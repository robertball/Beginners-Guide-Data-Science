Ingredients:
Pastry:
2 cups flour
3 Tbsp sugar
3/4 cup cold butter (1 1/2 sticks, cut into chunks)
2 eggs
Filling:
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/2 tsp grated lemon peel
1/4 tsp salt
2 cups sliced almonds
1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
1/4 tsp pure almond extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325째.  For the pastry, in a large bowl combine the flour and sugar.  Work the butter into the mix using a pastry cutter or your hands until the mixture resembles fine bread crumbs.  Add the eggs and stir with a large fork until the dough holds together.  If you have a food processor, you can pulse together the flour, sugar and butter and then add the eggs and pulse again, but be careful not to over-mix into a wet ball.  Press the dough evenly over the bottom and sides of a greased and floured 11"-12" tart pan with a removable bottom.  Place the tart pan on a baking sheet (I turn mine over so the sides face down) and bake at 325째 for 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and set aside.
Now raise the oven temperature to 375째
For the Filling, in a 2-3 quart saucepan, combine the cream, sugar, lemon peel and salt.  Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring regularly.  Once boiling, cook and stir for 11-12 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the sliced almonds, vanilla, and almond extract.  Spread the mixture into the pastry shell.  Place the tart on the baking sheet and bake at 375째 until lightly browned, about 35 minutes for a 12" tart and 40 minutes for an 11" tart.
Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 12 minutes and then remove the sides of the pan.  Once cool cut into wedges. (I find a pizza cutter works perfectly for this)

Description: 
I found this recipe in a Penzey's Spices catalog when I was ordering another large bottle of Double Strength pure vanilla extract.  I have made it so many times now that I buy the large economy size bags of sliced almonds.  Awesome Recipe!
