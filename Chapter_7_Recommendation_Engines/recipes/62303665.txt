Ingredients:
3/4 cup gluten-free pancake mix (ie. Pamela's Mix)
1/4 cup buckwheat flour
1 egg
3/4 cup water
1 Tbsp oil
(Optional:  blueberries or bananas, walnuts or pecans)

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together until there are no lumps. Batter should not be too thin or too thick; add additional water if needed. Let batter sit for 15 minutes for fluffier pancakes.  Pour 1/4 cup batter onto a preheated, lightly oiled griddle (medium-low heat). Cook until golden brown, flipping once. Serve immediately.
