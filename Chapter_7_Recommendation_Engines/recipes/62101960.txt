Ingredients:
1 1/2 c. graham cracker crumbs
2 T. sugar or fructose
1/4 c. softened butter
1 (16 oz.) can crushed pineapple in juice
3 c. plain non-fat (or lowfat) yogurt
1/2 c. honey (can use more or less to taste)
2 packets unflavored gelatin
2 t. vanilla extract
8-10 fresh strawberries, sliced
1 fresh kiwi, peeled and sliced
sweetened whipped cream (optional)

Directions:
Mix the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and softened butter together in a bowl with a fork. Press into the bottom of a pie plate or dessert dish. Set dish in the freezer for 10 minutes for crust to harden while working on the yogurt filling. Meanwhile, drain pineapple juice from can into a small microwavable bowl. Sprinkle gelatin over the juice and stir briefly until mostly dissolved. Heat in the microwave on high for 20-30 seconds until the juice is warm and the gelatin is completely dissolved. In another large bowl, mix together yogurt, crushed pineapple, honey and vanilla extract. Add gelatin mixture and stir well. Pour into pie plate and refrigerate for at least one hour, or until completely chilled and firm. Decorate top with sliced strawberries and kiwi, leaving one whole strawberry in the middle for decoration (if desired). Enjoy as is, or serve slices with sweetened whipped cream on top for an extra special touch.
