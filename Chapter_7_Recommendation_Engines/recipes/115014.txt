Ingredients:
1/3 cup wild rice
2 2/3 cups water
1 acorn squash, halved and seeded
1/3 cup cranberries
1/2 pound ground venison
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 pinch Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until the rice is tender, about 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, place squash, cut-side down onto a deep baking dish filled with 1/2-inch of water.  Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes, then drain water and set aside.
Bring some water to a boil in a saucepan, then remove from the heat.  Add the cranberries and let stand for 5 minutes, then drain and reserve.  Cook the ground venison in a skillet over medium-high heat until thoroughly cooked and crumbly.
Stir together the wild rice, cranberries, venison, and brown sugar.  Season with cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
Turn the oven on to Broil.  Rub the inside of the squash halves with the butter, then place cut-side up on the baking dish.  Stuff with the rice mixture, then broil in the oven for 5 minutes.
