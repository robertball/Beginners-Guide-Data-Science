Ingredients:
1 slice bacon, cut into small pieces
2 mushrooms, sliced (or more to taste)
1/4 cup cooked butternut squash cubes
2 cups arugula
1 ounce crumbled goat cheese
1 teaspoon pine nuts
1/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Cook bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until some of the fat renders into the pan, 2 to 3 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir together until the mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir squash cubes into the bacon mixture; continue cooking until the squash is hot and the bacon crisp, 3 to 5 minutes more.
Put arugula in a bowl; top with bacon, mushroom, and squash mixture. Sprinkle goat cheese over the salad and top with pine nuts. Sprinkle with cracked black pepper.

Description: 
This is just a quick salad I came up with from leftovers and loved! I liked the way the arugula paired with the bacon and squash. Add a baguette or a bagel, and it's a great lunch all on it's own! Dress with balsamic vinaigrette or simply oil and vinegar. Feta cheese can be used for the goat cheese, if you prefer.
