Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
3 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees), divided
2 eggs, beaten
2/3 cup honey
1 teaspoon salt
9 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in 2 cups water. Beat in eggs, honey, salt, 2 cups flour and remaining water. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. On a floured surface, roll to 1/2-in. thickness. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Cut into 4-in. circles. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8 minutes or until bottom is browned. Turn and bake 7 minutes longer or until second side is browned. Cool on wire racks. To serve, split with a fork and toast.
