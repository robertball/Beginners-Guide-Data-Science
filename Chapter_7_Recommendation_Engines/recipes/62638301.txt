Authentic Guacamole Recipe Recipe

Ingredients:
6 Ripe Haas Avacados, washed and pitted
1 1/2 Jalepeno peppers, seeded and finely minced
1/2 cup of finely diced Red Onion
2 Heaping Tablespoons of fresh cilantro, chopped (do not bruise)
Juice from 1 Lime  and 1 Teaspoon of lemon juice
2 Teaspoons (or to taste) of Kosher Salt

Directions:
After washing and pitting your avacados, take a spoon and scoop out the inside. If your avacados aren't ripe, place in a bag with an apple on the counter and let ripped for 24 hours.
Mash avacados with a fork. DO NOT USE A FOOD PROCESOR OR ELECTRIC MIXER. Add in jalapenos, onion, cilantro and citrus juice. Mix. Add kosher salt to taste and mix.
Guacamole can not be made too far in advance (no more than 20 minutes) because it browns very quickly. To prolong the life of your dip, pack tightly in a bowl and place a piece of plastic wrap ontop of the dip pressing it down so there is no layer of air between the dip and wrap. Then wrap again and store until ready to serve.

Description: 
After months of trying to duplicate Chipotle's guacamole recipe, I have nailed it. The two keys to this recipe are using HAAS avacodos and an 80/20 citrus juice. Hope you enjoy because my family certainly does!
