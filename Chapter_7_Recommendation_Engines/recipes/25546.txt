Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground pork sausage
1 onion, finely chopped
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground dry mustard
4 drops hot pepper sauce
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 (16 ounce) can sauerkraut - drained, rinsed and finely chopped
1/4 cup butter
2 eggs, slightly beaten
1/4 cup cold water
3/4 cup dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place ground pork sausage and onion in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and stir in all-purpose flour, dry mustard and hot pepper sauce. Whisk in milk. Stirring constantly, continue cooking approximately 5 minutes. Remove from heat and mix in dried parsley and sauerkraut.
Place butter in a 9x13 inch baking dish, and melt in the preheated oven.
In a small bowl, stir together the eggs and cold water.
Roll the sausage mixture into 1 inch balls. Dip sausage balls into the egg and water mixture, then roll them in the bread crumbs.
Arrange coated sausage balls in the baking dish in a single layer. Bake in the preheated oven approximately 30 minutes, turning after 15 minutes, until golden brown.
