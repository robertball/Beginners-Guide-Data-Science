Ingredients:
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 large poblano or medium green bell peppers
1 large red onion, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices
2 (12 inch) prebaked pizza crusts
1 1/2 cups RAGÚ® Old World Style® Traditional Sauce
3 cups shredded Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Lightly coat chicken and onion with oil, then season, if desired, with salt and ground black pepper. Grill chicken, onion and peppers, turning once, 8 minutes or until chicken is thoroughly cooked and vegetables are tender. Wrap peppers in aluminum foil; let stand 5 minutes, then remove skin and thinly slice. Thinly slice chicken; set aside.
Grill top side of pizza crusts about 1 minute; remove from grill. Evenly spread pizzas with pasta sauce, then evenly top with chicken, vegetables and cheese. Grill pizzas, covered, until cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro. Serve, if desired, with additional heated sauce and diced avocado.
