1 8oz can pineapple rings

Preheat a grill for medium-high heat. When hot, lightly oil the grate. Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade.
Grill the chicken pieces until cooked through, about 10 minutes, turning once. 5 minutes before they are done, place the pineapple and pepper rings on the grill and cook for a couple of minutes per side.  Toast the buns, if desired.
To assemble the sandwiches, place the chicken, pineapple and pepper onto the bottom buns.. Spread the thousand island dressing onto the top buns and place onto the sandwiches.
