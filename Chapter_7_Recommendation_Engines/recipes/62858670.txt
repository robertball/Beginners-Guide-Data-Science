Ingredients:
1 can cream of mushroom soup
1 can cream of chicken soup
1 can chicken
2/3 cup milk
1 bag frozen broccoli
1/2 cup fried onions
1 1/4 cup shredded cheese (your preference)
about 1/4 bag uncooked frozen tator tots
1-2 tbsp dried or fresh chopped onion
salt, pepper, garlic powder to taste

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a saucepan, add soups, milk, broccoli, chicken, salt, pepper, garlic, and dried/fresh onions and mix together on medium heat. While mixture is warming, in baking dish, put single layer of frozen tator tots (I like to spray my pan with Pam first). Allow mixture in pan to come to slight boil. Add 1 cup cheese and stir. Pour mixture over frozen tator tots. Sprinkle remaining cheese over top. On top of that, sprinkle fried onions.
Bake in oven about 30 minutes or until browned on top and hot in center.
