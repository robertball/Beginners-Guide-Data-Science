Ingredients:
1 t sugar
1 T yeast
1 cup water, warm
2 3/4 cups all purpose flour
1 t kosher salt
1 t garlic powder
1 t italian spice mix
1 T olive oil
Parmesan cheese to taste
1 cup mozzarella

Directions:
Proof yeast by mixing sugar, yeast, and 3 T warm water (take water from measured 1 cup).
In a large bowl whisk together mix flour, salt, sugar, garlic powder, and italian spices.   Add water, olive oil, and yeast mixture.
Use beater attachment to gently incorporate ingredients.  When dough pulls together, switch to kneading hook and knead until smooth and elastic.
Place dough in oiled bowl, and turn to coat. Cover  and let rise in a warm place for 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 450.  Punch dough down and place on greased baking sheet. Pat into a 1/2 inch thick rectangle dimpling top as you go. Drzzle top with olive oil and a light dusting of kosher salt and cracked pepper. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese - other toppings may be used as desired.  Family favorite is sun dried tomatoes and a few pepperoni slices.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve warm.
