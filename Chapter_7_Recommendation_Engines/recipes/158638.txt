Ingredients:
2 cups cubed peeled sweet potatoes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
1 clove garlic, minced
6 tablespoons tamari soy sauce
3/4 cup water
3 tablespoons honey
3 tablespoons hot sauce, or to taste
1 ripe mango, peeled and cubed
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon warm water

Directions:
Place the sweet potatoes into a saucepan and fill with enough water to cover. Simmer over medium-high heat until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in chicken, and cook until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes; set aside. Stir garlic into the skillet, and cook for a few minutes, until fragrant. Pour in the tamari, 3/4 cup of water, honey, and hot sauce. Bring to a simmer, then stir in the sweet potato, chicken, mango, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until hot. Dissolve the cornstarch in 1 tablespoon of water, and stir into the simmering mixture; stir until thickened.

Description: 
This is a tropical tasting dish that is just as good vegetarian as it is with chicken! Honey and mango lend the sauce it's sweetness, but it's nicely countered with salty tamari and spicy hot sauce. Serve over rice or noodles.
