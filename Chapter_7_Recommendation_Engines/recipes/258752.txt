Description: 
Sweet potatoes have served as a great rice extender for many generations in Asia. The softness and sweet taste of the sweet potato gives rice a livelier taste, that's why it is liked by many. Try this sweet potato rice recipe where I've added some meat. You can eat this dish as-is, or serve it with other meat or vegetables.
