Description: 
I came up with this combining a favorite marinade recipe with a favorite rub recipe and tweaked them so they went well together. We love to use this marinade on tri-tip, but it goes well with a variety of meats. Try sprinkling crumbled blue cheese on your finished steak! Marinate your meat for at least 30 minutes.
