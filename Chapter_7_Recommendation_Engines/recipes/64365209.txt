Description: 
This recipe is also very typical of the kind of simple but delicious dessert that Laura Bush preferred for small private dinners for friends and family. She shared this recipe with me recently, but it could easily have appeared on a White House menu, given the juxtaposition of zingy citrus flavor and creamy texture. It’s unassuming, yet very satisfying. - See more at:
