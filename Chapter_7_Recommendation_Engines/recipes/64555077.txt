Ingredients:
2 lbs of beef (can be ground, chili, flank steak, etc.)
6 tomatoes
1 small can of chopped green chilis
1 Onion (any color)
2 Cloves of Garlic
1 Bell Pepper (any color)
1 Tbsp Cumin
1 Tbsp Chili Powder
1/2 Tsp Salt
1/4 Tsp Pepper
1/2 Tsp Garlic Powder
Ghee (or other fat like butter or oil)
Avocado and diced fresh onion (optional topping)

Directions:
1. Place meat in a skillet and season with a sprinkling of salt and pepper.  Then brown the meat and drain excess fat.
2. While the meat is browning, sauté onions, bell pepper, and garlic in a fat of your choosing until the onions are translucent and the peppers are soft. I used Ghee but oil or butter would work too.
3. Dice 2 tomatoes and puree the remaining 4 tomatoes in either a blender or food processor.  If you like thicker chili, reduce the number of tomatoes or keep adding them until you reach the consistency you like. You could also substitute canned tomatoes and tomato sauce if you would prefer.
4. Combine the diced and puree tomatoes and green chilis into the sautéed vegetables.  Then add the cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper and garlic powder.
5. Add meat into vegetables and simmer for 30 minutes or until hot.  If the consistency of the chili is too thick, you can continue to add additional pureed tomatoes.  Conversely, if you like think chili, cut back on the number of tomatoes you add.
6. Serv topped with fresh diced onion and avocado.
