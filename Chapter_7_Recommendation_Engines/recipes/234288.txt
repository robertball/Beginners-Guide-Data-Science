Ingredients:
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/3 cup flax seed meal
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup dark brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups rolled oats
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup dried cranberries
3/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
1/2 cup coarsely chopped pumpkin seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Whisk together all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, flax seed meal, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
Beat together butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl until smooth and creamy; Stir in eggs and vanilla. Stir flour mixture into creamed butter mixture until dough is just combined. Fold oats, chocolate chips, cranberries, coconut, and pumpkin seeds into dough just until evenly combined.
Shape dough into 1 1/2-inch balls or drop by heaping tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart; press to flatten slightly.
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until lightly golden at the edges, about 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
This cookie gets its name from the West Coast Trail on Vancouver Island. It's my adaptation of the perfect nut-free trail cookie that's been our family's favorite chewy oatmeal cookie for 10 years. Loaded with choco-chips and dried cranberries. The flax seed meal and pumpkin seeds give them a nutty taste, without the nuts. Perfect for school kids or those with allergies.
