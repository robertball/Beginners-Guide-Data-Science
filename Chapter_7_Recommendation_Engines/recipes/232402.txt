Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles
¼ cup butter
¼ cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon minced garlic
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 cup half-and-half
30 ounces chicken broth
1 (3 pound) rotisserie chicken, bones removed and meat cut into bite-size pieces
1 cup sour cream
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large serving bowl.
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot butter until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Place flour, milk, and half-and-half in a jar with a lid and shake until flour has smoothly mixed with milk and half-and-half. Pour mixture into skillet and whisk until smooth and thick, about 5 minutes.
Gradually whisk chicken broth into sauce and bring to a simmer, whisking constantly. Stir cooked chicken and sour cream into sauce, season with salt and black pepper, and mix with cooked noodles to serve.
