Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon dried marjoram
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Place ground pork in a large bowl. Combine salt, turmeric, sage, oregano, black pepper, paprika, and marjoram in a small bowl. Sprinkle half of the seasonings over the pork. Mix well with your hands or a wooden spoon to combine. Sprinkle remaining seasonings onto the pork and mix until evenly distributed.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
Scoop out 1/4 cup of the chilled pork mixture at a time and shape into patties.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties until no longer pink in the center and browned, about 4 minutes per side.
