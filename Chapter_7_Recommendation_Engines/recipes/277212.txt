Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/8 cup dry red lentils
1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
8 baby portobello mushrooms, stemmed
1/2 cup finely diced onion
2 cloves garlic, finely diced
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/8 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring water and lentils to a boil in a large saucepan. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms in the hot oil until softened and liquid starts to cook out, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and place into a baking dish, cap-side down.
Heat remaining oil in a small pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until onion is transparent and garlic fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Combine lentils,  onion-garlic mixture, 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese, feta cheese, Parmesan cheese, parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Stir until well mixed.
Fill mushroom caps evenly with mixture and top with remaining Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve.
