Ingredients:
1/2 cup canola oil
2 onions, chopped
6 cloves garlic, sliced
1 green bell pepper, chopped
3 serrano peppers, chopped
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon kosher salt
2 (16 ounce) bottles dark beer
2 (16 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
20 fluid ounces tomato juice

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large stock pot over medium heat. Crumble the beef and pork into the pot. Cook, stirring frequently, until no longer pink. Drain off the grease, leaving just a thin layer. Cook the onion, garlic, bell pepper, and serrano pepper  in the remaining oil until the onions soften, about 5 minutes.
Add the lime juice, chili powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper, salt, and 1 1/2 bottles of dark beer. Slowly add the last 1/2 bottle of beer while stirring. Stir in the tomatoes and tomato juice. Reduce heat to low. Simmer 1 hour.
