Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces
garlic powder to taste
½ pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 large onion, diced
½ teaspoon dried basil
½ teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon dried rosemary
½ teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon garlic salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 cup dry white wine
1 (10.5 ounce) can chicken broth

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Sprinkle chicken with garlic powder, and brown on both sides. Remove chicken to paper towels.
Spoon off chicken fat, and return pan to stove. Stir in mushrooms and onions; cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft. Remove to a medium bowl.
In a separate bowl, mix together basil, oregano, rosemary, and thyme. Season with garlic salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning. Stir in wine, and add to onion and mushrooms.
Return chicken to Dutch oven. Pour mushroom mixture and broth over chicken; cover, and cook over low heat until meat begins to fall off the bone, about 1 1/2 hours.
