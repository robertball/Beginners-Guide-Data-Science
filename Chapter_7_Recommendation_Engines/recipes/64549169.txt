Ingredients:
1.5 cups shredded mozzarella
¾ cup almond flour
2 tbs cream cheese
1 egg
Garlic
Basil
Italian Seasoning

Directions:
-put mozzarella & cream cheese in a medium size microwaveable bowl
-Microwave for 1 min, stir and then another 30 sec, stir (very hot!)
-Stir in egg & almond flour
-Wet hands and spread “dough” thin on parchment paper. It should spread evenly with dough-like consistency (if “stringy” then your cheese has hardened too much—just put it back in the microwave for maybe another 20 seconds)
-Dock (poke rows of holes) with a fork to avoid bubbling
-Sprinkle with garlic, basil, and Italian seasoning to taste.
-Put in 425 degree oven
-After about 8 minutes, check it and poke holes where any large bubbles may be.
-continue cooking for 4-5 min, or until slightly brown on top.
-Take it out and add whatever toppings you want! Mozzarella, pepperoni, etc.
-Place back into the oven at the same heat, to crisp the meat and melt the cheese, if applicable.
