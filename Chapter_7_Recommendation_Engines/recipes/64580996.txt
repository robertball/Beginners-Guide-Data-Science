Ingredients:
1 large sweet potato, sliced into 1/8 inch thick rounds
2 small handfuls fresh  spinach (about 2 cups loosely packed
1 cup cooked and shredded chicken breast
1 green onion, chopped  1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese
10  large eggs
1/2 tsp kosher salt

Directions:
1. Spray an 8x8 pan with nonstick spray and preheat oven to 350ยบ. Place sliced sweet potatoes in the pan. Spray with nonstick spray (or 1 teaspoon olive oil), and toss with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Arrange sweet potatoes so they line the bottom of the pan. It is fine if they overlap a bit and are slightly stacked.
2. Bake sweet potatoes for 30 minutes. They should be soft & fork-tender.
3. Remove pan from oven and layer other ingredients on top of the sweet potatoes: fresh spinach, shredded chicken, chopped green onions. Top with feta cheese.
4. Whisk eggs with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt for 1 minute, then pour them over everything. Bake for another 30 minutes, just until eggs are set. Remove and cut into squares to serve! Top with creamy avocado and chopped chives if desired.
*Notes
- You could also use 4 ounces frozen spinach if you do not have fresh spinach on hand. Just thaw the frozen spinach and squeeze out some of the moisture.
- You can use any cooked chicken you have on hand; for example, grilled chicken from dinner the night before would work great in this recipe. Chicken that has been cooked and seasoned lightly is best.
- Adjust the cheese to your liking; fresh Parmesan, shredded sharp cheddar, or shredded white cheddar would all be great choices.
