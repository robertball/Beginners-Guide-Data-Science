Ingredients:
2 tablespoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons maple syrup
1 1/2 teaspoons miso paste
1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
1/2 teaspoon ground paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 sheets rice paper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Whisk sesame oil, soy sauce, maple syrup, miso, liquid smoke, paprika, and black pepper together in a shallow bowl.
Stack 2 pieces of rice paper and soak them in a bowl of cold water until slightly soft and pliable, about 30 seconds. Cut the hydrated rice paper into strips using a pizza cutter. Dip each strip in the soy mixture and place on a sheet of parchment paper. Carefully lay the parchment paper directly on the oven rack.
Bake in the preheated oven until strips are dry, 6 to 8 minutes.

Description: 
Some fake bacons are hit-and-miss, but because bacon is the one thing most people miss when switching to a vegetarian or vegan way of life, it's expected a fitting alternative is created. This recipe not only offers a completely meat-free bacon, but one that is low in fat and calories. To mimic the intoxicating aroma that we have come to love in the real thing, we used a combination of liquid smoke and paprika to achieve similar results cleverly using rice paper.
