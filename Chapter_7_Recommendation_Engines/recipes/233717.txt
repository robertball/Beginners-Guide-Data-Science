Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
1 (6 ounce) package long grain and wild rice mix (such as Uncle Ben'sÂ®)
1 (10 ounce) package frozen peas
1 (6.5 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained
1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained
1 cup diced roma tomatoes
1 bunch fresh parsley, finely chopped
3 green onions, sliced
Dressing:
1/2 cup white balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup canola oil
1/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Bring water and rice mix to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 22 minutes. Transfer rice to a bowl to cool.
Bring a pot of water to a boil; cook peas in the boiling water until just cooked, about 2 minutes. Drain and cool.
Mix cooled peas, artichoke hearts, olives, tomatoes, parsley, and green onions into cooled rice mixture.
Blend vinegar, canola oil, and sugar together in a blender or shake in a covered bottle until dressing is emulsified and creamy. Drizzle dressing over salad and toss to coat. Refrigerate salad until ready to serve.
