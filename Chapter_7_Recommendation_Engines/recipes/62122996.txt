Ingredients:
SHELL
1 cup corn meal
1 cup flour
2 eggs
3 1/2 - 4 cups COLD water

1 clove garlic diced
1/4 onion diced
1/2 tsp cumin

1 tblsp chili powder
THE TOPPINGS
lettuce     shredded
tomato     chopped
cheese      grated
onion        chopped
sour cream
salsa

Directions:
SHELLS
mix all ingredients together until smooth, like a heavy cream(humidity and altitude change water amounts)
pour into hot frying pan rotating it as you pour to make as thin as a crepe (i use a soup ladle to measure mixture)
as the edges start to curl flip the shell and minute one each side
this make 8 - 10 shells depending on the size shell
SEASONING FOR MEAT
mix into meat instead of the packets you can buy, fry until meat is done
i also have substituted ground flax to make it eggless shells
and use a rice and lentil mixture for ground beef
