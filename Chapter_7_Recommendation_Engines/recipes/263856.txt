Description: 
Bircher Muesli is a Swiss classic and the original overnight oats. Dr. Bircher, its inventor, believed that oats are easiest digested if they have soaked for at least 12 hours. I have this almost daily for breakfast and just switch it up with different kind of fruit, nuts, and berries for variety.
