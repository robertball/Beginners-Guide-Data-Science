Ingredients:
5 potatoes, peeled and quartered
3 tablespoons butter
1/8 cup milk

Directions:
Fill a medium size saucepan half full of water, and add a pinch of salt.  Bring to a boil.  Add potatoes to pot; the water should cover the potatoes. Simmer for 10 minutes, or until potatoes are easily pierced by a fork. Drain.
Transfer potatoes to a large mixing bowl. Add butter or margarine and milk, and mash with a potato masher.  When well mashed, whip for a minute or two with an electric mixer set on medium speed.

Description: 
Ordinary mashed potatoes are made by using a potato masher on boiled potatoes. However, using an electric mixer after mashing makes the potatoes super delicious.
