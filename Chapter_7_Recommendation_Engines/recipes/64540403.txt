Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, melted
1-1/3 cup sugar
3/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 tsp lemon zest
3 eggs plus 1 egg yolk

Directions:
Mix together butter and sugar. Stir in lemon juice, lemon zest and eggs plus yolk. Mix very well, you don't want bits of egg in your curd.
Pour into jars and hand tighten lids. Don't overfill. I used 4 small jelly type jars.
Pour 2 cups of water into inner pot. Place  jars on trivet in pot. Close and lock lid and shut the vent.
Pressure cook on high for 9 minutes.
Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes then release the remaining pressure.
Remove jars from pot and place on a towel.
Carefully open the jars and stir well. Replace lids, let cool for 25 minutes and refrigerate.
NOT shelf stable!
