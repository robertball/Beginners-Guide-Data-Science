Description: 
I started out w/the original Libby's pumpkin pie recipe and kept tweaking it untill my family said it was the best pumpkin pie they ever ate! They ask me to make it every year!
I started making pies for Thanksgiving at around age 12. We have a big family and extended family.  Thanksgiving is more like a family reunion so I make 12 or more pumpkin pies enough that after dinner each family group can take a pie home w/them :>)
