Ingredients:
8 roma (plum) tomatoes, cut in half and seeds removed
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
salt and black pepper to taste
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix together the tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, parsley, basil, oregano, and salt and pepper in a bowl, working the seasonings into the cavities of the tomatoes. Place the tomatoes, cut sides up, on a baking sheet, and sprinkle each tomato with about 1 tablespoon of feta cheese.
Bake the tomatoes in the preheated oven until cooked but still firm, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
Simple, fresh ingredients that are amazing together. Roast tomatoes in the oven or on your grill; you want them cooked but still firm, definitely not mushy.
