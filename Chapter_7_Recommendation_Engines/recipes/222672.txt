Ingredients:
6 tomatoes
ice water
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 lemon, zested and juiced
3 tomatoes, diced
2 green bell peppers, diced
2 ripe mangoes - peeled, pitted, and diced
1/2 Spanish onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon vinegar
1 1/2 habanero peppers, diced

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add 6 tomatoes. Boil tomatoes until skin starts to peel, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove tomatoes with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl of ice water until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. Peel skin, cut in half, and remove seeds. Blend seeded tomatoes in a blender until smooth.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Cook and stir 2 cloves garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add pureed tomatoes, cilantro, and lemon zest; bring to a boil, lower heat, cover, and simmer about 1 hour.
Place 3 diced tomatoes, green bell pepper, mangoes, onion, and 2 cloves garlic in a large bowl. Pour tomato mixture into bowl; stir to coat. Add lemon juice, vinegar, and habanero peppers; mix well. Chill in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
