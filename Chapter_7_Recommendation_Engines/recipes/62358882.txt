Ingredients:
- 2 to 3 mild green chili peppers (such as Anaheim or Cubanelle)
- 1/2 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/2 medium red onion, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
- salt and pepper
- cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat a grill pan or light a grill. Spray with cooking spray.
Grill the chiles over moderate-high heat until charred on all sides.
Remove from grill and place in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and allow the chiles to steam for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, spray a skillet with cooking spray. Add onion, and season with salt and pepper. Cook just slightly (for 3-5 minutes) or until softened but still a little crisp. Remove from heat and place in a bowl covered with foil, in order to remain warm.
Cut tops off of chilies and seed. Slice the chiles into 1/4-1/2 inch pieces.
Place sliced chiles in bowl with onions and halved cherry tomatoes.
Add chopped fresh parsley and mix together. Serve immediately.

Description: 
I served my Harissa Chicken (on this site) on top of this salad. It was a great accompaniment. However this salad can be used as a garnish for endless dishes. It can also be doubled and mixed with arugula with a splash of balsamic vinaigrette for a larger salad. Enjoy!
