Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
cooking spray
1 teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste
3  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
¼ cup butter
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
¼ cup chopped fresh basil
3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves removed
½ cup grated Mizithra cheese
¼ cup pine nuts
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
Spray a grill pan lightly with cooking spray; heat over medium heat. Sprinkle seasoned salt on both sides of chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Let cool slightly.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; bring to a low simmer and cook until butter has a caramel fragrance and is almost done foaming, 5 to 10 minutes.
Combine linguine, chicken, spinach, basil, and thyme in a large bowl. Pour browned butter on top. Toss well to combine. Add Mizithra cheese and pine nuts; toss again. Garnish with freshly ground black pepper.

Description: 
It's so hard to find recipes with Mizithra cheese other than the typical browned butter, so here is a new twist on an old favorite! Great for summer evenings! I like to use a George Foreman(<sup>&reg;</sup>) grill to cook the chicken.
