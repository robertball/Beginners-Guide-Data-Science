Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
18 slices bacon
1 1/2 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and sliced
1 1/4 cups shredded fontina cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Coat an 8 inch round baking dish with the butter. Arrange bacon in a spiral fashion in the baking dish, draping ends of the slices over the pan edge to fold over filling.
Arrange 1/3 of the potatoes over bacon, and sprinkle with 1/3 Fontina cheese. Repeat layers with remaining potatoes and cheese, and season with salt and pepper. Fold bacon over filling to form the upper layer.
Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 1 hour, or until potatoes are tender. Drain any drippings, and cut into wedges to serve.

Description: 
A great side dish with almost any meat. My grandmother used to make this using Swiss cheese. I've found that using Fontina cheese adds better flavor without those Swiss cheese strings.
