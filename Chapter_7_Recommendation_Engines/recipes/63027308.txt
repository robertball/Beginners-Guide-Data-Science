Ingredients:
1 c. elbow macaroni (4 oz)
1/4 c chopped onion
1 Tbs butter
1 Tbs all-purpose flour
Dash pepper
1-1/4 c milk
2 c cubed cheese - I use sharp chedder, but use your favorite

Directions:
Cook macaroni according to package directions; drain well.
While pasta is cooking, chop the onion, cube the cheese and get other ingredients ready.  Once pasta is draining, use the same pot to melt the butter and then cook the onion till tender.  Stir in flour and pepper.  Add milk all at once.  Cook and stir till slightly thickened and bubbly (med to med-high heat).
Remove from heat.  Add pasta and cubed cheese back into pan.  Stir just enough to distribute the ingredients.  Transfer to a 1-quart casserole (sprayed with non-stick spray) and bake, uncovered, in a 350 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or till bubbly.  Let stand 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
