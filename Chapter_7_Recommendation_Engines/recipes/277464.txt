Ingredients:
1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
5 eggs
1/2 cup amaretto liqueur
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup milk
2 cups chopped cranberries
1 cup flaked coconut
1 cup walnuts, chopped (optional)
Glaze:
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup amaretto liqueur
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).
Mix yellow cake mix, pudding mix, eggs, amaretto, oil, and milk together in a bowl. Beat using an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes. Fold in cranberries, coconut, and walnuts. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 55 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine sugar, amaretto, and butter for glaze in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil; continue to boil until sugar is dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes.
Remove cake from the oven and glaze immediately.
