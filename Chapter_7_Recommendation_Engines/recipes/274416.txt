Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/2 cup dry Italian-seasoned bread crumbs (such as ProgressoÂ®)
1/3 cup finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese
1/4 cup melted butter
3 (8 ounce) packages reduced-fat cream cheese (Neufchatel)
4 large eggs
1 1/4 cups shredded Gruyere cheese
1/2 cup fat-free half-and-half
1/3 cup diced ham
4 slices crisp cooked bacon, crumbled
2 tablespoons minced red bell pepper
3 green onions, chopped
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 24 muffin tin cups with cooking spray or use paper liners.
Mix bread crumbs, Pecorino Romano cheese, and melted butter together in a small bowl. Spoon about 1 teaspoon mixture into each of the prepared muffin cups, pressing down.
Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer in a large bowl until fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time until combined. Stir in Gruyere cheese, half-and-half, ham, bacon, bell pepper, green onions, salt, and pepper. Pour about 1/4 cup of the mixture into each muffin cup, filling each about 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheesecakes are firm to the touch and lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool in muffin tins for 10 minutes.
