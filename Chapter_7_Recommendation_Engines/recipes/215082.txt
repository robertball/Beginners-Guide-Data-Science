Description: 
I love this recipe that my Aunt Rita makes!  It's easy and very soul warming.  It goes well over rice, egg noodles, pasta, mashed potatoes, or by itself with garlic bread on the side. For a vegetarian option or vegetable side dish option, just omit the sausage. Use spicy sausage if you like it hot.
