Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups spelt flour
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup soy milk
1/2 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup applesauce
1/2 cup coconut sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups finely grated carrots
2 cups finely chopped walnuts (optional)
Vegan Icing:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 3/4 tablespoons vegan butter
3 tablespoons soy milk
4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons cider vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a loaf pan with parchment paper.
Mix spelt flour, cinnamon, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Mix soy milk, coconut oil, applesauce, coconut sugar, and vanilla extract together in another bowl. Fold flour mixture into the milk mixture until just combined. Add carrots; whisk well. Add walnuts and stir to evenly distribute.
Pour carrot cake batter into the loaf pan and even out the top with a spatula.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Turn cake out onto a cooling rack.
Beat confectioners' sugar, vegan butter, and soy milk together in a bowl using an electric mixer to make the icing. Add lemon juice, vinegar, and vanilla extract. Mix well. Frost cake once cool.
