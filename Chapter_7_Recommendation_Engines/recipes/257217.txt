Spray a large skillet with cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium; pour 1/4 cup batter into the skillet. Cook until bubbles start to form and bottom is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a cooling rack. Repeat with remaining batter.
