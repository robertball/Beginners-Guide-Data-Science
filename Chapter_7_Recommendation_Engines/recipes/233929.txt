Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup milk
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup shredded zucchini
1/2 cup fresh blueberries
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Combine flour, white sugar, brown sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk olive oil, milk, egg, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl until smooth; stir into flour mixture until batter is just moistened. Fold zucchini, blueberries, and pecans into batter. Fill prepared muffin cups 2/3 full with batter.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
