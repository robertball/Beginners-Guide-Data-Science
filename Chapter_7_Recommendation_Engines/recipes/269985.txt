Ingredients:
Cookie:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup butter
2/3 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon grated fresh jalapeno
1 lime, zested and juiced
1/2 teaspoon salt
Icing:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup lime juice
1/2 tablespoon grated fresh jalapeno, or more to taste
1 lime, zested

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix flour, butter, sugar, jalapeno, lime zest and juice, and salt together in a large bowl.
Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place on ungreased cookie sheets; flatten slightly with a thumb print to accommodate icing.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and set, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove cookies from the oven and let cool at least 10 minutes.
Combine confectioners' sugar, lime juice, jalapeno, and lime zest in a bowl. Drizzle icing onto cooled cookies.
