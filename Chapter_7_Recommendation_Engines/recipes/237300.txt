Ingredients:
1 untreated cedar plank
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons herbes de Provence
2 teaspoons dried dill weed
2 teaspoons dried tarragon
1 teaspoon paprika
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 halibut steaks
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the cedar plank in water to soak, about 30 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Stir butter, lemon juice, herbes de Provence, dill, tarragon, paprika, and garlic together in a small bowl.
Place halibut steaks on the cedar plank. Season to taste with pepper; spoon half the butter mixture onto the halibut.
Place the cedar plank into the grill; cook, with grill lid closed, for 20 minutes. Open grill; baste halibut with remaining butter mixture. Continue grilling until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes.
