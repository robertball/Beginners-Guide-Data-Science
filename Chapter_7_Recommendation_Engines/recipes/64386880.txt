Ingredients:
6 oz Fettuccine or Linguine (I prefer Linguine)
8 oz Asparagus
3 oz Prosciutto (bacon works just fine)
1 T butter
1 shallot, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 c heavy cream
1/2 c Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano Reggiano
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:
Trim the ends of asparagus and shave off any of the tough skin from lower ends.  Slice on the bias into roughly 1" to 1 1/2" pieces.  Set aside.
Saute bacon, set aside to cool, then tear into bitesize pieces.  Remove most of grease from pan, leaving a few drippings in for flavor.
Begin cooking pasta in another pan according to directions, and then return your attention to saute pan.  Saute asparagus pieces in butter and bacon drippings 5 to 6 minutes or until just done.  Add shallot and garlic and continue to cook for another minute.
Add cream and bacon to pan and let cook several minutes or until it begins to thicken.  Add crushed red pepper if desired.
Begin slowly adding shredded cheese to sauce until desired flavor is reached (we're usually happy with about 1/4 cup, serving additional on top of pasta).  Season well with cracked pepper.
Add drained pasta and toss well.
