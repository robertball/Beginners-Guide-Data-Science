Ingredients:
Muffin:
2 cups white sugar
1 1/4 cups vegetable oil
3 eggs, lightly beaten
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups peeled, pitted, and chopped peaches
Streusel Topping:
2/3 cup brown sugar
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 16 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Beat white sugar, vegetable oil, and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium until creamy. Mix 3 cups flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Gradually beat flour mixture into egg mixture until batter is just combined; fold in peaches. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Mix brown sugar, 2/3 cups flour, butter, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl until crumbly; sprinkle over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
