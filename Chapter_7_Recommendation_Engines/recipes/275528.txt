Ingredients:
1 head garlic
2 drizzles extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
2 pints cherry tomatoes
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pound fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/4 cup fresh basil, cut into strips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cut the top off of the head of garlic and place on a piece of aluminum foil. Drizzle with oil and wrap up.
Roast in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Place tomatoes on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
Roast in the oven with garlic for 20 minutes more.
Remove from the oven and let cool until safe to handle, 10 to 20 minutes. Place tomatoes in a large bowl and squeeze roasted garlic onto tomatoes. Mash using a potato masher into a sauce.
Add spaghetti to sauce; mix well and top with mozzarella cheese and basil. Season with salt and pepper.
