Ingredients:
7 (15 ounce) jars nacho cheese dip
3 pounds ground beef
3 (1.25 ounce) packages dry Mexican or taco seasoning
1 yellow onion, diced
1 teaspoon chili powder
4 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chilies, drained
water (optional)

Directions:
Pour the cheese sauce into a large slow cooker. Cover, and set to High.
Place a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the ground beef until completely browned; stir in the taco seasoning. Reserving the fat in the skillet, use a slotted spoon to transfer the beef to the slow cooker and stir into the cheese.
Return the skillet to medium heat. Combine the onion and chili powder in the skillet; cook until the onion softens. Stir in the tomatoes with green chiles. Add to the cheese mixture and stir through. If sauce is too thick, stir in up to 1/2 cup water.

Description: 
This hearty nacho cheese dip is better than your average thrown-together, processed-cheese nacho mix. Serve during the big game or party, or bring with you to work and watch the pot get scraped clean. Serve with yellow corn tortilla chips and pickled jalapeno slices.
