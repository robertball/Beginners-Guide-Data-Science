1 cup vanilla wafer crumbs
1/4 cup Hershey's cocoa
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1/4 cup melted butter or margarine
Cheesecake filling:
1 3/4 cups Hershey's premium semi-sweet chocolate chunks, divided
1 cup whipping cream, divided
1/4 cup Kahlua
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup sugar
1/3 cup Hershey's cocoa
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon powdered sugar
2 tablespoons Kahlua
One 9 inch spring form pan

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
First prepare Chocolate Crumb Crust:  In a small bowl, combine the wafer crumbs, cocoa and powdered sugar.  Stir in melted butter or margarine.  Press mixture on bottom of pan and bake for 8 minutes.  Set aside.
Next prepare cheesecake filling:  Turn oven temperature to 400 degrees F.  In small microwave safe bowl, place 3/4 cup chocolate chunks.  Microwave on HIGH for one minute; stir.  If necessary, microwave at HIGH an additional 15 seconds at a time, stirring after each heating, just until chunks are melted when stirred.
Add 1/4 cup whipping cream and stir until well blended.  Stir in 1/4 cup Kahlua and set aside.
In large mixer bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until fluffy.  Add cocoa and beat well until blended.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Stir in vanilla and reserved chocolate mixture, blending well.  Pour over prepared crust and bake for 10 minutes.  Decrease oven temperature to 275 degrees F and continue baking for 45 minutes.
Remove from oven to cooling rack, loosening cake from rim of pan.  Cool completely and remove spring form rim.
In a small microwave safe bowl, place remaining 1 cup chocolate chunks and microwave on HIGH 1 minute, then stir.  If necessary, microwave at HIGH an additional 15 seconds at a time, stirring until chunks are melted.  Stir in 1/4 cup whipping cream and blend well.  Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons Kahlua, blending well.  Spread on top of cheesecake and refrigerate for about 6 hours or overnight.
At serving time, beat remaining 1/2 cup whipping cream and powdered sugar until stiff, then garnish cheesecake with small rosettes of whipped cream.
Refrigerate leftover cheesecake.
