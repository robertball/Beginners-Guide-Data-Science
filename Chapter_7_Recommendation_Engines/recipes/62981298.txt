Description: 
Cranberry and orange have gone together forever, but with the addition of the dried cherries you put a real antioxident factor in this sauce.  To reduce the sugar grams, I use Splenda sugar blend.  Using the orange without peeling it first pops the orange flavor.Modified from: Dried Cherry and Cranberry Sauce
