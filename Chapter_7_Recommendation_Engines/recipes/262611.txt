Ingredients:
2 cups mashed bananas
1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
3/4 cup butter
2/3 cup white sugar
2/3 cup brown sugar
2 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup oat flour
1 cup rolled oats
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
Mix mashed bananas and yogurt together in a bowl.
Combine butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl; beat using an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs and vanilla extract and stir to combine. Add banana mixture and mix well.
Stir flour, oat flour, rolled oats, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Add to the banana-butter mixture and stir just until combined. Don't overmix. Fold chocolate chips and walnuts into the batter. Divide batter between the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and cover loosely with aluminum foil for 5 minutes. Remove from the pans and allow to cool completely.

Description: 
After trying several recipes for banana bread that had some but not all of the things I wanted in it, I tweaked a few together and came up with this version with Greek yogurt. I made 8 loaves before declaring it a success (and the comments from family and coworkers sealed the deal).
