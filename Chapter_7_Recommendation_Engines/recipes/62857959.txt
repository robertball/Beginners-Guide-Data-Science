Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower washed and trimmed to florets (with wash water clinging to them)
3 ears corn, washed and kernels cut from cobs
1/2 lb wax beans, washed, trimmed and cut into 2" pieces
4 to 6 cloves garlic, peeled
1/4 tsp salt
zest of 1 lime
1 tbsp fresh lime juice (1 lime)
1 oz butter
Ground red pepper or mild paprika

Directions:
Place the cauliflower florets, corn kernels, beans and garlic cloves in a microwave-safe casserole dish and sprinkle with lime zest and salt.
Mix in lime juice and stir until zest is evenly distributed.
Dot with butter.
Cover the dish with its glass lid (or plastic film that is pierced 3 times), and cook on high for 6 to 10 minutes, depending on how soft you like your cauliflower.
When done, carefully remove film with oven mitts to avoid getting a steam burn and give the veggies a final stir.
Sprinkle with red pepper and serve hot.
