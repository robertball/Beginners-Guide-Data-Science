Grzybki Marynowane (Pickled Wild Mushrooms) Recipe

Ingredients:
4 pounds fresh porcini mushrooms
5 1-pint canning jars with lids and rings
3 1/2 cups water
1 cup white vinegar
1 onion, roughly chopped
1 tablespoon superfine sugar
1 teaspoon salt
6 whole black peppercorns, or to taste
2 whole allspice berries
1 bay leaf

Directions:
Trim and wash mushrooms. Place in a large saucepan, cover with water, and bring to the boil. Remove saucepan from heat and drain. Return mushrooms to saucepan, add fresh water to cover, and bring to a boil again. Remove from heat and drain. Cut larger mushrooms into bite-sized pieces.
Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack mushrooms into hot, sterilized jars.
Bring water, vinegar, onion, sugar, salt, peppercorns, allspice, and bay leaf to a boil in a large pot for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool, about 20 minutes. Pour liquid evenly over mushrooms, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top.
Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 7 minutes.
Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.
