Ingredients:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons milk
2 teaspoons light corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
assorted food coloring

Directions:
In a small bowl, stir together confectioners' sugar and milk until smooth.  Beat in corn syrup and almond extract until icing is smooth and glossy.  If icing is too thick, add more corn syrup.
Divide into separate bowls, and add food colorings to each to desired intensity. Mix slightly the colors for a tie dye effect.
