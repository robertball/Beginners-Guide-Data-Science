Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced

2 cups cooked brown rice
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
2 large green bell peppers, chopped

Directions:
Combine beef, onion, and garlic in a large pot over medium heat. Cook until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard excess grease.
Pour beef broth into the pot. Add tomatoes with their juice, brown rice, salt, pepper, and paprika. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 1 hour. Add green bell peppers; cook, uncovered, until soft, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
A super-delicious stuffed green pepper soup that is simple to make. The aroma while it's cooking is amazing, and the taste is to die for! Be sure to add the chopped bell peppers at the end, so they won't end up too mushy. I love stuffed green peppers, and when the flavors are condensed into an easy-to-prepare soup, it makes for a family favorite. It's great topped with shredded medium Cheddar cheese and a side of garlic bread!
