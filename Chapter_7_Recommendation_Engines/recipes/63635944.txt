Ingredients:
1 RIb celery, diced
1 onion, diced
1/4 Cup olive oil (preferably not EVOO)
1 Pinch salt
4 Cloves garlic, finely minced
56 Ounces canned whole peeled San Marzano plum tomatoes
1 Teaspoon salt
2 Teaspoon sugar
1/2 Teaspoon dried Italian herbs
1 Pinch red pepper flakes
1 Teaspoon anchovy paste
1 Teaspoon white wine vinegar
1 Tablespoon tomato paste
2 Tablespoons Italian parsley, chopped
water as needed

Directions:
Finely dice the onion and celery. Saut√© with the olive oil and a pinch of salt over medium-low heat. Sweat the vegetables for 15 minutes or until they get really soft and golden. Do not brown!
Meanwhile, mince the garlic. Pour the San Marzano plum tomatoes in a large bowl and crush them with your hands.
When the vegetables get soft and golden, add the minced garlic. Cook for another minute.
Add the salt, sugar, herbs, red pepper flakes, anchovy paste, and vinegar. Turn up the heat to medium and cook for another few minutes or until most of the liquid evaporates. Again, do not brown the vegetables! Stir well.
Add the tomato paste and cook for another few minutes.
Add the San Marzano tomatoes, parsley, and a splash of water to lower the temperature. Bring to a simmer; then turn the heat down to low.
Cook for 1 to 1.5 hours, stirring occasionally. Add a splash of water as needed to keep it simmering, not boiling. Do not skim off the oil, it should be stirred back into the sauce.
