Ingredients:
2 slices wheat bread
10 ounces ground chicken
1 Granny Smith apple, grated
1 onion, grated
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1/4 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
cooking spray

Directions:
Toast bread slices in toaster until hard and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove and cool on wire rack until no longer warm to the touch, about 10 minutes.
Crumble toasted bread slices into a large bowl until reduced to fine crumbs, or place in food processor and process until fine.
Combine chicken, apple, onion, breadcrumbs, egg, soy sauce, and oyster sauce in a bowl until well mixed.
Shape mixture into 4 patties. Place flour on a place, coat patties with flour.
Spray a nonstick skillet with cooking spray, heat to medium. Cook patties until browned on both sides, no longer pink in the center, and juices run clear, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
These are very juicy and light patties with the secret ingredient - grated Granny Smith apple - that makes all the difference. They are not heavy and meaty, so if you like your patties light, these are for you! Serve on whole meal buns with lettuce, tomato, and chutney.
