Ingredients:
2-3 lbs sweet potatoes
1 tsp canola or vegetable oil
3-5 tbs dark brown sugar
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1 egg, slightly beaten
1 tsp cinnamon
1/4-1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/4-1/2 tsp ginger
1 package of jumbo marshmallows

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Scrub the potatoes and rub with the cooking oil.  Place in a cast iron skillet and roast until squishy.  The amount of time can vary based upon the size of the potatoes.  Chill the potatoes until cool enough to handle.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Cut the potatoes into chucks, and pass through a potato ricer.  This will remove the skins and most of the roots.  Add the remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly.  Taste the mixture throughout the seasoning process to determine the level of spice and sugar that suits your audience. Grease a brownie pan with butter, and spread the potato mixture in it.  Place in oven and back for 45 minutes.  Remove from oven and place marshmallows on top.  Be creative with the layout.  Return to oven for 15 minutes or until slightly browned.  Remove from oven and enjoy!
