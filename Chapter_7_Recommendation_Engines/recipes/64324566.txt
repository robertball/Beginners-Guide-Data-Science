Ingredients:
1 teaspoon oil, olive, extra-virgin
1 clove(s) garlic, minced
5 ounce(s) spinach, fresh, thick stems trimmed (5 cups packed or 10 cups loosely packed)
salt, to taste
peppercorns, black, freshly ground, to taste
7 1/2 ounce(s) tofu, firm, drained and patted dry, and sliced lengthwise into 4 pieces
1/2 tablespoon basil, dried, divided
2 piece(s) tomato(es), sun-dried and oil-packed, drained and thinly sliced
1/4 cup(s) cheese, mozzarella, part-skim, shredded
1 tablespoon cheese, Parmesan, freshly grated

Directions:
Heat oven to 400Â°F.
Heat oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Add garlic and cook until softened, about 1 minute. Add spinach, cover, and cook until wilted and tender, about 3 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.
Lay tofu slices in a single layer in a 9" by 13" baking dish. Sprinkle each slice with a pinch of the basil.
Top tofu slices evenly with spinach, tomatoes, mozzarella, Parmesan, and remaining basil. Bake until tofu is hot and cheeses are melted and bubbling, about 15 minutes.
