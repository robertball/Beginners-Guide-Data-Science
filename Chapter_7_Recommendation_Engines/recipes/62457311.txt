Ingredients:
3 lbs beef brisket, trimmed of all fat and cut into 1 inch chunks
4 tbsp Spice Trail’s Tagine Spice
1/8 c vegetable oil plus 3 tbsp
4 garlic cloves, sliced thin
2 large onions, chopped
8 carrots, peeled and sliced
2 large tomatoes, chopped
4 c butternut squash, peeled and cut into large chunks
1 c rich chicken stock
1 c cooked chickpeas
Salt to taste
1/4 c fresh cilantro, chopped
1/4 c fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped
3 tbsp lemon juice

Directions:
In a large bowl mix the beef with Spice Trail’s Tagine Spice, salt, and 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil, making sure to coat thoroughly with spices. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour at least.
Heat remaining oil in Tagine or large pot and place beef in one layer without overcrowding the pan, then sear on all sides or until browned well. Remove meat from Tagine and place garlic, onions, carrots, tomatoes, and squash in pan, then cook on low heat, add chicken stock, and return beef to Tagine, cover and place in oven at 300 degrees. Bake for 3 hours and then add the chickpeas, cilantro, parsley, and lemon juice. Cover and let stand for 20 minutes before serving.
