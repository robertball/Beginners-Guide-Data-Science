Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 carrot, chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 head cabbage, shredded
1 potato, diced
4 cups chicken stock
1/3 cup stone-ground mustard
1/4 cup ketchup
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 bay leaf
1 clove
1 clove garlic

Directions:
Heat oil in a multi-functional pressure cooker on Saute mode. Saute onion, carrot, and celery until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Toss in cabbage and potato; cook until cabbage starts to break down, 2 to 3 minutes.
Mix chicken stock, mustard, and ketchup into the cabbage mixture. Cook and stir until combined, about 1 minute. Stir in salt and pepper; add bay leaf and clove. Place garlic in the center of the pot.
Close the pot and lock the lid. Select Soup setting or high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 6 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove lid.
