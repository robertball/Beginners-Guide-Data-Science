Indian Rice Pudding Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup basmati rice
1 Gallon Whole Milk
1 ½ cup sugar
½ tsp Ground Cardamom

Directions:
Wash the rice and keep aside.
Boil the milk in a heavy bottom pot, make sure to keep stirring while heating it or it may stick to the bottom. I like to heat up the milk in the microwave a little bit and then add it to the pot, saves it from sticking to the bottom of the pan and the process is a little faster.
Once the milk is starting to boil, turn the heat down to medium-low, add the rice and keep stirring. You have to keep stirring until the rice is cooked and has absorbed most of the liquid.
Once the rice is cooked and is thickened, add the sugar, and then turn off the heat. The pudding will thicken more once it’s cooled, so make sure it’s not too thick. If it is just heat up some milk in the microwave and add it while it’s still hot.
Add the cardamom and mix well.
You can serve it warm or chilled, and also add any nuts like slivered almonds, pistachios, cashews or even raisins if you like

Hi  Jill,

Thank you for liking my dish. I didn’t get to take any of it home, the rest of the crew did. ? And I am not sure of how it would taste once its frozen; I have never done it. But you can always try. This is the recipe for when I made it.
