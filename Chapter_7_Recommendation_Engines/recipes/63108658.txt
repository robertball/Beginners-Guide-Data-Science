Ingredients:
Soup:
1 (16 oz) can chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
1/4 cup Udon Noodles snapped into small pieces
1 teaspoon cornstarch (optional)
2 teaspoons water (optional)
2 eggs, beaten

fresh ground pepper to taste
Garnish:
crushed peanuts to taste
chopped fresh chives to taste
a few drops hot Chinese chili sauce (optional)

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine the chicken broth, soy sauce and sesame oil. Bring to a boil. Add the Udon Noodles. Stir together the cornstarch and water to dissolve cornstarch; pour into the boiling broth. Stir gently while you pour in the egg. Mix in the salt and pepper.
Pour into two bowls. Place the garnishes nearby to add to the dish according to taste.

Description: 
I was not feeling well one evening and wanted soup. But I only had chicken broth and that sounded boring. I'd made egg drop soup before and thought that sounded perfect, so I started looking up recipes. Since I couldn't quite make any of the ones I found, I combined them to make this. It helped settle my stomach and was super easy to make.
