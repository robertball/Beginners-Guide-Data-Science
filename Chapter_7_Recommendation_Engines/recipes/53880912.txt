Ingredients:
Pam spray
1 potato, sliced paper thin (peel optional)
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste or cajun seasoning
Parchment paper

Directions:
Add the potato slices directly on parchment lined plate which has been sprayed with Pam.  Do NOT overlap!
Cook in the microwave for 3 to 5 minutes, or until lightly browned (if not browned, they will not become crisp). Times will vary depending on the power of your microwave. Remove chips from plate, and toss with salt (or other seasonings). Let cool. Repeat process with the remaining potato slices. You will not need to keep oiling the plate.

Description: 
Make your own potato chips using your microwave. A tasty and easy alternative to store-bought potato chips (not to mention economical)! A mandoline would make slicing the potato into paper thin slices a breeze.Modified from: Potato Chips
