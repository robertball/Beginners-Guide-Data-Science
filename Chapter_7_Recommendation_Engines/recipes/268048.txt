Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds starchy potatoes, such as russet or Yukon Gold
11 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
1 egg
12 Italian prune plums, pitted and left whole
12 sugar cubes
2 eggs
1/3 cup unsalted butter
2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar
1 cup dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain. Peel as soon as they are cool enough to handle and push through a potato ricer or mash with a potato masher in a bowl. Set aside to cool completely, about 10 minutes.
Combine potatoes, flour, 1 egg, and salt in a bowl and mix into a smooth dough. Shape into a 3-inch log and cut into 3/4 -inch slices.
Stuff each pitted Italian plums with 1 sugar cube. Wrap potato dough slices around the stuffed plums so they are completely covered; shape with floured hands into round dumplings.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Submerge dumplings in the water, reduce heat, and simmer on very low heat for 15 minutes. Remove dumplings with a slotted spoon and drain well.
Lightly beat 2 eggs and place in a deep plate. Add bread crumbs to a second plate. Coat each boiled dumpling in beaten egg and dredge through the bread crumbs. Gently push bread crumbs into dumplings so they stick.
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat and pan-fry dumplings until they are golden brown on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve with cinnamon sugar.
