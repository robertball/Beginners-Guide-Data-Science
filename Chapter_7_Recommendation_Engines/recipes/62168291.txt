Ingredients:
1 15.5 oz can of Blackeye Peas
1 large Egg
1/2 cup Flour
1/3 cup Corn Meal
1/2 cup Bacon bits
1/4 cup Chopped Green Onions
Vegetable Oil
Slice Tomatoes (optional)
Mayonnaise (optional)

Directions:
Drain peas reserving liquid. Beat egg in bowl and then gently mix in can of blackeye peas. Add flour, cornmeal, onions, and bacon to the pea mixture and blend.  Add the reserved blackeye pea liquid a little at a time and blend until you have the consistency of thick pancake batter
Heat 1/4 inch thickness of vegetable oil in frying pan.  Put blackeye pea batter in pan making about a 3 inch circle. I normally cook about 4 at a time. Use you spoon to flatten the batter into a consistent thickness.  Fry until underside is brown and the batter bubbles on top like pancakes.  Carefully flip fritter over and brown the other side.  Drain well on paper towel and place in warm oven until all the fritters are made.
Optional:  You can serve the fritters as is or we like to place a thick slice of tomato and a dab of mayonnaise on top.  My husband likes to add a few more bacon bits on top as well.  You can also substitute homemade or leftover blackeye peas.

Description: 
Simple, fast and delicious!!!  My husband wouldn't touch blackeye peas before I made these.  Now he will actually requests them.  You can also use leftover blackeye peas instead of canned...a great way to give leftovers a boost. These fritters are fantastic when served with fresh tomatoes and a dab of mayo on top.
