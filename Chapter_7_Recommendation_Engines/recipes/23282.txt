1/2 cup butter
1 lemon, juiced
2 teaspoons soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced

Directions:
In a small saucepan over low heat melt butter with lemon juice and soy sauce.  Stir in garlic and cook for about 10 minutes.  Refrigerate overnight.
Place green beans in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Cook until tender but still crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Heat butter mixture and pour over beans.  Stir in pimentos and peanuts.  Toss and serve.

Description: 
This red and green dish is especially nice at Christmas.  The ingredients sound a little odd, but the peanuts and soy give it a bit of an Oriental taste. I have always received compliments on this.
