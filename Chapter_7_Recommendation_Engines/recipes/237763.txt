Ingredients:
4 cups pomegranate juice, divided
1 cup white sugar

Directions:
Combine 3 cups pomegranate juice and sugar together in a saucepan; heat to 244 degrees F (118 degrees C) or until a small amount of mixture dropped into cold water forms a firm ball. Remove saucepan from heat and cover with a lid; let cool until pan is cool enough to touch. Stir remaining 1 cup pomegranate juice into mixture. Refrigerate.

Description: 
This rich, tawny syrup will elevate your cocktails from 'pretty in pink' to 'pretty spectacular'. Shop around for pomegranate juice! There are a few options for 100% unsweetened juices, and I haven't had bad results at any price point.
