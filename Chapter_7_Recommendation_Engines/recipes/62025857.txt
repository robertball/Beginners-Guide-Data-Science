Ingredients:
1 cup margarine or butter
1 1/2 cup white sugar
2 Tbsp Corn syrup
1 egg
2 1/2 cups flour
2
1 tsp. baking soda
2 tsp cinnamon
2 tsp. ginger
1/2 tsp. cloves
1/4 tsp. allspice
Icing
2 egg whites
1/2 tsp. cream of tartar
2 cups icing sugar

Directions:
Cream margarine and sugar.  Add corn syrup and egg. Mix until smooth.  Sift dry ingredients. Add to batter and blend together. Refridgerate for at least 1/2 hour.  Roll out using plenty of flour and cut out shapes.  Bake at 375F for 6 - 8 minutes.
Icing:
Beat egg whites until very stiff.  Mix cream of tartar and sugar and add a little at a time to egg whites, beating after each addition.  Mix until stiff icing is formed. Add food coloring if desired and pipe onto cooled cookies.  This icing can also be used as a "glue" to affix candy decorations, such as cinnamon hearts.
