1 cup cooked chicken
1/4 cup shredded carrots
1/2 cup cashews or peanuts chopped
3 tablespoons green onions
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 clove minced garlic
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon sugar.
Bottom Layer:
1 8 ounce package cream cheese at room temperature
1 tablespoon milk
Sweet and Sour Sauce
3/4 cup water
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup wine vinegar
few drops of liquid pepper seasoning

Directions:
Combine all of the topping ingredients and refrigerate overnite.
Next day, for the bottom layer, beat milk and cream cheese together until fluffy.  Set aside.
For sweet and sour sauce, combine water, cornstarch, ketchup, sugar, wine vinegar and hot pepper seasoning in a sauce pan.  Boil until thickened, cool.
To assemble the appetizer, spread cream cheese mixture in bottom of 9 X 9 inch baking pan, or tart pan. Spread a small portion of cooled sweet and sour sauce over the cream cheese mixture.  Spread topping mixture over the cream cheese mixture, then drizzel the rest of the sweet and sour sauce over all.
Serve with crackers.

Description: 
I make this dip for my bunco crowd and the group just goes crazy over it!  It's just different than your average appetizer and an easy way to introduce the crown to that Thai taste.
