Description: 
So I heard of people making salsa chicken and I thought I would give it a try but add a few of my own twists to it. My whole family, even the 2-year-old, loved the tacos and we ate the leftovers at our very next meal. After the mixture is cooked, fill flour tortillas with it (hard shells are great, too), add shredded Cheddar cheese on the top, and shredded lettuce.
