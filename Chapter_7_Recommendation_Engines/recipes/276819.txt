Ingredients:
20 cremini mushrooms
1/2 pound spicy cured chorizo, finely diced
ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons light garlic-flavored cream cheese
3 tablespoons grated mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons crumbled Gorgonzola cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cut stems from mushrooms and finely chop them; set mushroom caps aside on a baking sheet.
Heat a small skillet over medium heat. Add chopped stems, chorizo, and black pepper; cook and stir until sausage is browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, and Gorgonzola cheese until well combined, 3 to 5 minutes. Spoon mixture into the mushroom caps.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese browns, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
I love Gorgonzola cheese, and chorizo is my favorite sausage, so I combined the two to create a spicy, cheesy appetizer. Whenever I make these for events, people have nothing but praise. This filling is also amazing in jalapenos.
