Ingredients:
4 boneless pork chops
Kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons honey
4 fresh apricots, pitted and cut into wedges
3 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Pat the pork chops dry with paper towels, and sprinkle both sides with salt and black pepper. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and brown the chops well on both sides, about 5 minutes per side.
Stir in honey, apricots, and garlic; cover, and simmer until the pork is tender, about 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer, inserted into the center of a chop, should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).  Sprinkle with parsley, and serve chops topped with the apricots and pan juices.

Description: 
These are absolutely divine!!  So simple and so beautiful...this is definitely a trick up my mom-sleeve!  They look like they require so much more effort than they really do.  I love to serve them with roasted asparagus topped with a homemade lemon vinaigrette or some green beans.
