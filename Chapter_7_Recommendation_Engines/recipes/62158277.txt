Description: 
This is my Oma's kohlsuppe recipe that I have tweaked over the years. This soup has a wonderful aroma while it is cooking and the taste takes me back to my childhood. I hope your family enjoys this soup as much as my family does. Serve with crusty bread or you can do what my husband does and break out the hot dog buns and mustard for the German wieners.
