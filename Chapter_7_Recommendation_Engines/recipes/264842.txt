1 grapefruit
1 cup white wine vinegar
1 cup white sugar

Zest grapefruit, then section the fruit, cutting it away from the peel and inner membranes. You should have 5 teaspoons zest and 3/4 cup grapefruit sections. Puree zest, sections, and any juices with sugar and vinegar. Add  tea bag. Chill, covered, 4 hours to 2 days. Remove tea bag and strain.
In a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice, combine 2 fluid ounces shrub and vodka. Shake until very cold. Strain into martini glass or an ice-filled old-fashioned glass. Garnish with a grapefruit wedge.

Description: 
This drink starts with a simple shrub--a tart, fruity liquid you make ahead and can also sip straight up or with seltzer-made with sugar, vinegar, citrus, and a tea bag. It's a play on a Greyhound (grapefruit juice and vodka). Salt the rim if you like.
