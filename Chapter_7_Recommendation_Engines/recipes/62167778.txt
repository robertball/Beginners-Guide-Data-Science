Ingredients:
1 Cup Masa Harina mixed with 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of hot water
2-1/2 Tablespoons rich-tasting pork lard or vegetable oil
1 Teaspoon Baking Powder
1/4 Teaspoon Salt, plus a little more for the beans if they need it.
3/4 Cup finely grated Mexican Queso Anejo, Parmesan, or Romano
2 Large Egg Yolks
1-1/2 Cups cooked Black or Pinto Beans
1/2 Medium White Onion, finely chopped and rinsed briefly under cold water
1/2 Roasted Poblano-Tomato Salsa, or what ever kind you prefer
1 Large Ripe Avocado, peeled, pitted, and diced
1/4 Cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
1.Heat oven to 350.  Grease a baking sheet.
2. In large bowl mix together the masa, lard, baking powder, salt, 1/2 cup of cheese and the egg yolks.  The mixture should be the consistency of a medium-soft cookie dough.
3.Divide into 20 balls, flatten them into about 2 inch disks, then pinch up a 1/4-inch-high border all around.  Arrange them on the baking sheet, then bake until slightly brown and crispy, about 17-20 minutes.
4.  While the sopes are baking, warm the black beans and mush them slightly with a potato masher.  Almost like re-fried but not quite that much.
5.  Spoon beans onto sopes, then top with a little chopped onion, a spoonful of salsa, and a couple pieces of avocado.  Sprinkle them with the remaining cheese and cilantro.
Then Enjoy!!

Description: 
Sopes are very commonly served in Central and West Cental Mexico. I got this recipe from one of my Rick Bayless cookbooks.  I made a few changes but not to many. They are small, round, thick tortillas type snack.  You may top them with whatever you like, there very versatile.
