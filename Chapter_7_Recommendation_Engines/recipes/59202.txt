Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
2 (15 ounce) cans cream-style corn
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped bell pepper
1 cup milk
16 crushed saltine crackers

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally until crisp and brown, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate, and crumble when cool enough to handle.
Mix corn, crumbled bacon, eggs, onion, bell pepper, milk, and crushed crackers in prepared baking dish, and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, until the casserole is thickened and bubbling.
