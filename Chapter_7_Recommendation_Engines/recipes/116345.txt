Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive or vegetable oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 (6 ounce) lamb loin chops

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first eight ingredients; add the chops. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
Drain and discard marinade. Broil lamb 3-4 in. from the heat for 4-6 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).
