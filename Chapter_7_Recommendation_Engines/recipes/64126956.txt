Ingredients:
Gougeres:
1/2 c unsalted butter
1 c cold water
1 c all purpose flour
salt and hot chili flakes
1/2 tsp. cumin seed or 1/4 tsp. ground cumin
4 eggs
1 c crumbled gorgonzola or St. Agur blue cheese or other cheeses. Classic can include - Fontina, Parmesan, Asiago, Jarlsberg, Emmenthal, Swiss, Gruyere or stronger Gorgonzola, St. Agur,  Stilton, Bleu de Causses, Benedictine or Ermite

Directions:
Bring the butter and water to a boil, add the flour, salt, hot chili flakes and cumin seed, stir in and cook over medium heat until a ball forms and pulls smoothly from the walls of the pot, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, let stand 5-10 minutes, then add the eggs one at a time, Mix well. Stir in the cheese. Pipe or spoon onto parchment lined baking sheets and bake at 400 F for about 20 minutes. No peeking. To test for doneness, pull one gougere apart; it should be crisp on the exterior, with a center core that is still soft to the bite.
