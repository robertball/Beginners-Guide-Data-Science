Description: 
Skip the traditional sweet potato casserole and try this salad sensation instead. Writes Roberta freedman of Mesilla Park, New Mexico, 'I really like this different treatment for sweet potatoes--I first tasted something similar at a friend's house years ago. This was a favorite of our children during the holidays. Now it's our grandson's favorite, too.'
