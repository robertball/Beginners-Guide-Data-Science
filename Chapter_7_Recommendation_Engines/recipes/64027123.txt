Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 large yellow onion  diced
1 can (14.5 ounce) cut diced tomatoes
1 can (8 ounce) tomato sauce
1 can (14 ounce) beef broth
1 cup water
11/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground oregano
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
Optional: 1 can (15 ounce) black soy beans drained and rinsed well.
Shredded Cheddar cheese
Sour Cream

Directions:
Brown ground beef and onions, breaking up well. Drain well.
Add spices and continue to cook and blend well.
Add the remaining ingredients.
Reduce heat, cover and simmer for at least 30 minutes or until reduced slightly.
Add beans (if using) in the last 10 minutes, just long enough to heat through. Black soy beans have a softer texture than pinto beans and will break down faster.
Add water or more broth if necessary.
Serve hot with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream.

Description: 
This recipe is one of my staples for my LC lifestyle. The spices are better than any prepackaged seasoning you can purchase in the store.
