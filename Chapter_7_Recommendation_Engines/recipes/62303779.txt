Ingredients:
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup water
3 cups old fashioned or quick oats
1/2 cup oat bran (optional)
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/4-3/4 cup nuts (I like finely chopped pecans and almonds, may also use walnuts, peanuts, etc...)
2 tsp. ground cinnamon
1 Tbsp. honey
2 tsp. vanilla or almond extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees and cover a 10x15 inch pan with parchment paper.
Mix brown sugar and water in microwave safe bowl. Cook in microwave to dissolve sugar, about 1 to 1.5 minutes. Stir to dissolve sugar then add vanilla, honey, and maple syrup.
In a large bowl, combine oats, salt, nuts, oat bran and cinnamon. Stir in the wet mixture. Mix well.
Pour mixture onto the prepared pan, spreading evenly. Create clusters by squeezing small handfuls of the oat mixture together.
Bake in oven for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and gently stir granola using a spoon. Return to oven and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Stir again and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Remove from oven. The granola should be slightly browned and will be chewy. Allow to cool for a few hours. Granola will harden as it cools.
