2 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust, chocolate
32 large marshmallows
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon mint extract
2 teaspoons chocolate extract
1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream
3 drops green food coloring

Directions:
In large saucepan combine marshmallows and milk. Stir over medium heat until the marshmallows are completely melted. Chill until mixture holds its shape when dropped from a spoon.
Slowly mix in the mint extract and chocolate extract and stir until all the ingredients are combined completely.
Beat the whipping cream in a chilled bowl until it forms stiff peaks. Gently fold whipping cream into marshmallow mixture.  Add food coloring to desired color.
Spread into pie crust. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Be sure to refrigerate any leftovers.

Description: 
This pie tastes like the traditional grasshopper pie only it does not contain alcohol.  It's great in the summer because of its light texture. If desired, top with dark chocolate shavings before serving.
