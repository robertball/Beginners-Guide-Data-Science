Ingredients:
1 pound turnips, cut into bite-sized pieces
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 pound cauliflower florets
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine turnips and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a bowl and toss. Transfer to a baking sheet in a single layer.
Roast in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, 30 to 35 minutes.
Combine cauliflower and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a bowl and toss. Transfer to a baking sheet in a single layer.
Roast in the hot oven until lightly browned on all sides, 20 to 25 minutes.
Mix mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, garlic salt, fresh dill, and black pepper together in large bowl. Toss roasted turnips and cauliflower, eggs, and onion into the sauce. Refrigerate before serving, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
You can flavor the 'sauce' to taste. I avoided relish due to the sugar content. Whether you add paprika, dill, or relish, the key to this low-carb recipe is the combination of cauliflower and turnips.
