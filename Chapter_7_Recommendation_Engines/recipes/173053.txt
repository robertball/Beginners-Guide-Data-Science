Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 link kielbasa (Polish) sausage, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 tablespoons salsa
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 pinch cumin
1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
2 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1/2 cup slightly crushed tortilla chips
1 tablespoon softened butter

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the sausage in the hot oil until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, salsa, chili powder, pepper, garlic salt, and cumin; cook and stir until the garlic has mellowed, about 4 minutes. Place a tortilla onto a microwave-safe plate and top with the sausage mixture. Sprinkle with the shredded Monterey Jack cheese.
Cook the tortilla in the microwave on High until the cheese melts, 45 seconds to 1 minute, depending on the microwave. Sprinkle the tortilla chips on top of the melted cheese and top with the remaining tortilla. Butter both sides of the quesadilla and place in a clean skillet over medium heat. Cook until golden brown; flip and continue cooking until golden brown on the other side, about 4 minutes per side.
