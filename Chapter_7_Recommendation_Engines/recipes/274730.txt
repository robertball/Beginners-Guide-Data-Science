Ingredients:
2  Roma tomatoes, quartered
1  green bell pepper, seeded and quartered
1  red bell pepper, seeded and quartered
1  Cubanelle pepper, seeded and quartered
1 small onion, peeled and quartered
1 bulb garlic, peeled
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons olive oil
10  boneless, skinless chicken thighs, or more to taste
2 teaspoons adobo seasoning
2 teaspoons cumin
1 cup chicken broth

Directions:
Combine tomatoes, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, Cubanelle pepper, onion, garlic, and cilantro in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until finely chopped. Set aside 1 cup of sofrito for the recipe and save the rest for another use.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season chicken thighs with adobo and cumin. Add chicken to hot skillet and sear on each side until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Reduce heat to low and add chicken broth and 1 cup of sofrito. Cover and simmer until chicken thighs fall apart, about 1 hour.
