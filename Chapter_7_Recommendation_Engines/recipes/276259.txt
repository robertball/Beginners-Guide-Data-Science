Ingredients:
1 tablespoon oil
1 (8 ounce) package portobello mushrooms, chopped
1 onion, diced
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained and 2 tablespoons juice reserved
1 tablespoon chorizo sausage spice seasoning (such as Chimayo Chorizo Sausage Spice by Savory Spice ShopÂ®)
1 (16 ounce) bag chopped fresh spinach
8 (10 inch) flour tortillas, warmed

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until sizzling. Add mushrooms and onion and cook until mushrooms begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add beans, diced tomatoes, and 2 tablespoons reserved tomato juice. Season with chorizo sausage seasoning and cook, stirring constantly, about 4 minutes. Add spinach and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes.
Add a few tablespoons of the vegetable mixture to the middle of a warmed tortilla. Fold in the outer edges, beginning at the middle edge of tortilla, and fold inward towards the filling; continue rolling until filling is enclosed. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.

Description: 
The vegan burrito is packed full of so many 'good for you' items, you will not miss the meat! Don't let the seasoning fool you, it may say chorizo, but this is a medium hot chile-based spice.
