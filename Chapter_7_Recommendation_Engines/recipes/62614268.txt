You can remove the fat from the steak but leaving it on adds another dimension to the gravy, improving the taste;

Cook, stirring constantly, for a couple of minutes until the slices or cubes are browned on all sides;
Place in a large casserole dish and pour the meat juices into the stock;
Pour the remaining oil into the frying pan, heat to a low medium heat, add the garlic, onions, celery and leek and, stirring occasionally, fry them until soft (about 5 minutes);
Sprinkle the flour over the onions, stirring for a minute to mix well;
Slowly pour in the stock, bring the mixture to the boil and turn the heat to low;
Stir in the tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, red wine, add salt and pepper, bring to boil, and heat on medium high for 3 to 4 minutes or so to thicken slightly then simmer for two or so minutes more;
Pour the tomato and onion mixture into the casserole dish;
Add the potatoes, carrots, bay leaves and mix well;
