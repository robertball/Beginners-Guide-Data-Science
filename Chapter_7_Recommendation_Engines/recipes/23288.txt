Ingredients:
CAKE
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 cup water
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa
1/2 cup LAND O LAKES® Butter, softened*
3 eggs
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla
FILLING
1 pint chilled LAND O LAKES® Gourmet Heavy Whipping Cream
1 1/2 teaspoons mint extract
2 tablespoons sugar
GLAZE
2 tablespoons LAND O LAKES® Butter
1/2 cup real semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon mint extract
Mint leaves, if desired

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease 2 (9-inch) round cake pans.  Line each pan with 9-inch round piece of waxed paper; grease waxed paper.  Set aside.
Combine all cake ingredients in large bowl.  Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until smooth.
Pour batter evenly into prepared pans.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool 10 minutes; remove from pans.  Remove waxed paper.  Cool completely.
Combine chilled whipping cream and 1 1/2 teaspoons mint extract in small bowl.  Beat at high speed, scraping bowl often, until soft peaks form.  Continue beating, gradually adding 2 tablespoons sugar, until stiff peaks form. Reserve 1/2 cup filling for garnish; refrigerate.
Cut each cake layer horizontally in half using serrated knife.  To assemble torte, place one split cake layer on serving plate; spread with 1/3 filling.  Repeat with remaining cake layers and filling, ending with cake layer.  Refrigerate torte at least 1 hour.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in 1-quart saucepan; stir in chocolate chips and corn syrup.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until chocolate chips are melted (2 to 3 minutes).  Remove from heat; stir in 1/4 teaspoon mint extract.  Spread glaze over top of torte, allowing glaze to drip down sides.  Garnish with reserved 1/2 cup filling and mint leaves, if desired.  Refrigerate until serving time.
