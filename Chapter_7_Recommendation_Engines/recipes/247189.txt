Ingredients:
3 apples, cored and chopped
2 teaspoons lemon juice
2 teaspoons honey

Directions:
Place 1 apple in a bowl. Cover with water. Let soak until soft, 8 hours to overnight. Drain, reserving soaking water.
Transfer soaked apple to a large pot. Mix in lemon juice and honey. Simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until consistency is very soft, about 15 minutes. Add remaining 2 apples to the pot. Continue simmering, adding some of the soaking water, until applesauce reaches desired consistency, 15 to 45 minutes.
