Ingredients:
6 jalapeno peppers, halved and seeded
7 1/2 ounces garden vegetable cream cheese (such as PhiladelphiaÂ®)
6 bacon strips, halved lengthwise

Directions:
Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Fill each jalapeno half with cream cheese and wrap with a halved bacon strip. Tuck in bacon ends or use toothpicks to secure.
Place jalapeno poppers inside the air fryer basket, working in batches to avoid overcrowding, if necessary.
Cook in the preheated air fryer until bacon is done to your liking, 10 to 12 minutes.

Description: 
Three ingredients and 10 minutes in your air fryer are what's needed to make these keto-friendly, bacon-wrapped jalapeno poppers. Try different flavors of cream cheese for variety! Thick-cut bacon does not work well, so use regular bacon. Halving the bacon lengthwise makes it easier to wrap around the peppers.
