Ingredients:
1 block cream cheese
1 C shredded mozzarella
1 C shredded cheddar
1/2 C diced habañero cheddar, such as Cabot
1/2 C Red Guajillo Chile Herdez Cooking Sauce
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp ground cayenne
10 large jalapeños

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Remove jalapeño stems.  Slice jalapeños in half lengthwise and remove seeds and membranes.
In large microwave-safe bowl, combine cream cheese, habañero cheddar, shredded cheddar, mozzarella, cooking sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne.  Cook for 2 minutes at 50% power.  Stir.  Continue to cook at 50% power in 1 minute intervals, stirring each time.  Cook until cheeses are fully melted, combined, and thick.
Place jalapeño  halves cut-side up in a medium baking dish.  Fill each jalapeño half with cheese mixture.
Cook for 25 minutes or until jalapeños have softened and cheese has started to brown.
