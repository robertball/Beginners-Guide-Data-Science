Ingredients:
1 whole chicken, 6-8 lbs
1/2 - 3/4 stick of very soft butter (depending on how big your chicken is)
2 tsps garlic powder
1 heaping tsp celery salt
1 heaping tsp ground cinnamon
1 heaping tsp rosemary
1/4 tsp coarse salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
Rinse your chicken under warm water, and pat dry with paper towels, making sure your chicken is very dry.
Place the bird breast side up on a counter, cutting board, or in the roasting pan. Starting from the neck side slide your hand inbetween the breast meat and the skin, seperating the skin from the meat so you have a cavity for the butter. Do this all the way to the other end of the bird, being very careful not to tear the skin.
Take half the butter and spread it inbetween the skin and meat.
Take the rest of the butter and spread it all over the top of the bird (breast side up), including breasts, legs and wings.
Mix together all the herbs and spices, and sprinkle on top of the bird, making sure to coat it well.
Place in a roasting pan and cook for 1 hour. Then raise the heat to 425 and roast for another 20-30 minutes, or until a thermometer reads 180 degrees when inserted into the thickest part of the thigh.
Cover the chicken with foil and let rest for 15 minutes. It's very important to do this step, otherwise the juices will come out of the bird and the meat will be dry.
Carve and serve. We usually eat it with mashed potatoes, gravy and veggies. Enjoy!
