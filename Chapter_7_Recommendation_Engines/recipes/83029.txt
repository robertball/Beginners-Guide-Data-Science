Brew your espresso. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, whisk together the pumpkin, vanilla, sugar, pumpkin pie spice and milk. Warm over medium heat, whisking constantly, until hot and frothy. Do not  bring to a boil. Pour the espresso into a mug and pour the pumpkin spiced milk over it.

Description: 
My take on our corner coffee shop's seasonal pumpkin latte. I loved it so much I HAD to do something!  You can use canned 'pumpkin pie mix' if you like, since it contains the pumpkin pie spice ingredients already. Top with nutmeg or cinnamon if you like.  Enjoy!
