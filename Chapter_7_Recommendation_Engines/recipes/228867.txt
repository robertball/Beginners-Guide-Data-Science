Description: 
My mother made this often when I was growing up. Lovely for breakfast, brunch, or light lunch. Serve this alongside a couple slices of good quality bakery bread, toasted and buttered. Keeping hard-cooked eggs in the fridge makes this easy and quick. You can adjust the amounts of chives and radishes, or even add an extra egg, depending on your taste.
