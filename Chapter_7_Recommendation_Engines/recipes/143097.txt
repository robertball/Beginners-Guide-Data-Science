Description: 
Here's a quick and easy way to create a beautiful summer fruit dessert.  I love to use fresh peaches, strawberries and blueberries, but frozen fruits should also work. You can also use fresh nectarines or apricots in place of the peaches. It will look like you spent hours making this fancy 30 minute dessert! Pairs great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
