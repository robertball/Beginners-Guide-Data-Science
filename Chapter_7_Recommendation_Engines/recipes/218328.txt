Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 onion, chopped
2 cups chicken broth
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 1/2 tablespoons chili powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat and stir in the ground turkey. Cook and stir until the turkey is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes.
Add the chicken broth, tomatoes, black beans, kidney beans, refried beans, garlic, chili powder, paprika, oregano, cumin, salt, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Sprinkle each bowl with a teaspoon of Cheddar cheese, if desired.
