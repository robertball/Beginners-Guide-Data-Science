Ingredients:
4 small zucchinis
3 tbsp coconut oil
1 tbsp butter
1/3 cup shredded parmesan
2 eggs
1-2 tsp chili powder (to taste)
1 tsp lite salt, himalayan pink salt, or iodized table salt
(Optional) 1 tsp cayenne pepper

Directions:
Wash zucchinis, and, holding the stem end, grate them against a fine cheese grater.
Put zucchini gratings into a medium skillet along with coconut oil and butter.  Begin frying on medium heat.
Add chili powder, salt, cayenne (if desired), and Parmesan to the mix.  Stir until cheese melts.
In a separate small bowl, beat eggs until they are  evenly mixed.
Turn heat down to low and add eggs, quickly stirring.  When eggs are fully mixed in, turn heat back up.
Cook, stirring and flipping occasionally, approximately fifteen minutes, until the edges of the hash mash are lightly browned.  Serve.

Description: 
This recipe makes an amazing side dish.  Flavorful and high in healthy fat,  it is a great complement to a meat or other high-protein main dish.  If you like the flavors of zucchini and chili powder and miss the texture of mashed potatoes, try this one.
