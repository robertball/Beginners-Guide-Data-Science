Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package rotini pasta
1/4 cup butter
2 sweet onions, chopped
1 (26 ounce) can tomato soup (such as Campbell's®)
1 (16 ounce) package hot dogs (such as Oscar Mayer®), sliced 1/4 inch thick
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, undrained
4 teaspoons dill pickle relish
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions until translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer onions to a large bowl and mix cooked rotini, tomato soup, hot dogs, corn with its juice, dill pickle relish, and yellow mustard into onions. Pour mixture into a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and the top is lightly browned, about 1 hour.
