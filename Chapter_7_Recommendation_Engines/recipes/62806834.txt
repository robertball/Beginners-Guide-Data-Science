Ingredients:
CAKE:
1 package white cake mix
1 (3 oz) raspberry gelatin
1 (10oz) package of frozen raspberries (thawed)
4 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup hot water
FROSTING:
1 (12 oz) container frozen whipped topping (thawed)
1 (10 oz) package frozen raspberries (thawed)
Topping:
1/2 cup Strawberries (halved)
1 cup raspberries
1 black berry

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 325 degrees
In a large bowl, combine dry cake mix and gelatin powder. Add one package raspberries with juice, eggs, oil and water. Beat until well blended. Pour into 2 greased 9 inch round pans (if making double layer cake). Bake at 325 degrees for 28-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
Let cake cool completely before frosting. I put the cake pans in the freezer for half an hour to speed the cooling process. If you do this, set a timer so you don't freeze the cakes solid.
For frosting, fold whipped topping into raspberries. Spread over cake and refrigerate for 2 hours before serving. Top cake with halved strawberries on outter edge then top with raspberries in circular pattern and place 1 black berry in center of cake. Store in refrigerator.

Description: 
A quick gourmet cake that is very moist. I made this for a friend's birthday as a nice alternative to standard birthday cake since she preferred whipped frosting to buttercream.
