Ingredients:
1 cup fine bulgur
1 cup boiling water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
2 large tomatoes, finely chopped
1 cucumber, diced
2 green bell peppers, finely chopped
1 red bell pepper, finely chopped
7 green onions, finely chopped
1/2 cup minced fresh parsley
1/2 cup minced fresh mint leaves
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
juice of 1 fresh lemon
2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses

Directions:
Place the bulgur in a bowl; stir in the boiling water. Cover and let stand for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the chopped onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
Drain the bulgur and return it to the bowl. Add the cooked onion, chopped tomatoes, cucumber, green and red bell peppers, green onions, parsley, mint, and red pepper flakes. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, the lemon juice, and the pomegranate molasses. Toss gently until the salad is thoroughly combined. Serve immediately, or refrigerate until serving.
