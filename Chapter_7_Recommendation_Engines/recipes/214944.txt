Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 pound bacon, cut in half

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet liberally with olive oil.
Place the salmon fillets onto the baking sheet skin-side-down. Sprinkle the fillets with garlic powder, dill, salt, and pepper. Lay the bacon strips over the fillets to cover completely. Do not overlap the bacon strips.
Bake in the preheated oven until the salmon is no longer translucent in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. Turn the oven on to broil and cook until the bacon has crisped, 1 to 2 minutes.

Description: 
A delicious use of some of my favorite things - bacon and salmon! The salmon stays really moist from the bacon, and the skin helps protect the bottom from cooking prematurely.
