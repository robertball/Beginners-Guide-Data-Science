Ingredients:
1 pound potatoes, peeled and sliced
3 tablespoons vegan butter (such as Earth Balance Â®), or more to taste
2 1/2 cups finely chopped leek, white and pale green part only
6 large cloves garlic, peeled and halved

Directions:
Rinse leek well and drain in a colander.
Melt vegan butter in a pot over medium-high heat and stir in leek. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until leek is soft, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil, add sliced potatoes and garlic, and cook until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain potatoes and garlic and return to the pot with the leeks. Mash until desired consistency is reached.

Description: 
Creamy, decadent mashed potatoes. I use vegan butter for a plant-based side dish, but you can certainly use regularly butter as well.
