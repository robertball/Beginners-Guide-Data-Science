Ingredients:
2 boneless/skinless chicken breasts
2 eggs
¾ cup almond flour
½ cup flax meal
1 tsp cumin
¼ cup fine grate Parmesan cheese (I use powdered in the can)
Spices of choice (I go with a no salt herbal blend, crushed black pepper, and organic garlic salt)

Directions:
Preparation:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Have a large baking sheet standing by
In a medium bowl, whisk eggs to create a wash for the chicken
In a medium bowl, place all dry ingredients and fork until combined (I taste to see if I need to add additional spices)
Slice chicken breasts into strips (8-12)
Dip each chicken strip into the egg wash, transfer into dry ingredients and coat, place onto baking sheet. Continue this process until all chicken strips are on the sheet and ready to place in the oven. Bake for approximately 20-25 minutes. I serve with a spicy mustard, but feel free to experiment with your favorite healthy dips.
