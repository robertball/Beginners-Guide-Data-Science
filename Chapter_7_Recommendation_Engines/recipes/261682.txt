Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup cashews
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1/4 cup sunflower seeds
2 tablespoons hemp seeds
2 tablespoons wheat germ
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1 pinch red pepper flakes
1 egg white

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix oats, cashews, almonds, sunflower seeds, hemp seeds, wheat germ, olive oil, honey, maple syrup, sesame seeds, salt, thyme, oregano, and red pepper flakes together in a large bowl.
Whisk egg white in a small bowl until frothy.  Stir into granola mixture. Spread on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.
Bake until fragrant, about 15 minutes. Turn over sections of the granola using a flat spatula, trying to keep large clusters intact. Bake until evenly browned and dry to the touch, about 10 minutes more.
Place baking sheet on a wire rack; let granola cool completely. Break up into clusters and transfer to an airtight container.

Description: 
Who says granola has to be sweet? I decided to skip the fruit and add some herbs and spices and was very pleased with the results! I'd recommend serving it as I did - over plain yogurt, with a drizzle of olive oil, and some chopped cucumber. Yum!
