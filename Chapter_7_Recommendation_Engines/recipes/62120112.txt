Ingredients:
1 tablespoon sugar
2 eggs beaten
1 to 1 1/2 cups of Four-Cheese Mexican blend shredded cheese (don't use the kind with the taco seasoning added).
1/2 cup of butter melted (1 stick)
1 8.5 oz Jiffy cornbread mix
1 14.75 oz cream of corn
1 15.25 oz whole corn, drained
1 cup of sour cream

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.  Combine all ingredients except for the cheese in a mixing bowl and scape into baking dish. Sprinkle the top with cheese and pat lightly so pieces don't stick out and burn.  Use enough cheese to cover the top of your casserole.  Bake uncovered for about 45 minutes or until the top has set and begins to turn golden.  Enjoy!!

Description: 
This is another version of the classic.  I have modified it over the years and this is the version that my family and friends love.  If you double the recipe, it fits perfectly into a long 9 x 13 pyrex baking dish.  It is so easy to make that sometimes I just mix the ingredients right in the casserole dish and throw it in the oven.
