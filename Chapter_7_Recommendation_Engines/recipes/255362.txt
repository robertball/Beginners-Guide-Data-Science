Ingredients:
4 tablespoons olive oil
4 teaspoons dried minced onion
1/2 teaspoon crumbled dried rosemary
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon paprika
3 tablespoons no-salt-added tomato paste
2 (15 ounce) cans no-salt-added chickpeas
1 (14.5 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 cup water
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook onion and rosemary, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in garlic powder, paprika, and tomato paste and cook, stirring, 15 seconds. Add chickpeas, tomatoes, spinach, salt, pepper, and water and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, over low heat, stirring occasionally, until flavors have combined and mixture is piping hot, 5 to 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook panko, stirring, until toasted and lightly browned, about 3 minutes.
Divide stew among serving bowls and top each with 2 tablespoons panko.
