Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
2 (5 ounce) cans white tuna, drained and flaked
2 stalks celery, minced
1 onion, minced
2 cups mayonnaise
1 (5 ounce) jar pimento-stuffed green olives, drained
1 pint grape tomatoes
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Transfer the macaroni to a bowl, and cool in the refrigerator.
In a large bowl, lightly toss the tuna with celery, onion, and about 1 cup mayonnaise until combined, then stir in the remaining mayonnaise, macaroni, olives, and grape tomatoes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Let the salad chill in refrigerator 1 hour.

Description: 
This macaroni salad is great for lunch on its own, if you don't feel like cooking on those hot summer days. It's also a wonderful side for grilled food. I have perfected it -- after making many different types of macaroni salad, this one is my favorite. Enjoy!!
