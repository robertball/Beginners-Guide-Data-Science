Description: 
A Memphis style rub that I use primarily on pork butts and ribs prior to smoking. I usually coat the meat with the rub and let rest 24 to 48 hours wrapped in plastic wrap. I then sprinkle a light second application immediately before putting the meat into the smoker. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.
