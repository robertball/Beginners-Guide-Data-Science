Ingredients:
1 (14.5 ounce) can cream of pumpkin soup
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 pound boneless chicken, chopped
1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
9 lasagna noodles
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine milk and cream of pumpkin soup. Set aside.
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Add chicken, and saute until done. Stir in Bolognese sauce; simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Spoon 1/3 meat sauce into a 2 quart casserole dish, cover with 3 uncooked noodles, and top with 1/3 soup mixture. Repeat twice. Sprinkle cheese over lasagna.
Bake in a preheated 400 degree F (200 degree C) oven for 35 minutes, or until hot and bubbly. Remove from oven, and let stand 15 minutes before serving.
