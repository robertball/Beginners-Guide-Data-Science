Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 cup real maple syrup + 1/4 cup (glaze)
2 teaspoons maple flavor
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups dried blueberries
1/3 cup granulated sugar for decoration (if not glazing)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, cream the butter and brown sugar.  Add the egg, syrup and vanilla.  Mix until well blended. Sift together the flour, salt and baking soda.   Stir into mixture until well blended. Add the blueberries at the end so that they remain whole. Shape into 1 inch balls and roll in sugar. Place on cookie sheets about 2 inches apart and flatten slightly.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Let cool on wire rack.
Glaze:  I used 2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup maple syrup and just enough milk to make it spreadable
