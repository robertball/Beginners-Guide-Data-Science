Ingredients:
1 lb of potatoes, cubed
2 T butter, cubed
2 1/4 to 2 3/4 cups bread flour (original called for 12oz)
1 T sugar
2 tsp yeast
2 large eggs (divided use)
sesame seeds

Directions:
Put cubed potatoes in pot with just enough water to cover and boil until tender.
Remove and reserve 5 T of potato water.
Drain and dry potatoes, then thoroughly mash.
Measure out 1 cup of mashed potatoes and add butter.
In mixer bowl, add flour, salt, yeast, and sugar. Whisk to combine.
Add potatoes to flour mix and incorporate using hands.
Add potato water and one egg.
Knead 8 to 10 minutes then turn out (dough should be dry, yet quite sticky).
Let rise in oiled bowl 30-40 minutes.
Gently turn out, pat into a square, and divide into 8 sections (use between 2.5 and 2.75 oz per bun).
Roll each section into a tight ball, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest 15 minutes.
On lightly floured surface, gently press down on each ball, forming it into a 3 1/2" circle.  Place on parchment lined baking sheets, cover with wrap and let rise 30 to 40 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425.
Take remaining egg, add 1 tsp of water and a pinch of salt.
Brush egg mix onto rolls (gently) then sprinkle with seeds.
Bake 13 to 15 minutes (original 15-18) or until golden brown (but not burnt, like my first batch turned out to be).
