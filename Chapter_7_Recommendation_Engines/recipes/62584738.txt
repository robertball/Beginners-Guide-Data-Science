Ingredients:
2 tbsp. Butter
1 tsp. Ground rosemary
2 49 oz. Cans chicken broth
1 tsp. Salt
Hot pepper sauce to taste (I like a lot!)
2 Small onions, chopped
4 Butternut squash, peeled and cut into chunks
1-1/4 cups Heavy cream
1/2 tsp. Freshly ground white pepper

Directions:
Add the squash, chicken stock, cream, salt, pepper and hot pepper sauce, reduce the heat and cover.
Simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 2 hours, or until the squash is very soft.
Use a food processor or blender to puree the hot soup. Add the cream and warm.
Add additional stock if the soup is too thick.
Ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with a dollop of sour cream, and serve.
