Description: 
This is very good.  Original recipe says to dump all ingred. in slow cooker, no need to defrost chicken but this is much better if chicken is first cooked in chicken broth. Chicken is then shredded and returned to cooker with barbecue sauce, Italian salad dressing, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce.
