Ingredients:
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 1/2 cups cranberry sauce
1/2 cup turkey drippings
2 teaspoons curry powder
1 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon anise seed
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 teaspoon orange zest

Directions:
Whisk water and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth.
Combine cranberry sauce, turkey drippings, curry powder, thyme, anise seed, cardamom, and orange zest in a small saucepan; cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat for about 5 minutes.
Stir cornstarch mixture to remove any lumps and pour into cranberry mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until gravy is thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
Flavorful for any fowl. My cranberry-hating son even gave it the thumbs up! My thanksgiving guests had fun trying to figure out what this gravy was made out of and were amazed when I finally told them. I had regular turkey gravy out and this gravy. The cranberry gravy was every bit as gone as the regular turkey gravy!
