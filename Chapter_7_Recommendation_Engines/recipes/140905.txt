Ingredients:
2/3 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
1 egg, beaten
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch round cake pan or pie plate.
In a medium bowl, mix together the butter, sugar and almond extract until light and fluffy using an electric mixer. Blend in the egg. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the mixture using a sturdy spoon until dough forms a ball. Press the dough into the prepared pan.
Bake for 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is light golden brown. When cool, slice into wedges to serve.

Description: 
A decadent Dutch cake that's super easy to stir up and a perfect complement to a cup of tea or coffee.  It's actually more like a soft cookie than a cake but definitely delicious nonetheless.
