Ingredients:
3 eggplants, roasted and peeled (pierce before roasting to avoid an eggplant explosion)
3 cloves minced garlic
200 grams of crumbled feta cheese
50 grams of finely ground walnuts (or pecans)
Salt and pepper to taste
50 grams of olive oil

Directions:
Roast eggplants by brushing them lightly with olive oil and placing in oven at 400 until skins are brown.  Remove and peel the eggplants.  Set aside to drain.  Cut into medium sized chunks.  Place in food processor.  Add remaining ingredients to food processor.  Mix until all ingredients are combined (mixture shouldn't be a smooth puree, it should have a slightly thick consistency with a few present chunks of small eggplant)
Serve as an accompaniment or appetizer.
