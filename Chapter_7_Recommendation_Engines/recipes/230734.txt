Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package rotini pasta
2 cups cubed cooked chicken
2 stalks celery, diced
1/3 cup jarred roasted red pepper, drained (reserve juice) and chopped
1 green onion, thinly sliced
1/2 cup mayonnaise (such as Hellmann's®/Best Foods®)
2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®), or to taste
2 tablespoons crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and cool.
Mix pasta, chicken, celery, roasted red pepper, and 1 tablespoon of reserved roasted red pepper juice in a salad bowl. Stir mayonnaise, hot sauce, Gorgonzola cheese, and Worcestershire sauce together in a separate bowl until thoroughly combined. Pour dressing over pasta mixture and toss lightly to coat. Chill before serving.
