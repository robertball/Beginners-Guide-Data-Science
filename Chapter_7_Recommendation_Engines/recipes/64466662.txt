Ingredients:
2 tbsp COCOA
4 tbsp SUGAR
2 tbsp BAKING POWDER
~9-10 tbsp FLOUR
~1/4 cup MILK
1/4 cup MELTED BUTTER

Directions:
OKAY GUYS THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME
1. GET A BOWL AND GATHER THE INGREDIENTS AND WARM UP YOUR COOKING DEVICE (eg oven)
2. MIX ALL THE DRY STUFF TOGETHER - BUT ONLY ADD HALF THE FLOUR
3. ADD THE MELTED BUTTER AND MILK
4. ADD THE REST OF THE FLOUR, MIXING SO IT GETS ALL MIXED TOGETHER IN A MIXED NON HETEROGENEOUS LIKE WAY.  GO FULL HOMOGENOUS.  FEAR NOT THE TOGETHERNESS
5. GET A TRAY AND MAKE IT NONSTICKY WITH YOUR SUPERSECRETSUPERPOWER (or wax paper if you're trying to maintain your secret identity)
6. PUT YOUR HOMOGENEOUS-EPIC-MIX ON THE TRAY.  IN SEPARATE LUMPS.  KEEP THEM APART BECAUSE IT WILL SPREAD.  THE LUMPS DONT HAVE TO LOOK PERFECT THOUGH.  ITS WHATS INSIDE THAT COUNTS ANYWAYS.
7. PUT IT IN THE OVEN FOR LIKE 10minutes OR MORE.  TIL IT'S COOKED AND YUMMY.  LIKE A CAKE BUT BETTER AND BITE-IER.  IF YOU POKE IT AND THE POKEY THING IS CLEAR OF YUMMYNESS THEN ITS DONE!!!
8. EAT IT UP.
9. BUT WAIT TIL ITS COOL ENOUGH.  DONT BURN YOUR PRECIOUS TONGUE.
