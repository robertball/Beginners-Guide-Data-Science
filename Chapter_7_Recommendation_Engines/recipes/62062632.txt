Ingredients:
1 pint heavy cream
1 stick butter
2 tablespoons cream cheese
3/4 cup fresh grated parmesan cheese, (NOT THE GREEN CAN STUFF!)
1 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
In a saucepan combine butter, heavy cream, and cream cheese. Simmer until melted and well combined. Add parmesan cheese and garlic powder and simmer 20 mins on low. Mix frequently so it doesnt scorch. The longer you simmer the better. Salt and pepper if desired.

Description: 
If this isnt how the Olive Garden makes their alfredo sauce for pasta and breadsticks, then I dont know how. I worked there for years and this to me is IDENTICAL! SOOO GOOD!
