Ingredients:
Cake:
1 packet yeast
1/4 cup warm water
1 cup sugar
1 tsp. salt
2 eggs
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup butter, melted
2-3/4 to 3 cups flour (all-purpose)
1 cup coconut, toasted
2 Tbsp. grated orange rind
Glaze:
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup sour cream
2 Tbsp. orange juice
1/4 cup butter

Directions:
Soften yeast in warm water in mixing bowl. Stir in 1/4 cup sugar, salt, eggs, sour cream and 6 Tbsp. melted butter. Gradually add flour to form stiff dough beating well after each addition (for first additions of flour, use mixer on medium speed). Cover, let rise in warm place (85 - 90 degrees) until light and doubled, about 2 hours. Combine 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup coconut and orange rind. Knead dough on well-floured surface about 15 times. Roll out half of dough into a 12 inch circle. Brush with 1 Tbsp. melted butter. Sprinkle with half of the sugar-coconut mixture. Cut into 12 wedges. Roll up, starting with wide end and rolling to point. Place rolls point side down in 3 rows in well-greased 9X13 pan. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover, let rise in warm place until light and doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes until golden brown. Leave in pan. Pour glaze over hot coffee cake. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup coconut.
For glaze: combine ingredients in sauce pan. Boil 3 minutes stirring occasionally.

Description: 
My Grandma made this delicious coffee cake when I was a little kid. It brings back fond memories of her cooking. My Mom and I used to laugh about how Grandma used every clean pot and utensil when she cooked. And these days I find myself doing the same!
I researched the recipe and discovered that it was the winner of the 16th National Pillsbury Bake-off in 1964! If you make it, you'll see why!!
