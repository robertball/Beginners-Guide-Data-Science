Ingredients:
4 pounds beef sirloin steaks, at least 3/4 inch thick
1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian salad dressing
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Score the steaks lightly on both sides using a sharp knife. Place in a shallow baking dish. Pour the Italian dressing and Worcestershire sauce over them, and sprinkle with garlic. Rub the marinade into the steaks using the back of a spoon or fork. Turn steaks over, and repeat on the other side. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 24 hours.
Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Oil the grate lightly with a paper towel dipped in olive oil.
Grill steaks for about 6 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. Season with salt and pepper to taste before serving.
