Ingredients:
1 large roaster chicken (6 to 8 pounds)
2 lemons
16 garlic cloves
3 fresh rosemary branches
1/3 cup olive oil
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp ground cumin
10 smallish yukon gold potatoes (whole)
4 fat carrots
3 medium yellow onions
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
Place one lemon in a small sauce pan and cover with water, bring to rapid boil, then turn off heat
Puree together marinade: leaves from one rosemary branch, cumin, 10 garlic cloves, juice and zest from one lemon (not the boiled one), salt and olive oil
Put whole, washed potatoes, 6 garlic, carrots (cut in big chunks) and onion (peeled and cut in half) in a bowl and coat with half of the garlic lemon marinade
Rinse and pat dry chicken.  With one hand gently slide the remaining marinage under the breast and thigh of the chicken (start at the neck opening), taking care to stop before breaking through the pointy end of the breast (this will make a pocket that will keep the marinade on the meat and baste the chicken during roasting)
Rub the outside of the chicken with a bit of the marinade left on your hand. Salt and pepper
Place the boiled lemon (prick with fork) and 2 rosemary branches in the chicken in a large Dutch oven (which has a cover) and add 1/4 cup of the hot lemon water to the bottom of the dutch oven and 1/4 cup inside the chicken. Bake uncovered for 20 minutes.  Reduce oven temp to 350 degrees and put cover on dutch oven
40 minutes later add the vegetables to the dutch oven and cover and bake for 40 minutes (If there is too much liquid, use a baster to remove -- and save--some so there's not more than half an inch)
Bake uncovered for another 20 minutes. Let rest and serve

Description: 
This is my no brainer chicken that lets you gets on to other things while it cooks (I shovelled snow this time). A couple of tricks make this special. Super juicy and full of flavor, it's sure to please. It's also easy on the pocket book.
