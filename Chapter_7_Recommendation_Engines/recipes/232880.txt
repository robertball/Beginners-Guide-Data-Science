Ingredients:
1 (16.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 1/4 cups water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 egg whites
1 (6 ounce) package pineapple-flavored gelatin mix (such as Jell-O®)
1 cup boiling water
3/4 cup cold water
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1 (8 ounce) container whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Beat cake mix, 1 1/4 cup water, vegetable oil, and egg whites together in a bowl using an electric mixer in medium speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 29 to 34 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes.
Stir pineapple-flavored gelatin with boiling water in a bowl until dissolved; stir in cold water.
Poke holes into cake using a skewer or straw; spoon gelatin mixture evenly over cake. Refrigerate for 4 hours.
Mix pineapple and pudding mix in a bowl; fold in whipped topping. Spread mixture evenly over chilled cake; refrigerate at least 2 more hours.

Description: 
I combined two favorite cake recipes to come up with this one. Always a hit parties and potlucks. The topping really makes this one great. Lemon Jell-O® works well too.
