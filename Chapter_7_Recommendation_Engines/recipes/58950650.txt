Ingredients:
4 russet potatoes, sliced into 1/4 inch slices
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1 quart casserole dish.
Layer the potatoes into the prepared casserole dish.  Season each layer with salt and pepper to taste.
In a medium-size saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Mix in the flour and salt, and stir constantly with a whisk for one minute. Stir in milk. Cook until mixture has thickened. Stir in cheese all at once, and continue stirring until melted, about 30 to 60 seconds. Pour cheese over the potatoes, and cover the dish with aluminum foil.
Bake 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven. Remove foil for the last 15 minutes of bake time to let the top of the potatoes brown.

Description: 
This dish is a simple crowd pleaser.  I purchase my potatoes in bulk 5 or 10 lb bags at the local grocer as well as purchasing the 5 lb blocks of cheese that are almost always on sale.  I like to grate the whole block at once and this way I always have grated cheese on hand when needed and can avoid buying the pricey pre-shredded cheddar.Modified from: Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes
