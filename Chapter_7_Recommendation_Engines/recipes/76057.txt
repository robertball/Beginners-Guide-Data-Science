Ingredients:
1 cup mesquite chips, soaked
1 (2 pound) slab baby back pork ribs
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 teaspoon Hungarian paprika
1 teaspoon ancho chile powder
1/2 teaspoon ground thyme
1 cup barbeque sauce

Directions:
Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect heat - a pile of charcoal on one side, nothing under the food. Once it is going, throw some soaked mesquite woodchips on it.
Remove the membrane from the ribs if the butcher has not already. Combine the salt, pepper, paprika, chile powder and thyme; rub onto the ribs. Cut the slab of ribs in half.
Place the ribs over indirect heat, and close the lid. Cook for 20 minutes, then brush with barbeque sauce. Cover, and continue cooking for an additional 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is an easy recipe for ribs which won't be tough, like smoked ribs, or fall off the bone, like braised ribs. These ribs are done the right way, and I've never had better ribs than this.
