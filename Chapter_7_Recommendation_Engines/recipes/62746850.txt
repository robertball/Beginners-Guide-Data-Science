Ingredients:
1 loaf (16 oz) bread (unsliced) (I prefer sourdough or pumpernickel)
1 (8 oz) pkg cream cheese, softened
1/2 c sour cream
1/4 c hot salsa
1 1/2 c (6 oz) shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Cut a 1/4" slice from top of bread; set aside.  Remove center from bread leaving 1/2" thick shell.  Cut center into 1" cubes.  Bake until toasted, above 5 minutes.  With electric mixer, beat cream cheese, sour cream and salsa until smooth.  Stir in cheddar cheese, spoon into bread shell.  Place reserved slice on top; wrap in foil.  Bake until hot, about 1 1/2 hours.  Serve with fresh veggies and toasted bread cubes.
