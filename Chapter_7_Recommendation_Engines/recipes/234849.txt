1 tablespoon white sugar, or more to taste
1 tablespoon pumpkin puree

Whisk 1/2 cup milk, sugar, pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spice, and vanilla extract in a small saucepan over low heat. Simmer for 5 minutes. Whisk in remaining 1/2 cup milk.

Description: 
This is a great recipe for the holidays; it tastes great and it feels like fall when you drink it. It is similar to the StarbucksÂ® Pumpkin Spice Latte, but I personally like this better. Top with whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice.
