Description: 
Along with a refreshing beverage, I served these attractive hors d'oeuvres to guests at my Garden Party. The crisp cucumbers on these easy-to-fix finger sandwiches get their zip from being marinated for a short time.                                                                  --Sara Laker                                                                   Loda, Illinois
