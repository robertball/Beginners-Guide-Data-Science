1 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
1 cup almond flour
3/4 cup chopped dried mixed fruit

1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup chopped pecans

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 cup applesauce
1/2 cup honey
1 egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Mix oats, almond flour, dried fruit, rice cereal, brown sugar, pecans, chocolate chips, flax seeds, instant coffee granules, and cinnamon in a large bowl.
Whisk applesauce, honey, egg, and vanilla extract in a small bowl; pour into oat mixture. Stir until evenly incorporated. Press batter into prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into granola bars.

Description: 
I adapted a few granola bars to fit my needs as a short-on-cash college kid. They're easy to adapt to what you have in your pantry and perfect to store individually for a healthy grab-and-go snack! Using dried cherries gives the bars a tarty edge! I recommend cutting bars and storing in refrigerator wrapped individually for grab-and-go snacking.
