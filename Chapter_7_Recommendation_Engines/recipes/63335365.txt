Ingredients:
1 and 1/2 cups (3 sticks) of butter, softened
4 cups of flour
1/2 cup of granulated sugar
1 eighteen ounce jar of apricot jam or preserves (or the fruit flavor of your choice)

Directions:
With an electric mixer beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Gradually add flour and continue mixing until well-combined, but crumbly. Place 2/3 of this mixture, evenly, into a 9x13 ungreased baking dish. Press it down firmly with your hands to form a kind of crust. Spoon the jam all over the top of this layer, spreading gently (to about 1/4" of the edge), so as not to pull up the bottom layer. Sprinkle the remaining third of the crumbly dough over the jam layer. Bake in a 350 degree preheated oven for about 25 minutes or until set. The top should not get brown. Allow to cool before cutting into bars/squares. Before serving, dust with powdered sugar.

Description: 
This recipe makes a delicious dessert when you don't have much time or many ingredients in the house. Essentially, you only need butter, sugar, flour and a medium size jar of jam/preserves to complete this one. The result is a rich crumbly dessert bar that is fine by itself, or can be served with a scoop of ice cream or sorbet.
