Ingredients:
25 slices bacon
25 mushrooms

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Bake approximately 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bacon is evenly brown. Serve hot.

Description: 
Mushrooms are an excellent vehicle for beloved bacon in these easy to make appetizers. Use toothpicks to hold the bacon in place while baking. I usually have to make a double batch of this party favorite to satisfy our guests.
