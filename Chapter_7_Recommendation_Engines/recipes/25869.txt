Ingredients:
1 pound sea scallops
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup plain bread crumbs
1 tablespoon OLD BAYÂ® Seasoning

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch pie plate.
Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. Rinse the scallops, and drop them into the boiling water; cook for 2 minutes. Remove the scallops with a slotted spoon, and pat dry. Place on the bottom of the prepared pie plate.
In a small saucepan, melt the butter, and stir in the flour. Cook over low heat for 3 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly, or until thick.
Squeeze the spinach dry, and spread over the scallops. Pour the cream sauce over the spinach, and top with mozzarella cheese, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and bread crumbs. Sprinkle Old Bay Seasoning over the bread crumbs.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until browned and bubbly.
