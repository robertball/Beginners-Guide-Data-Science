Ingredients:
1 head cabbage, shredded
2 cooked skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed
6 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 chicken-flavored ramen noodle seasoning packets
1/4 cup white sugar
1 cup olive oil
6 green onions, chopped
1/4 cup toasted sliced almonds, or to taste
1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds, or to taste

Directions:
Combine the shredded cabbage and cubed chicken in a large mixing bowl; set aside. Whisk together the vinegar, ramen noodle seasoning, and sugar in a mixing bowl until the sugar has dissolved. Slowly pour the olive oil into the vinegar mixture, whisking quickly to incorporate the oil into the dressing. Stir in the green onions, then pour the dressing over the cabbage mixture. Toss the salad until evenly coated with the dressing. Sprinkle with almond slices and sesame seeds to serve.

Description: 
A great salad for summer days, cool, crunchy and refreshingly light. The chicken breasts are preferably barbecued for extra flavor, but baked is ok too. I also often double this recipe and make 3 times the dressing and there is always great lunch leftovers remaining. People also love the dressing so more typically goes onto the salad when you let them self serve than would normally, and that's ok, it makes it very flavorful. You can also crush up the ramen not used when making the dressing, and top the salad with these as well.  I prefer them without.
