Ingredients:
20 ounces shredded carrots
1 handfuls golden raisins
1 tablespoons poppy seeds
1 lemon, juiced
1 orange, juiced
1/2 grapefruit, juiced
2 Tbsp light brown sugar
Salt to taste

Directions:
Combine all ingredients well, using your fingers to toss and coat the carrots thoroughly. Transfer to a travel container or serving dish. As the salad sits, the raisins will plump a bit and carrots will take on citrus taste.
