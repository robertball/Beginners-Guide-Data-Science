Ingredients:
1 egg sub, beaten
3/4 cup cold water
1/4 teaspoon salt
7/8 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together egg sub, cold water and salt. Mix in all-purpose flour 1/3 at a time. Allow the mixture to stand 15 minutes at room temperature.
Heat non stick skillet or wok on low. Pour 1/4 of the mixture in an approximately 8 inch circle. Rotate wok quickly to spread an even layer of batter. Cook over low heat 45 seconds to 1 minute, until bottom is golden brown and edges begin to curl. Carefully remove from heat and place on a paper towel, golden brown side down.
Repeat the wok procedure with remaining batter, 1/4 at a time.
Allow the wrappers to cool completely. Cut wrappers in half to use for egg rolls.
