Ingredients:
2/3 cup water
1/3 cup quinoa
1 cup shredded coconut
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 cup applesauce
1/2 cup peanut butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Place a cover on the saucepan, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the moisture is absorbed completely, 15 to 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
Mix cooked quinoa, coconut, oats, flour, brown sugar, mashed bananas, applesauce, peanut butter, vanilla, salt, baking soda, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Fold chocolate chips into the quinoa mixture; drop by spoonful onto prepared baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until browned around the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow cookies to set up a few minutes before transferring to a cooling rack

Description: 
I bake with my three-year-old at least once a week. We have tried a plethora of different cookies with different fruits and bases. This one was a hit! My three-year-old and older child both loved these, and I did too! They are super simple to make and sneak fiber, protein, and other nutrients into dessert! I used one cookie sheet for nine cookies, three rows of three fit well.
