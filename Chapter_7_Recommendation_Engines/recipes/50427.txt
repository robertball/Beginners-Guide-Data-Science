Ingredients:
1 pound asparagus spears, trimmed
1/4 cup water
1 pound salmon fillets, skin removed
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon dried dill weed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup sliced spinach
1 tablespoon capers
1/4 cup diced red onion
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place asparagus and water in a covered, microwave-safe, and vented bowl; steam in the microwave for 5 minutes.
Rub salmon with olive oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, dill weed, salt, and black pepper; place in a foil oven bag. Toss spinach, capers, red onion, and asparagus with salt, black pepper, and 1 tablespoon lemon juice in the foil oven bag. Place vegetables on top of salmon.  Fold foil bag closed and place in a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 30 minutes. Carefully split bag open with a knife to release steam.

Description: 
An easy, elegant dinner that's fun to make. The salmon is delicately infused with the flavor of the vegetables. If you like your asparagus more al dente, just skip the pre-steaming step.
