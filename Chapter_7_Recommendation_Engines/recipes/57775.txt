Ingredients:
1/2 pound venison tenderloin
3 tablespoons zesty Italian dressing
12 slices bacon
1/4 cup cream cheese
12 slices pickled jalapeno peppers
1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt to taste

Directions:
Cut the venison tenderloin into 12 strips lengthwise.  Toss with Italian dressing, and allow to marinate for 1 hour in the refrigerator.
Preheat a grill for medium heat.
To assemble the venison wraps, lay a strip of venison on top of a strip of bacon.  Place a teaspoon of cream cheese at one end, and top with a slice of jalapeno.  Roll up and secure with a skewer.  Repeat with remaining ingredients. Season the wraps with desired amount of seasoning salt.
Grill for 10 minutes, then turn over, and continue cooking until the bacon is crisp.
