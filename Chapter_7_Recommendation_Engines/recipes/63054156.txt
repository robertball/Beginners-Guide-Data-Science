Ingredients:
-a little over 2 pounds of boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs
-3 or so spoonfuls of mayonnaise (you can eyeball it-not too much mayonnaise)
-a few squirts of lime juice
-slivered almonds (eyeball it-to your liking)
-chopped celery-about a cup
-chopped red onion-about a cup
-a teaspoon or so garlic powder
-a teaspoon or so cumin
-a teaspoon or so chile powder
-kosher salt and ground pepper to taste
-poultry seasoning
-a bit of chicken broth (optional if you want to add moistness)
-2 or so tablespoons of olive oil
-about 1 tablespoon or more of chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Cut the boneless skinless chicken breast or thighs into small, bite-sized pieces.  Heat olive oil in a large skillet and add cut chicken.  Season chicken with salt and pepper, a bit of garlic powder and a bit of poultry seasoning.  Sautee chicken until it is cooked through (no longer pink).  Once done remove chicken from skillet and put into a large mixing bowl.  Add the chopped celery, red onion, and slivered almonds.  Toss in mayonnaise, lime juice, garlic powder, cumin, chile powder, salt and pepper, and cilantro.  Adjust seasonings to your own taste.  If the chicken is still too dry either add more mayonnaise or chicken broth will do the trick.  Cover and chill for about an hour.  Serve chilled.
