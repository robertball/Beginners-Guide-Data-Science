Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin cut into 1-inch thick slices
1 garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1 tablespoon butter or stick margarine
2 tablespoons sugar-free maple syrup

Directions:
Flatten meat to 1/2-in. thickness. In a resealable plastic bag, combine the garlic, marjoram, thyme, salt and onion powder. Add meat, a slice at a time; shake to coat evenly. In a nonstick skillet, cook meat in butter over medium heat for 2-3 minutes on each side or until meat is no longer pink. Drain and discard pan juices. Add syrup to meat in skillet. Cook over medium-high heat, turning several times, for about 3 minutes or until syrup is absorbed. Serve immediately.
