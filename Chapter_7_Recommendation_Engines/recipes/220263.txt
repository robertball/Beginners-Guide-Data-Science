Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 pinch salt
4 slices Canadian bacon, cut into 1/2-inch dice
3 tablespoons grated onion
1 clove garlic, pressed
4 eggs
3/4 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup biscuit baking mix (such as BisquickÂ®)
3 tablespoons butter, softened
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 dash hot pepper sauce
1 prepared 9-inch single pie crust
1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir asparagus until tender, about 10 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt.
Stir Canadian bacon, grated onion, and garlic into the asparagus; cook and stir until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat, cover, and set aside.
Whisk eggs, cream, biscuit mix, butter, Parmesan cheese, Dijon mustard, 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and hot sauce together in a bowl.
Place the pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish; spread asparagus mixture into the crust.
Spread Colby-Monterey Jack cheese over the asparagus mixture in an even layer, and pour the egg mixture slowly over the quiche.
Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is lightly puffed and browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
