Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package tri-color rotini pasta
2 tomatoes, seeded and diced
2 cucumbers - peeled, seeded, and diced
1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives
1/2 cup Italian dressing, or more to taste
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 avocado, diced
1 squeeze lemon juice

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and let cool, 10 to 15 minutes.
Mix rotini pasta, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, Italian dressing, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Chill until flavors combine, about 1 hour.
Toss avocado with lemon juice in a bowl. Mix into the pasta salad before serving.
