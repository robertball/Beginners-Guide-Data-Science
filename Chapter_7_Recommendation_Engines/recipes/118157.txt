Ingredients:
8 large baking potatoes
6 tablespoons butter or margarine
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
3 1/2 cups milk
12 ounces process cheese (eg. Velveeta), cubed
1/3 cup crumbled cooked bacon
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup sliced green onions

Directions:
Scrub and pierce potatoes; place on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high for 15-20 minutes or until tender. Cool slightly.
In a saucepan, melt the butter. Stir in flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper until smooth; gradually whisk in milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Add the process cheese and bacon; stir until cheese is melted. Remove from heat; set aside.
Cut the potatoes into 1/4-in. slices. Place a third of the slices in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; top with a third of the cheese sauce. Repeat layers twice. Sprinkle with cheddar cheese and onions. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes or until cheese is melted.

Description: 
I wanted a different side dish one night, so I dressed up my usual scalloped potatoes with bacon, green onion and extra cheese. Microwaving speeds things up, but you can save even more time by preparing it a day early.
