Ingredients:
1/4 cup finely minced onion
3 ripe Haas avocados
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (or lemon juice)
1 large Plum or Roma tomato, deseeded and diced
1/4 cup cilantro leaves and tender stems, chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1 to 2 teaspoons minced jalapeño or Serrano pepper, optional

Directions:
Add diced onion to a small bowl then cover with warm water, set aside. This “de-flames” the onions, making them less intense.
Cut avocados in half, lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop out the seed. Scoop out the flesh and add to a bowl.
Add lime juice then use a fork to gently mash until creamy, but still chunky. Stir in the tomato, cilantro, cumin, de-flamed onions, salt and diced peppers (if using). Taste the guacamole and adjust with additional salt, peppers, or lime juice.
Serve immediately or cover with plastic wrap by pushing the plastic wrap down onto the guacamole and refrigerate up to one day.
