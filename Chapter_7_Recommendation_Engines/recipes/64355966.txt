Ingredients:
1-1/2 tbsp olive oil
6 cloves of garlic, minced
1 medium onion, diced
16 oz mild italian sausage
16 oz ground turkey
3 cans (14.5oz) tomato sauce (adjusted from previous 2 cans)
1 can diced tomatoes, drained
2 tbsp italian seasoning
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
16oz Rigatoni (Barilla brand)
24oz shredded Mozzarella cheese
15 oz tub of light Ricotta cheese
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
2 -1/2 tsp fresh or freeze dried parsley
2 eggs

Directions:
1. Heat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add onions and saut√© until softened, 3 to 4 min. Add the ground sausage and ground turkey and cook until browned. Drain most of fat leaving a little for flavor and moisture. Add the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, garlic, italian seasoning, oregano, red pepper flakes and salt and pepper to taste. Stir, bring to a simmer and cook for 30 min, stirring occasionally. Remove 3-4 cups of meat sauce to a bowl to cool down.
2. Preheat oven to 375.
3. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook the ziti until al dente. Drain and put into a ice bath to keep from over cooking.
4. In a large bowl, mix 2 cups of mozzarella, the ricotta, Parmesan, 2 tsp parsley, eggs and some salt and pepper. Stir together a few times (don't mix it completely)
5. Drain and pour cooked pasta into cheese mixture and toss to slightly combine.  Add the 3-4 cups of cooled meat sauce mixture and stir to combine.
6. Grease a large casserole dish with butter. Add half the coated pasta. Spoon half remaining sauce over the top, then top with half the remaining mozzarella. Repeat one more time. Sprinkle 1/2 tsp of parsley over top for presentation.
7. Bake in preheated oven until bubbling, about 25 min. Let stand 5 min before serving.
