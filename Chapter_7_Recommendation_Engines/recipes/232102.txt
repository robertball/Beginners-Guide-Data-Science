Ingredients:
1 (32 ounce) container chicken broth
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed, or more as needed
1 onion, chopped
1/2 (16 ounce) package baby carrots
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 bay leaf
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 1/4 cups baking mix (such as Bisquick Â®)
2/3 cup milk

Directions:
Combine chicken broth, chicken breast cubes, onion, carrots, celery, bay leaf, salt, and pepper in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover pot, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the vegetables are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
Mix baking mix and milk in a bowl until dough is sticky; drop golf ball-sized pieces of dough into the soup. Cover pot and cook until dumplings are cooked through, about 10 minutes.
