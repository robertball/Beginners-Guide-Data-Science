Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
2 andouille sausage links, finely diced
1 poblano chile, finely diced
1/2 red bell pepper, finely diced
1/2 large red onion, finely diced
1/2 cup frozen corn kernels
4 flour tortillas
2 cups shredded Colby cheese
1 tablespoon canola oil
1/4 cup sour cream (optional)
1/4 cup salsa (optional)

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the diced sausage, poblano pepper, red pepper, red onion, and corn. Cook until soft, about 15 minutes.
Spoon 1/4 of the sausage mixture on one half of each tortilla; top each with 1/2 cup cheese. Fold over tortillas to make a half moon shapes. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of canola oil in large skillet over medium heat. Cook quesadillas until the cheese is melted and the tortilla is brown and crispy, about 5 minutes per side. Cut each quesadilla into 4 wedges, and top with sour cream and salsa, if desired.

Description: 
These quesadillas are unique and filling - with a bit of a kick! If you have any leftover filling, scramble with some eggs for a Tex-Mex breakfast.
