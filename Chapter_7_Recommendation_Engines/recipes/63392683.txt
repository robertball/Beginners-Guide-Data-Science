Ingredients:
1 cup milk
1 egg, slightly beaten
1/4 cup melted butter
2 cups flour (whole wheat is best or you can use a mixture all purpose/whole wheat, you can substitute 1 cup flour for 1/2 cup flax seed meal, and 1/2 cup unprocessed wheat bran for a healthier version.)
1 tbsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup peanut butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease muffin tins.
Blend milk into egg and add butter.
Mix dry ingredients thoroughly. Mix in peanut butter only until mixture becomes crumbly.
Add liquid and stir slightly, leaving better lumpy. Do not over mix.
Half film muffins tins with batter and bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown. Yield: 12 muffins.
