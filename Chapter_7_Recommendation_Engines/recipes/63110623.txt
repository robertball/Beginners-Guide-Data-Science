Description: 
These tacos are really simple, since you cook them in a crock pot and the filling is healthy. Put them in a soft corn tortilla and top with veggies, low fat cheese, and low fat sour cream to keep the fat and calories at their lowest. Any extra chicken is also wonderful served in a wrap or over rice.
