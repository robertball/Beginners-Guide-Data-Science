Ingredients:
~Sesame Dressing~
1/2 c corn syrup
3 T white distilled vinegar
2 T pineapple juice
4 t granulated sugar
1 T light brown sugar
1 T rice wine vinegar
1 T soy sauce
1 t sesame oil
1/4 t ground mustard
1/4 t ground ginger
1/8 t salt
1/8 t paprika
dash garlic powder
dash ground black pepper
1/2 c vegetable oil
1/2 t sesame seeds
4 chicken breast fillets
1 large head iceberg lettuce, chopped
4 c red leaf lettuce, chopped
1-1/3 c canned mandarin orange wedges
1 c rice noodles
1 c roasted sliced almonds

Directions:
Prepare dressing by combining all dressing ingredients except
vegetable oil and sesame seeds in a blender on high speed. Slowly add
oil to mixture (to create an emulsion). Add sesame seeds and blend
for just a couple seconds. Pour dressing into a covered container
(such as a dressing cruet) and chill until needed.
Rub each chicken breast fillet with oil, then lightly salt and pepper
each piece. Grill on medium/high heat until done. Chill chicken
breasts in refrigerator until cold.
When chicken is cold, build each salad by first arranging about 4
cups of iceberg lettuce in the bottom of a large salad bowl or on a
plate.
Arrange a cup of red leaf lettuce on the iceberg lettuce.
Dice each chicken breast into bite-size pieces and sprinkle the
pieces from each one over each salad.
Arrange about 1/3 cup of mandarin orange wedges on each salad.
Next, sprinkle about 1/4 cup of rice noodles and 1/4 cup of roasted
sliced almonds on top of each salad.
Add desired amount of sesame dressing and serve. Makes 4 large
salads.
