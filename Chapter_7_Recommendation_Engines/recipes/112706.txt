Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 fresh poblano pepper, seeded and finely chopped
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1 teaspoon honey
3 tablespoons dark molasses
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup Marsala wine
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir the poblano pepper and onion for 6 to 8 minutes, until the onion is translucent.
Stir in the honey, molasses, brown sugar, tomato paste, vinegar, Marsala wine, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, smoke flavoring, salt and pepper, and whisk until smooth. Bring the sauce to a boil over medium-low heat, reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 35 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick.
Store refrigerated.

Description: 
This sauce began as a dare to top an ex-boyfriend's father's locally famous sauce. Something magical happens when it hits the grill! Don't forget to add to the ribs in the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking, or else the high sugar content will scorch. Don't let the strong smell of vinegar scare you while cooking; the flavor of the sauce after cooking does not reflect the scent that fills the kitchen while cooking.
