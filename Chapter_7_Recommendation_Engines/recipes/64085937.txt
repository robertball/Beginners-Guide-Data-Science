Ingredients:
1-2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
6 large eggs, room temperature
1 cup coconut milk full fat can
1/3 cup coconut sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup coconut flour
1 orange zest
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
Brush coconut oil in your baking dish.  I used a loaf pan.
In a large mixing bowl whisk eggs then add in coconut milk, sugar and vanilla until combined well.
Add in remaining ingredients and continue whisking.
Pour into your prepared loaf pan and bake for 45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.
Let cool then remove from pan and slice and cube.

As a true Italian we love warm desserts. My Paleo Blueberry Bread Pudding brings back so many great memories with my Nana. We loved bread pudding by using day old bread but this family inspired recipe makes me feel good and I love sharing Paleo dessert recipes with you.
