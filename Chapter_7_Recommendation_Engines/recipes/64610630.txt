Ingredients:
1 whole chicken (based on the size of your slow cooker - a 1.3kg chicken should just about fit into a 3.5L slow cooker - while a 6.5L would probably fit a 2kg chicken)
4 lemons
10 garlic cloves divided (8 whole and 2 halved)
4 sprigs rosemary
Salt
Pepper

Directions:
1.  After removing any giblets from the cavity of the chicken, (you'll sometimes find these packed in a small bag), place one sprig of rosemary, 1 lemon (quartered) and 4 cloves garlic inside the chicken, then rub all over with salt and pepper.
2.  Remove both ends of a lemon and cut in half to create 2 thick slices, then repeat with the other lemons and place 4 of the slices on the base of your slow cooker, with 4 garlic cloves and a sprig of rosemary in the space between the slices.
3.  Place the prepared chicken on top of the lemon, rosemary, and garlic and garnish with the remaining halved garlic cloves, 1 - 2 more sprigs of rosemary and the two remaining lemon slices.
4.  Put the lid on the slow cooker, set to cook on high for 4 hours, before placing the cooked chicken under the grill (broiler) to crisp the skin if you like it that way.
5.  Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before carving and serving, while you strain off the leftover lemon and chicken fat juices in the slow cooker to serve sparingly as a strongly flavored sauce.
