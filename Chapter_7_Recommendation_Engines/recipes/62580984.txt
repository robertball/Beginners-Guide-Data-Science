Title:
Petite Carmel Pecan Rolls Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/4 cup margarine or butter, softened
2 Tbsp light corn syrup
8 oz can Pillsbury Refrigerated Crescent Rolls
2 Tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 cup finely chopped pecans (plus extra)

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees.  In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, margarine, and corn syrup; blend well (personally, I do this right in the pan and skip the bowl).  Spread in the bottom of ungreased 8" or 9" round cake pan.
Separate dough into 4 rectangles; firmly press perforations to seal.  In small bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle mixture evenly over each rectangle.  Sprinkle 1 Tbsp of the pecans on each rectangle.  Starting at shorter side, roll up each rectangle; seal edges.  Cut each roll into 4 slices.  Place cut-side down in brown sugar mixture.  Bake at 375 degrees for 20-27 mins.  Cool 1 minute, and invert onto serving platter or foil.

Description: 
LOVE this recipe -- use it often for Christmas brunch, or just because.  Small enough to give you a satisfying taste but not the size of a car to make you feel like you've eaten a meal with one roll.  Thank you Pillsbury!!
