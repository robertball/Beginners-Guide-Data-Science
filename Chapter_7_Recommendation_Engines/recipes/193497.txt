Ingredients:
2 cups broccoli florets
2 tablespoons butter
salt and pepper to taste
1 (5 ounce) can tuna packed in oil, drained
1 tablespoon teriyaki sauce
1 pinch garlic powder

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan, and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli and steam until just tender, 2 to 6 minutes depending on the size of the broccoli florets. Remove the broccoli to a serving bowl and toss with butter, add salt and pepper to taste.
Heat the tuna, teriyaki sauce, and garlic powder in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until the tuna has heated through, about 5 minutes. Pour the tuna over the broccoli and serve.

Description: 
This was something experimental that I came up with the other night because I was hungry and had a can of tuna leftover from lunch. This is something that you can also experiment with and tweak it to fit your personal tastes, it's great when you're in a time crunch.
