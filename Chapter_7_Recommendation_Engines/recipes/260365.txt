Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup diced onion
1/2 cup diced celery
1 pinch salt
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (32 ounce) container chicken broth
1 (28 ounce) can crushed San Marzano tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons unsweetened shredded coconut
1/2 (1 gram) packet sugar substitute
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil leaves

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, celery, garlic, and 1 pinch salt; cook and stir until onion is softened, 5 to 8 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Pour chicken broth and crushed tomatoes into the pot with the onion mixture. Increase heat and bring to a simmer. Stir in paprika, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. Reduce heat to low; add shredded coconut. Simmer until vegetables are tender and soup is thickened, 35 to 45 minutes. Add sugar substitute.
Remove soup from heat and blend in the pot using an immersion blender until smooth. Whisk in 1/2 cup heavy cream. Top each serving of soup with the remaining heavy cream and 1 teaspoon basil.

Description: 
I absolutely love tomato bisque soup; it is one of my favorites! But I needed it to be keto friendly! So here is my version. I based this soup on the original recipe and video from Chef John called 'How to Make Tomato Bisque.'
