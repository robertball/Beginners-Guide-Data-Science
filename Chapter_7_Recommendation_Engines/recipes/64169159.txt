Ingredients:
4 boneless pork loin chops, cut 1/4 inch thick
4 (7 inch) French bread baguettes, split lengthwise
4 teaspoons mayonnaise, or to taste
(some use potted meat to mix into the mayo)
1 ounce chile sauce with garlic
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
1 small red onion, sliced into rings
1 medium cucumber, peeled and sliced lengthwise
1 carrot, grated
(rice vinegar and sugar to marinate the onion, cucumber and carrot, for a few minutes)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
yellow pepper slices or jalapeno peppers
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler. Place the pork chops on a broiling pan and set under the broiler. Cook for about 5 minutes, turning once, or until browned on each side. (I think I would use pork that was shredded)
Open the French rolls and spread mayonnaise on the insides. Place one of the cooked pork chops into each roll. Spread chile sauce directly on the meat. Sprinkle with a little lime juice and top with slices of onion, cucumber, carrots, yellow peppers, cilantro, salt and pepper. Finish with another quick drizzle of lime juice.
