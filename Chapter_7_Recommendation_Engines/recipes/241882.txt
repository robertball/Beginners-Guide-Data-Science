Ingredients:
5 cups water
2 teaspoons salt
1 (12 ounce) fresh salmon fillet
8 ounces smoked salmon, chopped
1/3 cup chopped green onion
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon, or to taste
7 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan and add salt. Add salmon fillet, reduce to a simmer, and cook until just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer salmon to a plate using a slotted spoon and let cool 10 minutes. Flake salmon into a large bowl, discarding skin, and toss with smoked salmon, green onion, parsley, and tarragon.
Whisk together butter, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, and pepper in a bowl until smooth. Add mayonnaise mixture to salmon mixture and gently stir until well combined.
Cover and chill 3 hours. Serve with toasted baguette slices or crackers.
