Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves
1 can cream of mushroom soup
1 can cream of chicken soup
1 envelope dry onion soup mix
1 cup instant rice (either brown or white)

Directions:
Combine all 3 soups in a medium bowl.  Remove about 1 cup of mixture to use later.
Add rice to soup mixture.  Spread into the bottom of a 9 x 13" pan.  (My mom always lines the pan with aluminum foil for easy clean-up.)
Put chicken breasts on top of rice mixture.  Spoon reserved soup mixture over chicken.
Cover with foil and bake for 2.5 hours at 250 degrees.
