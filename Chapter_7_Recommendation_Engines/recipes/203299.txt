Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cooked yellow rice
1 serving cooking spray
8 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1/4 cup prepared yellow mustard
1/4 cup sour cream
1/3 cup honey
1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
1/2 cup diced green bell pepper
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup corn kernels
2 cups shredded cooked chicken
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Prepare yellow rice as directed on package; reserve 1 1/2 cups. Refrigerate any remaining rice for another use.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Line bottom of baking dish with 4 tortillas. To make the honey sauce, whisk together the mustard, sour cream, and 1/3 cup honey in a small bowl. Combine the red pepper, green pepper, garbanzo beans, black beans, and corn in a large bowl. Scoop out 1/2 cup of the bean mixture and reserve for topping.
Stir the chicken, 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese, 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese, cumin, yellow rice, and honey sauce into the bean mixture. Mix well. Pour mixture into the baking dish. Top with 4 tortillas; sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese, 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese, and the reserved 1/2 cup bean mixture.
Bake in preheated oven until hot and bubbly, 30 to 45 minutes. Cover with aluminum foil if top browns excessively. Remove from oven, drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of honey.

Description: 
I have been trying for years to duplicate my favorite burrito from my favorite south Florida Mexican restaurant.  I started making it in casserole form and was pretty happy with this one, a combination of beans with a sweet and creamy sauce.  I have many variations of this, but this is the basic idea behind it. Serve with a side of chopped lettuce and tomatoes.
