Ingredients:
3/4 cup raisins
2 cups gluten free bread flour
1/2 cup buckwheat flour
1/4 cup coconut sugar
1 tbsp ground cinnamon
Pinch cream of tartar
Pinch baking soda
1/2 cup gluten free sourdough starter
3/4 cup whole milk, at room temperature
1 tsp agave
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
In a bowl, add the raisins and cover with lukewarm water. Set aside.
Line a loaf pan with parchment paper. Whisk together the flours, sugar, cinnamon , cream of tartar, and baking soda.
In a mixing bowl of a stand mixer, add the starter, agave, and milk. Start the mixer on low, add the dry mixture little by little and mix until combined. Add the eggs and vanilla. Mix until incorporated. Drain the raisins and fold them into the batter.
Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Smooth out the top using a wet rubber scraper. Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap and keep the oven with the light on until almost doubled in size. About 2 hours.
Cover with foil. Return to oven. Turn on oven to 350°F . Bake about 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until browned and has reached an internal temperature of 200° about 10 minutes more.
Allow to cool five minutes in the pan. Remove and allow to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing. This bread is delicious toasted.

Description: 
Cinnamon raisin bread made with gluten free sourdough starter discard instead of commercial yeast. I made this recipe during the Covid-19 lockdown when yeast had disappeared from the supermarkets. This light and fluffy loaf is very easy to make because there is no kneading as it is more of a batter than a dough.
