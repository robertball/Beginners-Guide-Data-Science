Description: 
My fiance loves chicken salad, but it's not for me, so i always end up throwing out extra servings that other recipes make. So, I made a single serving one day and am sharing my recipe so you don't have to waste extra servings either! If you like your chicken salad crunchy, add some cashews! Serve as a sandwich or on top of lettuce!
