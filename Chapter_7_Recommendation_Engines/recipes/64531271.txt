Tip:  double-line the outside of springform pan with heavy aluminum foil.  Then place in hot tap water bath (about 1 inch) in oven to bake.
Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 65 minutes.  Turn off oven, and let cheesecake cool in oven for one hour, to prevent cracking.  Chill in oven overnight.
For topping, mix sugar and cornstarch in a medium saucepan.  Add water and bring to a boil.  Add FROZEN berries and boil for 5 minutes, occasionally giving a gentle stir, until thick.  Place in refrigerator to cool.
