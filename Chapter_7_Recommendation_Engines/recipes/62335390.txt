Ingredients:
10 crimini mushrooms washed and quartered
½ pound baby spinach washed-partially drained.
1 baby Bok Choy
1 package pre-cooked Chow Mein noodles (or cook uncooked noodles according to package directions.)
4. tbs. Canola oil
½ can chicken broth
2 tsp flour
2 tsp Soy Sauce (season to taste).
½ pound package of Dover Sole Fillets (you can substitute another light fish)

Directions:
Wash the spinach and place in a non-stick pot along with 2 tablespoons cooking oil (I use canola oil).
There should be a little remaining water with the spinach having been cleaned. If not add a little water.
Then pour in ½ can Swansons broth. Once the spinach is cooking clean and cut the mushrooms and place in the pot.
Then clean and put in the Bok Choy with the leaves seperated. Add 1 tsp. of soy sauce.
While the vegetables are cooking cook the Dover Sole Fillets in a frying pan with 2 tablespoons cooking oil.When done the Sole should look white and it cooks quickly on high. Once the sole is cooked place it in the vegetable pan.
Next add the noodles along with 2 tsp flour. If you are unable to find pre-cooked noodles you will need to cook them according to the package directions.
Add 1 tsp of Soy Sauce.
Allow the pot to simmer for about 10 minutes and then serve. All the vegetables should be soft and the leafy greens wilted. If not cook a while longer.
