Ingredients:
•2 pounds chicken thighs and drumsticks
•a mix of vegetables (like onions, garlic, carrots, celery, potatoes and/or broccoli)
•olive oil
•1-2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
•salt and pepper, to taste
•fresh parsley, chopped
•dried herbs (thyme, rosemary, oregano)

Directions:
Heat the oven to 425°F.
Wash and prep your preferred vegetables and cut into bite-sized pieces. Make a bed for the chicken pieces by arranging the vegetables on the bottom of a baking dish. Sprinkle with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper and herbs.
Rub the chicken drumsticks and thighs with olive oil. Sprinkle the chicken pieces generously with salt and pepper and place on top of vegetables.
Bake for an hour or until chicken is done. Let the chicken pieces rest on a serving platter. Mix vegetables in the baking dish and roast 5-10 minutes longer if needed. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley.

Description: 
This roast chicken dish is a staple and was one of Wishful Chef’s most popular recipes of 2012.

Chop veggies into rustic bite-size pieces and added olive oil, balsamic vinegar, herbs and spices, then top with herbed chicken pieces. Can use chicken drumsticks and thighs but most other parts should work as well.
