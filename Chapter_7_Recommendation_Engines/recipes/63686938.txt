Ingredients:
Base:
1 cup flour
2 tbsp. icing sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/3 cup (approx.) seedless raspberry jam
Middle:
1/2 cup butter
2/3 cups sugar
2 eggs
2/3 cup rice flour
10 drops (or more)red food colouring
Icing:
1/3 cup butter
2 cups (approx.) icing sugar
1-2 tbsp. milk
1 tsp. maple extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Line an 8" square pan with parchment paper making sure to crease the corners well.
To make the shortbread base, combine flour, icing sugar and butter until crumbly texture forms. Spread in prepared 8" pan and gently pat down evenly. Bake for 20 minutes.
When cooled cover base with thin layer of raspberry jam.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
For the middle section blend butter and sugar together thoroughly. Beat in eggs until light, fluffy and pale yellow. Mix in rice flour and stir well. Add red food colouring until desired colour is reached. Pour over jam making sure batter is spread evenly. Bake for 30-35 minutes.
For icing combine butter and icing sugar. Add maple flavouring (more may be added if desired but it will turn the icing a light shade of brown). Ice the top of the squares when cooled.
Using parchment paper edges, lift the squares out of the pan and place on a cutting board. Carefully slice 1 inch sections across and down creating 64 bite size squares. Voila! When cut it will reveal the white base, red middle and white top. O'Canada!
