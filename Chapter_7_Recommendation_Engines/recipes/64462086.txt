Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
2 large zucchini, ends trimmed
1/2 cup bread crumbs
2 tsp jarred minced garlic
1/3 cup green or sweet white onion, chopped
1/2 cup finely chopped fresh mushrooms
1 (32 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook and stir the ground beef, onion and mushrooms in a skillet over medium heat until the meat is browned, breaking the beef up into crumbles as it cooks, about 10 minutes. Drain off excess fat,add garlic and cook 3 minutes more. Transfer the beef into a mixing bowl.
Slice the zucchinis in half the long way  and then slice each piece crosswise to make 8 boats.  Use a spoon to scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/2-inch thick shell all around the zucchini.
Chop the scooped-out zucchini flesh, and add to mixing bowl. Stir in the bread crumbs, spaghetti sauce and Parmesan cheese; mix the stuffing well.
Lightly stuff the eight zucchini with the meat mixture. Place the stuffed zucchini boats on a foil lined baking sheet after spraying the foil with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over each zucchini boats and bake an additional 10 minutes or until mozzarella cheese is browned and bubbling. Freeze any remaining meat mixture for future use.
