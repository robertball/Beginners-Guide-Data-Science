While rice is cooking, grind peanuts in a blender and set aside. Heat the margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the white part of the green onions; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned golden brown about 10 minutes. Stir in ginger, carrots, and salt to taste. Reduce heat to low and cover to steam 5 minutes. Stir in peanut butter and peanuts. When rice is done, add it to skillet, add green onions and stir gently to combine with other ingredients.
