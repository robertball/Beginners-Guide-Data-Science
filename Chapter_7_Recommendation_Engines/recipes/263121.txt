Ingredients:
1 teaspoon adobo seasoning
4 (3 ounce) fillets mahi mahi
1 dash lime juice
1 medium tomato, diced
1/2 red onion, chopped
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 scallions, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons lime juice
cooking spray
8 (6 inch) corn tortillas
1 avocado, sliced

Directions:
Season mahi mahi lightly with adobo seasoning and 1 dash of lime juice.
Mix tomato, red onion, cilantro, scallions, and 2 tablespoons lime juice together in a bowl for the pico de gallo.
Lightly spray a nonstick skillet with cooking spray; turn stove to medium-high heat. Cook mahi mahi until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Reduce heat to low; cook, covered, until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes.
Place corn tortillas between damp paper towels; microwave until heated through, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Place 1/2 of each mahi mahi fillet on a tortilla. Top each with 2 slices avocado and 1 scoop of pico de gallo.
