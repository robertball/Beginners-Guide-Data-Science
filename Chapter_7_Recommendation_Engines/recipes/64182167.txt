Ingredients:
1 head cabbage (I used red, but green works)
1 - 2 bell peppers
2 15 oz cans Mexican stewed tomatoes (the kind with jalepenos and cumin)
2 1/2 tbsp. chili powder
5 c vegetable broth
15 oz can tomato sauce
1 bay leaf
1/2 tbsp. oregano
1 tbsp. low sodium soy sauce or liquid aminos
1 tbsp. liquid smoke
a few shakes each garlic and onion powder
salt and pepper to taste
Toppings: tortilla strips, cheese, green onions, sour cream

Directions:
Slice the cabbage and peppers into half inch strips.
Combine all ingredients in a large slow cooker (except optional toppings). It's okay if not all of the cabbage is covered.
Cook on low for at least 6 hours, up to 10.
Serve with optional toppings.

Description: 
The way to my heart is through Mexican food, like I assume holds true for most people, right? This recipe doesn't have much to do with the recipe that ignited my love fire other than it has lots of cabbage and some Mexican spice. You open a few cans, sprinkle some seasonings, chop 2 ingredients, and walk away, and come back in a couple hours. Sour cream, cheese and tortilla chips make an excellent topping. Serve alongside a salad for a light dinner or serve as an appetizer for tacos or burritos!
