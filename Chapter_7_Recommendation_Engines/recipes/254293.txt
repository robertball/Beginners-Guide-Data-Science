Ingredients:
1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar, divided
1/3 cup sliced almonds
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons cold Parkay速 Original-stick
PAM速 Baking Spray
1 (15 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts
1 pound apples (such as Braeburn), cored, chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 tablespoons Reddi-wip速 Original Dairy Whipped Topping

Directions:
Stir together 6 tablespoons brown sugar, almonds, and flour in small bowl. Cut in Parkay with pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; refrigerate until ready to use.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 18 medium nonstick muffin cups with baking spray. Roll each pie crust into a 13-inch circle on floured work surface. Trim and discard edges to make two 10-1/2-inch square crusts. Cut each crust into 9 square pieces. Carefully press pieces into muffin cups; set aside.
Combine apples, remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla in large bowl. Spoon 1/4 cup apple mixture into each crust-lined muffin cup.
Bake 20 minutes. Top each with crumble mixture; bake 8 to 10 minutes more or until crumble browns. Cool in pan 5 minutes; carefully remove from muffin cups. Top each with Reddi-wip just before serving.
