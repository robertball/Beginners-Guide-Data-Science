Ingredients:
1 1/2 c. grated Cheddar, plus more for sprinkling
1/2 c. grated mozzarella
8 oz. cream cheese, softened
1 tbsp. Dijon mustard
2 tbsp. chopped chives, plus more for garnish
1 tsp. garlic powder
1/4 c. pale ale (we used Sierra Nevada)
1/4 tsp. Freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp. baking soda
1 can Pillsbury Grands biscuits
Egg wash, for brushing biscuits
Coarse salt, for sprinkling

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Make Beer Cheese Dip: In a large bowl, combine cheddar, mozzarella, cream cheese, Dijon, chives, garlic powder, beer, and black pepper.
Make Pretzels: In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups water and baking soda to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. Cut each biscuit in half and roll into a ball. Slice an X across the top. Drop into simmering water with baking soda and let cook 1 minute, then remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a cast-iron skillet, forming a ring along the inside edge.
Brush biscuits with egg wash and sprinkle with coarse salt.
Transfer cheese dip to the center of the skillet and smooth top.
Bake until biscuits are golden and dip is warmed through and bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes.
Garnish with chives.
