Ingredients:
1/2 c. UN-salted Butter, softened (1 stick)
3/4 c. + 1 T. Granulated Sugar
1 Large Egg
5 Egg yolks
2 t. Good quality Vanilla Extract
1 t. Butter Extract (I use Wilton)
1 small package (3.4 oz) Instant French Vanilla Pudding
3/4 c. Milk
1/4 c. Light Cream
1 3/4 c. Flour
2 1/2 t. Baking Powder
1/2 t. Salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350* degrees.
Cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
With the mixer on low speed, add the whole egg, then the yolks one at a time until mixed.
Add extracts, milk and cream. (Don't worry... if the mixture looks curdled -it's not).
Sift the flour, baking powder & salt.
Add these dry ingredients & Instant Pudding to the wet mixture slowly until incorporated. Beat on medium speed, for 1 minute or so, until smooth, scraping down the bowl in-between.
Pour immediately into cupcake cups - Filling each 1/2 to a -light 2/3 full (Do not overfill).
Bake for 20-25 min. until toothpick comes out clean.
~OR~ For a cake:
Fill 2 8" round prepared cake pans(greased & floured)and bake for 25 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.
Cool completely.
Frost with your favorite Icing & decorations.
* Unfrosted cupcakes/cake can be frozen for up to 1 month if wrapped very well.
