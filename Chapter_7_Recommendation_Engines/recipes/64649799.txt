Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups ground nuts
1/4 cup homemade yogurt or small amount of fruit juice (add last and adjust amount depending on batter consistency)
1/2 cup honey (more or less as desired)
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt (optional)
4 eggs (or pureed fruit)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Grind nuts in the blender and empty into a bowl.
Place eggs and honey into blender and mix thoroughly.
Add egg mixture to nuts and blend by hand or with electric beater.
Add yogurt as needed to bring to bread batter consistency.
Blend in baking soda and salt.
Spoon batter into a well-buttered 1 quart baking dish.
Bake for about 15-20 minutes or until the bread springs back when pushed. The bread may fall after is it removed from the oven, but this will not affect the taste.
