Ingredients:
1/2 lb french green lentils (can be substituted for brown lentils)
1 can of low sodium corn
1 can of dark red kidney beans
small bundle of italian parsley, chopped
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
3 Tbs raw sugar (can use white sugar if thats what you have on hand)
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Rinse and sort through lentils (no pre-soaking required).
Boil lentils for approx. 20 minutes or until tender.
While lentils are cooking combine corn, kidney beans, and parsley in a medium size bowl.
In a small bowl whisk together olive oil, vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper.  Please note the dressing is to my taste so I would suggest tasting as you go.
Once lentils are fully cooked drain and rinse them, combine them in the medium size bowl.  Pour dressing on top and combine.  Place in fridge and let it get nice and cold.
I have also substituted the vinegar for lime juice and the parsley for cilantro for a different flavor.  Just play with the ingredients this is a whatever you have in the pantry and fridge recipe!

Description: 
With the rising prices of meat and my pocket book getting smaller and smaller I have started to experiment with lentils and beans.  This is one of the recipes I created.  Its cheap, easy, flavorful, and packed full of protein.
