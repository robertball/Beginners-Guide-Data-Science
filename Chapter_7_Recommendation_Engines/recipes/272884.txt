Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups chicken stock, or as needed, divided
3/4 cup fat-free half-and-half
1 cup polenta
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 plum tomatoes, diced
1 large red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®), chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 pinch dried oregano, or to taste
1 pinch dried thyme, or to taste
1 teaspoon ancho chile powder, or to taste
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
12 ounces uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined

Directions:
Heat 2 cups chicken stock and half-and-half until nearly boiling. Add polenta and stir constantly until no clumps remain, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer until tender and thickened, 20 to 30 minutes. Add additional stock or water if polenta is too thick.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add tomatoes, bell pepper, onion, and garlic. Saute for 3 to 5 minutes. Add 1/2 cup chicken stock, oregano, thyme, and ancho chile powder. Simmer until vegetables reach desired texture, 3 to 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, stir Parmesan cheese into the polenta. Add shrimp to the vegetable mixture; cook until pink and heated through, 3 to 5 minutes more. Spoon polenta onto serving plates and top with shrimp mixture.
