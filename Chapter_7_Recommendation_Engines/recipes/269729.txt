Ingredients:
1 cup cavatelli pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 cup broccoli florets
1 large pinch kosher salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 pinch red pepper flakes
2 slices crispy cooked bacon, crumbled
2 tablespoons basil pesto

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cavatelli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium-high heat and drizzle with olive oil once hot. Add broccoli and season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cook until tender, 5 to 7 minutes; use a spatula to break any large florets into smaller pieces. Add additional oil if needed and continue cooking broccoli until lightly browned and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes more. Remove from heat.
Drain pasta and return it to the pot. Add crumbled bacon, then stir in cooked broccoli and pesto. Mix until evenly coated.
