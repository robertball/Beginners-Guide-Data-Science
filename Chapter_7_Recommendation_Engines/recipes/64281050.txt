Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 slices Swiss cheese
2 slices ham
1 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup Panko crumbs
1/4 teaspoon paprika
2 tablespoons butter
2 Tablespoons + 2 teaspoons Ginger Ale
1/4 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/3 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Pound chicken breasts if they are too thick. Place a cheese and ham slice on each breast within 1/2 inch of the edges. Fold the edges of the chicken over the filling, and secure with toothpicks. Mix the flour, Panko crumbs and paprika in a small bowl, and coat the chicken pieces.
Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the chicken until browned on all sides. Add the ginger ale and bouillon. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
Remove the toothpicks, and transfer the breasts to a warm platter. Blend the cornstarch with the cream in a small bowl, and whisk slowly into the skillet. Cook, stirring until thickened, and pour over the chicken. Serve warm with fresh asparagus spears baked potatoes.
