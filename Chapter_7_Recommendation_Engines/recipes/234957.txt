Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
2 red bell peppers, seeded and diced
1 bunch green onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
6 cups water, or as needed
2 (15 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, undrained
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups farfalle (bow tie) pasta
3/4 cup frozen corn
3/4 cup frozen peas
1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained

Directions:
Heat a Dutch oven or stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, red bell peppers, green onions, and garlic in the hot Dutch oven until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add water, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper to ground beef mixture; bring to a boil.
Stir farfalle pasta into ground beef-tomato mixture; cook for 10 minutes. Add corn, peas, and mushrooms to mixture and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until pasta is cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 5 more minutes.

Description: 
Fall finally made it to Southern Mississippi and I wanted a nice warm soup to enjoy after an evening of handing out Halloween candy. This is what I came up with, and we love it! Serve with crackers if desired.
