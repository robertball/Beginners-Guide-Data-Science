Ingredients:
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup sesame seeds
1/2 tsp dill weed
1/4 tsp salt
3/4 cup plain yogurt
1 pound tilapia or other whitefish fillets
1/4 cup canola oil
Lemon wedges, optional

Directions:
In a shallow bowl, combine the bread crumbs, sesame seeds, dill and salt. Place yogurt in another bowl. Dip fillets in yogurt; shake off excess, then dip in crumb mixture.
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet. Fry fillets over medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Serve with lemon if desired.

Description: 
These crispy fillets are a snap to make. I often will double the recipe just we will have leftovers for later in the week or for lunch.
