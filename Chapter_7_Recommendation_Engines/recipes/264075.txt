Ingredients:
1 whole trout - cleaned, rinsed, and patted dry
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 sprigs fresh parsley, or to taste
4 leaves fresh sage, or to taste
3 sprigs fresh dill, or to taste
1 lemon, thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Rub trout with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Rub the cavity of the trout with salt and stuff with parsley, sage, and dill. Make a few slits in the skin on the back of the trout and stuff with lemon slices. Place trout on a lined baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until flesh flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes. Cover with aluminum foil if top starts browning too quickly.
