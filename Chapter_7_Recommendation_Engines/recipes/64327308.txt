Ingredients:
1 Lavash bread (Joseph's) or whole wheat tortilla
1/2 cup shredded turkey, chicken, or ground beef
2-4 tablespoons taco seasonings
1 teaspoon each basil and parsley
1/4 cup of water
1 mozzerella babybel cheese
1 cheddar babybel cheese
1/4 cup black beans
1/4 cup brown rice
Handful of spinach or lettuce
Mild chunky salsa

Directions:
On a plate, lay out the lavash bread or tortilla.
Heat a small skillet over medium to high heat. Place the meat in the skillet and slowly stir or flip the meat. Wait for it to sizzle in the skillet then add water and taco seasonings. Once the water and seasoning is absorbed add the parsley and basil. Cook another minute or two then place on the lavash bread or tortilla.
Keeping the skillet on the same heat, put babybel cheeses inthe skillet. When it begins to melt a little, put rice and beans in with the cheese. Constantly stir until cheese is melted and all is well combined. Spread over the meat in the lavash bread or tortilla.
Spread the spinach over the rice and beans cheese mixture then spread salsa. Roll into a burrito with one side open. With the lavash bread, it may fall apart a little bit  it will hold together while it is being eaten.
