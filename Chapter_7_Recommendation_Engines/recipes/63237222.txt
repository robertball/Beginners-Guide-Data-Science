Ingredients:
2 whole boneless chicken breasts cut in half
1 Tbls. olive oil
1 cup chicken broth
a generous dash or two of your favorite hot sauce.  We use Cholula.
3 cloves garlic, minced
medium sprig fresh rosemary, remove leaves and chop a bit.
1 Tbls good dijon mustard
1/4 cup sunflower butter(we have food allergies) or Peanut Butter
fresh black pepper to taste
3 green onions chopped

Directions:
Put a pot of brown rice on to cook. It will need to serve 4. But cook extra to make Fried Rice tomorrow night!
In a non-stick frying pan heat olive oil on med. heat tipping pan around to coat bottom.  Add chicken pieces and saute until golden brown on both sides.  While chicken is cooking, heat the broth in a small pot over med/low heat.  Add minced garlic, dashes of hot sauce, rosemary(to taste), dijon and sunflower butter(or PB) and pepper. Whisk together gentle and add the chopped green onion and simmer for about 5 min.  Carefully pour over chicken breasts, cover and simmer for about 15-20 min.
Serve piping hot over rice. My sister doubles the sauce and pours over steamed broccoli and rice.
