Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups chopped yellow summer squash
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chile peppers, divided
2 teaspoons chili powder, divided
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Sauce:
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup milk
1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided
8 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1 1/2 cups chopped tomatoes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish lightly with cooking spray.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic until slightly softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add summer squash; cook and stir until almost tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in half of the green chile peppers, 1 teaspoon chili powder, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in remaining 1 teaspoon chili powder, flour, salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper; cook for 1 minute. Pour in milk and stir until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in 1 cup Monterey Jack cheese; add remaining green chile peppers.
Stir 1/2 cup sauce into the squash mixture. Spoon 1/3 cup of the squash and sauce mixture into the center of each tortilla; roll up.
Arrange filled tortillas in the baking dish. Cover with remaining sauce. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 25 minutes. Top with remaining 1/2 cup Monterey Jack cheese and tomatoes.

Description: 
These vegetarian enchiladas are easy to make, delicious, and very filling. They are also very accommodating to modifications. I frequently use zucchini or add mushrooms and other vegetables.
