Ingredients:
Meatballs (can be done ahead of time*)
1/2 pound ground beef, thawed
1/4 cup onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, peeled and minced
2 Tbsp grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 tsp salt
1 Tbsp plain bread crumbs
1/2 tsp dried basil
3/4 tsp dried parsley
1 egg
Soup
1 Tbsp butter
1/2 cup onion, chopped (roughly 1 small)
1/2 cup carrot, peeled and sliced into coins (roughly 2 carrots)
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
6-8 cups chicken broth
Salt and pepper for seasoning
1/2 cup acini di pepi (can use orzo)
10 ounces frozen spinach, thawed

Directions:
Make the meatballs: In a large bowl, mix together the beef, onion, garlic, cheese, salt, bread crumbs, basil, parsley, and egg until combined. Shape into tiny bite-sized meatballs, roughly 1/2 inch in diameter. Place onto cookie sheets (or plates) and refrigerate until ready to use*. Refrigerating will keep them from falling apart in the soup.
For the soup: In a large stock pot, melt the butter. Add the onion, carrots, and garlic and cook until tender but not too soft, about 5 minutes.
Add 6 cups of chicken broth and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to simmer, cover, and cook for 30 minutes. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed.
Drop in the meatballs and cook 7 minutes (longer if frozen*). Add acini di pepi and cook 5 minutes then add spinach. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. If you need more broth, add the remaining 1-2 cups.
Notes: * If you are not going to use the meatballs the same day you make them, cover them until you are ready. You can even freeze and drop them frozen into the soup. Just add a few more minutes to the cooking time.
