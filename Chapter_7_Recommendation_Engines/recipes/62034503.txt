Ingredients:
1 lb top or bottom round sirloin steak, cut into thin strips
1/2 cup worchestershire sauce
2 tbsp yellow mustard
Rice
1 tbsp olive oil
1/2 cup sweet onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed and chopped
1 tsp pepper

Directions:
Combine steak strips, worchestershire sauce and yellow mustard into a marinade bowl.  Stir, cover, and put into fridge for 1/2 hour.
Put rice onto boil.  Follow directions depending on which type of rice you use, so you end up with two full servings of rice.
Add olive oil to hot pan and add onions, garlic and pepper.  Saute over medium-high heat for 3 minutes, or until onions are slightly glassy-looking.
Add steak and sauce to pan.  Pan-fry until cooked thoroughly.
Serve over rice.

Description: 
This was made originally by an old housemate of mine.  When I moved, I took it with me.  It's a great, spicy favorite with me and my fiance.  Be careful, though!  It can get really spicy.
