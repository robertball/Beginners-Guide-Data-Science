1/8 teaspoon pepper
7 tablespoons fat-free sour cream
1/3 cup minced chives

Directions:
In a large saucepan or Dutch oven coated with nonstick cooking spray, saute onions until tender. Add potatoes and broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes or until potatoes are very tender. Set aside 1 cup potato mixture.
Puree remaining mixture in batches in a blender or food processor; return to the pan. Stir in the milk, Canadian bacon, butter-flavored granules, salt, pepper and reserved potato mixture. Heat through (do not boil). Garnish each serving with 1 tablespoon sour cream; sprinkle with chives.

Description: 
Canadian bacon adds a hint of smoky flavor to this hearty soup. It doesn't have the typical butter and heavy cream you'll find in many potato soups, but it's still rich and satisfying.
