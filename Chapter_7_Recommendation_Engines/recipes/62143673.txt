Ingredients:
2 lbs powdered sugar
1/2 cup salted butter, softened
1 1/2 cups Hi ratio shortening
2 tablespoons clear vanilla
1/3 cup water or milk

Directions:
In a large bowl cream together the butter and shortening until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and water. Add half of the powdered sugar and mix until creamy add remaining powdered sugar and mix on medium speed for about 5 minutes until fluffy. Keep bowl covered with plastic wrap when not in use. This is a crusting buttercream frosting. When exposed to air for 10 to 15 minutes it will start to crust. Frost the entire cake. To smooth run your cake knife under hot water and run it over the entire cake. Starting with the top and then the sides. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes and lay a printed paper towel on the cake starting with the top. Using the palm of your hand gently smooth across the paper towel moving the towel to make sure that you cover the entire cake. Next move on to the sides. If you want a smooth cake with no pattern use Viva brand paper towels.

This is the buttercream frosting that I use for all of my cakes. If you frost your cake and let it sit for 15 minutes you can imprint any pattern using a paper towel. Using the palm of your hand gently smooth across the paper towel. Remove the towel and enjoy!
