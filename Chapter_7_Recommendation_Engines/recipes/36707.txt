2 tablespoons chopped pitted kalamata olives
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Place potatoes in a saucepan; cover with water, and bring to a boil. Cook 20 minutes or until very tender. Add beans; cook 2 minutes or until beans are crisp-tender. Drain well.
Drain artichokes in a colander over a bowl, reserving 2 tablespoons marinade; chop artichokes. Add artichokes and olives to potato mixture.
Combine reserved 2 tablespoons marinade, vinegar, and the remaining ingredients. Drizzle dressing over salad, tossing to coat. Cover and chill.
