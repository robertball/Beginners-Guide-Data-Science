1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese (optional)
1 (16 ounce) container pico de gallo (optional)

Combine water, condensed chicken broth, beans, garlic, onion, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes into a large saucepan. Bring to a simmer; cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, until beans are soft, about 3 1/2 hours. You may need to add additional water to keep the beans from drying out.
