Description: 
A boxed crust mix and cooked chicken make this flavorful pizza a cinch to prepare. 'It bakes up fast and is a wonderful way to please pizza lovers,' says Autumn Ruhl of Montgomery, Michigan. TIP: 'We like a dark molasses-based barbecue sauce and sometimes use refrigerated dough instead of the boxed mix,' Autumn adds.
