Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 cup margarine
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup margarine
6 tablespoons milk
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (16 ounce) box confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 15 1/2x10 1/2-inch jelly roll pan.
Bring water, 1 cup margarine, and 1/4 cup cocoa powder to a boil in a large saucepan; remove from heat and stir in flour, white sugar, and salt. Beat eggs, sour cream, and baking soda in a bowl; stir into flour mixture until just blended. Pour batter into prepared jelly roll pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring 1/2 cup margarine, milk, 1/4 cup cocoa powder, and vanilla extract to a boil in another saucepan; remove from heat and stir in confectioner's sugar until icing is smooth. Spread icing over cake immediately after removing from oven. Allow cake to cool before cutting and serving.
