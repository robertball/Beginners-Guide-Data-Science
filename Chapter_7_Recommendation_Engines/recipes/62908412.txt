Description: 
This smooth and tangy taco sauce is a refreshing change from the traditional chunky tomato salsa.  It is easy to make and the spicy heat can be eliminated by omitting cayenne pepper, diced jalapenos and jalapeno juice.  Substitute lemon juice or vinegar.  This delicious sauce would go great with tacos, enchiladas, burritos, queso, carnitas or just with chips.  Enjoy!
