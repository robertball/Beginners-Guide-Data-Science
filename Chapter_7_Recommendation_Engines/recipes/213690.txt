Ingredients:
6 eggs
1 cup white sugar
1/3 cup orange juice
1/3 cup cocoa powder
1 cup matzo cake meal
1 (10 ounce) package frozen strawberries, thawed
1 (12 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 6x8-inch baking pans.
Beat the eggs in a bowl with a fork; beat in the sugar, orange juice, cocoa, and cake meal until thoroughly blended. Gently stir in the strawberries and chocolate chips; divide the batter between the 2 prepared baking pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center of a pan comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
