Ingredients:
2 C. Dry Slaw Mix, Packed
1 C. Carrots, Grated or Chopped
1 C. Pineapple, Diced Fresh or Canned in 100% Juice
3 Scallions, Sliced
1 Tbsp. Ginger Root, Grated
3 Tbsp. Rice Wine Vinegar
1 Tbsp. Sesame Oil
1 Tbsp. Reduced Sodium Soy Sauce
1/2 Lime, Juiced
1 Tsp. Sesame Seeds, Black and/or White (I used 1/2 tsp. of each color.)
1/8 Tsp. Red Pepper Flakes (Optional)

Directions:
Combine slaw mix, carrots, pineapple and scallions in a large bowl and set aside.
Whisk the remaining ingredients together in a small bowl and pour over the slaw veggies. Toss to coat.
Cover and set in the fridge for at least 30 minutes prior to eating. This allows the dressing to soak into the veggies a bit.
