Ingredients:
*1 cup glutinous rice
*1 14 oz can coconut milk
*4-5 chocolate tablea (a Filipinio chocolate tablet. Can use 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa + 1/8 tsp vanilla extract as substitute, or 1 Mexican tablea like Abuelita or Ibarra can be used), crushed
*brown sugar to taste
*Sweetened condensed, evaporated, or regular milk (optional)

Directions:
1. Soak rice for approx. 1 hour, then drain (Note: you don't have to soak the rice if you forgot to, but you may need to add some water and it will take longer to cook)
2. Add rice, coconut milk, sugar, and chocolate into small saucepan, bring to low boil.
3. Turn heat to low and cover, stirring occasionally until rice is soft. Add water as needed until rice is cooked through and a semi-thick oatmeal-like consistency is reached.
4. Place in bowl, add your choice of milk to the champorado (optional), and enjoy!

Description: 
Champorado is kind of like a chocolate oatmeal eaten in the Philippines for breakfast. A college roommate got me hooked on this dish, and now I can't imagine starting my Sunday mornings any other way.
