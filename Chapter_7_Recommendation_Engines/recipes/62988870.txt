Ingredients:
GRAVY INGREDIENTS:
3 cups cooking liquid from turkey pan (fat removed)
4 cups turkey stock from the neck, heart & gizzard
1/2 cup cooked onions from pan
*2-3 tbsp turkey fat skimmed from the drippings
*1 tbsp butter
*1/4 cup flour
Salt and Pepper to taste
1 tbsp chopped sage
******Double for thick gravy

Directions:
1. Prepare the stock for the turkey gravy. Take the package that comes in the turkey; Neck, heart & gizard but not the liver. Place in a stock pot with 6 cups of water & 1 bay leaf. Simmer for a couple of hours while the turkey is roasting. Reserve is turkey is still roasting.
2. For the last hour or so left of the turkey roasting, pull off the foil to allow it to brown.
2. Once turkey is done, pull it out of the oven & cover it in foil to allow it to rest. It will stay warm for at leat 40 minutes so take your time while making the gravy.
3. Pour off the juices from under the turkey & skim off the fat to make the rue.
4. Add fat drippings, butter, onions from the turkey & flour to a saute pan. Cook for 5 minutes. Onions will brown & deepen the color of the gravy & add sweetness to it.
**If you don't want to reduce your gravy, double the fat, butter & flour before proceeding.
5. Add drippings & stock. Bring to a boil & reduce to medium & let it simmer.
6. Skim off foam & fat if desired.
7. Add the secret ingredient: 1 tsp of Balsamic Vinegar. This will balance the sweetness & acidity. (Optional)
8. Reduce until it thickens & is the texture desired. (Usually about half for richness of flavor)OR DOUBLE THE RUE PRIOR TO THIS STAGE.
9. Add the salt & sage at the end. DO NOT SALT PRIOR TO THIS STAGE TO AVOID OVER SALTING.
10. Strain gravy or serve as-is country style.

Description: 
Gravy is the lifeblood of any real Thanksgiving feast. It will moisten the driest turkey and saturate the most solid stuffing. Lumpy mashed potatoes are no match for its slow-moving seduction. I like gravy, I like it a lot.
