Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups sugar
2 large eggs
1/2 cup applesauce
2 Tbsp canola oil
2 tsp vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tsp baking soda
2 tsp ground cinnamon
3/4 tsp salt
6 cups chopped peeled tart apples, 1/4" pieces
1/2 cup chopped pecans
FROSTING:
4 ounces Neufchatel cheese
2 Tbsp butter, softened
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°. Coat a 13" x 9" baking pan with cooking spray.
In a large bowl, beat sugar, eggs, applesauce, oil and vanilla until well blended. In another bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt; gradually beat into sugar mixture. Fold in apples and pecans.
Transfer to prepared pan. Bake 35-40 minutes or until top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool completely in pan on a wire rack.
In a small bowl, beat Neufchatel cheese, butter and vanilla until smooth. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar (mixture will be soft). Spread over cake. Refrigerate leftovers.
Note: Also very good served semi-warm with vanilla ice cream.

Description: 
I loved this wonderful cake warm from the oven when I was a kid.  Now in my kitchen, it's my turn to treat the kids. The spicy apple flavor combined with the sweet cream cheese frosting makes this dessert a treasured recipe.
