Description: 
I grew up eating cauliflower this way. In college, I included this in my menu for our school restaurant. Our chef did not want to allow me to serve it. Not only did we serve it, but almost every patron asked for the recipe! Chef even apologized to me after he tasted it! This is a great way to get kids to eat cauliflower (and grown-ups too)!
