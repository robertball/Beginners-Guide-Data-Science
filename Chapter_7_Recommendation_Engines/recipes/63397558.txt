Ingredients:
1 - 12 oz. can Evaporated milk (= 1-1/2 cups)
2-1/2 cups of chicken stock (not broth)
1/4 tsp white pepper
1/4 tsp rubbed sage
1/4 rounded tsp thyme
1 tsp dried parsley
1/3 C butter
1/4 C finely minced sweet or white onion
1 to 2 garlic cloves (minced or pasted)
2 tsp dried celery flakes (or 1 Tblsp chopped fresh celery leaves)
1/4 tsp Sea or Kosher salt
1 tsp minced fresh rosemary (optional)
1/3 cup A/P flour
1/4 tsp fresh ground black pepper
1/4 paprika (smoked if you have it)

Directions:
Combine milk, stock and next four ingredients in large measuring cup or a bowl. Set aside.
In a 2 qt saucepan over med/low heat, melt butter and saute the onion, garlic, celery, salt and optional rosemary (fresh not dried please) for 2 to 3 minutes until softened and fragrant.
Add paprika and black pepper to flour. Lower heat a bit and add seasoned flour to melted butter mix. While stirring, cook for a minute or 2 in order to remove raw flour taste and smooth out any lumps. It will be a paste-like consistency.
Using a whisk and on med/low heat; add the seasoned milk/stock liquid slowly while whisking until all liquid added. Crank the heat up to med/high and continue to whisk until mixture comes to a boil and thickens. Be patient, it will happen :)
If you prefer it thicker use 1 to 2 more tablespoons of butter and flour in step 2 and 3. Up to 1/2 cup of each for a more 'condensed' version. If you use more butter/flour for the roux you may want to increase your seasonings accordingly.
I recommend tasting before adding more salt or seasonings as chicken stock strength & salt content can vary.

Description: 
After looking around on here and not finding what I wanted - I was inspired to create my own version of this cream soup (or maybe it's a sauce?). I'd rather 'make it myself' as I detest canned cream of 'whatever' soups. Making a roux and using your own homemade chicken stock is best. Of course, use your own preferred seasonings as this was intended as a cooking guideline. I only listed the seasonings that I like and used - give it a try, maybe you'll like it this way too.
