Ingredients:
12 ounces dandelion flowers
water
1 1/2 cups raw cane sugar, or more to taste
1 lemon, juiced

Directions:
Pick dandelion petals off the stems. Wear gloves to avoid staining your hands. Measure 5 1/2 ounces of petals and discard the stems and leaves.
Transfer dandelion petals to a container and cover completely with water. Cover and steep in a cool, dark place, up to 24 hours.
Drain through a fine-mesh sieve into a saucepan, squeezing petals as dry as possible with your hands. Stir in sugar and lemon juice and bring to a boil over medium heat. Simmer uncovered until a thin syrup forms, about 45 minutes. Cool until syrup thickens slightly.
Pour into a bottle and place in the refrigerator.

Description: 
It has taken me years to perfect my dandelion syrup. Only use the yellow part of the dandelion blossoms, otherwise the syrup will taste bitter. I also try to use as little sugar as possible otherwise it only tastes sweet. It's a great honey substitute for vegans. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.
