Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
2/3 cup uncooked brown rice
1/2 pound ground turkey
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/3 cup chopped onion
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried celery flakes
1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/3 cup water
1 pinch salt, or to taste

Directions:
Bring 1 1/2 cup of water to a boil in a saucepan, and stir in the brown rice. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 40 to 50 minutes. Set the rice aside.
Place ground turkey into a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the turkey until the meat gives up some of its fat, 2 to 3 minutes; stir in green bell pepper, onion, and minced garlic. Cook and stir until the turkey is crumbly and no longer pink and the vegetables are tender, 5 to 8 more minutes. Drain excess grease, if necessary. Stir in the cooked brown rice, garlic powder, celery flakes, Cajun seasoning, black pepper, and 1/3 cup water.
Bring the mixture to a simmer, and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and additional black pepper, if desired.

Description: 
This is rice with a kick. It is best served with Cajun chicken or another Cajun dish. You will love how this complements your main dish; however, because this rice contains some meat, it can be eaten alone. Enjoy!
