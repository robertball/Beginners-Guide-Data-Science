Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups whole grain spelt flour
1 cup white spelt flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/8 teaspoon sea salt
2 eggs
1 cup buttermilk
2/3 cup whole cane sugar (such as Sucanat®)
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup extra-virgin coconut oil
1 lemon, zested and juiced, or to taste
1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
Whisk whole grain spelt flour, white spelt flour, baking soda, and sea salt together in a large bowl.
Whisk eggs in a separate bowl. Whisk in buttermilk, cane sugar, honey, coconut oil, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Pour into the flour mixture; mix thoroughly. Fold in blueberries gently. Fill muffin cups 3/4-full with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool in pan for 5 minutes; transfer muffins to a wire rack and continue cooling.
