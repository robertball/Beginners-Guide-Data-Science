Shelly's Italian Tomato Sauce Recipe

Ingredients:
2 (29oz) cans of Hunts Tomato Sauce
2 (6oz) cans of Hunts diced Basil, Garlic and Oregano tomatoes
½ large yellow onion (diced)
3 tbsp. of Italian Seasoning
2 tsp. Granulated Garlic
1 tsp. Onion Powder
1 (6oz) can of black olives (sliced) (optional)
1 package of button mushrooms (cleaned and sliced) (optional)
1 lb. of lean ground beef (browned) (optional)

Directions:
In a 5qt. crock-pot add all ingredients and slow-cook on high for 4 hours, or low for 6 hours.
The optional ingredients can all be added or you can just add the ones you like.  If I plan to use the sauce for vegetable lasagna or eggplant parmesan, I tend to omit the ground beef and mushrooms and just use the olives.
The key to this recipe is the slow cooking – it really diffuses the seasonings.  You won’t get as much flavor out of it if you cook it on the stove.
If you are a garlic lover, feel free to be more liberal with the granulated garlic!

Description: 
I never use store-bought sauce any more! This is such a versatile & tasty recipe that can be used as a spaghetti sauce or for many other Italian dishes calling for a tomato-based sauce.  It is very easy and can be frozen for later use.
