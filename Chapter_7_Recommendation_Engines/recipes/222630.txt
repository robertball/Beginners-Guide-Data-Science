Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup lemon juice
3/4 cup milk
2 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup cranberries, halved
1/3 cup toasted slivered almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups, or line with paper muffin liners.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Mix lemon juice and milk in a measuring cup, to sour milk; beat eggs, oil, and milk mixture in a bowl. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture until just moistened; fold in cranberries. Fill prepared muffin cups two-thirds full; sprinkle with almonds.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to wire rack.
