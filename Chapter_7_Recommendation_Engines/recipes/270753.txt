Ingredients:
3 large Yukon Gold potatoes, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
2 cups chicken stock, or more to taste
2 tablespoons salted butter, softened, or more to taste
1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
3 tablespoons cream cheese, softened (optional)

Directions:
Layer potatoes onto a steamer basket set inside a multi-functional electric pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Add chicken stock and secure the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 9 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Carefully remove sliced potatoes from the steamer basket; drain and reserve remaining stock.
Place butter and garlic in the empty pressure cooker; select Saute function. Cook and stir for 90 seconds. Return potatoes to the pot and mash with cream cheese.

Description: 
These potatoes are unlike any other!

 The difference with these is that they are pressure-cooked with homemade chicken stock, which gives the potatoes so much flavor, and sometimes eliminates the need for milk or cream and salt! 

I made this recipe just yesterday for someone who doesn't like mashed potatoes, and they loved it!
