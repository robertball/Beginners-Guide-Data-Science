Ingredients:
8 ounces uncooked rotini pasta
1 (10.75 ounce) can reduced fat cream of chicken soup
2 cups chopped frozen broccoli, thawed and drained
1 cup chopped cooked chicken
1/2 cup skim milk
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the rotini, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a bowl, mix soup, broccoli, chicken, and milk. Season with garlic powder and pepper. Transfer to a baking dish and top with Cheddar cheese.
Cover and bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove cover and continue baking 10 minutes, until bubbly.
