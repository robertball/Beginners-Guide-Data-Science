Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/2 cup beef broth
1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (4 pound) boneless beef chuck roast
3 tablespoons barbeque seasoning (such as Grill MatesÂ® Smokehouse Maple)
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 cups barbeque sauce
8 Kaiser rolls, split

Directions:
Spray the inside of a 6-quart oval slow cooker crock with cooking spray.
Mix beef broth and liquid smoke in a small bowl; pour into prepared crock.
Drizzle olive oil over the beef chuck roast. Rub barbeque seasoning over the roast and lie gently into the liquid in the slow cooker. Drizzle Worcestershire sauce over the roast.
Cook on Low until the meat pulls apart easily, 7 to 8 hours. Remove roast to a cutting board and shred into strands with a pair of forks.
Drain liquid from the slow cooker crock, reserving 1/2 cup and discarding remainder. Stir reserved liquid with barbeque sauce in a bowl.
Return shredded beef to the slow cooker. Drizzle barbeque sauce mixture over the meat and stir.
Cook on High until the liquid is bubbling, about 30 minutes. Spoon beef onto split Kaiser rolls.
