Ingredients:
3 c. cooked rice, cold
2-3 Tbsp. Extra virgin Olive Oil
1 med. onion, sliced
1/2 head of cabbage, sliced thin
2 carrots, shredded
2 c. fresh/frozen broccoli
2 boneless, skinless chicken breast
1/2 c. soy sauce
3 Tbsp. Sweet Chili sauce (found in the oriental foods isle)
1/2 c. Apricot preserves
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/4 to 1/2 tsp. Sesame Seed Oil (for flavoring)

Directions:
In large skillet over low heat, saute the onion, cabbage and carrots in 2 Tbsp. olive oil. About 15 minutes. I cover it with a lid.
While your veggies are sauteing, cut the chicken breasts into small chunks or strips (I use scissors).
In the skillet push everything to the outer edges so you can place your chicken in the center. Turn up the heat to medium. As chicken begins to cook, stir it around to combine with the veggies. Cook about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the broccoli, turn heat down a bit and cover with lid.
In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, apricot preserves, sweet chili sauce, garlic powder and Sesame Oil.
Add to skillet, cover and simmer on low heat about 8-10 minutes.
Remove skillet from heat, set aside.
In medium saucepan over medium heat,place about 1-2 Tbsp. oil.
Add in your cold rice and give it a quick stir-fry to warm it up.
Now you're ready to dish it out and top it with your chicken, veggies and sauce.
