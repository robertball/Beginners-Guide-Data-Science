Ingredients:
6 Tbsp heavy whipping cream,
1/4 cup (half stick) unsalted butter,
1 Tbsp instant coffee,
2 cups (12-oz package) semi-sweet chocolate chips,
1/4 cup cocoa powder

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, mix cream and butter over medium heat until butter is melted and cream is simmering.  Whisk in instant coffee until completely dissolved.
Slowly add chips, stirring constantly, until they're melted and the mixture is smooth.  Pour mixture into a silicone baking pan or a regular baking pan lined with parchment paper.
Cool in the fridge for 1-2 hours until firm.  Form mixture into 1-inch balls.  Roll each ball into cocoa powder or topping of your choice.
