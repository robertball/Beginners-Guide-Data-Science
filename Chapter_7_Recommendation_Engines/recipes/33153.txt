Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter, chilled
3/4 cup coconut milk
1/4 cup honey
1 egg, beaten
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
1 orange, zested

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix flour, baking powder, and salt. Cut in chilled butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
In a small bowl, mix coconut milk, honey, and egg. Stir into the flour mixture. Fold in pineapple and orange zest. Divide the mixture into 12 rounded pieces, and arrange in a single layer on a medium ungreased baking sheet.
Bake 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.
