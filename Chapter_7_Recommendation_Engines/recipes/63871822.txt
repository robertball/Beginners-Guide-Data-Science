Ingredients:
1/4 pound (1 stick) butter
1 cup diced onion
1 cup celery, strings removed and diced
3 cups carrot, peeled and diced
3 cups boneless chicken breast, cut into ½-inch dice
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1 quart chicken broth
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup (about) water
1 8-ounce package frozen peas
2 tablespoons parsley, minced
1 pint heavy cream
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion, celery and carrots, and cook until softened, 5 to 8 minutes. Add diced chicken, and cook, stirring, until meat is cooked through and beginning to brown slightly, another 10 minutes or so. Season with salt and pepper.
In a separate soup pot, bring the chicken broth to a boil. Add the broth to the chicken and vegetable mixture, and return to a boil. Reduce to a simmer.
In a bowl, mix together the cornstarch and enough water to form a pourable gravy-like paste. Add the cornstarch slurry to the simmering soup. Repeat with a second batch of cornstarch slurry if a thicker soup is desired.
Add the frozen peas and minced parsley, and stir. Add heavy cream and Parmesan cheese, stirring until cheese is melted. Let soup simmer slowly while you bake the biscuits according to package directions.
To serve, crumble one baked biscuit into a soup bowl, and ladle soup over
