Ingredients:
3 1/2 C all-purpose flour
2 Tbsp white sugar
2 Tbsp yeast
1/2 tsp salt
1 C warm milk
2 eggs, divided
5 C leftover meat and vegetables
2 Tbsp water
1/2 C cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
Add flour, sugar, yeast, and salt to mixer bowl.  Whisk to combine.  Add warm milk and one beaten egg, kneading to form dough.
Separate dough into 10 equal portions.  Roll each piece of dough into a rectangle, approximately 9"x3".  Spoon 1/2 C of leftovers onto one half of rectangle, being careful to leave a clearing of approximately 1/4" around edges.  Fold unused portion of dough rectangle over to encase filling.  Seal edges with fork tines.  Lightly prick the top of each pocket several times.  Place dough pockets on a greased baking sheet.  Repeat with each piece of dough.
In small bowl, whisk together remaining egg and water.  Brush lightly over the tops of the pockets.  Sprinkle with cheddar cheese.  Bake for 20-25 minutes until lightly browned.
