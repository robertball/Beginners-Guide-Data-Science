Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 white onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, pressed
1 1/2 cups frozen cut green beans
1 cup frozen peas
2 large zucchini, chopped
10 cups vegetable broth
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
2 cups cooked great Northern beans
3/4 cup ditalini pasta
1/2 cup minced fresh parsley
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Add green beans, peas, and zucchini; toss to coat vegetables with oil.
Slowly stream vegetable broth into vegetable mixture; bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir in rosemary and great Northern beans and bring back to a simmer, about 5 minutes. Add ditalini pasta and simmer soup until pasta is tender but firm to the bite and soup has thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in parsley.
Ladle soup into serving bowls and top each serving with 1 heaping tablespoon Parmesan cheese; season with salt and black pepper. Garnish soup with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.

Description: 
This is the classic and authentic Italian minestrone with a green twist. No tomatoes here! You may brown some pancetta or bacon in olive oil before proceeding with the recipe if you wish. I prefer to use a good quality vegetable bouillon to vegetable broth. The taste is more authentic and you simply need to skip the salt.
