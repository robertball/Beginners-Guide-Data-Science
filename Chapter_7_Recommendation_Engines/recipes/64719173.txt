4 Tbsp butter, divided
2 garlic cloves minced
2 tsp lemon juice -adjust to taste
2 Tbsp Pinot Grigio
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, finely shredded

Fill a saucepan with water. Bring to boil over high heat. Add linguine noodles and cook about 8 minutes or per package directions
In a skillet, melt 2 Tbsp butter, add garlic, sauté until garlic is fragrant and lightly browned. Add shrimp. Sauté for about 2 minutes per side - you’ll know the shrimp is done when the tail starts curling inward. Add the remaining butter, lemon juice, Pinot Grigio, Parmesan, and half and half. Stir to incorporate. Drain linguine noodles. Divide noodles between two bowls, serve shrimp mixture on top of linguine noodles. Garnish with chopped parsley
