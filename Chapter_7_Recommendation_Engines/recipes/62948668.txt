Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
1/3 cup cocoa powder
3 T cornstarch
pinch salt
2 1/4 cup milk
1 1/2 t vanilla

Directions:
In a heavy medium saucepan, whisk together the sugar, cocoa, cornstarch, and salt.
Whisk in about half of the milk to make a smooth paste and stir in the rest.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil and begins to thicken, about 6 minutes.
Continue to cook, stirring, for 1 minute longer, until smooth and very thick.
Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the vanilla or coffee extract, stirring until they are both melted.
*Optional: for extra creaminess, add 1 T of butter and a half square or so of semi or bittersweet chocolate
Serve plain or topped with the optional whipped cream
