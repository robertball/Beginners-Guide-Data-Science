Ingredients:
3 cups packed brown sugar
1 1/2 cups white sugar
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 (15 ounce) can applesauce
3 large eggs
4 1/2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon coarse salt
1 pound dried plums, cut into small pieces
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Place sugars and butter in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until combined. Add applesauce and eggs; mix well until blended, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in oats, flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Fold in plums and basil.
Drop dough onto the baking sheets using a tablespoon-sized cookie scoop, spacing cookies 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are golden and just set, about 10 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks.
