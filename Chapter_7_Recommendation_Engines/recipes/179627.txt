Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 onion, coarsely chopped
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes, with juice
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 1/2 tablespoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 1/2 tablespoons dried mint
2 tablespoons garam masala
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained
1 (10 ounce) box frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine, broken in half
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
Brown ground beef in a skillet over medium heat; remove with slotted spoon to a large pot; reserving drippings in the skillet. Cook and stir the onion in the reserved drippings until golden brown; remove with slotted spoon and add to beef in the pot. Stir the tomatoes with juice, garlic, red pepper, cumin, chili powder, mint, garam masala, garbanzo beans, and spinach into the beef mixture and place the pot over low heat; simmer 3 to 6 hours.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the fettuccini, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Stir into the chili along with the sour cream and serve hot.

Description: 
This is a delicious and exotic alternative to American-style chili. It's not too spicy, but combines intriguing flavors. I adapted this recipe from a traditional Afghani family favorite. It may be cooked in a slow cooker, Dutch oven, or soup pot. Try it also with ground lamb or ground turkey.
