Ingredients:
For the filling:
3 lb. Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and cut into slices 1/4 inch thick
3 lb. Pink Lady apples, peeled, cored and cut into slices 1/4 inch thick
3/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 cup cornstarch
3 Tbsp. bourbon
2 Tbsp. vanilla extract
For the streusel:
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
1 Tbsp. ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp. salt
2/3 cup roughly chopped pecans
7 Tbsp. cold unsalted butter, diced

Directions:
Position a rack in the lower third of an oven and preheat to 375Â°F.
In a large bowl, stir together the apples, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, cornstarch, bourbon and vanilla until well combined.
In another bowl, stir together the flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt and pecans.
Add the butter and work it in with your fingers, pinching to form pea-size pieces.
Pour the apple mixture into the pie shell and sprinkle the streusel on top.
Bake until the streusel is golden brown and the apples are tender, about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
If the top of the pie has browned after 1 hour, tent it loosely with aluminum foil.
Transfer the pie to a wire rack and let cool for at least 2 hours before serving. Serves 12 to 14.
