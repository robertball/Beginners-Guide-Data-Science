Ingredients:
1 cup tomato sauce
1/3 cup tomato paste
¼ cup packed brown sugar
¼ cup cider vinegar
¼ cup Dijon mustard
1 onion, chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 Tbsp fancy molasses
1 Tbsp Cajun seasoning or chili powder
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
8 chicken drumsticks, skinned

Directions:
In saucepan, bring tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar, vinegar, mustard, onion, garlic, molasses, Cajun and Worcestershire to boil, stirring often. Reduce heat to med-low; simmer for 10 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes. Pour into blender; puree until smooth. (Make-ahead: Refrigerate in airtight container for up to 1 month.) Set aside 2/3 cup to serve with drumsticks. Transfer remaining sauce to large bowl.
Place chicken on greased grill over medium heat. Close lid and grill, turning once, until juices run clear when chicken is pierced, about 30 minutes. Add to bowl of barbecue sauce; toss to coat. Return chicken to grill; grill until slightly crusty but still saucy, about 5 minutes. Serve with reserved sauce.
Variation:
Micro-Grilled Drumsticks: Follow first paragraph. Place drumsticks in 11x7-inch microwaveable baking dish; cover and microwave at High, turning halfway through, until juices are still slightly pink when chicken is pierced, about 6 minutes. Add to bowl of sauce; toss to coat. Place on greased grill over med-high heat; close lid and grill, turning once, until juices run clear when chicken is pierced, about 10 minutes.
