Ingredients:
8 baby red potatoes, scrubbed, or more to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or more as needed
1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt, divided
freshly ground black pepper to taste
4 sprigs fresh rosemary, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Cover a large baking sheet with parchment paper; do not use waxed paper.
Place potatoes into a pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until fork-tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and drain.
Pour 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil onto the parchment paper-covered sheet. Place potatoes on the oil and roll to coat. Push potatoes to one side of the pan. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon sea salt onto oil; space potatoes evenly on the salted oil.
Place the bottom of a drinking glass on each potato and push down firmly until the it cracks open and is about 1-inch thick. Brush potatoes with remaining oil and sprinkle with remaining sea salt. Sprinkle with pepper to taste. Tuck rosemary sprigs among potatoes.
Roast in the preheated oven until edges are crispy and beginning to to brown, about 20 minutes.
