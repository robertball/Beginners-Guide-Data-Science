Ingredients:
2 cups water
zest of one orange
1 cup brown sugar
1 Tablespoon Soy Sauce
pinch ground Cayenne pepper
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
3 Tablespoons red wine vinegar
1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon Sriracha sauce
3 Tablespoons corn starch

Directions:
Combine all ingredients with the exception of corn starch in a sauce pan over medium low heat.   Stir well until sugar is dissolved.
Remove 1/2 cup of mixture and combine with corn starch in a small bowl.   Whisk until well blended.
When orange zests start to disappear, raise temperature of sauce pan and bring mixture to a slow boil.
Mix in corn starch mixture and stir occasionally until sauce thickens to desired consistency.
Remove from heat and let cool a bit.

Description: 
I was in the mood for some egg rolls, and when trying to think of something to go with them, I opened the fridge and saw way too many oranges.   Not finding an orange sweet and sour sauce, I made my own.   This is sweet and sour with a bit of spice and a beautiful, yet light, orange taste.   Perfect over egg rolls, shrimp, chicken, rice or even stir fry veggies.
