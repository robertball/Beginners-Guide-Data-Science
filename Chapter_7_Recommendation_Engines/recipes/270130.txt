Ingredients:
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken broth
1 (15 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
1 1/2 cups frozen corn
1 onion, chopped
1/2 cup cauliflower rice
1/4 cup quinoa
3 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons chili powder
3 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound chicken breast
3 tablespoons vegetable oil for frying
2 (8 inch) corn tortillas, cut into bite-sized strips

Directions:
Combine chicken broth, tomatoes, corn, onion, cauliflower rice, quinoa, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Add chicken breast. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 7 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Meanwhile heat oil in a skillet over moderately high heat. Add tortilla strips and cook until golden, about 1 minute. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 15 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Remove chicken and shred or cut into bite-sized pieces.
Return chicken to pot to warm. Ladle into soup bowls and top with fried tortilla strips.
