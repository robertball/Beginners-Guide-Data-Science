Ingredients:
3/4 tsp. kosher salt
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp. onion powder
1/4 tsp. black pepper
4 lb. loin pork chops, about 1/2-inch thick each
2 tsp. olive oil
1 Tbsp. Butter
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tsp. minced ginger
1/2 cup chicken broth
2/3 cup bottled apricot-pineapple preserves

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.
While the pan is heating, combine the salt, garlic and onion powders, and pepper. Sprinkle half of spice mixture evenly over one side of pork chops.
When the pan is hot, add the olive oil. Place pork, spice side down, in the hot pan. Sprinkle the remaining spice mixture on the top of the pork chops. Cook the pork for 3 minutes and then flip and cook 3 additional minutes. Remove the pork from the pan and cover with foil to keep warm.
Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter. When melted, add the garlic and ginger. Saut√© for about 30 seconds while stirring. Add the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Use a spatula to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan and continue to simmer for 1 minute.
Whisk in the preserves. Bring the sauce to a simmer and return the pork to the pan. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes on each side or until cooked through to an internal temperature of 160 degrees.
Remove from heat and let the pork chops rest for 5 minutes before serving. Serve over white or brown rice and spoon the sauce from the pan over each piece of pork.
