Description: 
I grew up on a Montana ranch, and this dish reminds me of the kind we used to prepare for the hay and harvest crews. The bacon and sausage provide rich flavor to this comforting. When I make this dish, I share a taste of my country memories with my family. -Machelle Lewis, Henderson, Nevada
