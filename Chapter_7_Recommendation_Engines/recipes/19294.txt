Ingredients:
1/4 pound thinly sliced pancetta bacon, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1/4 cup white wine
1/2 pound uncooked spaghetti
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon, onion and red pepper flakes until onion is tender but not browned.
Stir in the tomatoes and wine; simmer for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Add pasta to the sauce and toss well; simmer for 2 to 3 minutes more (this will infuse the pasta with the sauce). Add salt and black ground pepper to taste; serve.
