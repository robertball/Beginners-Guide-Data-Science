3 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 tbsp olive oil
1/2 tsp dried cilantro
1/2 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp sea salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
4 cloves garlic, lightly crushed
1 large onion, chopped
1 can Nacho cheese soup, condensed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees farenheit.  Cut chicken into 1 inch cubes.  Saute chicken and onion in olive oil.  Add cilantro, chili powder, salt, pepper and garlic cloves.  Cook for about 10 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.
In bowl, mix together Nacho cheese soup, undrained beans, canned tomatoes, one cup of the cheese, sour cream and garlic powder.
Stir in cooked chicken and onion mixture.  Layer in 9x13 inch pan, beginning with half the chicken and soup mixture, top with half the tortilla pieces, then add one cup cheese.  Repeat.

Description: 
This can be made as spicy or as mild as you like it.  An excellent week-night meal.  You can use corn tortillas if you prefer them, or even tortilla chips if you like!
Add a couple of teaspoons of red pepper flakes, hot sauce, or a small can of jalapenos for more punch.
