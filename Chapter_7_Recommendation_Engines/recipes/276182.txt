Ingredients:
baking spray
1 (18.25 ounce) package brownie mix
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3 tablespoons water
2 eggs
50 miniature chocolate-covered peanut butter cups, unwrapped, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 50 mini muffin cups with paper liners and spray each liner with baking spray.
Combine brownie mix, vegetable oil, water, and eggs in a large bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon until well blended.
Place a dollop of batter into each of the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 1/2 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the muffin cups, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately push peanut butter cups into centers of brownie bites.
Remove from muffin pans and let cool on wire racks before serving.
