Ingredients:
--- CRUST ---
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup firmly pack brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup pecan halves
--- CARAMEL LAYER ---
2/3 cup butter
1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
--- CHOCOLATE ---
1 cup real semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Heat oven to 350Â°. Combine all crust ingredients EXCEPT pecans in a large bowl.  Beat at medium speed until mixture resembles fine crumbs.  Press into bottom of an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan.  Place pecans evenly over unbaked crust.
Combine 2/3 cup butter and 1/2 cup brown sugar in a 1-quart saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until entire surface of mixture begins to boil.  Continue cooking, stirring constantly, 1 minute.  Pour mixture over pecans and crust.
Bake for 18 to 22 minutes or until entire caramel layer is bubbly. (DO NOT OVERBAKE.) Remove from oven. Immediately sprinkle with chocolate chips; allow to melt slightly. Swirl melted chips over bars leaving some whole for marbled effect.  Cool completely. Cut into bars.
Store at room temperature in a loosely covered container.
