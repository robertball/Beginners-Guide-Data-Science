Mix oats, milk, eggs, applesauce, brown sugar, butter, white sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until oats are evenly moistened; pour into prepared baking dish.

Description: 
If your family doesn't care for the texture of regular oatmeal, then this is for you. It's more cake-like. This is the most requested recipe at the sports camp my kids went to. I modified the recipe to cut the fat and sugar and it is my kid's favorite breakfast. Make a pan on Monday and eat a quick, healthy breakfast the rest of the week.
