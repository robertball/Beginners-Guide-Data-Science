Ingredients:
1 large onion, chopped
1 medium green bell pepper, chopped
2 tablespoons chicken broth
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained, divided
1 1/2 cups picante sauce, divided
12 (6 inch) flour tortillas
2 medium tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
3 cups shredded lettuce
6 tablespoons fat free sour cream

Directions:
In a nonstick skillet, cook and stir onion and green pepper in broth for 2-3 minutes or until tender. Mash one can of black beans. Add to the skillet with 3/4 cup of picante sauce and remaining beans; heat through.
Spoon 1/4 cup mixture down the center of each tortilla. Roll up and place, seam side down, in a 13-inch x 9-inch x 2-inch baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Combine tomatoes and remaining picante sauce; spoon over enchiladas.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. Uncover; sprinkle with cheeses. Bake 5 minutes longer. To serve, place 1/2 cup lettuce on each plate and top with two enchiladas. Garnish each serving with 1 tablespoon sour cream.
