Ingredients:
1/4 cup light olive oil
3 28oz. cans of unseasoned crushed tomatoes
2/3 can of water

3 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp dried basil
1/4 tsp pepper
pinch of dried oregano
Love

Directions:
Saute the crushed garlic in the oil as slowly as possible over low heat in a large pot until the garlic turns golden brown.  Add the tomatoes and rinse out all the cans with the water, and add to the sauce.  Stir in remaining ingredients.  Bring to a simmer, and cook over low heat.  Cover halfway to keep the sauce from splashing, but allowing steam to escape.  Stir every 10 minutes to avoid scorching.  Sauce will thicken as it cooks. TASTE FREQUENTLY, preferably with a chunk of bread.  If you add meatballs, decrease the water to 1/3 can (see my Easy Meatballs recipe).

Description: 
I make this every Sunday.  I use little spice because I love the taste of the tomatoes.  Too much oregano, and it tastes like pizza sauce.  We're 100% Italian from Brooklyn, so this sauce is the real deal!
