Ingredients:
5 1-inch thick slices of day-old bread
5 Tbsp. butter, melted
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp. dried Parmesan cheese
1 tsp. oregano
1/2 tsp. thyme
1/2 tsp. salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
Remove and discard the bread crusts, and cut the slices into cubes.
In a large, flat-bottomed bowl, with a spatula, mix the butter, garlic powder, Parmesan cheese, oregano, thyme and salt.
Add the bread cubes to the butter mixture. Stir gently with the spatula until all bread cubes are well coated.
Transfer cubes to a cookie sheet and spread them out in a single layer.
Bake at 325 degrees F for 15-20 minutes.
Cool the croutons completely.
When cool, store in an airtight container.
