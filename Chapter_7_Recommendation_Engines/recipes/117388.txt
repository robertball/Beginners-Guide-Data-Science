Ingredients:
3/4 cup water (70 to 80 degrees F)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups bread flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 medium onions, quartered and sliced
3 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 cup butter
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In bread machine pan, place the first six ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed).
When the cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly greased 12-in. pizza pan; pat into a 10-in. circle. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, saute onions and garlic in butter for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown. Stir in the Italian seasoning; cook 1 minute longer.
Using the end of a wooden spoon handle, make deep indentations 1 in. apart in dough. Top with onion mixture and cheeses. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
