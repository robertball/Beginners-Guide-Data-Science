Ingredients:
4 tbsp butter
6 apples thinly sliced (Granny Smith recommended)
½ cup sugar
½ cup brown sugar
2 tsp cinnamon
¼ tsp nutmeg
½ cup water

Directions:
In a large skillet with lid melt the butter over medium heat.
Turn off heat.  Add the sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and water.  Stir to combine.
Return the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil.  Allow it to boil until it begins to thicken.
Reduce the heat to medium then stir in apple slices turning them to coat in the sauce.
Continue cooking over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  The sauce will continue to thicken.
Reduce heat to low and cover the skillet.  Cook until the apples are tender (should be another 5 to 10 minutes), stirring occasionally.  Add more water if necessary to continue stirring.
Turn off heat and allow the sauce to thicken as it cools.
