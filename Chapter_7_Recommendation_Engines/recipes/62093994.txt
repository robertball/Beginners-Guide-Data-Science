Summer Squash Saute Recipe

Ingredients:
3 - 4 medium fresh zucchini
3 - 4 medium yellow (crookneck) squash
1 onion
1 - 2 cloves garlic, minced
2 medium fresh, ripe tomatoes
2 - 3 sprigs fresh basil or 4 - 5 sprigs fresh cilantro
Kosher Salt
Fresh ground pepper
2 TB (+/-)Olive oil

Directions:
Chop zucchini, squash, onion and tomatoes roughly, so that they are approximately equal bite-size chunks.  Chop basil; if you're using cilantro, use the stems as well.  Waste nothing!
If sauteeing, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmery.  Add vegetables, herbs, salt and pepper and saute for about ten minutes until vegetables are tender.  Turn out into a bowl and serve immediately.
If you're planning to grill, toss ingredients in a large bowl with the olive oil and turn out onto a large piece of foil.  Cover with another piece of foil and seal the edges.  If you want, you can repeat the "packaging" with foil again before you put it on the grill to give the packet some structural integrity -- you don't want this falling apart halfway to the kitchen!  Put the packet on the grill and cook for about ten minutes.  Take it off the grill, wait for the packet to cool a bit, and then slash it open to serve.  Beware steam burns when you do this -- because of the nature of the technique, a lot of moisture heats up inside the packet and you have to be careful when opening it up.
