Description: 
This recipe goes way back, like 1898 back, when the brownie was first recorded into existence at the Palmer House Hotel in Chicago. Don't rely on the traditional stick test for doneness in this recipe; the brownies will continue to be gooey even after baking. For easier cutting, place glazed brownies in the freezer for 3 to 4 hours.
