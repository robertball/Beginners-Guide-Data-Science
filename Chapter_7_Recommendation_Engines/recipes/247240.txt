Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 clove garlic, smashed and peeled
2  green onions, white and tender green parts separated and chopped
¾ teaspoon ground coriander
¾ teaspoon cumin
¾ teaspoon chipotle chile powder
3 cups fresh corn kernels (from fresh ears of corn or frozen corn, thawed)
1 cup buttermilk
½ cup water
½ teaspoon salt
¼ cup chopped cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook garlic, white parts of onions, coriander, cumin, and chile powder, stirring, until garlic and onions are tender, about 3 minutes. Add corn and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 2 minutes.
Transfer mixture to a blender. Add buttermilk, water, and salt and puree until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids. Chill at least 1 hour.
Serve chilled, garnished with green parts of onions and cilantro (if using).

Description: 
Tangy buttermilk, sweet corn, and spices combine to make a simple, yet rich soup. If you don't have buttermilk, you can make some by adding a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice or white vinegar to a cup of milk and letting it stand for 1/2 hour.
