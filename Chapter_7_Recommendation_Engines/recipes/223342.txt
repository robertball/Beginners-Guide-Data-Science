2 tablespoons dried oregano
2 cups chicken broth
1/2 sweet onion (such as Vidalia速), chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, minced
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoons garlic salt
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes with garlic

Directions:
Coat a large saucepan with cooking spray and cook 1 chopped sweet onion over medium heat until tender, about 5 minutes. Add chili starter, oregano, and chicken broth; increase heat to medium-high and simmer for 20 minutes.
Coat a large stock pot with cooking spay and cook remaining 1/2 chopped sweet onion, green bell pepper, and jalapeno pepper over medium heat until tender, 5 to 8 minutes.
