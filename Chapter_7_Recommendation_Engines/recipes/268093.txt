Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
10 eggs
1/4 cup milk
2 pinches Italian herb seasoning, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 dash chipotle hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®)
1 (8 ounce) ball fresh buffalo mozzarella
12 slices bacon, halved
1 (10 ounce) package ready-made pizza dough
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat a convection oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an ovenproof baking dish with butter.
Break eggs into a bowl. Add milk, 1 pinch Italian herb seasoning, salt, black pepper, and chipotle hot pepper sauce and mix with a whisk. Pour into the prepared baking dish.
Tear mozzarella cheese into pieces and place on top of egg mixture in an even layer. Place bacon slices on top of cheese in an even layer.
Roll pizza dough out halfway. Stretch dough over sides of baking dish firmly, allowing about 1/4-inch extra on each side. Use kitchen scissors to trim away any extra dough.
Pour olive oil in a small bowl and add remaining Italian seasoning and garlic powder. Pour mixture over dough. Top dough with shredded mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until dough is golden and cheese is nicely crisped, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
A one-dish oven omelette with bread included. 
Named Anneomelette as an ode to my wife who can do it all. Served with pizza crust on bottom when eating instead of bread. Enjoyed with sides of mayo, ketchup, chipotle Tabasco®, and fresh cherry tomatoes.
