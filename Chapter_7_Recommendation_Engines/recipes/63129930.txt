Ingredients:
1/3 c canned pumpkin (or cooked pumpkin)
3/4 c milk of choice
1 cup flake cereal (I like spelt flakes, but bran, corn, etc will work. Some people have even used oatmeal!)
1/4 to 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp salt
sweetener (such as stevia, sugar, or even maple syrup)
optional: chocolate chips, pecans

Directions:
Blend all ingredients together. The cereal will have a thin consistency at first, but if you leave it in the fridge (after blending) for even just 10 minutes, it starts to get really thick!
