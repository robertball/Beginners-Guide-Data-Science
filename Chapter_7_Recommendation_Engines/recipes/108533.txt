Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups elbow macaroni
1 medium red or green bell pepper, chopped
1 medium onion, diced
2 carrots, peeled and finely chopped
1 cup pineapple chunks, drained, 2 tablespoons of juice reserved
3 cups finely shredded cabbage
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 teaspoon white pepper
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 cup cherry-flavored yogurt
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup fresh shredded coconut
8 maraschino cherries for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain, and rinse with cold water until chilled.  Drain well.
Place the macaroni in a large bowl, and toss together with the bell pepper, onion, carrot, pineapple, reserved pineapple juice, and cabbage.  Sprinkle with garlic powder, and toss to combine; set aside.
In a small bowl, stir together the Dijon mustard, vinegar, oil, white pepper, sugar, and yogurt; season to taste with salt and pepper.  Toss the macaroni salad with the dressing, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour to overnight.
To serve, toss the salad again to mix, then pour into a serving bowl.  Sprinkle with coconut, and garnish with maraschino cherries.
