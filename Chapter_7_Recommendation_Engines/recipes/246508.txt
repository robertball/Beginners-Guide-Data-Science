Ingredients:
7 red potatoes, scrubbed and quartered
salt
1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoons butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 links smoked beef sausage (such as EckrichÂ®), sliced into 1-inch pieces
1 bunch asparagus, stemmed and chopped
2 cups frozen sweet white corn
2 cups chopped broccoli florets
3 cups beef broth
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed
ground black pepper

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until potatoes are very soft, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Place potatoes in a large bowl. Add milk, butter, and garlic. Blend potatoes until creamy with an electric mixer. Divide mashed potatoes among bowls.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage; cook until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add chopped asparagus, corn, and broccoli florets. Pour in broth; cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are almost cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Scoop 1 cup of broth out of the skillet into a small bowl. Whisk in flour until smooth. Pour broth mixture back into skillet. Stir until a thickened gravy forms, about 5 minutes.
Serve sausage mixture and gravy over mashed potatoes. Season with black pepper.

Description: 
Comfort food with vegetables. I made up this recipe. Both my 18-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter loved it - it's not always easy to satisfy them both!
