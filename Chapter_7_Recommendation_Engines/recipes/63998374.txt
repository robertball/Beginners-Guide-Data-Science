Ingredients:
1 6 to 7 pound armadillo, preferably one that has been digging up the yard & eating yur vegetables
1 bullet (more if you ain't a good shot)
1 case cold beer (less if you ain't a good shot)
3 pounds roadside gravel, washed clean with garden hose & sit down to drain
6 slices thick bacon, cut up little
3 wild yard onions, cut goodly
2 kernels of garlic, smushed with a clean hammer
1 forgotten loaf good light bread
1 cup fine red wine from Ma's box
Box of that new fangled low sodium beef broth
S&P

Directions:
When a full moon, park yur tractor or riding yard cutter in corner of yard where varmit is known to hang out. Place cooler of beer on one side of seat & gun & ammo on the other. TCB (take care of business) while making sure it ain't Ma's cat. Aim for a head shot so's not to crack the shell. If you crack the shell, patch with duct tape.
Field dress & wash armadillo outside. Ma gets mad iffin you use her bathtub. Use clean hack saw or tin snippers (don't use tractor fuel to clean, leaves a bad taste, ha, been there!) to cut varmit into quarters (that's 4 parts for us that hasn't graduated thurd grade yet) with one of them 4 scrawny legs left on each piece. (Save the claws cause they make mighty fine tooth pickers).
Break up the slices of the old hard loaf bread. Break off & throw away the green or fuzzy parts, ain't good for no one, not even the mean dogs.
In a big skillet, cook bacon until looking brown. Fetch them out with a holey spoon & put in a bowl. Add yard onions & cook until soft. Add garlic & cook just until you smell it good. Iffin you cook it two long, throw skillet in the gulley & start over.
Take the cup of Ma's wine, drink half, add the rest to the skillet & get it hot. Add beef broth & let her rip for 4 or 5 minutes.
Mix liquid & bread. It may look dry but the juices cooking out of the armadillo will help. Add the bacon Ma ain't et up yet & skir it up good. Taste & put in some salt & pepper if it feels right. Devid, divede, oh heck just put it in the armadillo parts.
Put gravel in a big turkey/armadillo cooking pan. Place armadillo parts shell side down & push to snug them in good so the juices can't spill out. Bake at 350 degrees for 45 - 50 minutes or until the legs wiggle freely & stuffing is good & hot. Take out & let sit there bout 10 minutes.

Description: 
A more fancied up dish than BBQ armadillo since it is stuffed. If the varmit has been eating up yur vegetables, he should taste right good! -- This recipe was posted for April Fool's & is for entertainment only!
