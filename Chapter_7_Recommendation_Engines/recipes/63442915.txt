Ingredients:
1 English cucumber, very thinly sliced
1 Tablespoon coarse salt
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 cup white-wine vinegar
1 cup sugar
1 bay leaf
2 allspice berries

Directions:
Place cucumbers in a colander.  Toss with salt, and let stand 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine water, vinegar, sugar, bay leaf, and allspice berries in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil.  Remove from heat, and let cool.
Rinse salt off cucumbers, and squeeze out as much moisture as possible with your hands.  Transfer cucumbers to a nonreactive container with a tight-fitting lid, and pour pickling liquid over them.
Cover, and refrigerate at least 3 hours before serving.
