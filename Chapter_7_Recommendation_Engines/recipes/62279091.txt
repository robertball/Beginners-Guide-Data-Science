Ingredients:
16 frozen artichoke hearts, thawed
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
5 large fresh eggs
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Coat the artichoke hearts with flour, shaking off any excess. Heat all but 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over high heat until very hot.
Saute the artichokes for about 8 minutes, turning them several times to cook evenly. When they are lightly browned, drain on paper towels.
Discard the oil used for frying and replace with the remaining oil. Arrange the artichokes in the skillet and return to a moderately high heat.
Beat the eggs lightly with the salt and pepper then pour over the artichokes.
Cook for 4-5 minutes. Turn the omelet carefully and cook for 4 minutes more. It should be firm and lightly browned on both sides. Turn out onto a heated serving dish and serve.
