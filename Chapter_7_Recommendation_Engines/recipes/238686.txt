Ingredients:
1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
1 cup unbleached flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon powdered milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Heat oil in a heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Sift flour, baking powder, powdered milk, and salt together in a large bowl. Pour water over flour mixture and stir until a sticky dough forms. Form dough into a ball using floured hands.
Fry the dough in the hot oil until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer fry bread to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
