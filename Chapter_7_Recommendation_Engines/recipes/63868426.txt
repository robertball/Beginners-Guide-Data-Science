Ingredients:
2 cups old-fashioined oats
2 1/2 cups buttermilk
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup butter or coconut oil, melted
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Mix oats and buttermilk in a large bowl; allow to rest for 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Combine eggs, brown sugar, and butter or coconut oil in a small bowl; stir into oat mixture. Set aside.
Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt separately; stir into oat mixture until just moistened.
Fill prepared muffin cups about 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
