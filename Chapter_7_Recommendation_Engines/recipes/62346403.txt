Ingredients:
3 lbs ground turkey
2 onions
1 green pepper
1 red pepper
2 jalapenos
2 (28oz) cans petite diced tomatoes
2 (29oz) cans tomato sauce
1 (6oz) can tomato paste
3 (15oz) cans pinto beans (drained & rinsed)
1/2 cup chili powder
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp red pepper flakes
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp garlic powder
4 cups water
Add your favorite pasta to garnish (optional)

Directions:
You'll need an over-sized soup pot for this recipe or cut the recipe in half!  Brown the ground turkey then add the onions and peppers.  Continue cooking just until vegetables are tender but still crispy.  Add all other ingredients and simmer for 1 hr.  Garnish with your favorite pasta (I like bow tie).  If it gets to thick the next day, just add water to get the consistency you desire.
