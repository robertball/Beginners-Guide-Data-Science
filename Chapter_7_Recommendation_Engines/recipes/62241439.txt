Ingredients:
3 cups all purpose flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
3/4 cup butter, room temperature
1 1/2 cups sugar
3 large eggs
2 tbsp Meyer lemon zest
1/2 cup Meyer lemon juice
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 tbsp Meyer lemon juice
1 cup confectioners sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Grease and flour a 10 or 12 cup bundt pan.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, followed by lemon zest. Stir 1/3 of the flour mixture into the butter mixture, followed by the Meyer lemon juice. Add in additional 1/3 of the flour mixture, followed by the buttermilk. Stir in all remaining flour, mixing only until no streaks of flour remain visible. Pour into prepared pan.
Bake for 40-45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean or with only a few moist crumbs attached.
Let cake rest in pan for 15 minutes, then turn out on to a wire rack to cool completely.
For the glaze, whisk together lemon juice and confectioners’ sugar in a small bowl. Drizzle over cooled cake.

Description: 
Now, if you can’t get Meyer lemons, you can easily substitute regular lemon juice into this recipe and get great results. If fact, if you’re not too familiar with meyer lemons, you might want to try giving both versions a try (or simply compare the lemons side-by-side) to get a feel for the differences between the two.
