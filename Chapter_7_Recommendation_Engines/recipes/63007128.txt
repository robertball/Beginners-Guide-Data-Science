Ingredients:
3 TBS olive oil
8 anchovies (drained and chopped)
2 medium/large garlic cloves (minced)
½ tsp crushed red pepper
1 or 2 TBS Jalapeño peppers (diced)
1 lb. spaghetti
1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes
1 ½ cups black olives (pitted and chopped)
2 TBS small non-pareil capers (rinsed and drained)
3 TBS fresh parsley (chopped) (optional)
salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Put pasta water in a large pot, and heat on high, but don't add pasta yet.
Heat oil over medium heat in a large skillet, or wok.
Add the anchovies to the oil and cook about 3 minutes, breaking up the anchovies with a spoon.
When the anchovies have "melted" down, add the garlic, diced jalapeño and pepper flakes, stirring for another minute.
Start cooking the spaghetti in the water that has been brought to a boil, according to the package instructions.
Add tomatoes, olives and capers to the sauce and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally while it starts to thicken.
Just before the pasta is ready, reserve a bit of pasta water in case the sauce is too thick and needs to be loosened up.
When the pasta is cooked as desired, drain the pasta and toss with the sauce in a large serving bowl.
