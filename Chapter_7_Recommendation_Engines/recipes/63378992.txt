Pickled Beets MeMom's Way Recipe

Ingredients:
1  Bussel Beets
11 Cups Apple Cider Vinegar
9 Cups Granulated Sugar
7 Cups Water
2 T. Whole Cloves
6 Sticks Cinnamon (broken in half)
1 T. Pickling Salt
1 T. Allspice
9  Quart Wide Mouth Jars with lids/seals
12 Pint Jars with lids/seals

Directions:
Scrub beats & put in 2 large pots (I use one of my cold packers & heavy duty soup pot). Add enough water to cover beets. Bring to boil. Cook until beets are tender all the way through. If beets are very large, cut in half or even quarter, but most will be left whole.  When tender, take off stove, pour off water, rinse with cold water so you can handle.  Cut ends off and most of peeling will just come off when you scrape with finger nail or paring knife.  After all are peeled, sliced or quartered.  I prefer slices. Make sure slices will fit into your jars.
Mix all ingredients in a very large heavy duty pot, like a soup pot.  Bring liquid to a boil.  Pack canning jars tight with beets. I add the cinnamon sticks to jars as far as they will go around.
Drop jar lids & seals in pan of boiling water and let boil for 10 minutes.
Fill jars with hot liquid and run a case knife down inside of each jar all the way around to release all air bubbles, you can see them. Add more liquid at this point if necessary to leave 1/2 inch to top of rim with liquid.  Wipe each jar rim with wet rag so seals will get tight fit.  Place seals and rings on jars and seal tightly. I use one of those rubber jar openers to get a tight fit.  I turn my jars upside down for 30 minutes to insure a good seal.
