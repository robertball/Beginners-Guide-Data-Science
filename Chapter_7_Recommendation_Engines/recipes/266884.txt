Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
3/4 cup quinoa
1 cup pitted dates
1 cup old-fashioned oats
2/3 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup maple syrup
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Uncover, fluff with a fork, and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Combine dates, oats, cranberries, and maple syrup in a food processor. Blend until a sticky paste forms.
Mix 2 cups cooled quinoa, date mixture, and cinnamon together in a bowl.
Line a small baking pan with parchment paper. Press mixture firmly into the pan. Cut into bars.
