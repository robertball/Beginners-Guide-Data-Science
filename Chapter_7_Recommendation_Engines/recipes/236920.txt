1 onion, sliced
2 carrots, peeled and sliced
1/2 cup rice vinegar

1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons soy sauce

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over high heat. Cook and stir ground pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Return skillet to high heat. Stir onion and carrots into the ground beef; stir-fry until the vegetables are hot, about 2 minutes.
Stir rice vinegar, ketchup, sugar, and soy sauce together in a bowl; pour over pork mixture. Add broccoli and bell pepper to the mixture; stir. Place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to medium, and cook until the broccoli is tender, 7 to 10 minutes.
