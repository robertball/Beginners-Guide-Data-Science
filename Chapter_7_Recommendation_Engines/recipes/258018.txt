Ingredients:
Crunch:
1 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup melted butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Batter:
1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 cup pumpkin puree
3 eggs
1/2 cup water
Drizzle:
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup milk, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Stir brown sugar, pecans, butter, flour, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg together in a bowl to make crunch mixture.
Mix yellow cake mix, pumpkin, eggs, and water together in a separate bowl until batter is smooth. Pour half of the batter into the prepared baking dish; top with crunch mixture. Pour remaining batter over crunch.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
Whisk confectioners' sugar and milk together in a small bowl, adding more milk if needed to reach a pourable consistency; drizzle over the cake.
