2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Process ricotta cheese and cream cheese in a food processor until smooth and creamy; add egg yolk, melted butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt and process until fluffy.

Description: 
Sweet cheese filling goes well with sweet Polish nalesniki, also known as Polish blintzes or filled crepes. Once filled and rolled, they can be baked, pan-fried, or dipped in beaten egg and bread crumbs and fried. Serve with fruit sauce, like a fresh blueberry sauce, if desired.
