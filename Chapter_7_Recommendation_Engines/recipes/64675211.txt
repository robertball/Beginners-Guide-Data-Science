Ingredients:
1 package yellow cake mix (regular size), divided
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 Tbsp butter
2/3 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup (8 ounces) sour cream
2 large eggs
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1-1/2 cups finely chopped fresh or frozen rhubarb
1-1/2 cups sliced fresh strawberries
Cream cheese frosting or vanilla ice cream, optional

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup cake mix and sugar; cut in butter until crumbly. Add walnuts; set aside.
In another bowl, combine the sour cream, eggs, flour and remaining cake mix; beat on low speed for 30 seconds. Beat on medium for 2 minutes. Fold in rhubarb and strawberries. Spread into a greased 13x9-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture.
Bake at 350Â° for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
If desired, drizzle with frosting or serve with ice cream.
Note: If using frozen rhubarb, measure rhubarb while still frozen, then thaw completely. Drain in a colander, but do not press liquid out.

Description: 
My family LOVES rhubarb and using a cake mix helps speed the prep for this moist streusel-topped dessert that pairs tart rhubarb with sweet strawberries. It's great all by itself, but feel free to add some frosting or ice cream.
