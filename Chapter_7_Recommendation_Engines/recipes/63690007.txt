Ingredients:
2 potatoes, shredded (can use frozen hash browns if wanted)
7 slices  bacon or 8oz pork sausage
8 scrambled eggs
1 cup chopped zucchini
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 onion, chopped

Directions:
Cook the bacon (or sausage)in skillet until brown.  Remove and cool (save the grease).
Chop or shred potatoes. I cook them until they are almost done in the bacon grease, but you can use frozen hash browns (the shredded ones) too and save some time.
Chop your veggies (whatever your favorites would be) and sautee lightly.
Assemble the mini quiches- spray your jumbo muffin tin well. I try to mash the potatoes in the bottom of the muffin tin so the eggs cannot leak through. then put a spoonful of meat and veggies in each one and fill up with egg liquid.
Bake at 375 for 15-20m until tops of quiches are no longer liquid.

Description: 
A quick and easy way to take breakfast on the go, after the gym etc. Can make it wheat-free, dairy-free, and can easily be made vegetarian without the bacon.
