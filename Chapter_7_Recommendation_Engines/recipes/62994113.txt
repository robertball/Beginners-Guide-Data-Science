Ingredients:
2 - 3 pound centre cut beef tenderloin
2 Tbsp olive oil
2 tsp salt
2 tsp pepper
2 tsp dried thyme
2 Tbsp butter
4 shallots, thinly sliced
1 sprig fresh rosemary
1 cup red wine
1 cup beef stock

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Mix together olive oil, salt, pepper and thyme and rub all over roast.  Place beef in roasting pan and cook for 45 minutes to an hour, depending on desired doneness, rare to medium rare.
While roast is cooking, melt the butter in a frying pan over medium heat. When hot add the shallots, rosemary sprig and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until the shallots soften and carmelize, about 40 minutes.
When beef is cooked, remove from oven, tent with aluminum foil and let rest 10 to 15 minutes.
Pour the red wine into the frying pan with the carmelized shallots and bring to a boil. Add the stock, and boil gently for 5 to 7 minutes or until you have about 1 cup of sauce. Remove the rosemary sprig and season with salt and pepper.
Slice the meat and serve with sauce spooned over top.

A family favourite for Sunday dinner or a dinner party.  I've substituted the thyme with both rosemary and oregano and it is equally delicious!
