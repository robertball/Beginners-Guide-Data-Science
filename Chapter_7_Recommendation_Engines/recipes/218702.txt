Ingredients:
Crust:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed
1 envelope Fleischmann's® Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise Yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/3 cups very warm water (120 degrees to 130 degrees F)*
1/3 cup Mazola® Extra Virgin Olive Oil
Additional flour for rolling
Toppings:
1 (8 ounce) container flavored hummus
1 cup chopped asparagus (use thin spears or slice in half)
1/2 cup roasted red pepper strips
1/2 cup crumbled goat or feta cheese, or more to taste
2 tablespoons pinenuts

Directions:
Start charcoal fire or preheat gas grill to medium-high heat.
Combine 2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add very warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Dough should form a ball and will be slightly sticky. Knead** on a floured surface, adding additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. (If using RapidRise Yeast, let dough rest at this point for 10 minutes.)
Divide dough into 8 portions. Pat or roll dough on a well-floured counter to about 8-inch circles; they do not need to be perfect.
Using hands, lift each crust carefully and place on grill. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until bottom is lightly browned and top looks set. Using long handled tongs, remove crust from grill, grilled side up, to a platter or baking sheet.
Spread about 2 tablespoons hummus over the grilled side of each pizza crust. Top with 2 tablespoons asparagus, 1 tablespoon roasted red pepper, about 1 tablespoon goat cheese and a few pinenuts. Repeat with remaining pizzas.
Carefully slide each pizza onto the grill. Cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes until bottom of crust is browned and cheese is melted. Remove from grill and serve immediately.
