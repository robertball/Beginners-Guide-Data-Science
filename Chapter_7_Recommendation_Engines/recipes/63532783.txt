Ingredients:
1. 4 boneless, skinless chicken breast cutlets (thin or regular)
2.  2 eggs
3.  1 cup Italian Style bread crumbs (I use Vigo)
4.  10oz any white wine (I use Sauvignon Blanc)
5.  2 cans (14.5oz each) chicken broth
6.  4 fresh lemons
7.  Olive oil
8. Pasta or Rice (your choice to put the chicken over)

Directions:
Cover bottom of large wide pan with olive oil (about 5 tablespoons).
Whisk eggs on one plate and add bread crumbs to a second plate.
Dip both sides of each cutlet in the egg and then cover completely with bread crumbs and place in pan.
Cook cutlets on medium-high about 2 minutes each side (just to brown each side and make breading slightly crisp).
Add wine and simmer 1 minute.
Add 2 cans of broth.
Cut 3 lemons in quarters and squeeze all juice out into pan.
Slice 1 lemon in circles and lightly squeeze some juice out into pan and place each circle rind onto the tops of the cutlets.
Cover and simmer on low for 30 minutes. I like to make this dish and let it cook on low for up to 2 hours if I have the time. It makes the chicken extra soft and flavorful.
Serve over pasta or rice with desired amount of sauce.
