Ingredients:
Jessica's Spaghetti Sauce (intended for large lasagna batch)
3 lb. meat market Italian Sausage
3 lb. 90-95% lean ground beef or sirloin
3 cans (14.5oz) Del Monte diced tomatoes with basil, garlic & oregano
2 cans (14.5oz) Del Monte stewed tomatoes with basil, garlic, & oregano
2 cans (14.5oz) Del Monte pasta style tomatoes
3 cans (15oz.) Contadina tomato puree
1 can (14.5oz) Contadina diced tomatoes with roast garlic
1 can (14.5oz) Contadina diced tomatoes with Italian Herbs
1-2 cans (12oz) Contadina tomato paste, to thicken
2 cans (28oz) Hunt's tomato sauce
2 cans (28oz) Hunt's crushed tomatoes
1 jar (3lb) Prego spaghetti sauce, any flavor, your choice
Water while making to desired thickness
****************************************
(portion sizes below are for approx. 1 pan of large Lasagna)
1 lb box lasagna noodles
1 package Parm cheese, shredded (better) or canned
1 carton 8-12 oz Ricotta cheese
1 package 5 cheese, Italian blend, shredded

Directions:
Brown meat & drain well.  Add in all additional ingredients, minus the water, and stir.  4-5 hours for chunky sauce, 7-8 hours for a smoother sauce.
Now begins the Lasagna process!
Cook noodles 3/4 of the way.  Should be sticky but firm.
Cover bottom of 9x13in baking pan with Jeska's sauce.
Cover sauce with evenly spread lasagna noodles, then sauce on top, then Parm cheese, then Ricotta cheese, then Italian blend.
Repeat 4 times, or as many times as pan allows, leaving a final layer on top.
Then cover with another layer of lasagna noodles and Italian blend shredded cheese on top, none of the other cheeses.
Cover with non-stick foil and poke holes with toothpick in foil to further prevent cheese from sticking and bake for 30 min.
Uncover and bake an additional 30 min.
Last minute, broil top of cheese til golden brown.
IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO BROIL SOMETHING WITH THE DOOR OPEN SO YOU CAN SEE INSIDE THE OVEN!  CHEESE BURNS EXTREMELY FAST WHEN BROILING SO TURN YOUR OVEN ONTO BROIL AND STAND GUARD.  YOU MAY HAVE TO TURN THE PAN AS MANY OVENS BAKE UNEVENLY WHEN BROILING!  MAKE SURE YOU MOVE THE LASAGNA TO THE BOTTOM MOST RACK BEFORE BROILING AND KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THE CHEESE.  TURN OFF OVEN BEFORE REACHING IN WITH OVEN MITS!
ENJOY!!!

Description: 
This is the most delicious Lasagna ever.  There are millions of different versions of Lasagna out there but this one is so delicious!  Remember, this is Family or Party sized.  If you have a huge family, this is the one!  If you are serving under 5 persons, this recipe isn't for you!  I always make about 6 of these and freeze up the other 5.  They heat up just as well!
