Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
4 (4 -5 ounce) slices salmon, about 1 pound total
1 teaspoon sea salt
2/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
3/4 cup chicken broth
2 lemons, juiced
2 tablespoons capers
2 teaspoons arrowroot powder
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Heat the olive oil and butter in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat.
While the pan is heating, blot the fish dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper.
Sauté the fish flipping once just cooked through, about 4 minutes.
Remove the fish to a platter.
Deglaze the pan with chicken broth, whisking for about 1 minute.
Add the lemon juice, capers and arrowroot powder then stir.
Place the salmon back in the pan and keep warm until ready to serve.
Garnish with fresh parsley before serving.

We are very fortunate to have a fresh fish market near us. I just love walking into City Fish and exploring the choices. Salmon is one of my favorites and Tully is always smiling and happy to assist!
