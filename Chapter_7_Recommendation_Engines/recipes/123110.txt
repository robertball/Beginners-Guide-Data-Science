Ingredients:
1 1/8 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 tablespoons cold margarine
1/2 cup fat-free plain yogurt
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon fat free milk

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda; cut in margarine until crumbly. Combine yogurt and sugar; stir into the dry ingredients just until moistened. Turn onto a floured surface; knead 4-5 times. Place on a baking sheet that has been coated with nonstick cooking spray; pat into a 6-in. x 4-in. rectangle. Cut into six square biscuits (do not separate biscuits). Brush tops with milk. Bake at 450 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden. Serve warm.

Description: 
'Scoring the dough instead of cutting out individual pieces keeps these biscuits nice and moist,' explains Rosemarie Kondrk of Old Bridge, New Jersey. 'They have old-fashioned flavor that's very satisfying.'
