Ingredients:
4 tbs cooking oil
24 corn tortillas
4 boneless, skinless, chicken breasts (or 3 large cans chicken meat)
1 16 oz container sour cream
3 12 oz cans cream of chicken soup
1 8 oz can diced green chili
cilantro (optional)
1 8 oz can diced jalapeno (optional)
4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 375.
Add 1 tbs of oil to frying pan and add chicken (if using fresh). Cook until no longer pink in the middle.
While chicken is cooling, brush both sides of tortillas with remaining oil and soften in another pan. Set tortillas aside and dice up chicken.
Combine sour cream, soup, 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese and green chilis. You can add the jalapeno's if you choose to, to make them a bit spicier. Blend until smooth.
One at a time, add a small amount of the chicken and cheese to each tortilla, top with a pinch of cilantro and roll up. Place each one into a 13 x 9 baking dish. You may need more than one dish.
Add remaining chicken to sour cream sauce. You can also add some cilantro to this if you wish. Mix thoroughly. Pour over enchiladas and top with remaining cheese.
Place in pre-heated oven and bake until the cheese is glazed on top and bubbly. About 35 minutes.
Serve hot with a green salad and garlic bread.

Description: 
This is actually my husbands recipe. Being hispanic myself I was a bit hesitant to try them, but with the savory sour cream sauce and chunks of chicken and all the cheese, you can't go wrong. When we have chicken enchiladas, these are the ones that requested the most.
