Description: 
A cushaw is a long necked squash and it makes a wonderful pie, similar to a pumpkin pie, but with a lighter filling and a milder flavor.  The cushaw can be very large and you may get enough cushaw meat to make as many as 8 pies.  You may freeze your unused cushaw to use at a later date.
