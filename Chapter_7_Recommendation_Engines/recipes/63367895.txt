Ingredients:
1.5 - 2 lbs. of boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 medium onion, sliced thin
2 T. olive oil
cracked black pepper and sea salt
1 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes
1 c. heavy cream
2-3 cloves minced garlic
3 tsp. dried basil
2 tsp. Son of Italy Italian Seasoning (or any brand)
1-2 T. sugar (depending on you preference)
1/4 c. Kraft Parmesan Cheese
Chicken Marinade...
1/4 c. olive oil
juice of 1 lemon
1 tsp. each basil and Italian seasoning

Directions:
Mix ingredients for the marinade in shallow pan and place chicken (filleted lengthwise)in pan, turning to coat.  Allow to marinade for at lease 20 minutes, longer for better flavor.
Heat oil in skillet, and saute onion, salt, and pepper until onions are translucent. Remove onion temporarily and add chicken breasts to pan and brown on both sides (don't cook chicken all the way through). Remove chicken to a platter and add onions back to the pan along with all ingredients except sugar and parmesan cheese, mixing well.  Simmer 30 minutes.  Return chicken to the pan and continue to simmer until chicken is done.  Add parmesan cheese and sugar for desired sweetness.  Serve over linguini.
