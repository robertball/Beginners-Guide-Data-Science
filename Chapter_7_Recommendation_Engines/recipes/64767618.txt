Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegan butter
3 Tbsp olive oil
2 large leeks, diced
1 large carrot, diced
1 yellow onion, minced
1 cup Pleurotus mushroom (oyster mushrooms), minced
2 pounds potatoes, peeled and diced
1 quart low sodium vegetable broth
1 cup unsweetened oat milK
1 tbsp potato starch
Salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Turn on the saute function on your slow cooker. Add the vegan butter and olive oil. add the diced leeks, carrot, onion, and mushroom. Stir until the leeks and onions are translucent and softened, the carrots have softened, and the minced mushrooms have liquified, about 7 minutes. Add the potatoes, vegetable broth. Mix well. Add a tbsp of oat milk to the potato starch and mix to create a slurry. Add it to the soup. Add the remaining hot milk. Salt and pepper.
Turn off the saute function. Turn on the slow cooker function, low, for 6 hours. (If preferred, use high for 3.5 hours). Stir before serving.
Notes: If you don’t want to use oat milk, use any unsweetened, neutral-flavored, full-bodied vegan milk. Rice milk is not a good substitute. Flax milk would be a good substitute.
If your slow cooker does not have a sauté function, sauté the ingredients in a skillet then transfer to the slow cooker to proceed. Do not skip the sauté method. It is vital in creating a robust and rich flavor.
