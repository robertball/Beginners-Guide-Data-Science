Description: 
These little beauties are down right delicious. Just lightly cinnamon-flavored from the apple butter, crunchy from the walnuts, and heart-healthy from the coconut oil (unflavored), lots of oats and whole grains, plus walnuts and cashew milk. Yum! Store cookies in an airtight container, if there are any left!
