Ingredients:
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 cup chopped dried apricots
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup golden raisins
1/2 cup orange juice
DOUGH:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
2 cups sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon orange zest
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the first seven ingredients. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Cool.
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla and orange zest. Combine flour and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 2-3 hours or until easy to handle.
On a lightly floured surface, roll half of the dough to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-in. round cookie cutter. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Place 1 teaspoon of raisin filling in the center of each cookie. Roll out remaining dough. Cut with a 2-in. cookie cutter. With a 1-in. round cookie cutter, cut a hole in the center of each; place over filling. With a fork, press edges to seal.
Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until edges begin to brown.
