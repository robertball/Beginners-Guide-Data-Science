Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 ½ pounds chicken meat, cut into chunks
salt and black pepper to taste
1  onion, chopped
1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1 teaspoon rubbed dried sage
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon ground allspice
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground cloves
2  limes, juiced
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies
1 (32 ounce) carton chicken broth
3 (15.5 ounce) cans white beans, drained and rinsed
8 ounces shredded Pepper Jack cheese

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Season the chicken meat with salt and pepper to taste. Stir into the hot oil, and cook until no longer pink in the center, about 8 minutes. Add the onion, jalapeno pepper, and garlic; continue cooking and stirring until the onions are tender, about 3 minutes more. Stir in the cumin, thyme, sage, oregano, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, salt, and cloves; cook and stir 1 minute.
Pour in the lime juice, chopped green chilies, and chicken broth, then bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook 45 minutes. Stir in the rinsed white beans, and cook 10 more minutes to reheat. Stir in the Pepper Jack cheese until melted to serve.
