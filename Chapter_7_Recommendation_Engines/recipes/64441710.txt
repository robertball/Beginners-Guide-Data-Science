Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1/4 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 tsp. pepper
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup dry white wine
1/2 lemon juiced
1/2 cup whipping cream
2 tablespoons capers, drained and rinsed

Directions:
Season chicken breasts with pepper, salt, dill weed, and garlic powder then toss in flour to coat.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place breasts in skillet, and increase heat to medium-high. Turn chicken frequently, until brown, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, and cook 5 to 7 minutes, until breasts are cooked through. Remove chicken to a warm serving platter, and cover with foil.
Return skillet to stove, and increase heat to high. Whisk in wine, lemon juice and whipping cream, whisking continuously until reduced to sauce consistency, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in capers. Pour sauce over chicken, and serve.
