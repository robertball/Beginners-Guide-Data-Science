Ingredients:
6 cups mashed strawberries
1 cup water, divided
3 T. low sugar pectin
1/2 pat butter
5 cups baking stevia (or to taste)
Optional:
1/4 cup lemon juice

Directions:
Wash and dry the strawberries, and remove the stems.
Mash the strawberries in a large bowl (to desired smoothness, or blend if really smooth is desired).
In a small saucepan, bring 1/2 the water and pectin to a boil and boil for 1 minute.
Put the mashed strawberries into a large saucepan; heat just to a boil and stir in the pectin mixture for 1 minute.
Dissolve the stevia in the other half of very HOT water.
Turn off heat on strawberries and stir in sweetener.
Ladle the jam into containers and let cool to room temp. Cover and place in the refrigerator overnight to let it set.
Store in the freezer if desired for up to 1 year; in the fridge for 3 weeks. Or ladle into jars and process in water bath.
