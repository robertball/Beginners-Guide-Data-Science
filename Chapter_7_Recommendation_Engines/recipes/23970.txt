Ingredients:
2 (9 ounce) packages fresh linguine pasta
1/4 cup butter
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 pound imitation crabmeat
1/2 pound cooked salad shrimp
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook for 3 minutes, or until al dente; drain.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic until tender. Stir in cream, and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add imitation crab, shrimp, Parmesan cheese, and salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until heated through.
Transfer cooked linguine to a serving platter, and top with seafood sauce. Garnish with parsley.
