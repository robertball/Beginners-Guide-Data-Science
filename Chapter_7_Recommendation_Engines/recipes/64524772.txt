Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound Andouille, finely diced
1 pound ground sirloin
1-1/2 cups finely diced yellow onions
1/2 cup finely diced celery
1 tablespoon pressed garlic
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon dried leaf oregano
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1 (12-ounce) bottle dark beer
1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes, crushed in juice
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1 teaspoon sugar
5 cups cooked red beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup cooked red beans, drained, rinsed, and pureed
salt to taste
pepper to taste
hot sauce to taste

Directions:
In a large pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.
Add andouille and beef and brown
Add the onions, celery, garlic, and all spices. Cook until soft
Deglaze the pan with the beer and cook until the foam subsides,
Add tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, and beans to the pot. Stir well and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes. Simmer longer to your desired thickness.
Season with salt, pepper, and hot sauce, to taste.
You can serve immediately. This chili is even better if you allow it to cool (safely below 41F within 2 hours) and reheat the following day.

Description: 
Andouille brings a subtle heat while Stout brings richness to this simple to make chili. Personally I use Left Hand Nitro Milk Stout.
