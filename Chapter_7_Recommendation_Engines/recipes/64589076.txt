Ingredients:
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed and cubed
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium shallot, minced
8 ounces thinly sliced mushrooms (your choice)
2 tablespoons white wine
1/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
3 tablespoons heavy cream or coconut cream
Fresh herbs for garnish

Directions:
Season chicken with pepper and salt on both sides.
In a medium saut√© pan heat oil over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook until done (about 7 minutes). Remove chicken from pan and set aside.
Add shallot to the pan and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 2 minutes. Pour in wine; simmer until almost evaporated, scraping up any browned bits, about 1 minute.
Add chicken broth and cook until reduced by half, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in cream then bring down to a simmer. Return the chicken to the pan, turn to coat with sauce and cook until heated through, about 1 minute.
Serve over your favorite side dish!
