Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup milk
lemon, zested and juiced
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 eggs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a loaf pan.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Mix milk, lemon juice, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl.
Beat butter and lemon zest with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add sugar and beat until fluffy again. Don't let butter get too warm. Beat in eggs one at a time, making sure each one is fully incorporated before adding the next.
Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk mixture, beating batter after each addition. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges and cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool.

Same taste as your grandmother's lemon pound cake, but fluffy like the slice at your local coffee shop! Serve with seasonal fruit, whipped cream, your favorite glaze, or just a cup of coffee. Pairs great with summer nights and a cup of tea.
