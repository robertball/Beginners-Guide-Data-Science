1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch single crust pie
1/4 cup chopped pecans
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 12 oz. container of cool whip
2 large bananas, sliced

1/2 cup chopped pecans toasted

Directions:
Knead together the pie dough and the 1/4 cup finely chopped pecans.  Line 9 inch pie pan with the pecan dough; bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15-20 minutes.  Let cool.
Beat cream cheese and confectioners' sugar until smooth, and spread in the pie shell.
Prepare chocolate pudding according to package instructions, but use 1/2 cup less milk. Set aside.  Spread  half of the cool whip over the cream cheese in the shell.  Lay sliced bananas on top of the cool whip, and cover with the chocolate pie filling.  Spread the other half of the cool whip over the bananas.  Sprinkle with chopped pecans, and refrigerate at least 3 hours before serving. Drizzle with chocolate syrup as you serve it desired
