Description: 
This is a common and colorful side dish for our summer cookouts. It's such a hit that I get complaints if I don't make it. Even the youngsters love this mix of fresh vegetable and light dressing! Regular black olives can be substituted for the Greek olives if you don't care for their flavor.
