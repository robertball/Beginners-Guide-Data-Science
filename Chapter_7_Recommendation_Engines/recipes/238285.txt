Ingredients:
Cupcakes:
2 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
2 cups brown sugar
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups water
1 over-ripe banana, mashed
1/2 cup canola oil
4 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup chocolate chips, or more to taste
Peanut Butter Icing:
1 cup chunky peanut butter
1/3 cup margarine, melted
1/3 cup coconut milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 24 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Whisk whole wheat flour, brown sugar, cocoa powder, and salt together in a large bowl.
Stir water, banana, canola oil, and apple cider vinegar together in a separate bowl; add to flour mixture and blend until batter is smooth. Stir in chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer cupcakes to wire wracks to cool completely.
Beat peanut butter and margarine together in a bowl with an electric mixer; add coconut milk and vanilla. Gradually beat confectioners' sugar into peanut butter mixture until icing is well-mixed.
Top cooled cupcakes with icing.

Description: 
This is a wonderful recipe that my vegan step-daughter gave me. So delicious and so healthy. My younger kids loved them! Top with chia seeds, black sesame seeds, or chocolate chips! I add whatever I want to the frosting; you could add peanut butter or peanut butter chips!
