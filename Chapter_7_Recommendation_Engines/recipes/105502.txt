Ingredients:
5 egg whites
1/3 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Lightly oil a 13x11-inch baking sheet.  Set aside.
Make Angel Bites.  Place egg whites in a medium mixing bowl.  Whip on high speed using an electric mixer or wire whisk until frothy.
Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, vanilla and salt.  Mix on high speed until medium-stiff peaks form (approx. 20-30 seconds with an electric mixer).
Spoon rounded tablespoons of egg whites onto prepared baking sheet.  Bake in preheated oven 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from pan.  Cool.
Assemble Angel Bites.  Just before serving, sandwich Angel Bites with filling of choice.  Place filling on the bottom of one Angel Bite and top with another so that the bottoms of the Angel Bites are facing each other and the filling is sandwiched between them.  Repeat with remaining Angel Bites.
