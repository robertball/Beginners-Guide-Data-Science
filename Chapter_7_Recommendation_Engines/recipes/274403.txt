Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
2 tablespoons white sugar, or as needed
2 cups white sugar
1 cup butter, softened
4 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Butter a 10-inch tube pan and cover with sugar.
Mix 2 cups sugar and 1 cup butter together using an electric mixer in a large bowl until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, making sure they are well incorporated. Stir in vanilla extract.
Whisk 2 3/4 cups flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Stir flour mixture gradually into the butter mixture until combined.
Coat peaches in remaining 1/4 cup flour; fold into the batter. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before flipping cake onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely.
