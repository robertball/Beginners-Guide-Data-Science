Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 small onion, diced
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs, or as needed
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2 eggs, slightly beaten
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix together the ground beef, onion, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, eggs, garlic, oregano, basil, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until just combined. Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions, then roll each of those portions into 4 meatballs. Arrange the meatballs on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is my version of meatballs based on experimentation from several different recipes, including my mother's. I like to use these in spaghetti sauce, of course, but they're also delicious in my meatball subs.  You can double or triple the recipe - sky's the limit! - and freeze.
