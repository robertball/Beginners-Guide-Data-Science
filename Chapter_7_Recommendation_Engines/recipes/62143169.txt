Ingredients:
1 medium sized yellow onion (chopped)
3 cloves garlic (minced)
1 Orange or Yellow bell pepper (chopped)
3 Portobello Mushroom caps (stems removed and washed)
1 teaspoon honey
2 tablespoons Apple Cider Vinegar
1 tablespoon Olive Oil
Salt
Pepper

Directions:
1. Heat up olive oil in skillet. Add garlic, onion, and pepper. Season with salt and pepper. Turn to medium heat and cook until peppers are soft. You can also turn to low heat and put a cover on top with a crack allowing steam to escape.
2. Once cooked through add Portobellos. Add Honey and Apple Cider Vinegar. Turn to low-medium heat and put cover on with a crack so steam can escape. The 'bite' in the vinegar will cook out leaving the flavor and some acidity. Cook until mushrooms are soft. Add more salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
I'm a student and don't have a lot of time to cook for myself. But instead of eating ramen I like to use recipes that are simple and quick to make. Serve with brown rice or on a sammich.
