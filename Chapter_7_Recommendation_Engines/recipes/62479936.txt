Ingredients:
3 pounds red potatoes
1/2 cup chopped onion (or 1 small onion)
1 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup Mt. Olive sweet salad cubes (a little larger sized pickle than relish; use coarsely chopped sweet pickles, if necessary)
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (Heinz All Natural)
1 tablespoon Gulden's spicy brown mustard (or one good squirt)
1 teaspoon celery seed
2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt
ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon dried dill weed
2 tablespoons dried parsley
6 hard boiled eggs, roughly chopped

Directions:
Wash potatoes and place in a large pot. Cover them with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are cooked through. Remove from water, let cool, and cut potatoes into slices or chunks.
In a bowl, stir together the onion, mayonnaise, salad cubes, apple cider vinegar, Gulden's mustard, celery seed, salt, pepper until well mixed.
Place the potatoes and eggs in a large salad bowl and sprinkle with dried dill weed and parsley. Pour the dressing over the potatoes and eggs and mix lightly. Cover and refrigerate salad for at least 30 minutes. Serve cold.
