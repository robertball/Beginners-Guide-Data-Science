Ingredients:
1 T Ginger
1 T Allspice
1 T Cloves
1 T Nutmeg
1 C Sugar
1 C Water
1/2 C Lemon Juice
1 C Apple Cider Vinegar
6 Apples

Directions:
Cut up the Apples into slices, I like to use one of those apple corer/slicers, and discard the core.
Place the apples into two large canning jars and pour 2 T of the lemon juice over the apples in each jar.
Bring the remaining ingredients to a boil on the stove.
Then pour the mixture into the jars with the apples.
The apples should be left in the refrigerator for at least a few hours before being served, a week would be better.
