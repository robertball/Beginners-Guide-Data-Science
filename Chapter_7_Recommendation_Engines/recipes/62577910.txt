1/3 cup boiling water
4 tbsp butter (softened, salted)

Directions:
In a medium bowl, pour boiling water over butter, sugar and vanilla-whisk until butter is melted and ingredients blend into a syrup.
Gradually add dry non-fat milk blending with handmixer (if you got a whisk attachment-this works better)blend really well.
Pour into container and refrigerate overnight.

Description: 
Never buy canned again!! This is the best version where its economical, very sweet, easy to make and better than the can itself!! Great for emergencies and use just like canned!! *Milk will thicken when refrigerated and lumps of non-fat milk will dissolve into the syrup.  Stir when needed (don't worry about it frothy on top-that's normal after settling).  Its better to make a day ahead before use.  Worth it and so yummie!!  I will post a low-fat, sugar-free version later.
