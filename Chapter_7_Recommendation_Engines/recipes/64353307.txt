1 T of favorite taco seasoning mix
1 T kosher salt
2 quarts of water

Mix water, tomato paste, taco mix, and salt in a stock pot.  Add chicken and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 1 hour.  Remove breasts one at a time from pot and shred with 2 forks.  As you shred the chicken add it to a casserole dish along with 3 cups of broth mixture.  Put all shredded chicken in the casserole and allow to cool.  The chicken will absorb the broth as it cools.
