Ingredients:
8oz Firm (Korean) tofu
4 green onion â€“ thinly sliced
Cooking oil 2 Tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp raw sugar
1 tsp sesame seeds
1/2 tsp sesame oil
1/4 tsp minced garlic

Directions:
Take out the tofu from the packaging and drain off the water. Gently pat dry the outer layer of tofu with some kitchen paper. Cut the tofu into bite sized pieces. (You can cut it into small cubes or cut into medium-sized rectangles, whichever you like). Gently pat dry both sides of the sliced tofu with some kitchen paper.
Preheat a (non-stick) frying pan on high heat and add some cooking oil and spread the oil across the pan.
Add the tofu and pan fry both sides until they turn golden brown (about 2 mins each side on high heat). Turn the heat off.
Stack the tofu in a shallow bowl and add the green onion. Pour the sauce around the tofu and green onion. Serve.
