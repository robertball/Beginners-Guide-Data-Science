Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 (300 grams) red potato
2 tbsp hot water
1/2 tsp Southwestern Chipolte flavor - Mrs. Dash
3/4 cup Egg beaters
2 tbsp Clint's Texas Salsa (optional)
15 sprays of "I can't believe it's not butter" topping spray (optional)

Directions:
Microwave one or two red potatoes that weigh about 300 grams (10.5 oz) until done.  Place in a non-stick-sprayed microwavable deep plastic container (one that will hold three eggs worth of extra liquid and egg rising while cooking!)
Moisten the potatoes with the hot water.  Sprinkle Mrs. Dash flavor into the bowl and stir into the potatoes(makes them less bland if they absorb the sprinkle now).
Pour the egg beaters onto the potatoes ...put more chipolte flavoring on the eggs....and stir.
Microwave for 1:30 minutes and then stir.... Microwave for another 1:20 min. to the texture you desire (don't make too dry! but don't under cook eggs!)
Add Salsa
Add topping spray gradually as you eat because its flavor disappears too quickly if used all at once.

Description: 
This is a zero cholesterol alternative (and fairly low sodium) to eggs with hash browns.  Add low sodium salsa (Clint's Texas Salsa) and/or I can't believe it's not butter spray to give added flavoring.
