Ingredients:
3 over-ripe bananas, mashed
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup vegetable oil
1 (15.25 ounce) package cake mix with candy bits (such as Pillsbury® Funfetti®), or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Beat bananas, cream cheese, and oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add cake mix and continue beating for 3 minutes more; spread into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
