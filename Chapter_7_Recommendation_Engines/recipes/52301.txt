Ingredients:
3/4 cup vegetable shortening
1/3 cup maple syrup
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 cups rolled oats
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup sunflower seeds
3/4 cup golden raisins
1/3 cup finely diced dried pineapple
1/3 cup pineapple juice
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Beat shortening, maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until combined. Stir oats, whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, sunflower seeds, golden raisins, dried pineapple, pineapple juice, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the shortening mixture to make a sticky dough.
Pinch off about 1 1/2 tablespoon of dough per cookie and roll into balls about 1 1/4 inch across; arrange on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
