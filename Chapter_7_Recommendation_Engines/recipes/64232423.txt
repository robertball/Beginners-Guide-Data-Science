Ingredients:
12oz  (about 1 cup) silken tofu or soy yogurt
2 teaspoons lemon juice
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar (or a drop or two of liquid stevia)
1/2 cup soy milk (or your favorite milk alternative)
1 large clove garlic or two smaller clove
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 Tablespoons minced chive
3 Tablespoons finely minced parsley
1 Tablespoon minced dill

Directions:
Blend everything in a blender until very smooth.  Store in an airtight container in your fridge for about a week - I'm being conservative here for safety's sake but I've kept it a few days past that. (You can half the recipe if you don't think you'll go through very much of it.)
