Description: 
Diners will ladle out praises all around the table when you serve this flavorful soup. 'My husband and three sons can't get enough of it,' says Maxine Pierson of San Ramon, California. 'I created this recipe for a dinner I hosted for a group of friends. The main course was Italian, and I needed a good soup, so I converted a favorite tortilla soup recipe by substituting pasta and adding different seasonings.'
