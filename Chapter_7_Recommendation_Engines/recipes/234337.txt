Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package lemon cake mix
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
4 large eggs
1 (3 ounce) package instant lemon pudding mix
zest of 1 lemon, or more to taste
1 tablespoon poppy seeds, or more to taste (optional)
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube cake pan.
Beat cake mix, sour cream, vegetable oil, lemon juice, eggs, pudding mix, zest, poppy seeds, and lemon extract in a bowl with an electric mixer on low speed for 1 minute. Increase speed to medium and beat for 3 minutes. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
