Ingredients:
2 tablespoons Goya Extra Virgin Olive Oil
2 1/2 pounds flank steak, cut in 3-inch x 4-inch pieces
Goya Adobo with Pepper, to taste
2 large yellow onions, finely chopped
1 1/2 green bell peppers, finely chopped
1 (6 ounce) jar Goya Sofrito
3 teaspoons Goya Minced Garlic
1 (8 ounce) can Goya Tomato Sauce
1 packet Sazon Goya with Coriander and Annatto
1 packet Goya Powdered Beef Bouillon
1/4 teaspoon Goya Ground Black Pepper
1 cup Goya Spanish Olives Stuffed with Minced Pimientos, sliced
1 (2 ounce) jar Goya Capers
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
2 cups cooked Canilla Extra Long Grain Rice

Directions:
Heat oil in large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Season meat with Adobo. Add steak to pot and cook in batches, flipping once, until well browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer meat to a plate. Lower heat to medium. Stir in onions and peppers. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes. Add sofrito and garlic to pot; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir in 3 cups of water, tomato sauce, Sazon, beef bouillon and pepper. Bring mixture to a boil. Return beef to pot. Lower heat to medium low and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Stir in olives and capers. Cover pot; simmer until meat shreds easily with fork, 1 - 1 1/2 hours, adding more water in 1/4 cup measurements, if pot becomes dry. Transfer meat to work surface; shred meat with two forks. Bring remaining sauce to a boil. Mix meat and cilantro into sauce. Serve with white rice.
