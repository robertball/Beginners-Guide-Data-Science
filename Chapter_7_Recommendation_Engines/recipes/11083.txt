Ingredients:
1 pinch salt
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 pounds ricotta cheese
1 teaspoon baking powder
4 eggs
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup milk
1 cup vegetable oil for frying
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar for decoration
4 cups cake flour

Directions:
In a large bowl; mix eggs, white sugar, and ricotta cheese until smooth and creamy. Stir in the vanilla and flour. If the batter is dry mix in a little of the milk.
In a frying pan over medium high heat, heat vegetable oil until hot. Drop teaspoonfuls of batter into the hot oil and fry until golden. Turn to cook cookies evenly. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain cookies on paper towels. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar if desired.
