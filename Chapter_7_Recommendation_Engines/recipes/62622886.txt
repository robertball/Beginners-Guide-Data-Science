Ingredients:
1 Tbsp veg. oil
1 1/2 lbs lean ground beef
2 cups chopped onion
2 Tbsp minced garlic
2 Tbsp chili powder
2 tsp Essence (see below for recipe)
2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 (15 oz) can whole peeled tomatoes, broken in pieces
3 Tbsp tomato paste
1 tsp sugar
2 cups water
6 all beef hot dogs, cooked
6 hot dog buns, lightly toasted

Directions:
Make the chili: Heat oil in a large, heavy pot over med/high heat. Add the meat and cook, stirring until it's browned and cooked through. Add the onion, garlic, chili powder, Essence, cumin, salt and pepper, and cook, stirring until soft. Add the squeezed tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar and water to the pot. Stir well and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the chili from sticking. Taste & adjust seasoning if necessary. Keep chili warm while you assemble the hot dogs.
Place hot dogs into the buns and spoon chili over hot dog. Top with assorted garnishes to taste.
