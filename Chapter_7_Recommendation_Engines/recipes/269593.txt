Ingredients:
2 medium onions, sliced
1/2 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
1/3 cup olive oil
1/3 cup white vinegar
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
2 (5 ounce) rib-eye steaks

Directions:
Combine onions, mushrooms, olive oil, vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and pepper in a medium bowl. Place steaks in a gallon-sized zip-top bag. Pour other ingredients over steaks. Seal and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; place steaks on top.
Broil steaks until hot and slightly pink in the center, about 8 minutes per side.
While steaks are broiling, pour onions, mushrooms, and remaining marinade into a saucepan. Simmer over medium-low heat until steaks are cooked. Serve sauce, onions, and mushrooms over steaks.
