Ingredients:
2 acorn squash
4 apples, cored and sliced
2 tablespoon butter
4 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup water

Directions:
To easily peel the acorn squash without losing a lot of vegetable, gently drop the squash in a large pot of boiling water, and boil for 15 minutes.  Pour off the boiling water and fill with cold water and let sit 5 minutes to cool.  When cool enough to handle, use a knife to slice off the peel on the ridges and use a teaspoon to dig out the peel in the valleys.  Slice the squash in half and remove the seeds and stem.  Then slice the halves into sections and finally cut into 1 inch chunks.
Place the squash chunks into a 9x13 dish along with the apples. Dot with pieces of butter. Sprinkle the brown sugar,  salt and cinnamon over the top. Add 1/2 cup water to the dish.  Bake at 350 degree for 55 min
