Ingredients:
cooking spray (optional)
4  frozen whole chicken breasts
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
8 ounces sour cream
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly spray the bottom of a 3-quart casserole dish with cooking spray.
Place chicken breasts in the prepared dish and top with mushrooms. Mix cream of mushroom soup, sour cream, and onion soup mix together in a bowl; pour over chicken and mushrooms. Cover dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
Tasty meal for a family on the go. This is one of my go-to meals when it's dinnertime and I haven't had the time to plan for our meal. Serve over pasta, rice, steamed veggies, or by itself.
