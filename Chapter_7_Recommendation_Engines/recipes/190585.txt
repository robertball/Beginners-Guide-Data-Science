Ingredients:
1 cup water
2 1/4 cups white sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 pound animal cracker cookies (tea biscuits), crushed
2 tablespoons cocoa powder
6 ounces dark chocolate, melted

Directions:
Place the water, sugar, and butter in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook and stir until the sugar and butter dissolve, about 10 minutes. Pour into a mixing bowl and cool to room temperature.
Stir the crushed animal crackers into the sugar mixture until evenly moistened; spread half the mixture into an 8x8-inch baking dish. Stir the cocoa powder into the remaining animal cracker mixture until smooth; spread into the baking dish over the lighter-colored layer. Spread the melted chocolate evenly over the bajadera.
Refrigerate overnight; cut into 16 pieces to serve.
