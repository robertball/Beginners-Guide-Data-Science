Ingredients:
1 tablespoon Sriracha hot sauce
2 teaspoons maple syrup
1 teaspoon melted butter
½ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
1  skinless, boneless chicken breast half

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Mix Sriracha sauce, maple syrup, melted butter, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl.
Place chicken in a baking dish. Pour maple-Sriracha mixture over the chicken; turn and coat thoroughly.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
