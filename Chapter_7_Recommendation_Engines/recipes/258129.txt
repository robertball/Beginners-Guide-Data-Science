Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 mini muffin tins with cooking spray.
Mix bananas in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until smooth. Blend in yogurt, sugar, butter, applesauce, eggs, and vanilla extract.
Mix whole wheat flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Pour into banana mixture; stir until moistened. Fold chocolate chips into the batter.
Scoop batter into the prepared muffin tins, filling each cup 2/3 full.

This is a recipe I came up with to get my picky eater to eat something else besides cereal. We called them chocolate chip cupcakes and he eats them up.
