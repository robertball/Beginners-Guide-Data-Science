Ingredients:
1 1/4 c. warm water
1/4 c. honey
1 pkg dry yeast
3 1/2 c. white whole wheat flour (divided)
1/2 c. wheat germ
1 T. vital wheat gluten
1 tsp. kosher salt
1 egg
2 T. oil

Directions:
Place water, honey and yeast in large mixing bowl. Let rest 10 mins until yeast foams. Stir in 1 c. flour, wheat germ, gluten, salt, egg and oil. Stir for 3-5 mins. Mixture should have no lumps. Let rest in warm place for 1 hr. (I preheat oven to 170 and shut it off then set bowl inside). Add remaining 2 1/2 cups, 1/2 c at a time and knead well. Dough will be slightly sticky. Divide into 16 pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Place on baking sheet (I use parchment paper) and flatten. Brush with water and sprinkle oats on top if desired. Let rest for 30 mins. (Flatten again, if desired) Bake @350 for 15 minutes, or until golden. Allow to cool.
