6 chicken thighs, with bone and skin
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
3 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper

For freezer meal:
Mix oil, vinegar, garlic, salt and pepper in small bowl.  Transfer marinade to freezer bag.  Add chicken to bag, turning to coat.  Freeze.
On serving day, thaw completely.  Place chicken, skin side up and well-coated with marinade into rimmed pan or dish.  Roast in a 350 degree oven until brown and cooked through, about 35-40 minutes.  Chicken may also be grilled over medium-hot grill until cooked through, turning once.  Serve with salad, tomatoes and cheese biscuits.
