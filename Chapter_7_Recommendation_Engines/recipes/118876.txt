1 pound pork tenderloin, sliced
2 cups broccoli florets
2 cups sliced carrots
1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained

2 green onions, sliced
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
4 teaspoons sesame oil
1 teaspoon ground ginger
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
Divide pork, broccoli, carrots, water chestnuts, green pepper and onions evenly among four pieces of double-layered heavy-duty foil (about 18 in. x 12 in.). Combine the soy sauce, sesame oil and ginger; drizzle over pork and vegetables. Fold foil around filling and seal tightly.
Grill, covered, over medium heat for 8-10 minutes or until vegetables are tender and pork is no longer pink. Serve with rice if desired.
