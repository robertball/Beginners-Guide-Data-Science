Ingredients:
1 lb. lean ground beef
1 med. to large onion chopped
1-2 green peppers (depending on size and taste) chopped
8 oz. Velveta cut into half inch chunks
1 can cream of mushroom soup
a little milk
2 cups uncooked macaroni
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
1. In your pasta pot or large sauce pan, put water on to boil for macaroni.
2. In a large skillet, brown ground beef with onion.
3. Add green pepper to beef/onion mixture just before beef is brown and cook until peppers are soft. (At this point, I usually add quite a bit of salt and pepper.)
4. Add macaroni to water and cook until finished; drain.
5. Add cheese, soup and a little milk to beef mixture to create what seems like a very thick beef sauce.
6. Combine pasta and beef mixture, serve and enjoy!

Description: 
This recipe came about because I wanted to use up green peppers from the garden. It's quick, easy and even my picky friends have asked for the recipe.
