Description: 
I needed a quick and easy side dish to take to our friend's house for their son's bithday.  This dish needed to be something that would be able to be outside for a few hours (so mayo wasn't an option)and be pretty, so this is what I came up with.  The variety of ingredients all tied together with the salad dressing was perfect.  So much so that I took home an empty bowl!
