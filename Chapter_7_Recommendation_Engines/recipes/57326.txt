1/2 cup light brown sugar
1 cup distilled white vinegar

1 tablespoon black pepper
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice

Description: 
Using fewer habanero peppers can reduce the spiciness in this extremely hot habanero hot sauce.  The sauce works wonders as a pick-up for Bloody Mary drinks.  Flavors meld wonderfully and the sauce keeps nicely for a long time.  Warning: A dash is all you need and it is best to use gloves when handling the habanera peppers.
