Description: 
I have been cooking for just my husband and me for the last 30 years. I come up with new recipes for two all the time. This recipe works well when you've had a busy day and can't spend much time cooking, but you still want a very special meal. -Betty Biehl, Mertztown, PennsylvaniaModified from: French Veal Chops
