Ingredients:
2 pounds skirt steak, pounded flat
10 (.18 ounce) packets sazon seasoning with coriander and achiote, such as Goya®
1 tablespoon white pepper
1/2 (12 fluid ounce) bottle Mexican beer (such as Corona®)

Directions:
Sprinkle each piece of skirt steak with the sazon and white pepper. Stack the seasoned steaks in a deep dish as you season them. Pour the beer over the steaks. Cover the dish and refrigerate for 2 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove the steaks from the dish and discard the marinade.
Cook the skirt steaks on the prepared grill until they are very firm, hot, and gray in the center, 7 to 10 minutes per side.
