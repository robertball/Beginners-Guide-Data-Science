Ingredients:
1 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2 tablespoons pitted, halved kalamata olives
1 tablespoon finely chopped red onion
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
Zest and juice from half a lemon
Couple good pinches of salt
A few grinds of black pepper
A few glugs of olive oil

Directions:
Mix everything but the olive oil in a small to midsize bowl. Very lightly smash the chickpea mixture with the back of a fork or a potato masher. Youâ€™re not looking for a hummus-like puree but something closer to a coarse chop with a few smaller bits to hold it together. Add the glugs of olive oil, mix it lightly and enjoy.
