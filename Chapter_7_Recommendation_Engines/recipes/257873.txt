Ingredients:
3  eggs
½ cup soy sauce
⅓ cup white sugar
¾ cup cornstarch
⅓ cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons sesame seeds
1 teaspoon salt
4  green onions, chopped
3 cloves garlic, diced
3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
oil for frying

Directions:
Whisk eggs, soy sauce, and sugar together in a large bowl.
Combine cornstarch, flour, sesame seeds, and salt in a separate bowl. Whisk in egg mixture. Fold green onions and garlic into the batter.
Stir chicken into the batter until each piece is coated. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to 2 days. Stir 1 to 2 times per day.
Fill a heavy saucepan with 1 1/2 to 2 inches of oil. Heat on medium-high heat until a small amount of batter sizzles when dropped in.
Stir chicken again to coat evenly with batter. Fry in batches until deeply browned, about 3 minutes per batch. Drain on a large plate lined with paper towels or newspapers.

Description: 
This is my family's recipe, originally preserved on a printed email from a neighbor that dates back to when we lived in Mililani. Sauce is optional - we've always eaten it without. Large chopsticks are recommended for frying. Enjoy with white or fried rice!
