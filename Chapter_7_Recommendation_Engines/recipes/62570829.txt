Ingredients:
1 package of frozen chicken tenderloins
1 can of cream of chicken soup
1 can of stewed tomatoes
1 can of red or green enchilada sauce
1 packet of taco seasoning
1 med. size sour cream
1 small can of green chiles (optional)
1 package of fiesta blend cheese
6-8 soft shell tortillas

Directions:
Place frozen chicken in crockpot with cream of chicken soup, tomatoes, enchilada sauce, taco seasoning and optional chiles.
Cook on high heat for about 4-6 hours, till chicken is cooked through and tender.
Use a utensil that will allow you to shred chicken up in crockpot (I use potato masher).
Stir in sour cream.
Use a 9x13 pan and begin loading tortillas with mixture and rolling them up in pan. Once you fill pan with around 6-8 enchiladas, top with cheese and place in oven at 375' for about 30 minutes (until cheese melts and begins to get crispy).
Pull out and serve. You can top with leftover sauce in crockpot if you desire.
