Ingredients:
2 cups water
1/4 cup diced onion
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup white rice
2 frozen white fish fillets, unthawed
2 tablespoons sliced almonds
1 cup frozen peas, thawed

Directions:
Heat water, onion, butter, curry powder, and salt in a large skillet over medium heat until butter is melted, about 2 minutes. Stir rice into onion mixture and arrange frozen white fish over rice. Sprinkle with almonds.
Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Fish should be heated through, and the flesh should be opaque and flake easily. Mix in peas and fluff rice with a fork before serving.

Description: 
I don't know where my mom found this recipe, but I remember eating it when I was little. This is a great recipe for when you don't have time to watch everything in the kitchen, but it's nice enough that I've served it to company!
