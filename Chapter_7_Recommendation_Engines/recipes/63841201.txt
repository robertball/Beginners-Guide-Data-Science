Pumpkin Bread:
2 cups canned pumpkin
3 eggs
1 egg whites
1 1/2 cups flour
1/2 cup white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 t baking soda
2 t pumpkin pie spice
Cream Cheese filling:
8 oz reduced fat cream cheese (room temperature or softened slightly)
4 tbsp sugar
1 egg
2 tsp flour
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Prepare 1 mini loaf pan (should hold 8 loaves) or 2 9x5 loaf pans with nonstick spray.
Bread Layers:
In the bowl of your stand mixer or hand mixer combine pumpkin, eggs & egg white until smooth.
In a separate medium bowl whisk together flour, sugars, baking soda & pumpkin pie spice.
Slowly add dry ingredients into the wet mixing until just smooth, set aside.
Cream Cheese Layer:
In another bowl either for your stand mixer or hand mixer combine all ingredients until smooth.
Bread Assembly:
Pour or spoon half of the pumpkin bread mixture into bottom of mini loaf pan or large loaf pan.
Evenly divide cream cheese mixture over pumpkin bread mixture & smooth out using back of a spoon.
Pour remaining pumpkin bread mixture over cream cheese mixture, covering as much as you can.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Let cool for about 10-15 minutes and then remove from the pans.
