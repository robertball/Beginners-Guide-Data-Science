Description: 
For perfectly prepared pork chops (prefer bone in) you must brine them for at least 1-2 hours and pick chops that are at least 1/2 to 1 inch thickness. I will say the success to this dish is the brine for moistness. There are many brine variations out there for what flavor you are wanting to accomplish but, it is an important part of the overall dish I will say.
