Ingredients:
6 Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs
1 Jalapeno Pepper
1 Shallot
4 Garlic Cloves
1/2 tsp Dried Parsley
1/2 tsp Dried Thyme
3 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 Lime
1 Tbsp Honey
1/2 cup White Wine
1/2 cup Chicken Broth
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
In a food processor, puree jalapeno (with or without seeds), garlic, shallot, 1 Tbsp olive oil, salt and pepper. Mix in dried parsley and dried thyme. Rub the mixture on chicken thighs and allow to marinate up to 24 hours, if you'd like. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In an ovenproof skillet, heat 2 Tbsp of olive oil and sear marinated chicken until golden brown. Remove chicken and adjust the heat to low. Pour the wine into the skillet and scrape the bottom of the skillet to loosen the brown bits. Add the juice of the lime and the honey. Allow the sauce to reduce just a bit. Return the chicken to the skillet with the sauce and add the chicken broth. Put the skillet with the chicken and sauce in the oven and cook for 20 minutes or until the sauce has reduced/thickened.
