Ingredients:
2 pkgs active dry yeast
1 3/4 c warm water (110-115 degrees F)
1/2 c sugar
1 T salt
5 1/2 to 6 c flour
1 egg
3/4 c butter or margarine

Directions:
Sprinkle yeast over warm water in large bowl; stir to dissolve.  Add sugar, salt and about half the flour.  Beat with an electric mixer or by hand until mixture is smooth.
Add egg and shortening.  Beat to mix.  Mix in remaining flour with hands or a spoon until dough is easy to handle.  Shape into a ball and place in oiled (I use spray) zip-lock or other plastic bag, allowing room for dough to rise.  Or place in lightly greased bowl, turn greased side up and cover with aluminum foil.
Place dough in refrigerator and let rise a minimum of 2 hours, or until doubled, before using.  Punch down dough every day until you use it.
Two hours before you want to serve hot rolls, punch down dough and shape as desired.  Brush tops with melted butter; cover and let rise in warm place until nearly doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.
Bake @ 400 degrees in preheated oven 12 to 15 minutes.  Makes about 3 dozen average size rolls.

Description: 
Yeast dough that rises in the refrigerator and can be used up to 5 days later if refrigerated.  Having this in the refrigerator makes it easy to serve hot rolls, and the dough can be seasoned in small amounts to compliment the main dish being served at that meal.
