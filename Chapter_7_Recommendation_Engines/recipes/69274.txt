Ingredients:
3 cups water
1 1/2 cups dry couscous
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small white onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup marinated artichoke hearts, liquid reserved
2 teaspoons capers, liquid reserved
12 small green olives
1 (14.5 ounce) can chopped stewed tomatoes, drained
2 tablespoons white wine (optional)
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 cup water
2 teaspoons sumac powder
1 1/2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
ground black pepper to taste
1 pound tilapia fillets, cut into chunks

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, bring 3 cups water to a boil, and stir in the couscous. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit 5 minutes.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the onion and green pepper about 5 minutes, until tender. Mix in the garlic, and continue to cook and stir about 2 minutes. Mix in the artichoke hearts with reserved liquid, capers with reserved liquid, and olives. Stir in the tomatoes, wine, lemon juice, and 1 cup water (or enough to attain desired thickness). Season with sumac powder, red pepper, basil, cumin, ginger, and pepper.
Bring the mixture to a boil, and mix in the fish chunks. Reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes, or until the fish is easily flaked with a fork. Serve over couscous.
