Ingredients:
Mexican Salad with Creamy Avocado Dressing
For the dressing:
1 large avocado (I used a large Fuerte avocado, which is a bit sweeter than the typical Hass avocado)

1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon hot sauce (omitted)
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 garlic cloves, pureed
3/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a food processor or blender and process until smooth and creamy. Taste and adjust seasonings. Cover and refrigerate. Toss salad with dressing right before serving.
