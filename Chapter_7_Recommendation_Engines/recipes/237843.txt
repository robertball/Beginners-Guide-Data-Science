Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
1/2 pound ground sausage
1 (1.2 ounce) package creamy pesto sauce mix (such as KnorrÂ®)
1 cup milk
1/4 cup olive oil

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook penne at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain and transfer pasta to a bowl.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; add to pasta.
Whisk pesto sauce mix, milk, and olive oil together in a small saucepan; bring to a boil while stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low and keep at a simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes; pour over pasta and sausage mixture and toss to coat.
