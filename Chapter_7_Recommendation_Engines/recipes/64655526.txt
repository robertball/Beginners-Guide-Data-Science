Ingredients:
3 tablespoons coarsely chopped pecans
1/4 cup dark brown sugar
4 tablespoons butter
1 to 2 tablespoons bourbon or water
4 salmon fillets, about 6 to 8 ounces each
Salt and freshly ground pepper
Olive oil

Directions:
Lightly toast the pecans in a dry skillet over medium-low heat.  When the pecans are lightly browned and aromatic, add the brown sugar, butter, and bourbon or water; heat until simmering. Set aside.
Heat oven to 425 F.
In an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat; heat the olive oil. Add salmon, skin side down and sear for about 2 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast the fillets for 5 minutes. Spoon glaze over the fillets and continue roasting for about 3 to 5 minutes longer, or until salmon flakes easily with a fork.
Turn the oven off and let salmon stand in the oven for 2 minutes.
