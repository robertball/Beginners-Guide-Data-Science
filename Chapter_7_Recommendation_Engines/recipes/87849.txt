Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (8 ounce) package baby portobello mushrooms, sliced and chopped
4 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams with juice
4 cubes chicken bouillon
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 (16 ounce) package uncooked linguini pasta
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Warm olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic and mushrooms; cook until mushrooms are tender. Stir in clam juice, chicken bouillon, parsley, basil, oregano, and Worcestershire sauce. Increase heat to high, and bring to a quick boil. Reduce heat to medium; simmer 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8-10 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Stir chopped clams and butter into the sauce; simmer 15 minutes more. Pour over cooked pasta to serve.

Description: 
This is one of my all-time favorite meals. What makes the clam sauce so flavorful is the chicken bouillon, Worcestershire sauce, and baby portobello mushrooms. I recommend having this with some garlic bread and a nice glass of red wine. A very satisfying meal.
