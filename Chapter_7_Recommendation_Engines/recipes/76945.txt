Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
2 garlic cloves, peeled
2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary
1 (16 ounce) can white beans, undrained

Directions:
Place olive oil, garlic and rosemary in a 10-inch skillet. Heat pan until ingredients start to sizzle. Add beans and their liquid to the pan. As beans cook, mash them with a wooden spoon or potato masher. Cook until mixture is a loose spread consistency (it will thicken as it cools). Transfer to a serving bowl or storage container.
