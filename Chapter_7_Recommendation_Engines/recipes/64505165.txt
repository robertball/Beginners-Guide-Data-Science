Ingredients:
1 lb of Prosciutto
1.15 lb Chicken Thighs
Sea Salt
2 Onions, sliced
5 c (100 g) Kale, ribs removed & chopped
3 c (325 g) Cooked Spaghetti Squash strands
Smoked Sea Salt, for serving

Directions:
In a cast-iron skillet fry the proscuitto over medium high heat, flipping as necessary. When the proscuitto is crisp, remove from the pan & reserve for garnish at the end.
Leave the drippings in the pan.
Sprinkle the chicken thighs with salt & saut√© them in the bacon drippings until they reach an internal temperature of 165 F.
Transfer the cooked chicken thighs to a cutting board.
In the same pan, with the drippings from the bacon & chicken, caramelize the onions over low heat, stirring occasionally. This process may take more than 20 minutes.
Once the onions are golden brown, increase the heat to medium low and add the chopped kale & cook, stirring occasionally, until the kale wilts slightly.
Meanwhile, chop up the cooked chicken thighs.
Add the spaghetti squash to the skillet.
Toss to combine.
Add the chicken pieces & continue to cook until heated through.  Chop the cooked proscuitto & sprinkle, along with some smoked salt (or other pink or sea salt) and serve.
Store any leftovers in the refrigerator or freeze for longevity.
