Description: 
My mum loves avocados and coconut milk. Since we have an avocado tree and coconut cream on hand, I tried making this fusion ice cream and it's heavenly.  The avocado lends a lovely, appetizing color, and it has the nice aroma of coconut. Simply irresistible. Definitely something different to impress your guests.
