1/2 cup frozen blueberries
4 cups fresh spinach

2 ice cubes, or as desired (optional)

Directions:
Layer yogurt, banana, and blueberries in a blender, respectively. Add as much spinach to blender that will fit; pour in water. Blend on high speed until smooth, adding the remaining spinach if needed. Add ice for a colder and thicker smoothie. Add more water for a thinner smoothie.
