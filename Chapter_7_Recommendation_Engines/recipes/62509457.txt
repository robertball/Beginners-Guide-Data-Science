Ingredients:
2 large baking potatoes, cut into medium size chunks
1/4 white onion - coarsely chopped
1 T. minced garlic
salt and pepper to taste
2 Tablespoons olive oil - add more if needed to coat potatoes
2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce - chopped fine
chorizo sausage - finely diced - to taste
1-2 tablespoons adobo sauce - to taste - makes the dish spicey and hot.

Directions:
Heat olive oil in pan at medium high until very hot. Add onions and quickly brown slightly.  This is not to cook the onions, but to quicky sear them.  Remove pan from heat and add other ingredients and mix.  Place all ingredients in an oven safe dish lined with enough aluminum foil to form a pouch around the potatoes.  Bake in foil pouch at 400 degrees until potatoes are almost done - about 20 minutes.  Open foil and continue baking until potatoes are tender and slightly browned.
