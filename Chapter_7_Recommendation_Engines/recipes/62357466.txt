Ingredients:
1 cup warm water
2 Tbsp canola oil
1/4 cup (or 4 Tbsp) honey
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
1 cup wheat flour
2 cups bread flour
1 tsp (Morton Lite)salt
2 1/4 tsp yeast

Directions:
Put ingredients in a bread machine in the order listed except yeast.  Smooth out the top of the flour and then make a small valley in the middle of it for the yeast. Add dry "bread machine" yeast. Put the machine on the dough cycle with a 10 minute rest period at the beginning(wheat bread ingredients should rest for 10 minutes before the machine starts to mix). When cycle ends, pull out dough and place in a greased 5x9 loaf pan. Punch out the air bubbles. Cover with a piece of greased waxed paper and place a clean kitchen towel over the wax paper. Let the dough rise another hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees 45 minutes into 2nd rise. After 2nd rise is complete, uncover bread and bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.  Let bread cool on a wire rack before cutting.
