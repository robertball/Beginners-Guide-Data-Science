Ingredients:
2 tablespoons tandoori masala powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon ground ginger
½ teaspoon amchur powder
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 ½ pounds chicken breasts
½ cup whole-milk buttermilk

Directions:
Combine tandoori masala, onion powder, garlic powder, ginger, amchur powder, and cayenne pepper in a bowl. Rub mixture onto chicken breasts and coat with buttermilk in a bowl. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove chicken from marinade and arrange over a greased or lined sheet pan. Discard any extra marinade.
Roast chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 25 to 30 minutes.
