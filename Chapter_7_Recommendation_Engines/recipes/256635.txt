Ingredients:
1/4 cup apricot preserves
1 1/2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 teaspoons apricot preserves
1 teaspoon whole-grain mustard
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 (8 ounce) salmon fillets, cut 1 1/4-inch thick
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 cups baby arugula
1 cup cherry tomatoes (optional)

Directions:
Mix 1/4 cup apricot preserves, 1 1/2 tablespoon mustard, and 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar in a bowl to make glaze. Divide glaze between 2 separate bowls.
Whisk 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, 2 teaspoon apricot preserves, 1 teaspoon mustard, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Drizzle in 1/4 cup olive oil, whisking constantly, until dressing is emulsified.
Preheat Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven to Medium-High on the "Grill" setting.
Brush 1 teaspoon of olive oil over both sides of each piece of salmon. Season with salt and pepper.
Place salmon flesh-side down in the center of the grill pan. Set timer for 3 1/2 minutes and press "Start." Flip salmon so skin side is down. Brush with glaze from one of the bowls. Set timer for 4 minutes and press "Start." Remove salmon to a plate and spoon glaze from the second bowl on top. Let salmon rest for 5 minutes.
Place 1 1/2 cup arugula and 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes on each serving plate. Drizzle with dressing. Top with cooked salmon fillets.
