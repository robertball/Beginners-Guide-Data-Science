Ingredients:
2 Cups light corn syrup
2 Cups firmly packed brown sugar
4 tsp baking soda (measure out and sift ahead of time  you don’t want clumps in your candy  blech.)

Directions:
Before you start, prep everything. The cooking is slow, but once you add that baking soda, you need to move fast and have everything ready to go.
Line a 13 x 9 cake pan with aluminum foil and either brush with butter or spray with cooking spray. (I spray.) You can use a larger pan, but no smaller. I use a Pyrex cake pan and the foamy candy tries to overflow but just barely stays contained by the flaps of foil. But you kind of want it in the smaller pan so that the cooled candy is thick. What happens is that the middle third of the candy is the foamiest, with the top third and bottom third being a little firmer and more like the Macey’s candy. If you pour the hot candy into a larger pan, I’m afraid you’d lose that yummy middle layer and end up with all firm, which isn’t the point.
Pour the sugar and corn syrup into a VERY large, heavy cooking pot. (Adding the baking soda will make the syrup foam up, so you want plenty of room in that pot for expansion.) Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves. Continue cooking, without stirring, to 300°F on a candy thermometer, about 15 minutes. It’s easy to burn, so don’t be impatient and turn up the heat.
Remove from heat and stir in baking soda, mixing well. The syrup will foam up. Make sure your mix it pretty thoroughly so there aren’t any pockets of baking soda next to thick, unfoamed candy, but at the same time, mix quickly so you don’t lose the foam effect. Quickly pour into the prepared pan. Allow to set at room temperature until firm. Invert pan and peel off foil. Break into pieces. Coat in chocolate if desired.

Description: 
This is a rare treat that you normally only see in candy shops. We make this every year for Christmas and my family loves it. Don't give up if it doesn't come out well on your first attempt. I've thrown out several batches of this in my attempt to learn how to make it.
