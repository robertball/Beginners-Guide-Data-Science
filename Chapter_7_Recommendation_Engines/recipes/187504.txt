Description: 
This easy soup is hearty, yet extremely tasty. This is really a form of chili, but uses some ingredients not found in regular chili.  Sure to be a hit, you can adjust the spice as needed by using varying levels of jalapenos and RO*TEL® varieties. Top with shredded sharp Cheddar cheese and/or sour cream. Serve with tortilla chips. Leftovers can be frozen and enjoyed later.
