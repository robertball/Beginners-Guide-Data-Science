Ingredients:
1 lb. navy beans
pinch baking soda
1 onion, chopped
1/2 C. molasses
2 T. brown sugar
2 tsp. dry mustard
2 tsp. salt
1 tsp. pepper
1/4 lb. salt pork or bacon, sliced 1/4 in. thick

Directions:
Add beans to a large saucepan and add water to cover them at least 1 inch. Soak overnight, drain and rinse.
Preheat oven to 275 degrees. Cover the beans with fresh water and add a pinch of baking soda.  Bring to a boil over medium high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the skins of the beans flake when you blow on them. Drain again, but do not rinse.
Stir in the onion, molasses, brown sugar, dry mustard, salt and pepper into the beans.
Into the crock-pot, place 1/2 of the salt pork.  Add bean mixture and enough water to just barely cover them. Place the remaining salt pork slices on top of the beans.
Cook on low for 8 - 10 hours adding water as needed to keep the beans just barely covered - about every hour or so. DO NOT STIR THE BEANS!
