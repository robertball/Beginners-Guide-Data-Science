https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/710464.jpg
Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl with electric mixer on high speed until fluffy.  Beat in remaining ingredients except flour until well blended.
On low speed, beat in flour just until blended.
Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls 1 1/2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.  Sprinkle with sugar or almonds.
Bake 10 to 12 minutes until edges are lightly browned.  Cool on cookie sheet 1 minute before removing to wire rack to cool completely.  Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week.  HINT:  These cookies will have a nicely browned edge if baked on a regular thin cookie sheet rather than a thick or insulated one.

Description: 
Great fresh lemon taste in a chewy little cookie with a nice crisp brown edge.  If you don't have the almonds, you can substitute 1/4 cup additional sugar instead.
