Description: 
Beautiful and satisfying, this breakfast-in-a-glass will keep you going all morning long. It's also great as an after school snack or late afternoon pick me up. All ages love it because it tastes just like an orange-coated ice cream bar. To save the remaining half of the avocado, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate to use in a salad, spread on toast or add to tomorrow's smoothie breakfast.
