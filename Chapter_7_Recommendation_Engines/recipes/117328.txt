Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package manicotti shells
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 (26 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
14 (1 ounce) pieces string cheese
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Cook manicotti according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the spaghetti sauce. Spread half of the meat sauce into a greased 13-in.x 9-in.x 2-in. baking dish.
Drain manicotti; stuff each shell with a piece of string cheese. Place over meat sauce; top with remaining sauce. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 24-30 min. or until heated through. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Bake, uncovered, for 5-10 minutes or until the cheese is melted.

Description: 
Even kids can help assemble this simplified Italian entree from Suzanne Runtz of Charlestown, South Carolina. She fills each pasta shell with a piece of string cheese for a deliciously gooey center, then tops the manicotti with a beefy tomato sauce.
