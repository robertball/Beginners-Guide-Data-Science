Ingredients:
For the Dough:
1/2 c warm water
1 c warm milk
1 T sugar
1 T yeast
1 beaten egg
1/2 c orange juice
1/2 c melted butter
1 T orange extract
4 T instant vanilla pudding mix
1 t salt
7 cups bread flour
For the filling:
1/2 cup softened butter
2 T orange zest
1 t orange extract
3/4 c sugar
Frosting:
1 8oz cream cheese Softened
1/2 c butter softened
2 t orange extract
2 cups powdered sugar
2-4 T milk

Directions:
In a large bowl dissolve 1 T sugar and yeast in warm water, and milk. Let sit 5 minutes until foamy. Add egg, orange juice, melted butter, orange extract, and instant pudding. Mix to combine. Stir in 5 cups of flour and salt until dough comes together. Add in remaining 2 cups of flour as needed. Knead dough for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place dough in oiled bowl, cover with a clean cloth, and let rise in a warm place until doubled. About 1 1/2 hours.
While dough is rising combine 1/2 c softened butter, orange zest and orange extract. Set aside.
Turn dough out on a floured surface and roll out into a 24x12 rectangle. Spread butter mixture evenly over dough. Sprinkle with sugar. Roll the dough up the dough, starting with the long side. Slice into 18 1 1/2 inch rolls. Unflavored floss works best.
Place rolls into greased baking sheet or pans. Cover with plastic wrap and put into fridge over night.
When ready to bake remove rolls from the fridge and let them rise in a warm place for 30 minutes while preheating the oven to 350.
Bake rolls for 25-30 minutes.
While the rolls are baking mix together the cream cheese and butter until smooth. Stir in orange extract and powdered sugar. Add milk until desired consistency is reached. Frost rolls.

Description: 
My son loves the orange rolls that comes in a can. But he wanted them homemade. After trying a couple recipes and none of them meeting his approval, I came up with my own. After getting thumbs up AND a High five from my son I finally had a recipe! These are made over night and baked in the morning.
