Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 3/4 cups flour
1 cup sugar
4 oz. pkg. German sweet chocolate, melted
2 eggs
3/4 tsp. baking soda
1/4 tsp. salt
1/2 cup chopped pecans
2 oz. vanilla chips
2 tsp. Crisco or butter

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat butter with an electric mixer on medium to high speed about 30 seconds or till softened. Add about half of the flour to the butter. Then add the sugar, melted chocolate, eggs, baking soda, and salt. Beat till thoroughly combined, scraping the sides of the bowl. Then beat or stir in the remaining flour. Stir in chopped pecans.
Drop dough by rounded teaspoons 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake on the middle rack of the oven at 375 for 10-12 minutes or till cookies are set. Remove the cookies and cool completely on racks.
In a small heavy saucepan melt vanilla chips and shortening over low heat, stirring occasionally. Drizzle over the tops of the cookies.
