Ingredients:
4 bacon strips
3 pounds fresh green beans
1 cup butter
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon lemon or lime zest

Directions:
Place green beans into a large skillet or medium saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until beans start to soften, about 10 minutes.
While beans are simmering, microwave bacon strips for about two minutes on high or until crisp.  Let cool, then crumble.  Set aside.
Drain water. Add butter and bacon crumbles to green beans; cook and stir until butter is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
Cook and stir garlic with green beans until garlic is tender and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes.
Add lemon or lime zest the last minute.  Serve while hot!
