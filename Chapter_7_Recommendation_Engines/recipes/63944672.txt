Ingredients:
3 and 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
pinch of salt
4 eggs
grated peel of 1 medium lemon
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons butter(softened)
icing sugar for dusting.(also known as confectioner's sugar).

Directions:
Heat oven to 375F. Sift the flour into a large bowl and make a well in the center. Add in sugar, salt, eggs, grated lemon peel and softened butter. Mix together  with a wooden spoon until the ingredients are well blended. Knead the mixture  thoroughly until smooth and pliable and shape into a ball . Cover and put in the fridge for 1 hour. On a floured board roll out the pastry a third at a time to about 1/4 inch thick and cut with cookie cutters into what shape you like. Place the cookies 1/2 inch apart on greased cookie sheets.( parchment paper works fine also)
Bake for about 1/4 hour or until light brown.  When done  cool and dust with icing sugar. ** see notes**
The butter can be replaced with Earth Balance or Becel Vegan spread, or
Natrel lactose free butter to make it dairy free.
