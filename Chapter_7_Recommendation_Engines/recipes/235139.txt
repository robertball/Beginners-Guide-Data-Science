Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) eggplants
Olive oil as needed
4 eggs
4 tablespoons water
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
4 1/2 cups seasoned bread crumbs, divided
2 cups marinara sauce
1 bunch fresh basil leaves, chiffonade
1 pound fresh mozzarella, sliced 1/8-inch thick
8 ounces deli-sliced Margherita® pepperoni, sliced thin

Directions:
Slice each eggplant lengthwise into slices about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.
In a large skillet, add olive oil (approximately 1/4 inch deep) and heat for frying.
In a bowl, mix eggs and water together. On a large plate, mix grated Parmigiana-Reggiano cheese and 4 cups seasoned breadcrumbs together. Dip eggplant into the egg mixture, then the breadcrumb mixture. Place breaded eggplant slices into skillet and fry until golden brown, rotating once if necessary. Remove from skillet.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees  F.
In an 8 by 12-inch baking dish, place the 4 largest eggplant slices, evenly spaced apart from each other. Over each slice, spread 1/4 cup of tomato sauce and sprinkle with a teaspoon of basil. Place one slice of mozzarella and 3 slices pepperoni over each slice and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon grated Parmigiano. Place the smaller slices of eggplant over each of the disks and repeat with tomato sauce, basil, pepperoni and the 2 cheeses. Repeat the layering again until all the ingredients are used.
Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs over the top of the eggplant dish, and bake uncovered until the cheese is melted and the tops turn light brown, about 20 minutes.
