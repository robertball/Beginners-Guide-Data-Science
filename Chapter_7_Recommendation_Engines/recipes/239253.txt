Ingredients:
2 pounds large (21 to 30 count) raw shrimp, peeled, deveined and tails removed
Marinade:
1/4 cup Mazola速 Corn Oil
1 cup fresh orange juice
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
4 cloves finely minced fresh garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons Spice Islands速 Ancho Chile
1 1/2 teaspoons Spice Islands速 Oregano

1/4 cup loosely packed fresh cilantro, minced
Lettuce Tacos:
4 large heads butter lettuce*
1/2 cup crumbled queso fresco cheese
2 avocados, cubed
Fresh lime wedges

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium high heat or about 400 degrees F. Place shrimp in a large resealable plastic bag or mixing bowl and set aside. Combine marinade ingredients in a small bowl; whisk until combined. Pour mixture over prepared shrimp, stir to coat and set aside to marinate for 10 minutes.
Separate lettuce leaves into 18 to 20 "cups." Rinse and pat dry; cover and chill until ready to serve. Spray grill with grill spray. Remove shrimp from marinade and discard marinade. Grill shrimp over medium direct heat for 2 to 3 minutes per side or until curled, firm and cooked through. Transfer cooked shrimp to a bowl. To assemble tacos, arrange chilled lettuce "cups," open side facing up on a serving platter. Spoon 3 shrimp into each lettuce cup, add a few avocado cubes, sprinkle with cheese, garnish with cilantro and serve immediately with lime wedges.
