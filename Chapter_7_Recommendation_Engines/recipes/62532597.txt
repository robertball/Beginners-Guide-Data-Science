1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

2 cups leftover mashed sweet potatoes
4 large eggs, at room temperature
3/4 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease two 9-inch loaf pans with baking spray. In a medium bowl, sift next six ingredients.
In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium, cream butter, sugars, and vanilla until light and fluffy.  Blend in sweet potatoes, then eggs, one at a time.  With mixer on low, add flour mixture in thirds; combine just enough to blend.
Spoon batter evenly into prepared pans.  Sprinkle pecans over batter.  Bake until cakes test clean when a skewer is inserted into centers.  70 to 80 minutes.  Cool completely on wire rack.
