Ingredients:
1 bunch kale
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon minced garlic

Directions:
Soak kale leaves in a large bowl of water until dirt and sand begin to fall to the bottom, about 2 minutes. Lift kale from the bowl without drying the leaves and immediately remove and discard stems. Chop the kale leaves into 1-inch pieces.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until sizzling, about 1 minute. Add kale to the skillet and place a cover over the top.
Cook, stirring occasionally with tongs, until kale is bright green and slightly tender, 5 to 7 minutes.

Description: 
Kale is supposed to have cancer-fighting properties. I love it, but my husband hates it. Cooking it this way is the only way he'll eat it.
