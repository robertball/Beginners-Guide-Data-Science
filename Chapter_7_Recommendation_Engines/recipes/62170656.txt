Ingredients:
1 medium size onion, diced
3 cloves of garlic, minced
1 stalk celery, diced
1 Tablespoon EVO
1 pkg. Morningstar Farms® Meal Starters™ Grillers® Recipe Crumbles
3 14.5 oz cans diced tomatoes
1 can red kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 can corn, drained
1/8 teaspoon Ancho chili powder
1 teaspoon cumin
1 3/4 tablespoons chili powder
3/4 teaspoon smoked salt
1/4 teaspoon ground fresh black pepper
1/2 teaspoon Italian Seasoning
1 teaspoon Cajun Seasoning
1/4 teaspoon white sugar

Directions:
Saute the onions and garlic in EVO until they become translucent.  Add the celery and continuing cooking on low until the veggies are soft.  Add the remaining ingredients.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and cover the pot.  Simmer for an hour, checking often, stirring to avoid it sticking to the bottom of the pot.
Served with a green salad and homemade corn muffins for a full meal.

Description: 
Finally came up with a vegetarian chili recipe that is tasty enough to satisfy all family members.  Has the full flavor of a traditional beef chili without the beef.   My family doesn't care for very spicy, you may want to adjust the heat level.
