Ingredients:
3 tbsp oil
2 medium onions, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 lbs ground lamb (ew) or beef
1 6 oz can tomato paste
2 beef bouillon cubes
1 heaped tbsp flour
1 cup white wine (anything on hand)
1/2 C water
salt
freshly ground black pepper
1/2 tsp tarragon
3 large potatoes, peeled
3 oz butter
1 C milk
1/2 c cooked corn
2 tbsp parmesean

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Heat oil in a large frying pan over low heat. Add onion and garlic until soft.  Turn up heat and add meat. Stir until well-browned.
Drain off excess fat and add tomato paste, bouillon cubes and flour.  Mix well and cook for a minute before adding the wine and water.  Season well with salt and pepper and add Tarragon. Simmer gently for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook and mash the potatoes. Add the butter and milk, season with salt and pepper.
Put the meat mixture in a large, well greased baking dish (I use the round corning ware casserole dish), spread the corn over the meat mixture and the mashed potatoes on top (here's where you can get creative and use that decorative frosting bag). Sprinkle the cheese over the potatoes and bake uncovered for 35 minutes.  Place under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the top.
p.s. the corn is not authentic to the British

Description: 
My husband is British. We have this all the time when the weather gets cold. It's directly out of a British cookbook, so I cannot take credit.  We do change it up a bit. When I'm not looking he adds corn (ew), when he's not looking..extra tomato sauce! Usually have peas as a side. Yum!
