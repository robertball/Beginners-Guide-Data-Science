Description: 
My mother passed this recipe on to her daughters as it was passed on to her from her mother.  It is a delicious alternative to traditional bread stuffing and my family always requests it when a chicken or turkey is on the menu.  It will be a stunning addition to your Sunday night dinner table.  As with any good recipe, adjust the seasonings to your taste.  This recipe quantity is for an approximately 5 lb. chicken.
