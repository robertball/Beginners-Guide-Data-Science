Ingredients:
1 cup all purpose flour
3/4 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 c white sugar
1/2 c oatmeal
1/3 c firm butter or margarine
1 egg
1/4 c milk
2/3 c strawberry jam, or other flavor
powdered sugar, optional

Directions:
Stir together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt and sugar in large bowl. Mix in oatmeal.  Cut in butter until mixture forms coarse crumbs. Beat together egg and milk, gradually add to flour mixture, stirring until well blended.
Spread about half the dough in greased or non-stick 8x8 inch square pan. Spread evenly with jam. Drop remaining dough evenly by spoonfuls over jam.
Bake at 375 until well browned, 35 to 40 minutes. Cut into bars, 1 1/2 by 2 1/2 inches, while still warm. Sift lightly with powdered sugar, if desired.
