Description: 
These delicious Crispy Parmesan Potatoes make the perfect snack or side!  My family loves dipping them in sour cream or ketchup!
You can use pretty much any seasonings and any type of potatoes!  I love fresh garlic but it’s not a great fit in this recipe as the high temperature causes it to burn.  Granulated garlic and onion adds lots of great flavor without burning and have more body than the powders. To make the potatoes nice and crispy, you’ll want to make sure they are cut nice and thin.  I use a  Mandolin slicer to make this task extra quick.
