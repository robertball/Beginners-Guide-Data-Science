Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
4 eggs, beaten
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
2/3 cup water
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole-wheat pastry flour
3/4 cup powdered milk
3/4 cup ground unsalted almonds
1/2 cup flax seed meal
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 (18 ounce) package miniature semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large bar-cookie pan.
Stir pumpkin puree, eggs, sugar, oil, and water together in a large bowl until smooth.
Stir all-purpose flour, pastry flour, powdered milk, almonds, flax seed meal, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger together with a whisk in a separate bowl; stir into the pumpkin mixture until you have a smooth batter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle chocolate chips over the top of the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool completely before cutting.

Description: 
These are perfect for kids school snacks. Freeze them and pull one or two out to pop in their snack container. You'll know you are sending some protein and fiber and not too much sugar. The small amount of chocolate chips just on the top make them feel like they're getting a treat! My kids and their classmates give them 5 stars!
