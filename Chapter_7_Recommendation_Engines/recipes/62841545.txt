Ingredients:
2 Italian style sandwich rolls
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 large tomato, sliced
1 ball fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced
salt to taste

Directions:
Cut sanwich rolls in half.
Drizzle each roll half with 1 Tbsp. oil.
Divide mozzarella evenly between the two bottom-halves of the rolls.
Divide tomato evenly over mozzarella.
Sprinkle with salt.
Close sandwiches and wrap tightly with plastic wrap, slightly squishing.
Leave to marinate for about an hour in a fairly cool place, but not in the refrigerator (you want the cheese to melt a bit).  Just on the counter top is perfect.
Unwrap and enjoy!

I spent six weeks of one summer as an exchange student in Sardinia.  One day my host sister and I went to a beautiful beach, and my host mom packed us these sandwiches.
