Ingredients:
8 pitted dates
2 cups moist almond pulp from making almond milk
1/3 cup rolled oats
1/4 cup almond milk
3 tablespoons blanched almond flour
2 tablespoons coconut flour
2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
1 tablespoon applesauce
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon cacao nibs, ground
4 pinches ground cinnamon
4 dashes salt
1 dash ground nutmeg
1/4 cup water (optional)
1/3 cup chopped vegan dark chocolate

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with lightly greased parchment paper.
Soak dates in hot water until soft, 6 to 10 minutes. Drain.
Combine dates, almond pulp, oats, almond milk, almond flour, coconut flour, coconut oil, applesauce, vanilla extract, cacao nibs, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg in a food processor. Process to the consistency of cookie dough, adding water if needed.
Roll 1 tablespoon of cookie dough with your hands. Pinch sides with your fingers to form a square. Place on the prepared baking sheet and press down with your fingers or a fork to flatten slightly. Repeat with remaining dough.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool.
Melt dark chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle melted chocolate over cookies.
