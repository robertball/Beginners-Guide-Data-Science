Ingredients:
1 cup sorghum molasses
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 apple

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a Dutch oven or large saucepan over medium heat,  heat sorghum, stirring constantly. Stir in baking soda and remove from heat. Stir in the sugar and eggs; mix well. Combine the salt, cinnamon, allspice, cloves and nutmeg; mix into the  sorghum mixture. Gradually stir in the flour until dough is stiff enough to roll out. The amount of flour may be adjusted.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters. I like to cut them into squares with a pizza cutter. Place cookies 1 inch apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are firm but not crisp. Remove from baking sheets immediately or they will stick. Cool on wire racks. When cool, place into an airtight container with the 1/2 apple for about a week, or until they are soft enough to bend. Frost with confectioners' sugar frosting if you like.
