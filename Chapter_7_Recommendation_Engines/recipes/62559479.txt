Ingredients:
4 teaspoons olive oil
1 8 ounce red potato, chopped
1 large red bell pepper, chopped

1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the potato; cover and cook, stirring once, about 5 minutes. Add the bell pepper, onion, and garlic. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and lightly browned, about 5 minutes more. Stir in the thyme, salt, and pepper.
Heat the remaining 2 teaspoons oil in another large skillet over medium heat. Break the eggs into the skillet and add 2-3 tablespoons of water. Cover and cook 2-4 minutes, or until desired doneness. 1/2 cup hash and 1 egg per serving
