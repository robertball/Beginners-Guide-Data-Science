Ingredients:
1 cup all purpose flour
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup pecans, chopped
1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed
1/3 cup butter
3/4 cup milk chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Combine flour, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1/4 cup butter and blend until crumbly.  Pat mixture firmly into 8x8 ungreased pan.  Sprinkle pecan halves over the unbaked crust and set aside.
In small saucepan combine 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup of butter.  Cook over medium heat until mixture comes to a boil, stirring constantly.  Boil for a full 1 minute.  Drizzle the hot caramel over the pecans and crust.  Bake for 18-20 minutes or until caramel layer is bubbly and crust is light brown.
Remove from oven and immediately sprinkle with chocolate chips.  Allow to sit for about 10 minutes then using the back of a spoon swirl the chocolate chips around the bars.
Cool completely before cutting into bars.
