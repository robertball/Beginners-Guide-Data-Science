Description: 
This is a lighter version of Janet Pierce's delicious muffins which have become a staple in our house. I recently went vegan & this recipe adapted beautifully. This recipe makes 24 muffins because the original recipe didn't last an hour in my house.Modified from: Zucchini-Chocolate Chip Muffins
