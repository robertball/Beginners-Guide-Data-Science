Ingredients:
6 medium cloves of garlic
4 red chilli peppers
½ cup apple cider vinegar
1 cup honey
1 ½ cup water
1 tsp sea salt
4 and ½ tsp arrowroot powder + 6 tbsp water

Directions:
Cut chillies in half width ways and add them to the food processor.
Chop garlic cloves in half and add them to the food processor.
Add all the other ingredients with the exception of the arrowroot powder to the food processor.
Blend until the chillies are all finely minced. You may need to take the lid off a couple of times and check how it is going, give it a mix, to make sure you don't have any big chunks of chilli.
Pour this mixture into a medium sized saucepan and let it come to the boil on a medium-high heat.
Once boiling reduce the heat a little so it is just simmering. Allow the mixture to bubble gently for about 3-4 minutes.
While this is simmering in a small mixing bowl whisk together the water and arrowroot powder.
Add this to the liquid in the saucepan so it will thicken. This process can take a little time. It took about 10 - 12 minutes for mine to come to a consistency I was happy with.
You will need to stir frequently to make sure that the sauce does not catch on the bottom of the saucepan.
Once thick enough for you, let it cool down. Once cooled funnel or pour it into your glass bottles.
Keep in the fridge.
