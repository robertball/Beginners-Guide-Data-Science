Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces
3 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 medium onion, cut into large chunks
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 cup dry lentils
4 cups water
2 (15 ounce) cans Italian-style diced tomatoes
3 cubes chicken bouillon
1 bay leaf
1/2 cup small pasta
1 medium zucchini, cut into large chunks
1 medium yellow squash, cut into large chunks
1 teaspoon dried basil, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute carrots, celery, onion, and garlic until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, rinse lentils. Combine water, tomatoes, bouillon, and bay leaf in a large pot on medium heat. Add carrot mixture and lentils. Simmer for about 7 minutes. Add pasta and cook for 3 minutes. Add zucchini and squash; cook until tender but not mushy, about 5 minutes. Add basil, oregano, and pepper.
Remove soup from heat and let sit for 30 minutes, covered.

Description: 
I wanted to make something substantial involving lentils... and this was truly delicious and colorful. My steak-and- potatoes-lovin' husband thought it was great, and he didn't even complain that it didn't have actual meat in it. Garnish with grated Romano or Parmesan cheese and serve with a nice crusty homemade bread.
