Description: 
I was inspired to create this dessert because I could not eat traditional ice cream from the grocery store due to a potato allergy. This recipe creates a fresh and sweet treat with minimal sugar allowing you to indulge in fruit and chocolate, the best of both worlds! Store the remaining ice cream in a container in your freezer for later enjoyment!
