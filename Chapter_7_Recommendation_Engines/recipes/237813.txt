Ingredients:
1 cup chopped cooked chicken
1/2 cup barbeque sauce, divided
1 (13.8 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
1 cup diced tomatoes, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix chicken and 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce together in a bowl until evenly coated.
Roll dough onto a work surface and cut in half to form 2 rectangles. Brush the top of each rectangle with olive oil.
Place dough, oil-side down, onto the grill; cook until bottom of dough is browned and top is bubbling up, about 5 minutes. Brush the tops of each dough with oil and flip.
Spread the remaining barbeque sauce over each crust; top with chicken, Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, and tomatoes.
Close the lid of the grill and cook pizza until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove pizza from grill and cool before slicing, 2 to 3 minutes.

Description: 
Quick and easy for those summer cookouts. I often make as an appetizer while the ribs are cooking. Use whatever toppings you normally like on regular pizza, but the barbeque chicken is always a crowd pleaser! The dough never makes a perfect rectangle, but we have fun guessing what it looks like ('That looks like America!'). For the chicken, I use the grilled chicken pre-cooked at the store.
