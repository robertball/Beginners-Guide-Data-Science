Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
3 cups semisweet chocolate chips, melted
1/2 tsp peppermint extract
1/2 tsp orange extract

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar until well blended. Stir in melted chocolate until no streaks remain. Divide equally among three bowls, adding one flavor to each bowl. Cover and refrigerate for about 1 hour. Do not refrigerate too long. Shape into 1 inch balls. Refrigerate again to set. Melt chocolate in microwave or doubleboiler. Use 2 forks to dip truffles and drain; arrange on wax paper covered cookie sheets. Return to refrigerator. Use peppermint crumbs or colored white chocolate to decorate.
