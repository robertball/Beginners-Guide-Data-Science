Ingredients:
1 Tbsp peanut or canola oil
1 medium red onion, thinly sliced
2 jalapeno peppers, thinly sliced (or more if you really like your food fiery)
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into small pieces
2 Tbsp fish sauce
1 Tbsp sugar
1 Tbsp low-sodium soy sauce
2 cups fresh basil leaves

Directions:
Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet. When hot, add the onion, jalapenos, and garlic and stir-fry for 2 minutes, using a metal spatula to keep the ingredients in motion. Add the chicken and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the meat is beginning to brown on the outside. Add the fish sauce, sugar, soy sauce, and basil and cook for 1 minute more. Serve over rice.
