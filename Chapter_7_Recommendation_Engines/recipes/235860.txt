Description: 
I got these recipe ingredients from Chef Bruce at the Red Rooster Cafe in New Braunfels, TX. I serve this sauce with fresh blackberries from my dad's garden. Layer in a wine glass, sweetened whipped cream, berries, sauce, then more whipped cream. Top with a berry and sprinkle with a little powdered sugar. So good! They also use this sauce on their Monte Cristo Sandwich.
