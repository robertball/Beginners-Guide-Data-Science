Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, diced
1 package ranch dressing mix
1 onion, diced
1 package bacon
1 package (3 crusts) of World Market Thin Crust Pizza Crust
Ranch dressing
1 block Queso Chihuahua cheese, shredded
Franks Buffalo Sauce

Directions:
Cook the chicken and onion in the ranch dressing mix until done with some olive oil.
Bake the bacon in the oven. 400 for 15-20 minutes. Then crumble
Spread some ranch dressing over the pizza crust. Not so much that it's soupy - but cover the crust.
Shred some Queso Chihuahua cheese (found at Dillons cheese counter). It's worth the extra effort to not buy shredded cheese. Trust me on this.
Top the cheese with the chicken and bacon crumbles. Use as much as you want.
Swirl the buffalo sauce over the pizza in a decorative fashion.
Bake at 350 for about 10-15 minutes. Let the cheese melt and get as crunchy as you like it.
Enjoy!

I created this after falling in love with Papa John's buffalo chicken pizza. I never make it the same way twice.
