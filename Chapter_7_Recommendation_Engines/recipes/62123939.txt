Ingredients:
(1) Tri Tip Roast (nicely marbled approx 3 pounds)
2  T Wistershire sauce
1/2 C of Canadian Steak Seasoning

Directions:
On a plate or baking sheet coat the Tri Tip with the wistershire sauce, on another plate lay out your seasoning.  Coat the roast completely (pushing the meat into the seasoning to coat it well) cover the plate and the meat put it in the refrigerator for an hour or so (or even overnight)
When you are ready to grill, preheat your grill to medium high to high heat and place your tri tip on the grill searing each side of the meat... approx 5 min per side.  Reduce heat to low and cook an additional 45 minutes (depending on the doneness you prefer… personally I like the meat to be med-rare to rare and times are going to vary depending on your grill) Allow the meat to “rest” for 10 minutes then slice and enjoy!
