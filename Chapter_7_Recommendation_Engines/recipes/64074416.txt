Ingredients:
1 Pork tenderloin
1 onion
2 cans chopped green chili
Salt
cumin
oregano
garlic
chicken broth

Directions:
Place all ingredients in a large pot and cook until combined and pork is done.
If you want brown gravy and a heavier taste; brown pork and onions before adding the other ingredients.
This is as close to Dennis' recipe that I could come up with. Amounts should be adjusted for taste.
