Ingredients:
4 cups fresh strawberries (3 ½ to 4 lbs.), stemmed and quartered
1 1/4 – 1 3/4 cups xylitol
2 Tbsp. freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 package NO SUGAR pectin (or: Use the amount required by your pectin brand)

Directions:
In a large saucepan, slowly heat the prepared strawberries to boiling. Mix the pectin with the sweetener and add the mix, as well as the lemon juice, to the strawberries just as they begin to boil. Cook over medium high heat for 8-10 minutes, until foaminess subsides and the jam has thickened. Remove from heat.

Description: 
You won't know it's sugar-free.  Xylitol is good for your health, good for your teeth and tastes like sugar.  It's natural - made of birch trees or corn. I do all my baking with it. It's a little more expensive than other sweeteners, but well worth it.
