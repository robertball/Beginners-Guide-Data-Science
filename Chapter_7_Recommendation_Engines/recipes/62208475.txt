Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp, ground ginger
1 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper

1 large egg yolk
3 tbsp. molasses

Directions:
Whisk together flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, nutmeg and pepper. Set aside.
Beat butter and dark brown sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy - about 3 minutes.  Beat in egg yolk and molasses.  Add flour mixture and beat at med-low speed until dough is coarse crumbs (about a minute)
Transfer dough to unfloured surface and knead gently until dough comes together.  Shape into an 8" log, about 1 1/2" in diameter, and wrap n plastic.  Refrigerate at least 3 hours until firm.
Preheat oven to 350.  Unwrap dough a cut into slices just under 1/4" thick.  Place 1" apart on ungreased cookie sheets (parchment paper can be used).  Bake until slightly dar around the edges, 10 to 12 minutes.  Cool about 15 minutes on sheets, then transfer to racks to cool completely.
Store in airtight containers.
