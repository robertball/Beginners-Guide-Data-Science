Ingredients:
Cake:
1 box strawberry cake mix
1 1/3 cups water
3 eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen strawberries
Topping:
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1 cup milk
2 cups frozen whipped topping, thawed
1 pint fresh strawberries (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Prepare cake mix as directed on package. Pour batter into prepared pan and bake until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Allow cake to cool on wire rack.
Poke holes on top of cake. Puree thawed strawberries with juice in a blender or food processor and spoon over top of baked cake.
To Make Topping: Prepare pudding mix as directed on package using one cup of milk. Fold whipped topping into pudding mixture and spread over cake. Arrange strawberries on top of cake, if desired.
Refrigerate cake for at least 4 hours before serving.
