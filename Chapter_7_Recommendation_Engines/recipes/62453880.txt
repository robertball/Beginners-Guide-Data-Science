Ingredients:
1 fresh pineapple
Large bag fresh baby spinach
2 lbs chicken tenderloins or boneless skinless chicken breasts
Â¼ Cup pinenuts or sliced almonds
1 10 oz. can mandarin oranges, drained
1 bottle Kraft Creamy Poppyseed dressing
Marinade for chicken:
10-12 ounces beer or ginger ale
1/3 C Dijon Mustard
1-2 Tbsp Fresh Rosemary (or 1 1/2 tsp dried)
1/2 C Honey
1/8 C Olive oil
1 tsp. each garlic powder & salt
1/8 tsp fresh cracked black pepper

Directions:
1. Mix together all marinade ingredients in a gallon zip top bag. Add chicken and toss to coat each piece thoroughly. Allow to refrigerate several hours or overnight. Turn bag over periodically.
2. About 30 minutes before dinner, heat grill to medium-high.  Twist top off the pineapple, cut the outer layer off in long vertical stripes. Cut pineapple into 6 vertical wedges and cut out the tough core.
3. Thread chicken onto skewers. Grill chicken and pineapple spears at the same time, for about 10-12 minutes, until chicken is cooked but still juicy and pineapple becomes tender and has light brown grill marks.
4. In the meantime, wash and dry spinach.  Toss with oranges and nuts.
5. Cut grilled pineapple and chicken into bite-sized pieces and toss into salad.
6. Drizzle each serving with 2-3 tsp Creamy Poppyseed dressing.
