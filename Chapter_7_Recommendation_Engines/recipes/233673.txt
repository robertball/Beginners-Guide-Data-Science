Ingredients:
10 slices bacon, chopped
1 onion, chopped
6 cloves garlic
3 pounds trimmed fresh green beans
1 cup water
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs, or to taste
1 1/2 cups shredded Italian cheese blend

Directions:
Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until some of the fat renders into the pan, about 5 minutes. Stir onion and garlic into the bacon and continue cooking until the bacon is crisp and the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes more.
Stir green beans, water, vinegar, salt, and pepper into the bacon; cook at a simmer until the liquid is mostly evaporated, 10 to 12 minutes. Top with bread crumbs and cheese; stir gently.

Description: 
This is a really delicious green been recipe. It started as an alternative to the usual green bean casserole at Thanksgiving, and now we cook it for any occasion. And, oh, it smells so good while cooking!
