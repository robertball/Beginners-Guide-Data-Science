Ingredients:
3 (4 ounce) bars dark chocolate, chopped, divided
3 tablespoons shelled unsalted pistachios, coarsely chopped
3 tablespoons dried blueberries
1 tablespoon coconut chips
2 teaspoons grated orange zest (optional)

Directions:
Melt 8 ounces chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Once chocolate is nearly melted, but a few chunks remain, stop microwaving and stir until completely smooth. Add the remaining 4 ounces of unmelted chocolate. Stir well until all the chocolate has melted.
Lay out a large sheet of parchment paper on a flat work surface. Pour melted chocolate onto parchment and spread chocolate into a thin, even layer using a spatula. Scatter pistachios, dried blueberries, coconut chips, and orange zest quickly over chocolate before it sets.
Leave the chocolate to set fully, about 45 minutes. Break into randomly sized pieces and store in an airtight container.

Description: 
A chocolate bark that's as pretty to look at as it is to eat. You can vary the toppings by using other freeze-dried berries, such as raspberries, or going for dried cranberries, cherries, or currants.
