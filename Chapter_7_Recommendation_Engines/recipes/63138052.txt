Ingredients:
3/4 cup mustard seed
9 oz.  Guinness beer
1 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar (or other sweet fruit vinegar)
2 tbsp. molasses
2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp. Buffalo Sauce (Pref) or Tabasco
2 Tbsp
1-1/2 tsp organic sugar
1-1/2 tbsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper
1/8 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp ground cloves
1/8 tsp ground nutmeg
1/8 tsp ground allspice
1/2 tsp granulated garlic
1 tsp granulated onion or onion powder
Water as needed*

Directions:
Combine the dry spices in a bowl and salt and set aside
In a plastic food storage container with a good airtight lid, combine all of the ingredients including the dry spices.
Set aside at room temperature for 2 days. The seeds will swell and soften.
Pour the contents into a food processor. Turn it on and let it chop up the softened seeds at least three times for a minute each. You may need to do more. It should have a blended consistency, but still see a good deal of the seed.

Description: 
This is a delicious and relatively easy to make recipe for a sweet spicy stone ground mustard made with Guinness with a dash of molasses. Great on brats, sandwiches and as a base for a wicked remoulade for chilled shrimp and seafood.
