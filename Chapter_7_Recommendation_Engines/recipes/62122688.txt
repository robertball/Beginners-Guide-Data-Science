Ingredients:
1 can of Escargots (20-24)
20-24 mushrooms
6 tablspoons butter
1 clove garlic-minced
1/3 cup white wine
1/3 cup cream
1 tablespoon flour
Black pepper
Tarragon
Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Drain, rinse well and soak Escargot in cold water (to remove the "canned" taste they sometimes have).
Remove stems from mushroom, discard or eat as you go LOL
On medium heat in a large skillet heat the butter and garlic.
Add the drained escargot and the mushroom caps.
Preheat oven to 350
Combine wine, cream and flour in a cup, whisk well.
When mushrooms and escargot are heated through (5-7 mins or so)add wine misture.
Season to taste with pepper and tarragon, cook until thickened.
Remove from heat, spoon a bit of sauce into each mushroom cap, add snail then pour remainder over top.
Sprinkle with parmesan cheese-fresh is much better.
Pop into oven for 10-15 minutes.

Description: 
Tender Escargot in mushroom caps, smothered with sauce and cheese.  Nothing big and fancy but I liked how it turned out so I thought I'd share, easy to make too.
