Ingredients:
1/4 cup sour cream
1/4 cup blue cheese crumbles
1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 pounds ground chicken
1/2 cup hot pepper sauce
1 teaspoon celery salt (optional)
1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 teaspoon paprika
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/4 cup bread crumbs
4 Kaiser rolls, split
4 leaves iceberg lettuce
1/2 cup diced celery

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Stir the sour cream, blue cheese, and Worcestershire sauce together in a small bowl; set aside.
Mix the ground chicken, 1/2 cup hot sauce, celery salt, poultry seasoning, paprika, cayenne pepper, and bread crumbs together in a mixing bowl until evenly blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.
Cook the chicken burgers on the preheated grill 6 to 7 minutes until well marked. Spray the uncooked top of the burger with cooking spray, and flip the burgers over. Continue cooking until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
To assemble the burgers, place a lettuce leaf on each roll bottom. Top with a burger patty, then spoon on 2 tablespoons of blue cheese sauce, and 2 tablespoons celery. Place the top of the roll on top to finish the sandwich.
