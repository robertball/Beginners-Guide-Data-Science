Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) container refrigerated pizza crust
1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
1 (6 ounce) container fresh blackberries
1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese
2 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup honey
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary

Directions:
Place a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the lowest oven rack and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Dust a large piece of parchment paper with flour. Roll pizza crust out on the parchment paper. Brush olive oil over crust. Spread blackberries on top, pushing them gently into the crust.
Place parchment paper on the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet and bake crust until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
Combine ricotta cheese, milk, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract in a blender; blend until smooth. Place in the refrigerator.
Combine honey and rosemary in a small saucepan over low heat; heat until honey has a runny consistency, about 5 minutes.
Drizzle rosemary honey over baked crust. Continue baking until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
Cool crust slightly, about 5 minutes. Spoon sweetened ricotta cheese over warm dough.
