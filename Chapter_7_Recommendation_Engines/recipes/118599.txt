Ingredients:
2 cups sliced fresh strawberries
1/2 cup sugar
3 teaspoons vanilla extract
PANCAKES:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 medium ripe bananas, cut into 1/4-inch slices
Whipped cream

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the strawberries, sugar and vanilla. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.
For pancakes, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl. Combine the egg, buttermilk, oil and vanilla; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.
Pour the batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto a lightly greased hot griddle; place 5-6 banana slices on each pancake. Turn when bubbles form on top; cook until second side is golden brown. Serve with strawberries and whipped cream if desired.

Field editor Katie Sloan from Charlotte, North Carolina writes, 'With strawberries, banana and a good buttermilk batter, this is my all-time favorite pancake recipe. I even serve these for dinner occasionally with some crispy bacon or a slice of country ham.'
