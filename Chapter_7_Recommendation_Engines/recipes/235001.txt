Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) can CONTADINA® Tomato Paste, divided
1 egg
2 teaspoons dried basil, divided
2 teaspoons dried oregano, divided
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 cups fresh bread crumbs*
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup golden raisins, coarsely chopped (optional)
1 1/4 pounds lean ground beef or ground turkey, 93% lean (not turkey breast)
2 (14.5 ounce) cans CONTADINA® Diced Tomatoes, undrained
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
Cooked pasta

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil; coat with cooking spray.
Combine 1/2 can tomato paste, egg, 1 tsp. each basil and oregano, onion powder, garlic powder and pepper in a large bowl. Stir in bread crumbs, Parmesan and raisins.
Mix in turkey with hands or a large spoon until mixture is combined well. Shape into 16 meatballs, about 1 1/2-inches in diameter. Bake 20 minutes or until browned and cooked through (165 degrees F internal temperature).
Meanwhile, stir together remaining tomato paste, diced tomatoes, 1 tsp. each oregano and basil, sugar and salt in a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes.  Add baked meatballs to sauce and simmer 5 minutes for flavors to blend. Serve meatballs and sauce over pasta with Parmesan cheese, if desired.
