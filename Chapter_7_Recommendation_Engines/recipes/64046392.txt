Ingredients:
2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2/3 cup white sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 large Kosher dill pickles, finely chopped
3/4 to 1 cup chopped fresh dill
6 cups bread flour

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water 110 to 115 degrees. Stir in yeast. Allow to proof until yeast becomes a creamy foam, 5-10 minutes.
Mix oil and salt into the yeast. Mix in chopped pickles and fresh dill. Mix in flour one cup at a time, scraping sides occasionally. Knead dough with dough hook in bowl, or by hand on a lightly floured surface until smooth, about 8 minutes. Place in a bowl well-coated with cooking spray, and turn dough to coat. Cover with plastic wrap. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down and knead for a few minutes Divide in half and shape into 2 loaves. Place into two greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise for 30 minutes, or until dough has risen 1 inch above pans. During rising time, preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. If using convection oven, 23-24 minutes at 350 degrees.
Remove from pans immediately and cool on rack. Allow to cool completely before cutting.
