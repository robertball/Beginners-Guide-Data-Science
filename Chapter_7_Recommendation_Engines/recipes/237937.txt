Ingredients:
1/2 cup whole wheat panko bread crumbs
1/2 cup cornmeal
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 (5.3 ounce) container VOSKOS® Nonfat Vanilla Greek Yogurt
3 eggs, lightly beaten
2 cups fresh or frozen corn kernels (thawed, if frozen)
1 (6 ounce) can crabmeat, drained, flaked and cartilage removed
2 tablespoons olive oil
Roasted Pepper-Yogurt Aioli:
2 (5.3 ounce) containers VOSKOS® Nonfat Vanilla Greek Yogurt
1/4 cup roasted red peppers, drained
4 teaspoons lemon juice
2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Stir together the whole wheat panko, cornmeal, salt, and pepper. Whisk in VOSKOS(R) Nonfat Vanilla Greek Yogurt and eggs until combined. Stir in corn and crabmeat.
Coat a very large nonstick skillet with olive oil. Heat over medium-high heat. Using a 1/4-cup measure, add six portions of the corn-crab mixture to the hot skillet, spacing evenly. Cook about 6 minutes or until golden brown, turning once. Transfer to a warm serving plate. Repeat with remaining corn-crab mixture. Serve warm with Roasted Pepper-Yogurt Aioli (see below).
Roasted Pepper-Yogurt Aioli: Add VOSKOS(R) Nonfat Vanilla Greek Yogurt, red pepper, lemon juice, and garlic to a blender or food processor. Cover and blend until smooth.
