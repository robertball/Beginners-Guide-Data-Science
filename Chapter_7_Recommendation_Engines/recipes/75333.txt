Description: 
For people who like chicken and are looking for something a little different, this recipe is for you. Brown sugar, soy sauce, and cocoa provide the base for this rather colorful dish. Goes well on a bed of fried rice. Refried beans make a good side dish. Substitute your favorite vegetables for tomatoes and Cheddar cheese for the Swiss (or Gouda if you can afford it).
