Ingredients:
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups mini candy-coated chocolates
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine the flour with baking soda and salt.
In a clean 1 liter sized glass jar layer the ingredients in the order given starting with the brown sugar and ending with the flour mixture.
Attach a card with the following directions: Cookies  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line one baking sheet with parchment paper.  2. Empty the contents of the jar into a large bowl and mix until all the ingredients are well combined.  3. Using your hands work in 3/4 cup softened butter or margarine until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  4. Beat 1 egg with 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Work this into the flour mixture until well combined. Dough will be a little crumbly.  5. Shape dough into 1 inch sized balls and place 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Slightly flatten the balls with the palm of your hand. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 14 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove cookies to a rack to cool. Makes about 2 dozen cookies.
