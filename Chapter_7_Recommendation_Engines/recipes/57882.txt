Ingredients:
4 slices white bread
4 slices processed cheese
6 slices bacon, cut in half
1 (15 ounce) can baked beans with pork

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler.
Place bread slices on a broiling pan that has been lined with aluminum foil. Spoon about 1/2 cup of beans onto each piece of bread. Cover each pile of beans with a slice of cheese. Place three half-slices of bacon onto each sandwich so that they are not hanging over the edge.
Broil for 5 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bacon is cooked and cheese is melted. Watch them carefully! I suggest leaving the oven door cracked near the 5 minute mark to allow some of the oven heat to escape.

Description: 
This is a baked version of an American favorite.  My grandma used to make these for us.  It's more like a half sandwich since the ingredients are actually baked on top of a slice of bread.
