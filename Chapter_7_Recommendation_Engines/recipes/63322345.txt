Ingredients:
1 pound pasta (linguine, farafalle, penne would all work)
Alfredo Sauce Recipe:
1/4 cup butter
1 cup 1% milk
2 teaspoons of cornstarch
1 clove garlic, minced
1 and 1/2 cups of grated parmesan cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste
Finishing Sauce:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
2 pounds coarsely shredded zucchini and drained
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
Fresh basil, for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Cook pasta following package directions. Drain; keep warm.
Alfredo Sauce:
Mix cornstarch into cold milk and set aside.  In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium low heat.  Add minced garlic and saute for 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Add salt and pepper (white pepper if you do not want the black flecks in the sauce) to taste.  Add milk mixture and simmer for 5 minutes, then add cheese and whisk quickly until melted (about 5 minutes).  Stir in parsley.  Remove from heat and set aside.
In large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add garlic; cook, stirring, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Increase heat to high. Stir in drained zucchini, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until tender, about 5 minutes (if you want it to blend in more with the sauce, cook longer). Add cheddar cheese and Alfredo pasta sauce; heat through. Transfer to large bowl; toss with pasta. If desired, garnish with basil.
