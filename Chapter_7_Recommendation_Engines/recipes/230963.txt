Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
1 small butternut squash, peeled and cut into bite-size cubes
1/2 small red onion, sliced
3 tablespoons orange-flavored dried cranberries
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 tablespoons slivered almonds
1 teaspoon shredded Parmesan cheese, or to taste (optional)
salt to taste

Directions:
Bring chicken stock, butternut squash, red onion, and cranberries to a boil in a saucepan, reduce heat to low, and simmer until squash is tender when pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes. Drain.
Heat butter and olive oil together in a large skillet over medium heat. Gently stir butternut squash mixture into hot butter and oil; sprinkle with brown sugar. Gently flip vegetables when browned, about 5 minutes per side. Sprinkle with almonds, Parmesan cheese, and salt.
