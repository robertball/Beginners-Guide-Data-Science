Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/3 cup heavy whipping cream
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup granulated sugar for decoration
1/4 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine the 1 cup butter, whipping cream and flour thoroughly. Chill for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
On a lightly floured surface roll dough out to 1/8 inch thick. Cut into 1 1/2 inch rounds. Transfer rounds to a tray or waxed paper sprinkled heavily with white sugar, turning to coat both sides with sugar. Place sugar coated rounds on an ungreased cookie sheet. Prick in four places with a fork, forming a "prick box".
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 7 to 9 minutes or until slightly puffed. Let cool then put the bottoms of two cookies together with the Creamy Butter Filling.
To Make The Creamy Butter Filling: Blend 1/4 cup butter, confectioners' sugar, egg yolk and vanilla until smooth. If desired tint with food coloring.
