Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
1 large large onion, finely chopped
1 (28 ounce) can diced San Marzano tomatoes

2 teaspoons dried oregano

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drizzle olive oil into a baking dish; add onion.
Bake in the preheated oven until onion is fragrant, about 7 minutes.
Stir diced tomatoes, wine, oregano, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and red pepper flakes into the baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until tomato sauce is simmering, about 10 minutes.
Season salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Slide fillets into the sauce; top with capers.
Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Garnish with parsley.

Description: 
I just love preparing a gourmet-looking and tasting dish and this was so easy!

 A thank you to City Fish for the salmon steaks. Ceramic bakeware like Emile Henry is perfect for this recipe because it goes from the oven to the table. I made the entire recipe in one baking dish.
