Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 (7.75 ounce) can Mexican-style hot tomato sauce
2 eggs
1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
3/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup diced green chiles
2 teaspoons garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. DashÂ®)
1 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix ground beef, Mexican-style tomato sauce, eggs, onion soup mix, bread crumbs, green chiles, garlic and herb seasoning, and garlic powder in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Place mixture into a large loaf pan and shape into a loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatloaf is no longer pink inside and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the middle of the loaf shows at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 hour.

Description: 
My family kept turning up their noses at my meatloaf. I tried several recipes in hopes of finding one that they would all like. They told it was just too darn plain for their taste. I tried adding oatmeal or rice instead of dry bread crumbs, adding different kinds of veggies, I used canned tomatoes, or ketchup, or tomato paste, or different styles of tomato sauce, even different spices until I came up with this one. When I saw all plates clean and being asked for more, I knew I had found the one they liked and the keeper for our family.
