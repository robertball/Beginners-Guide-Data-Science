In a skillet put the pumpkin puree in medium heat and let absorb most of its liquids.
After 5 minutes throw the sugar, raisins, semolina and spices and mix until they are all incorporated. Take a pan, oil it and place the first puff pastry sheet.
Pour the pumpkin mixture and cover with the second puff pastry sheet.
Brush the puff pastry sheet with the egg to make it shiny and bake for about 30 to 40 minutes or until golden brown.
