Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
3 egg yolks, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
1 (9 inch) graham cracker crust, baked
1 (1 ounce) square semisweet chocolate, melted
Whipped cream
chopped salted peanuts

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, flour, salt and milk until smooth. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until thickened and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat; cook and stir 2 minutes longer. Remove from the heat.  Stir 1 cup of hot mixture into egg yolks; return all to pan, stirring constantly. Bring to a gentle boil; cook and stir 2 minutes longer. Remove from the heat. Gently stir in vanilla. Cool slightly.
Divide mixture in half. To one portion, gently stir in peanut butter; pour into prepared crust. Gently stir chocolate into the remaining portion; pour over top. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until set. Just before serving, garnish with whipped cream and peanuts.

This is an old family favorite my mom made when I was a child. I've changed the recipe slightly, but it still brings back those delightful childhood memories.
