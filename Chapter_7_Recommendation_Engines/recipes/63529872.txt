Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter (I've also used a 50/50 combination of oil and applesauce with great results)
2/3 cup white sugar
2/3 cup brown sugar
2 cups flour
2 cups rolled oats (I use large flake oats and put 1 cup of them through the blender to make oat flour)
1 tsp salt
2 tsp baking soda
1-1/2 tsp baking powder
2 cups mashed bananas
2 eggs, beaten
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt or sour cream
1 cup chopped nuts (ie. walnuts or pecans)
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350*
Grease 2 - 9 x 5 inch loaf pans (or grease and flour - either creates great results)
Mix mashed bananas and yogurt or sour cream -set aside.
Cream together butter and sugars in large bowl.  Add eggs and vanilla and stir to combine.  Add banana mixture and mix well.  Set aside.
Stir together the flour, oats, baking soda and salt.
Add dry ingredients to wet mixture and stir just until combined (don't over-mix).
Fold in nuts and chocolate chips.
Pour into prepared pans and bake for 1 hour (check after 50 mins) - or until knife inserted comes out clean.
Remove from oven and cover loosely with foil for 5 minutes, then remove from pans and allow to cool completely (if you can resist the amazing aroma enveloping your kitchen).

Description: 
After trying several recipes for banana bread that had some but not all of the things I wanted in it, I tweaked a few together and came up with this.  I made 8 loaves before declaring it a success (and the comments from family and coworkers sealed the deal).
