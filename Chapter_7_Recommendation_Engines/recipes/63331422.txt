Ingredients:
1 c. water warmed to 110 degrees
1 tbsp. honey
3 tbsp. olive oil
1 tsp salt
1 tsp dried Italian herb blend
1/4 tsp fresh cracked pepper
2 tbsp fresh chopped rosemary
1 tbsp fresh chopped basil
2 1/4 c. white spelt flour
2/3 c. whole grain spelt flour
1 1/2 tsp. yeast

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine water, yeast, and honey and stir to combine.  Allow to sit 10 minutes until the mixture is frothy.  Add the oil and salt, then the flour and herbs, and stir until the bread forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.  Do not knead, as the bread will be too sticky.  Allow to rise in the bowl, covered, for about 45 minutes or until nearly doubled.  Using a spatula, scoop the dough into a 4 x 6 loaf pan that has been sprayed well with cooking spray and the bottom lined in parchment.
Bake in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.  Let sit in the pan for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack.

Description: 
After looking everywhere for a tried and true herb spelt bread and finding none, I made this one up myself.  It's light, perfectly herby, and a great way to use up all that fresh rosemary and basil we have during the summer.
