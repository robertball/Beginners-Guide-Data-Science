1 (5 pound) ready-to-eat ham
1/4 cup dark corn syrup
2 cups honey
2/3 cup butter

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place ham in foil lined pan.
In the top half of a double boiler, heat the corn syrup, honey and butter. You can add the seasoning pouch also if included with the ham. Place all in roasting bag. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven.  Turn every 15 mins. During the last 4 to 5 minutes of baking, take out of bag, turn on broiler to caramelize the glaze. Remove from oven, and let sit a few minutes before serving.
