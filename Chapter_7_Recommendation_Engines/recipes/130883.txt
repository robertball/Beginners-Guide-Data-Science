Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups molasses
1 1/2 cups honey
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon ground anise seed
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3/4 teaspoon ground cloves
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
2 tablespoons baking soda
1 tablespoon water
6 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 cup cocoa powder
2 eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Bring molasses, honey, and sugar to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium heat, then remove from heat and allow to cool for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir in anise, cardamom, ginger, nutmeg, clove, cinnamon, lemon zest, and butter. Dissolve baking soda in water, then stir into the molasses mixture. Sift together 6 cups of flour with the baking powder and cocoa powder into a large bowl. Stir in molasses mixture and eggs until smooth. Stir in remaining 3 cups flour until a stiff dough has formed.
Divide dough into 4 pieces to make it more manageable. Roll the dough to 1/4-inch thick on a well floured surface and cut into shapes with a cookie cutter.
Bake cookies on ungreased baking sheets 8 to 10 minutes until lightly browned around the edges. Cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
This is a German spice cookie recipe, similar to gingerbread, which I received from my mother, Sabine Muller.  I have been making these for over 20 years.  I looked online at other Pfefferkuchen recipes and none were like this one.  I thought that I would share it with you. The literal translation is 'pepper cakes', I always ice them with a lemon glaze.
