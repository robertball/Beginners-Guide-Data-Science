Ingredients:
2 cups orzo pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 onions, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups milk, warmed
4 cups roughly chopped spinach
1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onions and garlic until onions are translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir flour into onion mixture and cook until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.
Gradually pour milk into onion mixture while constantly beating with a whisk until sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Add spinach to sauce and cook until spinach is slightly wilted, about 5 minutes.
Mix Parmesan cheese into spinach sauce; cook and stir until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Fold orzo into spinach sauce and season with salt and pepper.
