Ingredients:
1/2 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
2/3 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons lemon juice
6 (6 ounce) fillets rainbow trout

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together soy sauce, vegetable oil, dried rosemary, ketchup and lemon juice. Set marinade aside.
Place rainbow trout in a medium baking dish, and pour marinade over the fish. Refrigerate for approximately 1 hour, turning trout once.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat and lightly oil grate. Drain excess marinade from fish, and transfer to a small saucepan. Bring marinade to a boil, and than remove from heat.
Place trout on the prepared grill. Baste fish with remaining marinade sauce while grilling. Cook approximately 5 minutes on each side, or until tender and easily flaked.
