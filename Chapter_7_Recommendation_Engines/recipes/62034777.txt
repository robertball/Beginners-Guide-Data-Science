Ingredients:
2 cups sliced onions
2 cups catsup
2 cups water
4 tsps. salt
4 tbsp. worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
4 tsps. dry mustard
3-4 lbs of pork ribs

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in large bowl. Cut 3-4 lbs of pork ribs down center between bones.  Brown ribs in skillet.  Place ribs in single layer in shallow baking pan.  Use more than one pan if necessary.  Pour 1/2 of sauce over ribs and bake at 350 for three hours.  Key to success is turning meat and basting with remaining sauce about every twenty minutes.  Last hour just baste with sauce in pan.  I usually double the sauce recipe and use two pks of ribs
