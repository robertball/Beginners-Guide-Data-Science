Ingredients:
1 package of chocolate (or vanilla) instant pudding mix.
1/2 cup butter
1 cup water
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup all-purpose flour
4 eggs
Milk chocolate chips
Vegetable oil

Directions:
Following the directions on the box, prepare the pudding mix. Cover and let set in the refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a large pot, bring water and butter to a rolling boil. Stir in flour and salt until the mixture forms a ball. Transfer the dough to a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon or stand mixer, beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each.
Using a piping bag, fill the bag with the dough and start piping the dough onto a nonstick cookie sheet. Make sure to cut the tip of the piping bag to the size you want your eclairs to be.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven,  until golden brown. Centers should be dry.
When the shells are cool, melt chocolate chips over a double broiler on low heat. Add the oil as needed to make the melted chocolate smooth. Dip the cooled eclairs to cover the top with chocolate. Let cool and pipe the eclairs with pudding filling.
