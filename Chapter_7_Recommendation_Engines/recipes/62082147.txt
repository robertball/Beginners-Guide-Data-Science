Description: 
This is a wonderful butter/sugar cookie dough for any recipe that calls for such a dough. People always adore it. It is a lovely, lightly sweet buttery, tender cookie. It is a great white cookie dough. It can be used to make Italian cuccidati (italian fig cookies) kolacky (polish jam/and or nut cookies) cut out sugar cookies and more..... I love them a myriad of ways ..... especially frosted. :)
