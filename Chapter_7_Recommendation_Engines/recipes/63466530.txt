Ingredients:
8 small (6-inch) corn tortillas
2 cups frozen hash brown potatoes (such as Simply Potatoes), thawed and drained
8 eggs
1 cup sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
1/2 cup salsa
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the tortillas between two paper towels on a plate.  Microwave for about 1 minute to heat them up to make them more flexible and prevent them from breaking.
Spray a skillet with cooking spray, add the potatoes, sprinkle with salt and pepper and stir until browned and heated through, about 5 to 10 minutes.  Remove the potatoes and place about 1/4 cup potatoes on top of each tortilla.
In a small bowl, add the eggs, salt, and pepper and stir until the egg yolks are thoroughly broken up and the salt and pepper are evenly distributed.
Spray the skillet with cooking spray.  Pour the eggs into the skillet and stir continuously for about 5 minutes until scrambled and cooked.
Place about 1/8th of the egg mixture on each taco.
Top with about 2 tablespoons of shredded cheese and about 1-1/2 teaspoons of salsa.
