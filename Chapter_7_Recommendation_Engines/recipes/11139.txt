Ingredients:
3 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
3/4 cup chopped walnuts
2 cups flaked coconut
7 1/2 ounces vanilla wafers, crushed
8 ounces dried apricots

Directions:
Snip apricots into small strips. Sprinkle with water and let stand in a sealed container overnight.
Combine eggs, sugar, and apricots. In a lightly buttered skillet cook the apricot mixture over low heat for 10 minutes. Stir in the nuts, vanilla wafer crumbs and 1/2 of the coconut.
Shape mixture into small balls. Roll balls in the remaining coconut. Store in a tightly covered box. These taste best after aging for a few days.
