Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower; chopped into bite size piece
½ cup brown rice flour
½ cup water
Pinch of salt
Pinch of garlic powder
1 cup fine crumbs (used part oat o's and gf bread)opt
*Sauce* Can also use honey/lime, BBQ, Mahogany optional if you want to marinate. Search my recipes for the sauce recipes **
2 t. water
½ cup Frank’s Red Hot sauce

Directions:
If marinating in Mahogany or Rosemary Garlic sauce, start it so it can marinate at least 1 hour
Preheat oven to 450F.
In a small bowl, combine brown rice flour, water, garlic powder and salt. Mix thoroughly with a whisk.
Dip cauliflower pieces in the batter until coated evenly, then if using, coat in crumbs, then place on a baking sheet covered with parchment or a silicon mat.
Bake for about 10 minutes or until the batter hardens, then flip with a spatula and bake for another 5 minutes.
Whisk together Frank’s Red Hot sauce and water in a small bowl.
When the cauliflower is finished, take a plastic pastry brush and evenly brush each piece with the hot sauce mixture.
Bake coated cauliflower for an additional 8-10 minutes, or until cauliflower is crispy, and sauce looks absorbed.
Remove from oven.
Let cauliflower bites set out for at least 20 minutes before serving.
