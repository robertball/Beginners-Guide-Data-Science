Ingredients:
2 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cubed
½ cup chicken stock
2  oranges, peeled and segmented
4  pitted prunes
4  pitted dates
½ cup dried currants
½ teaspoon whole cloves
1 teaspoon black peppercorns

2 tablespoons white sugar

¾ cup white wine

Directions:
Place chicken stock in a large saucepan over high heat. Add oranges, prunes, dates, currants and cloves and boil until the fruit has broken down a bit, about 7 to 10 minutes.
Stir in peppercorns, mace, sugar, rose water and wine; reduce heat to low and simmer for about 10 minutes. Strain and set aside.
Brown chicken in a  large skillet until lightly browned on both sides; add reserved sauce and cook together, turning and basting, until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear, about 20 to 25 minutes.
