Description: 
If you are having trouble including these anti-inflammatory spices in your diet, here is an alternative to supplements.  Actually quite tasty! I believe this tea is popular in Okinawa, Japan. Just remember turmeric stains. I make mine in an old mason jar, wrapped in an old tea towel! 

Turmeric is used for medicinal purposes in India.
