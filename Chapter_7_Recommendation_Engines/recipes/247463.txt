Ingredients:
14 cups minced oyster mushrooms
9 cups panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup minced garlic
3 tablespoons ground black pepper
3 tablespoons kosher salt
5 pounds ground Kobe beef, at room temperature
3 tablespoons dried parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Mix oyster mushrooms, panko, garlic, black pepper, and salt together in a large bowl with your hands. Mix in ground beef until mixture is sticky and thoroughly combined.
Scoop beef mixture with an ice cream scoop and roll lightly into balls. Place on the lined baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
Grind dried parsley into a fine dust using a coffee or spice grinder. Garnish meatballs with parsley dust.

Description: 
What is better than the best beef grown in the US and the best mushies to grace the genus Pleurotus? Putting them together of course. I work at a restaurant here in town and put this on the menu. It was prototyped with a Gorgonzola cream sauce, but the chef thought we needed a red sauce item on the menu. He's the boss. Great no matter what it is covered in. Serve over your favorite pasta. I prefer fettuccine or lasagna noodle torn into wide strips. Garnish with parsley dust.
