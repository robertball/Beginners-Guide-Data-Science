Ingredients:
3/4 cup (175 mL) butter
10 sheets phyllo pastry
Filling:
1-1/2 cups (375 mL) chopped walnut halves
2/3 cup (150 mL) slivered dried apricots
1/3 cup (75 mL) each chopped almonds and pistachios
1/4 cup (50 mL) fresh bread crumbs, toasted
2 Tbsp (25 mL) granulated sugar
1 tsp (5 mL) cinnamon
Pinch ground cloves
Syrup:
2/3 cup (150 mL) granulated sugar
1/2 cup (125 mL) liquid honey
1 strip lemon rind
1 cinnamon stick
1 Tbsp (15 mL) lemon juice

Directions:
Grease 9-inch (2.5 L) spring form pan; set aside.
Filling: In bowl, stir together walnuts, apricots, almonds, pistachios, bread crumbs, sugar, cinnamon and cloves; set aside.
Syrup: In saucepan, bring sugar, honey, lemon rind, cinnamon and 1 cup (250 mL) water to boil, stirring. Reduce heat and boil gently until syrupy, about 12 minutes. Stir in lemon juice; simmer for 1 minute. Let cool.
In small saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Skim off foam; pour clear melted butter into bowl, leaving milky liquid in pan.
Place 1 of the phyllo sheets on work surface, covering remainder with thin damp cloth. Brush with butter. Top with second sheet; brush with butter. Spread generous 1/2 cup (125 mL) of the filling along 1 long edge; roll up and fit around edge of pan. Repeat with remaining pastry, butter and filling until pan is full, coiling rolls around edge of pan then in spiral and pressing firmly to form compact rounds. Brush with butter.
Place on 12-inch (30 cm) pizza pan.
Bake in centre of 350°F (180°C) oven until phyllo is golden and crisp, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven; pour syrup over coil and let cool on pan on rack, pouring any syrup that leaks onto pan over coil.
(Make-ahead: Cover and store at room temperature for up to 24 hours.)
