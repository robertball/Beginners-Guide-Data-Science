Ingredients:
4 Tbsp. Flour
4 Tbsp. Butter
2 C. whole milk
1/2 tsp.dried thyme
1/2 tsp.dried oregano
1 bay leaf
1/2 tsp.celery salt
1/2 tsp.dried mustard
pinch of cayenne
splash of Worcestershire
1 1/2 C. grated medium white cheddar
! 1/2 Tbsp. grated Parmigiano Reggiano

Directions:
In a medium saucepan cook butter and flour stirring until raw flour scent has disappeared.Add slightly warmed milk to roux stirring with a spoon to ensure all is blended well. Switch to a whisk and increase heat to med-high while continually whisking.Just as the sauce shows signs of boiling,remove from heat.At this point your sauce will have thickened and you may add the cheese,either all at once or in two parts. Once cheeses have incorporated add all other ingredients and continue to whisk until all are blended.You may add salt and pepper at this time to your taste,but I suggest dipping a piece of celery or carrot into the sauce for testing.Pour over desired veggies or pass around.
