1/4 cup cocktail sauce

In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese and cocktail sauce until well blended. Stir in crabmeat, Swiss cheese, and green onion. Spread about 1/2 cup of the mixture onto each tortilla, and roll up tightly. Wrap each tortilla in plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight.

Description: 
This is an easy and delicious spread, and yet another way to use tortillas for an appetizer. The mixture can also be used without the tortillas as a spread on crackers.
