Ingredients:
2 cups chicken broth (from concentrated paste)
3 pounds pork shoulder
1 tablespoon all-purpose seasoning

Directions:
Pour 2 cups of chicken broth into slow cooker, and add pork shoulder and sprinkle of seasoning. Cook on High heat for 4 hours, or until meat shreds easily. Remove meat, and shred with two forks. It will seem that it's not working right away, but it will.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Transfer the shredded pork to a Dutch oven or iron skillet, and stir in barbeque sauce if desired.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until heated through.

Description: 
This recipe has a multitude of uses.  It can be used for pulled pork sandwiches, roasted pork tacos, or fried up with sweet potatoes for breakfast.  Instead of using boneless pork ribs I like to use a pork shoulder or pork butt which I usually find on sale at my local grocer. Pulled pork is a staple in my home and it's fun to find new and creative ways to use it.Modified from: BBQ Pork for Sandwiches
