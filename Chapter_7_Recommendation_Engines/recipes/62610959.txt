Ingredients:
4 c. dry milk powder
4 c. sugar
1 c. cocoa powder
1 1/2 c. malted milk powder (Carnation brand)
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp. salt (optional)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in an air tight container.
For an 8-10 oz. cup of hot chocolate, add 4 heaping Tbsp. of the mix to 8-10 oz. hot water.
This makes a lot, but I go through hot chocolate like some folks go through coffee!

Description: 
While trying to perfect my own hot chocolate mix, I came upon the idea to use Carnation Malted Milk powder...the rest is history! This stuff has flavor...not just your everyday hot chocolate water.
