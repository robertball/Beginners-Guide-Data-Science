Ingredients:
1-2 tbsp olive oil
1-2 lb chicken breasts (I used thin sliced), cut into bite-sized pieces
chicken seasoning
black pepper
1.5 c water
1 package fresh angel hair pasta
1 bag frozen peas
1 cup sliced mushrooms (optional)
garlic powder
splash white wine
1 bag fresh spinach (optional)
grated parmesan

Directions:
Heat large skillet over medium heat and add olive oil. Cut up chicken while pan is heating.
Add chicken to hot pan and sprinkle with a hefty amount of chicken seasoning and about 1/2 tsp black pepper. Cook until chicken is no longer pink, about 5-8 minutes.
Pour water into skillet and bring to simmer then stir in angel hair pasta, mushrooms and frozen peas. (I cut the pasta with kitchen scissors into thirds so it would be short bite-sized pieces.)
When pasta is tender, add a couple splashes of white wine and a good palm-full of garlic powder (maybe 2 Tbsp). Put spinach on top and cover to steam, or just mix in and will wilt.
Serve with grated parmesan on top.

Description: 
Tonight, I was desperate to use up chicken and fresh spinach in my fridge. I didn't have much energy or time and I couldn't find anything I wanted to make on here. I took a chance and threw this together from whatever I had on hand -- and it turned out great! I needed to add it AR so I don't forget it. It can be as simple or fancy as you want. My picky 5-year olds and husband enjoyed it (except the spinach) so that pretty much makes it a keeper.
