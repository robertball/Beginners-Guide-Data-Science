Ingredients:
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup quinoa
1 cup frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 cup shredded Colby-Jack cheese
2 jumbo eggs
1/2 cup bacon bits
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground white pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line muffin cups with paper liners, adding extra grease to the bottoms of the cups.
Cook chicken broth and quinoa together in a rice cooker or bring to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
Mix quinoa, spinach, Colby-Jack cheese, eggs, bacon bits, onion powder, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and white pepper together in a bowl; spoon into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
These savory, gluten-free muffins are easy to make, and a great breakfast to eat on-the-go. I use as much organic and/or local ingredients as possible in all my recipes. I cook these ahead of time, wrap them separately in waxed paper, then freeze them to heat later for quick, high-protein breakfasts.
