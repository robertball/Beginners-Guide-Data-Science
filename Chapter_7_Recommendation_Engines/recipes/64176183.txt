Ingredients:
1 cup rice
2 cups water
1 family size can of Cream of Chicken soup
1 cup milk
3-4 skinless chicken breasts
Fresh pepper & salt to taste
1 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese
1 can of flaky buscuits

Directions:
1. Take 1 cup of rice and 2 cups of water into a pot to a boil.  Once it boils lower temperature and cook for about 15-20 minutes until rice is tender and no water is left. (you can also use a rice steamer or follow instructions for 1 cup of rice on the rice package). Preheat the oven to 350.
2. Take the chicken breasts and cut them into bite size pieces.  Put them into a frying pan with water just covering the bottom thinly and throw fresh pepper and salt to taste.  Keep adding water as needed until chicken is fully cooked.
3. In a casserole dish mix thoroughly cooked rice, chicken, cream of chicken soup, milk & cheese (note you can add additional pepper or any other spices you would like).  Level the mix in the dish and place your biscuits on top (if you need to, you can break some of the biscuits into pieces to cover the top as needed).
4. Bake for about 20-35 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown and mix is cooked.

Description: 
If you love rice, cream of chicken soup & biscuits this is the meal for you.  I remember when I was younger and my mother had made something similar to this in a kit.  I decided to try to remake it without a kit to how I remember it.  It's perfect for those cool rainy days.
