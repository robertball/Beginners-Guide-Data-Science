Ingredients:
1 cup self-rising flour
1 cup self-rising cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (15 ounce) can cream-style corn
1/2 pound crabmeat
1 onion, diced
2 eggs, beaten
1 quart vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Mix self-rising flour, cornmeal, garlic salt, pepper, corn, crabmeat, onion, and eggs together in a bowl; let sit for 10 minutes.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
Drop 6 to 8 tablespoon-sized balls of batter into the hot oil; fry until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove hush puppies with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
Quick and easy appetizer! Similar to a Southern hush puppies but made with delicious real crab meat! This is really good served with a hot cheese dip or with tarter and cocktail sauce. My husband will stand by waiting for them to finish cooking to eat them right away.
