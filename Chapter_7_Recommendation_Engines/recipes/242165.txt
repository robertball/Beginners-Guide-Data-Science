Ingredients:
½ cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 ½ cups creamy peanut butter
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons cocoa powder, or more to taste

Directions:
Melt chocolate chips in a large microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Stir peanut butter, honey, and cocoa powder into melted chocolate and stir until completely combined. Transfer to a jar and store at room temperature.

Description: 
Better than store-bought versions because it is less sweet. Just enough honey to counter the bitterness of the cocoa powder. Delicious on bananas, toast, or anything else you spread regular peanut butter on.
