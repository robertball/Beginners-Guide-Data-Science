1 tablespoon of Jack Daniels Southwestern Spicy Mustard

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Rinse the haddock filets in cold water, and pat dry.
Spray a small glass baking dish with non-stick Pam.
Place the filets in the baking dish.
Sprinkle each filet with black pepper
Mix the mayo & mustard together, set aside
Put the cashews in a plaasic bag, and mash into crumbs.
(I use a meat hammer to make cashew crumbs)
Spread the mayo/mustard mixture onto the filets
Use less for smaller filets (should be a thin layer)
Sprinkle cashew crumbs over the filets covering all
Bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes until fish flakes with fork
