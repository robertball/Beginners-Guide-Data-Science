Ingredients:
Note: This is a vegetarian and dairy-free recipe
·     1/4 cup extra virgin coconut oil (such as Barlean’s brand) plus more for wiping pan
·        2 cups white whole wheat flour (such as King Arthur Flour brand)
·        1/4 cup ground flaxseeds (such as Barlean’s brand)
·        1 teaspoon baking soda
·        1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
·        1 teaspoon cinnamon
·        1/4 teaspoon allspice
·        1/4 teaspoon sea salt
·        1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
·        1 organic, free-range egg
·        1 package (10 ounces) frozen butternut squash puree, thawed
·        1/2 cup organic coconut milk
·        1/4 cup molasses
·        2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Coat a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan with extra virgin coconut oil. Place 1/4 cup measured coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl and place in microwave for 30 seconds, or until melted. Set melted coconut oil aside.
In a large bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, fresh ginger, cinnamon, allspice and salt; set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, add the sugar, coconut oil and egg; beat until smooth. Add the butternut squash puree, coconut milk, molasses and vanilla extract. Add dry ingredients in with the wet and mix until smooth.
Pour the batter into the pan and smooth the top. Bake on the middle rack in the center of the oven until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center of the cake, 45 to 55 minutes. Cool 5 minutes in the pan before turning the cake out onto a rack to cool completely.

Description: 
Even though I live in balmy south Florida, where it is pretty much summer year round, I still like to “get into” the seasons by cooking something festive and seasonally appropriate. So, when my son started flipping through Jessica Seinfeld’s cookbook Deceptively Delicious and landed on the recipe for Gingerbread Spice Cake I thought it would be the perfect fall-ish thing to make. However, I wasn’t going to follow the recipe exactly as it appeared in the book. Anyway, I had started slowly spiking my recipes with ultra-healthy ingredients (flax, wheat germ, hemp seeds, chickpea puree, etc.)
