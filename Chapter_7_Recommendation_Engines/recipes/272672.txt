Ingredients:
4 (7 inch) soft round flatbreads
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1/4 cup spinach pesto
4 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded
4 cups chopped romaine lettuce
10 ounces grilled chicken breasts, sliced into bite-sized pieces
2 Roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped
4 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Brush the surface of each flatbread round with olive oil. Flip over and spread 1 tablespoon spinach pesto and 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese over each.
Place flatbreads oiled-side down on the grill. Cook until cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes. Place flatbreads on a heat-proof plate. Top each with 1 cup romaine lettuce, 2 1/2 ounces grilled chicken, 1/4 of the tomatoes, and 1 teaspoon Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This recipe was developed by my 10-year old daughter, based on one of her favorite flatbread sandwiches. She calls it a 'Saladizza' because it is a salad on a pizza! This recipe is fresh, nutritious, and delicious. This is a great meal for lunch or dinner.
