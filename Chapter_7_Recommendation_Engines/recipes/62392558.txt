Ingredients:
9 eggs, separated
9 tablespoons sugar
1 cup brandy or or sweet marsala, divided
1 cup strong espresso coffee, divided
1 pound mascarpone cheese at room temperature, divided
2 pints heavy cream
2 packages of Savoiardi or ladyfingers

Directions:
make a zabaione by beating the egg yolks and add sugar gradually in the top of a double boiler until ivory colored. add 3/4 cup brandy (or marsala) and whisk over simmering water until mixture begins to thicken. let cool.
stir 1/2 cup espresso coffee into the mascarpone. whip heavy cream to soft peaks. beat egg whites until stiff. fold the egg whites into the zabaione.
arrange Savoiardi (ladyfingers) in a single layer in the bottom and on all sides of a large trifle bowl (10 or 11 inches) or rectangular dish (10 x 13 x 3). sprinkle savoiardi (ladyfingers), until soaked but not soggy, with mixture of remaining brandy (or marsala) and espresso (1/2 of each).
over the Savoiardi (ladyfingers), layer half the mascarpone, then half the zabaione and one third of the whipped cream. sprinkle with one-third of the cocoa. repeat layers, finishing with remaining whipped cream and sprinkle with remaining cocoa. refrigerate at least 2 hours, preferable overnight.
