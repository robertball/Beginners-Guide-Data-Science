Ingredients:
48 littleneck clams, scrubbed and rinsed
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/4 cup Vidalia onion, diced
3/4 pound bulk hot Italian sausage
8 large cloves garlic, minced, divided
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 teaspoon fennel seed
1 cup dry white wine
1 (24 ounce) jar Classico® Tomato and Basil Sauce
2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 tablespoons shaved Parmesan cheese
Crostini:
1 French baguette, sliced into 1/4 inch rounds
Cracked black pepper
Coarse sea salt

Directions:
Rinse clams in a strainer to remove any sand.
Heat the olive oil in a large pot (5-quart) over medium to low heat. Add the diced onions, stirring often, until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.
Add the sausage and garlic, red pepper flakes, and fennel. Cook until sausage is no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Drain oil.
Increase the heat to medium high. Pour in the wine and bring to a boil until it has reduced to about 3 tablespoons, approximately 5 minutes.
Stir in the Classico(R) Tomato & Basil sauce and bring to a quick boil. Add the clams, cover, and cook until clam shells open, 8 to 10 minutes. Check often to avoid overcooking.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix together remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves minced garlic, salt, and cracked pepper. Brush mixture on both sides of the baguette slices.  Arrange slices on a baking sheet.
Bake until its golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
Ladle the clams and sauce into bowls; top with fresh parsley and shaved parmesan cheese.  Serve with the crostini.
