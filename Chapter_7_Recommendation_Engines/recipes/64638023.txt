Description: 
I use this to drizzle over steamed lettuce or as a marinate. It is bold and sweet like Teriyaki sauce. It is super quick and easy to make and is as versatile as it is delicious. Marinade beef, chicken, and pork, or as a glaze for barbecuing, or as a dressings, or in noodle dishes and stir-fries.
