Ingredients:
4 Mission® Sundried Tomato Basil Wraps
3/4 cup marinara sauce, prepared
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup pepperoni, thinly sliced rounds

Directions:
Evenly spread 3 tablespoons of marinara on each wrap.
Sprinkle 1/2 cup of mozzarella evenly over marinara sauce on each wrap.
Layer 1/4 cup (approximately 18 slices) of sliced pepperoni over the shredded cheese on each wrap.
Fold each wrap in half forming a half moon.
Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly spray with non-stick spray.
Place two pizzadillas in the skillet, at a time, and cook for 3 minutes on each side until crisp and golden brown.  Remove and reserve hot.  Repeat for the other two pizzadillas.
Cut each pizzzadilla into quarters and serve one full sliced portion to each person.
