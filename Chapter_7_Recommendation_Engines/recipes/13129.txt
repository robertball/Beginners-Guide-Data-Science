1/2 cup brown lentils
1/2 cup red lentils
4 cups water
2 potatoes, peeled and quartered

1 carrot, finely chopped
3 tablespoons chicken bouillon powder
3 whole cloves

Directions:
Rinse lentils in cold water several times before adding to cooking pot. In a medium-size cooking pot, add lentils and water and boil for about 30 minutes.
Add quartered potatoes and cook until tender.
When potatoes are cooked, remove into a mixing bowl; mash and set aside.
Add carrots, onion, celery, and chicken soup base to pot and simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes or until lentils are soft.
Add cloves, salt, and pepper and simmer for another 15 minutes.
Now add mashed potatoes, mix well and just bring to boil. Adjust seasonings to taste. Remove and discard cloves before serving.
