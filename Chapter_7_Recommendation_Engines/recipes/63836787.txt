Ingredients:
4 egg yolks
1 can (12 oz) can evaporated milk
1 cup granulated sugar (7 oz)
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar (1.75 ounces)
6 tbsp unsalted butter (3/4 stick, cut into 6 pieces)
1/8 tsp salt
2 tsp vanilla extract
2 1/3 cup sweetened shredded coconut (7 oz)
1.5 cups finely chopped pecans (6.5 oz) toasted on baking sheet in 350F oven until fragrant and browned, about 8 minutes

Directions:
Whisk yolks in medium saucepan; gradually whisk in evaporated milk.
Add sugar, butter and salt and cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until mixture is boiling, frothy and slightly thickened, about 6 minutes.
Transfer mixture to bowl, whisk in vanilla, then stir in coconut.
Cool until just warm, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cool or cold, at least 2 hours or up to 3 days (pecans are stirred in just before cake assembly).
