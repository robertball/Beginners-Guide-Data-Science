Ingredients:
1/4 pound bacon, diced
1 large onion, diced
1 stalk celery, diced
1 large carrot, diced
1/2 green pepper, minced
2 large yellow skinned potatoes, peeled and diced
1/2 bunch asparagus stems (uses tips for another recipe), chopped into 1/2 inch pieces
1 quart chicken broth or stock
1 cube chicken bouillon
2 cups water
1 cup diced leftover cooked chicken
1/2 tsp ground thyme
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
1/4 tsp celery seed
1/8 tsp (tiny sprinkle) cayenne powder
1/2 cup baby shells pasta

Directions:
In a medium soup pot, cook and stir the diced bacon until cooked and slightly crispy.
Add the onion, celery, carrot, green pepper,  potatoes and asparagus, and allow to cook over medium heat until onions become translucent, about 5-8 minutes.
Add the chicken stock/broth and bring to a simmer. Add the cooked chicken, the bouillon cube and the water, and simmer for 20 minutes until potatoes are softened.  Add the seasonings and the pasta, and continue to cook for another ten minutes or so.  Enjoy!

Description: 
True story, just cleaned out the fridge of a few things that needed using, and made a pot of soup for the purpose of sharing.  Poured myself a bowl and walked over the street while it cooled down.  When I got back and tasted it, I wanted my soup back!  :)
