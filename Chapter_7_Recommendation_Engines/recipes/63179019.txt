Ingredients:
4 Sweet potatoes
1 cup Heavy cream
2 tsp Pureed chipotle peppers
1/2 cup Butter
1/4 cup Creme fraiche
1/3 cup Maple syrup (adjust based on how sweet you want it)
1 tsp Cinnamon
1 tsp Fresh ground nutmeg (fresh makes a difference -use it!)
Salt
Pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375F
Place potatoes on a baking sheet and bake in the oven until soft, 45 to 50 minutes.
Remove the potatoes from the oven and let rest 5 minutes. Remove the skins and rice the flesh in a ricer set over a bowl.
Mix the heavy cream and chipotle and bring to a simmer over low heat in a saucepan. Save about 4 tbs of the chipotle cream mixture.
Depending on the size of sweet potatoes you used, you may want to be careful how much cream and syrup you mix in - start with half the mixture first - you want to avoid getting the mixture too watery.
Stir the warm cream mixture, butter, creme fraiche and maple syrup into the sweet potato mixture until combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste, nutmeg and cinnamon to taste.
Butter a baking dish and fill with potato mixture. A nice touch is to bake each serving in a ramekin.
Drizzle the reserved chipotle cream mixture before placing in the oven. Cook until golden brown.
