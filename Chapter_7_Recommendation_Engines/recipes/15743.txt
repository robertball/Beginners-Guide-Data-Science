Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages braunschweiger liverwurst, cubed
1/2 cup chili sauce
2 teaspoons prepared horseradish
6 drops hot pepper sauce
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 cup pimento-stuffed green olives, sliced

Directions:
Using an electric mixer or food processor, beat or process braunschweiger, chili sauce, horseradish and hot pepper sauce until well mixed. Cover and refrigerate until mixture firms up, for approximately 1 hour.
In a medium-sized mixing bowl, mash cream cheese with mayonnaise until smooth and spreadable.  Turn liverwurst mixture out onto a sheet of foil and mold it into a ball. Using a small spatula, frost with cream cheese mixture. Decorate with sliced stuffed green olives.
