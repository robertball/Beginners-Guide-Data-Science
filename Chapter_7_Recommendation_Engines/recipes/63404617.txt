Ingredients:
1 medium acorn squash (about 1 1/2 to 2 lbs), cleaned and thinly sliced, with the skin on
1 bunch asparagus (about 1lb), chapped into 1" pieces
4 large cloves garlic, sliced
1lb whole wheat penne
1 medium 15oz can white beans, rinsed
2 1/2 T capers, rinsed
grape seed oil
olive oil
salt
black pepper
dried carrot greens (can substitute parsley)
dried savory

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Place the squash in a casserole dish/oven pan.  Add just enough grape seed oil to coat the squash and bottom of the pan.  Add salt, carrot greens, and savory to taste.
Place the asparagus in a separate casserole dish/oven pan.  Add just enough olive oil to coat the asparagus and bottom of the pan.  Add the garlic.  Add salt, pepper, and savory to taste.
Place both pans in the oven.  Cook the asparagus for about 15 minutes or until tender.  Cook the squash for about 30 minutes or until tender.  Remove each every 10 minutes or so to check on them and add oil as needed.
Meanwhile, cook the penne according to package instructions.
Combine the penne, capers, beans, squash, and asparagus-garlic mixture.  Add olive oil, carrot greens, salt, and savory to taste if needed.  Serve.
