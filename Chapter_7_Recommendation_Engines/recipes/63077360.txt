Ingredients:
2 Tbsp. olive oil
1 34 lb. boneless beef arm roast, seasoned with salt and black pepper
½ cup low-sodium beef broth
1 bottle vegetable-juice cocktail (12 oz.)
1 Tbsp. prepared horseradish
¼ tsp. celery seed
1 bay leaf
2 leeks, sliced
3 ribs celery, sliced into 2-inch pieces
1 rutabaga, cut into 2-inch chunks (1 lb.)
½ green bell pepper, chopped
¼ cup cold water
¼ cup all-purpose flour
2 Tbsp. chopped parsley
2 Tbsp. vodka (optional)
1 tsp. red wine vinegar
Hot pepper sauce
salt and black pepper to taste
Celery leaves (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a sauté pan. Brown roast on all sides in hot oil over medium-high, about 12 minutes total. Remove roast from pan; place meat in a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker.
Deglaze pan with broth, scraping up brown bits. Stir in vegetable juice, horseradish, celery seed, and bay leaf. Pour mixture into slow cooker.
Arrange leeks, celery, rutabaga, and bell pepper on top of meat. Cover slow cooker; cook until meat and vegetables are tender — on high-heat setting for 4-5 hours, or on low-heat setting for 9-10 hours.
Using a slotted spoon, remove meat and vegetables to a serving platter; cover and keep food warm.
Transfer juices from slow cooker to a large saucepan. Skim off fat.
Stir cold water into flour. Stir flour mixture into juices in saucepan; cook over medium heat until gravy is thickened, 2 minutes. Stir parsley, vodka, and vinegar into gravy in saucepan. Season gravy with hot pepper sauce, salt, and pepper.
Serve gravy over pot roast and vegetables. Garnish each serving with celery leaves.

Description: 
Are you more of a “roast-and-potatoes” type of cook? Substitute boiled new potatoes for the noodles. Either will sop up the vodka-spiked gravy. Letting the vegetables sit on top of the meat rather than in the juices ensures that they won't overcook.
