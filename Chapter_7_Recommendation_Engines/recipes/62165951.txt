Ingredients:
2 cups shredded zucchini
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 clove garlic, minced
2 green onions, diced
1/2 cup diced red pepper
1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
one egg, lightly beaten
1/2 cup milk
2 TBSP melted butter
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Spray an 8 X 8 glass baking dish with cooking spray.
Place shredded zucchini in a medium bowl and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Let it sit for about 15 minutes to allow the liquid to separate from the zucchini.
Then strain/squeeze the zucchini dry. You want it as dry as possible.
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, pepper, and 1/4 tsp salt.
In a separate bowl, mix together egg, milk, and butter.
Stir egg mixture into dry mixture just until blended.
Fold in veggies and cheese and mix just until incorporated.
Spread in greased baking dish and bake 30-40 minutes until top is lightly browned and toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.
Allow to cool about 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This crustless quiche combines zucchini, sweet red peppers, and mozzarella cheese for a savory treat. It makes a great addition to a brunch table, but also works well as a side dish. The secret is getting as much liquid as possible out of the zucchini.
