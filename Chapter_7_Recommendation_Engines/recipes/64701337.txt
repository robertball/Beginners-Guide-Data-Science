Ingredients:
12 Anaheim chilies
2 1/2 lbs. pork shoulder
1/2 onion finely chopped
2 garlic cloves minced
2 jalapeños diced
2- 32 oz. carton chicken broth
1/2 can beer
1/2 tsp. oregano
1 tbsp. garlic salt
1 tsp. pepper
2 tbsp. chicken bouillon
1/2 tsp. ground cumin
3 bay leaves
1- 10 oz. can diced tomatoes with green chile
5-6 large potatoes, chopped
2 tbsp. butter
2 tbsp. flour
2 tbsp. vegetable oil

Directions:
Put the Anaheim chiles to broil in the oven turning often to evenly darken skin making sure they don't burn.
Remove from oven and put in large ziplock bag or plastic bag for 10 minutes to steam the skins off.
Meanwhile, chop the pork into small cubes and sprinkle with garlic salt & pepper. Add oil to a large pot and brown pork with onions & garlic in oil for 5 minutes.
Add jalapeños, chicken broth, half a can of beer and spices. Bring to a boil, cover and let simmer for 1 hour.
Peel skin from chiles, chop and add to the pot (including the seeds).
Let simmer for 30 minutes then add the tomatoes & potatoes (add hot water if needed).
Simmer until potatoes are done, about 15-20 minutes.
Melt butter in a small skillet & add flour, cook for 2 minutes stirring constantly -- add to the pot.
Garnish with Cilantro, onions and lime.
