Ingredients:
1 (12 pound) bone-in ham
3/4 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup honey
1/2 cup whole cloves (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut 1 inch deep criss-crosses into the flat side of the ham. In a small bowl, mix together the butter and honey. Slather onto the ham, making sure to get in the crevices too. Insert cloves into the ham if desired. Place in a roasting pan.
Bake for 4 hours in the preheated oven, or 20 minutes per pound. The internal temperature should reach 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Baste every 20 minutes with the drippings. Remove, slice, serve, savor.
