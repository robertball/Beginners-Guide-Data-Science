Ingredients:
1 medium carrot
1 celery stalk
2 large garlic cloves
1 medium onion
1/4 red bell pepper
2 tbsp olive oil
2 14oz cans diced tomatoes
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 1/2 tsp sugar (or brown sugar)
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/8 tsp ground nutmeg
1 bay leaf
10 fresh basil leaves, chopped

Directions:
Peel carrot and cut everything in coarse pieces.
Transfer it to a food processor.
Grate the garlic over the bowl.
Blitz a couple of times. And there: you've got the perfect veggie base for the sauce.
Heat the oil and saut√© the vegetables over low heat for 10 minutes.
Add the tomato puree and cook for a minute.
Pour in the diced tomatoes.
Add the sugar, salt, pepper, oregano, and nutmeg.
Give everything a stir and bring it to a boil.
Add the bay leaf. Simmer the sauce, over low heat, for 45 to 60 minutes.
After roughly 20 minutes, add the torn basil leaves.
After 45 to 60 minutes you should have a thick, fragrant sauce. Discard the bay leaf.
Check the seasoning.
Optional: I like to use my blender to puree the sauce a little after cooking.

Description: 
By adding vegetables to the sauces, you add lots of flavor compared to a pure tomato sauce. For the diced-tomatoes: I suggest using San Marzano if you can get your hands on them.
