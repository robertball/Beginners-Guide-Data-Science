Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 (2 pound) boneless pork loin roast, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 (14.5 ounce) cans green enchilada sauce
2 (15.5 ounce) cans hominy (one white, one yellow), drained
1 onion, sliced
1/2 cup green chilies, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat the canola oil in a skillet over high heat. Add the pork; cook and stir just until meat is browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove meat from skillet and add onions and chopped garlic. Cook until onions are translucent and garlic is aromatic.
