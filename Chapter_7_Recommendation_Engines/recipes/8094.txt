Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups red and green candied cherries, quartered
1 cup candied pineapple, coarsely chopped
1 1/2 cups dates, pitted and chopped
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
4 1/3 cups chopped pecans
1 1/2 cups flaked coconut
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).  Grease and flour a 9 inch tube pan with a removable bottom.
Combine cherries, pineapple, and dates; sprinkle with flour, and toss to coat.  Add pecans and coconut; mix thoroughly by tossing.  Stir in the sweetened condensed milk, mixing well.  Spoon into prepared pan, and smooth the top.
Bake for 1 1/2 hours.  Cool the cake in pan on a wire rack.  When completely cool, remove from pan.  Wrap in foil tightly.  Refrigerate.  Cut cake when cold.

Description: 
This cake should be made at least two weeks ahead to allow the flavors to blend. Hint: I cheat and use the date pieces coated with sugar (instead of regular pitted dates), just taking off most of the sugar by rubbing them in my hands.
