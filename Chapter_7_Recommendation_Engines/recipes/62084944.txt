Ingredients:
2 Tbs. olive oil
1 small red onion, finely chopped
1-2 large garlic clove, minced
1/2 pound ground turkey
Salt and freshly ground pepper (to taste)
1- 28 oz can tomatoes & green chilies, undrained
1 Tbsp. chopped fresh marjoram (or 1 tsp. dried)
1/2 tsp. dried pepperoncini peppers, crushed (to taste)
1 pound ziti pasta
16 oz mozzarella cheese, grated & divided

Directions:
1. In large, nonstick pan heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute for 3 minutes, or until soft. Add garlic and saute for 1 minute longer.
2. Add turkey and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon, for about 5 minutes or until no longer pink.
3. Season with salt and pepper, then add tomatoes & chilies, marjoram, and pepperoncinis.  Bring to a simmer.  Reduce heat to medium-low and let sauce cook, covered for about 15 minutes until heated. (there will be liquid in sauce, this is ok)
5. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
6. Cook the ziti to al dente or just soft, not completely done. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Add sauce and half the shredded mozzarella, toss.
7. Transfer to an ungreased 2 quart baking dish and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and top is lightly brown. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
