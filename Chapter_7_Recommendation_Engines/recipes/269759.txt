Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup applesauce
2 lemons, zested
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lemon extract (optional)
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour

1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups peeled and grated zucchini
3 tablespoons poppy seeds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.
Combine brown sugar and eggs in a large bowl. Beat on medium-high speed for 1 to 2 minutes. Beat in oil, applesauce, lemon zest, vanilla extract, and lemon extract until incorporated.
Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Blend into the brown sugar mixture. Stir in zucchini and poppy seeds.
Pour batter into the lined muffin cups. Fill any empty muffin cups with water.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center come out clean, 17 to 18 minutes.
