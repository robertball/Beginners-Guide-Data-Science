Ingredients:
1 4-5 pound roasting chicken
2 teaspoons fresh chopped parsley
2 teaspoons fresh chopped rosemary
2 teaspoons fresh chopped sage
2 teaspoons fresh chopped thyme
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
20 garlic cloves, peeled
1 medium lemon, halved
1 large whole garlic bulb
1 fresh sprig parsley
1 fresh sprig rosemary
1 fresh sprig sage
1 fresh sprig thyme

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Loosen skin around chicken breast, leg and thigh.
Combine chopped parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, salt and pepper; rub half under skin.
Place whole garlic cloves under skin.
Squeeze half of the lemon into the cavity and place the squeezed half in the cavity.
Remove papery outer skin from garlic bulb (do not peel or separate cloves).  Cut top off garlic bulb.  Place garlic bulb and fresh herb sprigs in the cavity.
Skewer openings; tie drumsticks together with kitchen string.  Place chicken breast side up on a rack in a roasting pan.
Squeeze the remaining lemon over chicken; rub remaining herb mixture over chicken.
Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours or until chicken juices run clear and a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees (cover loosely with foil if browning too quickly).  Baste with pan drippings if desired.
Cover and let stand for 15 minutes.  Remove and discard skin, garlic, lemon and herbs from cavity before carving.

Description: 
Moist and tender chicken you'll fall in love with.  I got this from Taste of Home's Light & Tasty - October/November 2003 and it was an instant hit.  Serve with mashed or roasted potatoes and green beans for a meal grandma would be proud of.
