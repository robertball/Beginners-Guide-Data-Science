Ingredients:
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup red onion, chopped
3 sprigs fresh thyme, chopped
2 portobello mushroom caps, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 bunches broccoli rabe, ends trimmed, and cut into 2-inch pieces
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or as needed

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion, and cook until the onion has softened, and the garlic begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the thyme and portobello mushrooms, then turn the heat to low. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and cook until the mushrooms have reduced but are not browning, 30 to 35 minutes.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan, and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli rabe, recover, and steam until tender, about 6 minutes. Once the broccoli rabe has cooked, toss it with the mushroom mixture, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve.

Description: 
I have had complaints (Okay...my wife) about the way I used to cook broccoli rabe in oil because I use a lot of garlic and it was too heavy and oily. Check out this version - Lightly steamed broccoli rabe combined with portobello heads - niiiiiice. This recipe yields wonderful broccoli rabe in oil, combined with delicious portobellos, but since the broccoli is cooked separately it is not so heavy with oil. Really nice. Still use plenty of garlic though!!!!
