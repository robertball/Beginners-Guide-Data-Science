Ingredients:
3/4 cup pumpkin puree
1 egg white
1 tsp almond extract
1/2 cup coconut oil
1 cup coconut sugar
1 cup almond flour
1/4 cup tapioca flour
1/2 tbsp pumpkin pie spice
1/2 tbsp cinnamon
1/2 cup dairy free mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven 350 degrees
Use a nonstick 9X9 baking pan or prepare a glass dish with a little cooking spray
Mix all ingredients together until combined
Pour mixture into baking pan
Bake 30 minutes
Cool 15 minutes before cutting & serving
Notes: I added a few chocolate chips to the top of the bars when they came out of the oven & they melt adding extra gooey goodness. I also use a plastic knife to cut bars so they cute nicely & don't crack.
