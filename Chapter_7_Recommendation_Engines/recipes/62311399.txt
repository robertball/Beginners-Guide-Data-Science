Ingredients:
For the coffee layer:
1 tablespoon instant coffee
2 tablespoons warm water
2 tablespoons agar agar powder
75 ml (3 cups) water
200g white sugar
For the coconut layer:
1 tablespoon agar agar
250ml (1 cup) water
375ml (1 1/2 cups) coconut cream
50g white sugar
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
First make the coffee layer. Mix the instant coffee with the 2 tablespoons water until dissolved.
Place the agar agar powder and water in a small wok or pot and heat until agar agar is completely dissolved. Add the sugar and cook until dissolved, do not boil. Add the coffee and stir.
Remove from the heat and place in a small bowl that is sitting in a bowl of warm water. You do not want to let the mixture cool completely.
Next make the coconut layer. Place the agar agar powder and water in a small wok or pot and heat until agar agar is completely dissolved. Add the sugar, coconut cream and salt and cook until dissolved, do not boil.
Remove from the heat and place in a small bowl that is sitting in a bowl of warm water. You do not want to let the mixture cool completely.
Lay out the small foil cups.
Begin by placing 2 tablespoons of the coconut layer into the foil cups. Let almost set and then place 2 tablespoons of the coffee layer into the cups. Repeat this process until all the cups are full or you run out of agar agar mixture.
When the jellies are completely set, remove from the cups and serve.
