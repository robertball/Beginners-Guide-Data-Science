Ingredients:
3/4 cup good quality baking cocoa
1 teaspoon baking powder ( heaping)
3/4 cup butter or 3/4 cup margarine, melted
1/2 cup boiling water
1 tablespoon vanilla
1 1/4 cups sugar ( or to taste)
2 eggs
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips (optional)
1/2 cup walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Set oven to 350Â°F.
Line 12 muffin tins with paper liners.
In a medium bowl combine cocoa and baking powder; mix to combine.
Add in boiling water; mix well with a wooden spoon to combine.
Add in the melted butter and vanilla; mix well.
Add in the sugar, mix well with a wooden spoon.
Stir in eggs with a wooden spoon; mix until combined.
Mix the flour with salt; add in the chocolate mixture; mix well to combine (batter will be a bit on the thin side).
Add/mix in mini chocolate chips or walnuts (or 1 cup of both!).
Using an ice cream scoop fill each of the muffin tins almost to the top.
Bake for 25-30 minutes or until muffins are done, don't over bake! (might take a little longer, depending on how full the muffin tins are with the batter).
Cool, drizzle glaze over or frost with buttercream frosting.
