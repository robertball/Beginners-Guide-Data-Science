Ingredients:
15 Oreo cookies (half a package)
2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil
1/4 cup heavy cream (more, as desired)

Directions:
In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, whiz the cookies until they are fine crumbs.
Slowly drizzle in all of the oil and heavy cream with the processor turned on.
Stop the processor and test the thickness of the spread. If you'd like it thinner, add more heavy cream, one tablespoon at a time until it gets to the consistency you prefer.
Makes one half pint. Store in the refrigerator.
