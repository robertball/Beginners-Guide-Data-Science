Ingredients:
1/4 cup egg whites, beaten
1/2 cup superfine sugar
2 cups assorted edible flowers

Directions:
Clean and dry your flowers or petals. Use a brush to paint a thin layer of egg white onto each side of the flower petals or blossoms. Gently place them into a shallow bowl of superfine sugar and sprinkle sugar over them to coat. Remove from the bowl, and place them on a piece of waxed paper. Sprinkle some more of the sugar over them. Allow them to dry until stiff, about 8 hours. Store at room temperature in an airtight container until using.
