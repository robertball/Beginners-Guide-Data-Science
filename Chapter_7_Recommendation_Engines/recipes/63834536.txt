Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup chunky apple sauce
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup finely chopped peeled apple (1 medium)
1 cup butterscotch-flavored baking chips
1 cup powdered sugar
2 Tbsp milk

Directions:
Heat oven to 350Â°F. Spray 13x9-inch pan with cooking spray.
In large bowl, beat butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add apple sauce, eggs and vanilla; beat until well blended.
Slowly beat in flour, baking soda and salt until well blended. Stir in apple and butterscotch chips. Spread batter in pan.
Bake 28 to 32 minutes or until edges begin to pull away from sides of pan and top is evenly browned. Cool in pan on cooling rack at least 1 hour.
In a small zip-lock bag, mix powdered sugar and milk until thin enough to drizzle. Cut a corner off the bad and drizzle over bars. For bars, cut into 8 rows by 4 rows.
