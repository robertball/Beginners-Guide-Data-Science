Ingredients:
Meatballs
1/4 cup non-fat milk
2 slices whole wheat sandwich bread (crusts cut off)
14 ounces lean, ground chicken or turkey
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
1 egg
Sauce
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 small sweet onions, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup hot sauce (I used Frank's Red Hot Original)
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
1/2 cup honey (Optional: coconut sugar)
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
In a small bowl, soak the bread in the milk. In a large bowl, mix the chicken or turkey, Parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, egg, and the bread soaked in milk. Mix well until it becomes compact.
Get about a tablespoon of the meat then roll in between your palms to make the meatballs—we made them using a 1” scoop. Place them on the baking sheet. Cook for 6 minutes.
For the sauce, heat the olive oil on medium-low. Add the onions and garlic and saute until onions are translucent. Add the onions, garlic, and all additional ingredients to a bowl and whisk until smooth.
Add enough meatballs to cover the bottom of the slow cooker, then pour on half of the sauce. Add the remaining meatballs and pour the rest of the sauce. Cover and cook on low 2-4 hours, or until meatballs are cooked through.
