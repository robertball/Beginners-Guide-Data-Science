Ingredients:
½ cup hot pepper sauce
1 cup reduced fat sour cream
½ cup ketchup
¼ cup honey
¼ teaspoon paprika
¼ teaspoon cumin
8  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
¼ cup vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the hot pepper sauce, sour cream, ketchup and honey until smooth. Season with paprika and cumin. Set aside half of the sauce for serving later, then place chicken breasts in the remaining sauce to marinate. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant. Place chicken breasts coated with marinade into the skillet, and cook until nicely browned on each side, and meat is cooked through, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat reserved marinade in a small saucepan or in the microwave. Serve chicken breasts over white rice, or over salad greens with sauce spooned over the top.

Description: 
This Spanish chicken dish was a hit with me and my husband who love spicy food.  This recipe tastes similar to buffalo wings, but without all the calories.  The leftover chicken can be used chopped over salad greens too.
