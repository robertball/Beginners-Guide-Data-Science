Ingredients:
1 (15 oz) can garbanzo beans
1/2 cup canned diced tomatoes (with green chilies and onions, if you can find them)
1/2 packet taco seasoning
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp asian chili sauce (like sriracha)
1 tsp chili powder
1 small jalapeno pepper
1 whole roasted red pepper, canned in water
fresh cilantro (optional)
dairy-free sour cream (optional)

Directions:
1. In a sauce pan, heat all ingredients except taco seasoning, cilantro and dairy free sour cream until almost boiling -  about 15 minutes.  Dump out excess juices during cooking process, leaving about 1 Tbsp juices in pan.
2. After 15 minutes, beans should be softening and heated through.  Add taco seasoning and cook 2 minutes more, until flavors are well blended.
3. Pour mixture from sauce pan into food processor.  Process until desired texture.
4. Pour dip into bowl. If desired, top with dairy-free sour cream, fresh chopped cilantro, and another sprinkling of chili powder.
5. Serve warm or cold with raw vegetables and home-made pita chips.

Description: 
I'm always looking for lactose-free dips because I'm lactose intolerant and, well, dips are my FAVORITE.  This one is healthy and just spicy enough, and actually tastes like a meaty taco dip with fatty refried beans.  Top it off with some soy sour cream and dig in with some home-made tortillas.
