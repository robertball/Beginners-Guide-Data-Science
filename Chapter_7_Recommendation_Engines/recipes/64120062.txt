Ingredients:
1/2 cup 100% canned pumpkin
1/4 cup liquid egg whites
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp pumpkin spice

Directions:
Mix canned pumpkin and egg whites together with a spatula. (Mix by hand for a slightly lumpy batter or, if you prefer, use a blender to achieve a smoother consistency).
Stir in the baking powder.
Continue to stir as you add in the pumpkin spice. Add as little or as much as you like.
Slowly add water. Start with 1/4 cup and add from there. Be sure to keep the batter thick!
Turn stove on medium heat. Pour in the batter and let cook for about 3 minutes.
Flip the pancake and lower the heat a little. Cook to desired fluffiness and let cool.
