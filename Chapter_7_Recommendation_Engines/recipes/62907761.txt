Ingredients:
1/2cup butter or margarine
2cups sugar
2cups water
1 1/2cups Gold Medal® self-rising flour
1/2cup shortening
1/3cup milk
2cups finely chopped peeled baking apples (2 medium)
1teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
1
Heat oven to 350°F. Place butter in 13x9-inch (3-quart) glass baking dish; place in oven to melt. In 2-quart saucepan, mix sugar and water. Heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, until sugar dissolves. Set aside.
2
Place flour in medium bowl. With pastry blender or fork, cut in shortening until mixture looks like coarse crumbs. Add milk; stir with fork just until mixture begins to pull away from side of bowl.
3
On lightly floured surface, knead dough just until smooth. Roll out dough to 12x10x1/4-inch rectangle.
4
In medium bowl, gently stir apples and cinnamon until coated. Sprinkle apples evenly over dough. Beginning with long side, roll up jelly-roll fashion. Cut into 16 slices, each about 1/2 inch thick. Arrange slices in baking dish over melted butter. Pour sugar syrup carefully around and over rolls. (This looks like too much liquid, but crust will absorb it.)
5
Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 15 minutes before serving.
Expert Tips
For a cranberry-apple version, use 1 cup chopped fresh cranberries and 1 cup finely chopped peeled apple.
To make Apple-Raisin-Pecan Cobbler, sprinkle 1/2 cup raisins over melted butter in baking dish and arrange dough slices over raisins. Sprinkle top with 1/2 cup chopped pecans before baking.
