Ingredients:
1 fresh beef brisket (about 4 lbs.)
garlic salt
onion salt
celery salt
2.5 oz. bottle liquid smoke
2.5 oz. Worcestershire sauce
Bottled barbecue sauce

Directions:
Sprinkle both sides of brisket with garlic, onion and celery salts, to taste. Place brisket in a close-fitting glass dish (I use a tupperwear bowl). Pour liquid smoke over brisket. Tightly cover with foil so that odor does not penetrate other items in the refrigerator. Marinate brisket in refrigerator 12 hours or longer. Turn meat occasionally.
Line a shallow baking pan with sheets of heavy duty foil. Cris-cross sheets of foil and make them long enough to completely cover brisket. Place brisket on foil. Pour marinade and Worcestershire sauce over brisket. Seal Brisket in foil, making double folds.
Bake brisket in oven preheated to 275 degrees for 5 hours or until tender.
Roll back foil. Cover top of brisket with a generous layer of barbecue sauce. Seal foil again and bake one hour longer.
Refrigerate brisket and pan drippings separately until fat rises to top of pan drippings. Remove fat from drippings. Reheat drippings on top of stove. Reheat brisket wrapped in foil at 350 degrees about 20 minutes or until warm. Serve slices of the meat with pan drippings spooned over them.
