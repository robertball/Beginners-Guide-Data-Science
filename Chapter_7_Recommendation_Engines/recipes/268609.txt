Ingredients:
8 ounces ground Italian sausage
2 cups Almond Breeze Original almondmilk
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup canned pumpkin
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (25 ounce) package frozen cheese ravioli
Cooking spray
1 cup part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded
Coarsely ground black pepper (optional)
Chopped fresh sage (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook sausage until done, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Combine almondmilk and flour in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook 2 minutes or until thickened, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Stir in pumpkin, sage, salt, and pepper.
Cook ravioli in boiling water according to package directions to just al dente, 4 to 6 minutes. Drain and return to pot. Add reserved sausage and pumpkin sauce; fold gently to combine.
Transfer mixture to an 11x7-inch glass baking dish lightly coated with cooking spray. Top with mozzarella.
Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven for 20 minutes or until cheese is beginning to brown and sauce is bubbling. Top with pepper and sage, if desired.
