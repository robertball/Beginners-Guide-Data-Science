8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni
1 pound ground venison
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 (15 ounce) can pizza sauce
1 (4 ounce) can mushroom stems and pieces, drained
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Cook macaroni according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook the venison, salt and pepper over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain if necessary. Drain the macaroni; place half in a greased 2-qt. baking dish. Top with half of the venison, pizza sauce, mushrooms and cheese. Repeat layers. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes. Uncover; bake 10 minutes longer or until heated through and cheese is melted.

Description: 
Venison gives a pleasant change-of-pace flavor to this quick-to-fix pasta casserole. 'Since my husband is an avid hunter, I'm always trying to find new ways to prepare ground venison,' writes Donna Thomas from Bark River, Michigan. 'Even those who usually don't care for the meat will like this hearty on-dish meal.'
