Description: 
This recipe used to be printed on the Old Bay cans but it was removed a decade or more ago; it is very different than the one on the current Old Bay website.  I much prefer this one and even today occasionally see a posting from someone looking for the old recipe from the Old Bay can.  Well, here it is!
