Ingredients:
1 lb. uncooked fettuccine
2 cups fat free milk
1 Tbs all-purpose flour
1/4 tsp salt
dash fresh ground black pepper
dash ground red pepper
2 Tbs butter
2tsp finely chopped garlic
2 oz reduced fat cream cheese
2/3 C grated Parmesan or Romano cheese
2 Tbs chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Cooke fettuccine as directed, minus the salt. Drain: return to saucepan. Cover to keep warm; set aside.
Meanwhile, in medium bowl, stir milk, flour, salt, black pepper and red pepper with wire whisk until smooth. In a 2-quart saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Add garlic; cook 1 min., stirring constantly (do not burn). With wire whisk, stir milk mixture into butter mixture in saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat 6 to 8 minute or until mixture thickens and boils.
Stir in cream cheese until melted. Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted. Pour over fettuccine; toss to coat. Sprinkle with parsley.
(*Note* If mixture become too thick- just add some more milk- try not to add too much though: It tends to lessen the flavor) ;-)

We all love Alfredo, but it doesn't go so well with dieting. I stumbled across this recipe that doesn't have quite so many calories, but it still tastes good.. Enjoy!
