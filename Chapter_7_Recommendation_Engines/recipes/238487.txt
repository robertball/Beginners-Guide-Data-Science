Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups water
1 cup quinoa
1 1/2 avocados - peeled, pitted, and diced, or more to taste
1/2 large pomegranate, peeled and seeds separated, or more to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 lemon, juiced

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, about 12 to 15 minutes.
Spread quinoa onto a baking sheet and cool to room temperature, at least 30 minutes.
Transfer quinoa to a large bowl and gently fold in avocado and pomegranate seeds. Drizzle olive oil over quinoa mixture and toss to coat; mix in cilantro and lemon juice.
