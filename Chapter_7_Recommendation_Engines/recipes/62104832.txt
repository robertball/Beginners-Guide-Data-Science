Ingredients:
Cabbage  2 heads
3 lb.  Ground chuck
¾ lb. Ground pork
¼ lb. Ground ham (smoked if avail.)
1 tsp. Salt
1 tsp. Pepper
2 Eggs
¼ tsp. Paprika
1 Onion (2”) diced
6 Bacon strips
1 cup Basmati rice
2 28oz. bags or jars of Sauerkraut
1 ½ 28oz. cans Tomato juice
2 smoked ham hocks

Directions:
Core cabbage and boil separately 30 minutes. Pull leaves off with tongs while in water and lay out to cool.
Fry bacon until crisp. Remove the bacon, keeping two Tbs. of bacon grease, add the onion. Cook to soften it. Set aside to cool.
Drain the sauerkraut, rinse with water and squeeze dry.
Mix the meats well by hand. Crumble the bacon and add to the meat along with the onion and bacon grease. Add salt and pepper, eggs, paprika, uncooked rice, and mix by hand. Add just enough hot water while mixing to make a medium texture; not too soft.
Place enough meat into a cabbage leaf and roll from the splined end of the leaf. If the spline is thick, you can cut it out. It will cook to a soft texture though. Tuck in the ends into the roll.
In a LARGE pot, place one ham hock in the middle and line the bottom with halupki.
Place the largest ones on the bottom. Quarter the small cabbage heads and place throughout the layers while assembling. Cover the layer with tomato juice and water, then with sauerkraut and scrap cabbage leaves. There are no specified amounts for the liquid. It will all mix together when it cooks. (Do not assemble the pot and add the liquid at one time. Air trapped in the layers will cause a volcanic mess.)
Keep building layers and adding tomato juice and water. Place the other ham hock in the center of the top layer. Allow three inches of space at the top of the pot. When it heats, the entire contents will raise up. It will overflow if you don’t leave this space; trust me.
Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for four hours.

Description: 
This recipe was developed by my husband and is the best Halupki we, and all of our friends have ever eaten.  Freezes very well too.
