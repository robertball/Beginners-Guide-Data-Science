Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups cake flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 large eggs, at room temperature
2/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled to room temperature
2 bags Earl Grey tea (such as PickwickÂ®), finely ground
1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste
4 teaspoons melted butter, divided
4 teaspoons all-purpose flour, divided

Directions:
Sift cake flour, baking powder, and salt together into a medium bowl. Set aside.
Combine eggs and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium-high speed until fluffy and doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. Fold in the flour mixture with a silicone spatula, 1/4 at a time, until batter is just combined.
Add 1/2 cup melted butter, Earl Grey tea, and vanilla bean paste; mix until combined. Refrigerate batter for 2 to 24 hours.
Prepare 2 madeleine pans by greasing each with 1 teaspoon melted butter and dusting with 1 teaspoon flour. Tap out excess flour. Refrigerate the prepared pans before baking.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Pipe or spoon some of the cold batter into the prepared pans. Fill the molds no more than 3/4 full. Transfer pans to the oven and reduce the temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake until madeleines puff up and edges start to color, 6 to 9 minutes. Cool madeleines on a wire rack or paper towels. Wipe out the pans and repeat to finish the batter.

Description: 
I love Earl Grey tea, and decided to add it to my basic madeleine recipe. You can dust the madeleines with some powdered sugar before serving.
