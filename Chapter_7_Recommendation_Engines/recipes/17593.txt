In a medium mixing bowl, beat together softened cream cheese and confectioners' sugar until fluffy. Fold in 1 1/2 cups nondairy whipped topping. Spread mixture into cooled crust.
In a medium bowl, whisk together pudding mix and cold milk until smooth. Allow to set up 5 minutes, then spread over cream cheese layer. Top with remaining whipped topping and sprinkle with remaining nuts. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.
