Description: 
this is a dish I grew up on, tasty, economical,and a quick weeknite meal.Its so simple you definitely can make it yours! My husband likes corn in his so I usually serve it on the side and sometimes I add bell pepper for a change.It also freezes well. I think its the ketchup  that really flavors  this dish.
