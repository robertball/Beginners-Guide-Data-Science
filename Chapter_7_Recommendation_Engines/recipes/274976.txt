Ingredients:
1 prepared pound cake
2 cups sliced fresh strawberries, divided
1 tablespoon sugar
1 pint strawberry ice cream (such as Breyer's®)
1 (13 ounce) can whipped cream (such as Reddi Wip®)

Directions:
Slice cake horizontally into 3 layers and freeze for 30 to 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine strawberries and sugar in a bowl and set aside to macerate for 10 minutes. Once macerated, remove 1 cup of strawberries to a separate bowl for topping; set aside.
Create a sling in a loaf pan using plastic wrap. Place the bottom cake layer into the loaf pan. Spread the bottom cake layer with strawberry ice cream. Add macerated strawberries on top of the ice cream and spread whipping cream over strawberries. Repeat layers, adding equal amounts of strawberry ice cream, macerated strawberries, and whipping cream.
Place in freezer until frozen, about 4 hours. Remove from loaf pan and cut into slices. Serve with remaining macerated strawberries and whipping cream.

Description: 
This recipe is fast to assemble and while you can absolutely buy the ingredients pre-made, I prefer to make the cake part myself. 
You can also use angel food cake (loaf shape) or your favorite pound cake.
