Ingredients:
4 cups Mann's Vegetable Medley
1 (15 ounce) can white (cannelloni) beans, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup bacon bits, chopped (may substitute cooked bacon) (optional)
2 tablespoons Italian parsley, chopped
1/2 tsp Mann's Garlicky Vinaigrette
3 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground
1/8 teaspoon red pepper, crushed
1/4 cup olive oil, extra virgin

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add Mann's Vegetable Medley. Cook until water returns to a rolling boil, 1-2 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold running water to cool; drain well.
In a large bowl, combine Mann's Vegetable Medley with beans, bacon, parsley, and vinaigrette, tossing gently to mix. If made in advance, cover and refrigerate up to 24 hours.
Vinaigrette: In a small bowl, mix vinegar, garlic, salt, mustard, pepper and crushed red pepper until well blended. Whisk in olive oil.
