Ingredients:
Canola cooking spray
2 cups non-fat (0%) milk
1 teaspoon ground ginger
3 eggs
3 cups dry buttermilk pancake mix
3/4 cup chopped pecans
1 pound precooked breakfast sausage patties or links, roughly chopped
2 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and thinly sliced
1/4 cup maple syrup, plus more for serving

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with oil. In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, ginger and eggs.
In a large bowl, toss together pancake mix and pecans, and then whisk in milk mixture, just until combined. Stir in half of the sausage and apples, and then pour into the dish. Scatter remaining sausage and apples over the top, pressing down gently to submerge them somewhat. Drizzle syrup over the top and bake until puffed and deep golden-brown, about 40 minutes. Serve with more maple syrup on the side.
