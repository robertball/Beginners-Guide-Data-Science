Ingredients:
1/2 gallon buttermilk
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 tablespoons hot pepper sauce
24 fresh chicken wings (cut at the joint = 48)
2 cups all purpose flour
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon kosher salt
Peanut oil to fry

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine buttermilk, red pepper flakes, cayenne, and hot pepper sauce. Mix well. Add wings to mixture, stir to coat, and set aside.
In a large (1 or 2 gallon) zip-lock bag, combine flour, paprika, and salt. Shake until mixed well.
Using tongs, add a few wings at a time to the zip-lock and shake to coat. Remove and arrange coated wings on a platter.  Continue till all wings are coated and arranged on platter.
IMPORTANT: Place platter of coated wings in refrigerator for 30 minutes or until batter has a paste like consistency. This ensures the batter sticks to the wings while frying.
Heat oil in a large iron skillet to 350 degrees.  Fry wings in batches for 8-10 minutes turning them at the 6 minute mark. Wings should be uniformly golden brown.  Remove wings from oil and place on a paper towel lined platter allowing excess oil to drain. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce (blue cheese, ranch, etc).

Description: 
This is great football food! My family loves wings and these deliver.  Despite the spicy bath, these are not extremely spicy.  You can substitute with vegetable oil or Crisco, but food fried in peanut oil tastes better.  Also, a seasoned iron skillet fries better than other cookware.
