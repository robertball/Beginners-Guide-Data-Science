Ingredients:
1 ounce vanilla vodka
1 cup milk (non-dairy ok)
two pinches sea salt (the coarse kind)
2 tsp dark caramel (plus add'l for garnish)
2 cups vanilla ice cream (more if needed for taste)
1/2 cup pretzels (we like the traditional thin shape)

Directions:
Put milk, vodka, sea salt, and 2 tsp caramel in blender and pulse, adding vanilla ice cream. Blend just until "shake" consistency, adding additional ice cream if needed.  Drop pretzels in as blender is running, again just until blended.  Drizzle caramel around the inside of a glass, and pour shake into glass.  Garnish with an additional pretzel if desired.
