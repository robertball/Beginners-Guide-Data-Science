Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried parsley
3/4 teaspoon dried oregano
3 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup milk

Directions:
In a bowl, mix the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, thyme, parsley, and oregano. Cut in butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add milk, using just enough to form a thick batter.
Drop by rounded tablespoons into your simmering soup or stew, cover, and allow to cook 15 minutes.
