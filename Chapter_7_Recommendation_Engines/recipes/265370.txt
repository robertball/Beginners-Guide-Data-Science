Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked fusilli pasta
1 cup frozen mixed vegetables
1/3 cup minced dill pickles
1/3 cup minced celery
1/3 cup minced radishes
1/2 cup light creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle WhipÂ®), or more to taste
1/3 cup shredded aged Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons light Thousand Island salad dressing
1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish
2 teaspoons whole grain Dijon mustard
1 pinch paprika, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, for 6 minutes. Add frozen vegetables; continue cooking until fusilli is tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes more. Drain.
Soak the fusilli-vegetable mixture in cold water until cool to the touch.
Meanwhile, mix pickles, celery, and radishes with creamy salad dressing, Cheddar cheese, Thousand Island dressing, relish, and Dijon mustard together in a large bowl. Drain fusilli and vegetables and mix in. Cover and refrigerate, 1 to 8 hours. Sprinkle paprika on top before serving.

Description: 
This dill pickle pasta salad salad has so many different colors that it looks as though there is confetti in it. There is a thousand variations to this salad! My mother adds ham and asparagus to it. I usually use tri-colored pasta in this salad to add even more color. Also I serve green onions on the side. All my friends and family love this so much. I don't think I would be invited on our annual family camping trip if I didn't bring this salad.
