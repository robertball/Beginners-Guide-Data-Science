Ingredients:
1 pound ground Italian sausage
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 pound leftover cooked turkey, pulled
1/2 cup turkey drippings
3 tablespoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon ground thyme
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon mustard powder
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 cups water
3 russet baking potatoes, unpeeled and cubed
8 ounces white mushrooms, quartered
1 medium white onion, halved and sliced
8 ounces chopped kale
8 ounces sour cream
1 cup milk

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Set cooked sausage aside.
Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Stir in turkey, drippings, garlic, thyme, parsley, mustard powder, salt, and pepper. Add water and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Stir in browned sausage, potatoes, mushrooms, and onion. Reduce temperature to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are tender, stirring soup every 10 minutes, for 30 to 45 minutes.
Stir kale into the soup and reduce temperature to low. Simmer until kale wilts, about 5 minutes.
Stir sour cream and milk into the soup, cover, and simmer 10 minutes more.

Description: 
Got the idea after one Thanksgiving when we had so much turkey left over. One of my favorite soups is zuppa Toscana. So, I came up with this. It has been an after-Thanksgiving staple for my family for the past 7 years. Great recipe for the leftover turkey during the holidays. Nice and warming and a little light. Great for those cold nights. Serve garnished with shaved Parmesan cheese and Italian bread for dipping.
