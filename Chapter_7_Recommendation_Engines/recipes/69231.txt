Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) cans oysters, drained
32 fluid ounces half-and-half
1/3 cup butter

Directions:
Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
Cook the drained oysters in the butter over medium heat until warmed through. Stir in half-and-half and bring to a slight simmer. Reduce heat, and stir occasionally to prevent boiling or scorching the bottom of the pan. Serve hot.

Description: 
This has been served on Christmas Eve in our family forever. We also serve Chili, for those who don't care for oysters. Great with buttered crackers warmed in the oven, or plain oyster crackers straight out of the bag.
