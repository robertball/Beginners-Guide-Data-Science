Ingredients:
1 (17.3 ounce) package Pepperidge FarmÂ® Puff Pastry
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup shredded Mozzarella cheese
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1/2 cup diced roasted sweet red pepper
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Thaw the pastry sheets at room temperature for 40 minutes or until they're easy to handle. Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or spray with vegetable cooking spray.
Stir the cream cheese, mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until the ingredients are mixed. Stir in the artichokes, red pepper and parsley. Season to taste.
Unfold 1 pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Roll the sheet into a 12-inch square. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the edges of the pastry with water. Fold over the edges 1/2 inch on all sides, pressing firmly with a fork to form a rim. Prick the pastry thoroughly with a fork. Repeat with the remaining pastry.
Divide the cheese mixture between the pastry crusts and spread to within 1/2 inch of the edge. Sprinkle each with the remaining cheese.
Bake for 20 minutes or until golden. Let cool for 5 minutes on a wire rack. Serve warm.
