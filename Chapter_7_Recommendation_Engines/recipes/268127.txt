Ingredients:
4 pork chops
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon oil, or as needed
1 (20 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained
1 apple - peeled, cored, and diced
1 onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 tablespoon caraway seeds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish.
Rub pork chops with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and pan-fry pork chops on both sides until browned, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Place browned pork chops into the prepared casserole dish.
Combine sauerkraut, apple, onion, brown sugar, and caraway seeds in a bowl; cover pork chops with the mixture. Cover dish with aluminum foil.
Bake pork chops in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
