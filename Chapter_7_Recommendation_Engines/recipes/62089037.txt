Ingredients:
48	Savoiardi biscuits (you can use ladyfingers but these work best)
16 oz	Mascarpone cheese
3.5 oz	instant vanilla pudding
2 cups	milk
8 oz	Cool Whip
2 T	sugar
1/4 cup	Kahlua or brandy
2 cups	Greek Coffee
Kahlua to soak the biscuits
Cocoa powder to dust

Directions:
Prepare a strong coffee (Greek or espresso) & let cool – add Kahlua to taste.
Prepare the vanilla pudding according to package recipe and put in fridge.
Beat Mascarpone cheese with sugar.  Add cooled pudding slowly.  Beat until completely mixed and the mixture is light and fluffy.  Add the Kahlua or brandy.  Add 1/3 of the Cool Whip to mixture.  (do not over mix)
Have a rectangular pan (9” x 13” or larger) ready.
Soak the biscuits very briefly in the coffee/Kahlua mixture only for a few seconds on each side and let the excess liquid drain.  Place them in the pan to line the bottom.  Spread 2/3 of the cheese mixture over biscuits.  Sift some cocoa powder on top to cover.  Place another layer of soaked biscuits and top with the remainder cheese mixture.  Top with the remaining Cool Whip.
Cover with sifted cocoa powder.
Put in the fridge overnight…
Enjoy!
