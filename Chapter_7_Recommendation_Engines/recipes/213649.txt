Ingredients:
1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed
1 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan. Pour enough water into the saucepan to reach just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring the water to a boil. Add the asparagus, cover, and steam until just tender, 2 to 6 minutes depending on thickness.
Place the asparagus into a baking dish. Spread mayonnaise over the asparagus; sprinkle with bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until the crumbs and cheese are golden brown, about 20 minutes.
