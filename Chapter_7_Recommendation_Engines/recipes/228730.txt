Ingredients:
3/4 cup Marzetti's® Old Fashioned Caramel Dip, or more if needed
1 cup pecans, divided
1 sheet puff pastry, divided
For Icing:
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon cream or milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
Pinch of salt

Directions:
For Kringle, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place all pecans on a sheet pan and toast for 8 minutes. Cool, chop and set aside.
Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Line a baking pan with parchment paper.
Unfold puff pastry in center of prepared pan. Evenly spread 1/2 of Marzetti Old Fashioned Caramel Dip onto center section of dough. Sprinkle with 1/3 cup pecans.
Fold one-third section of dough over to cover caramel and pecans.
Spread that dough layer with remaining Marzetti Old Fashioned Caramel Dip and 1/3 cup pecans. Fold remaining section of dough over all, trying to completely cover caramel and pecans.
Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until pastry is golden brown.
For icing: Whisk together all ingredients, adding additional cream if necessary.
Cool Kringle slightly and drizzle icing over top. Sprinkle with remaining pecans.
Cool completely. Slice and serve.
