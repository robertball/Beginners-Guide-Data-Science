Ingredients:
FILLING:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 egg
1/3 cup sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
BATTER:
1 cup water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup baking cocoa
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, egg, sugar and salt until smooth. Stir in chocolate chips; set aside. For batter, combine water, oil, vinegar and vanilla in another mixing bowl. Combine remaining ingredients; add to the liquid mixture and beat well (batter will be thin). Spoon about 2 teaspoons of batter into greased or paper-lined miniature muffin cups. Top with about 1 teaspoon of filling. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-23 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in chocolate portion comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
'These freeze very well,' notes Bertille Cooper of St. Inigoes, Maryland. ' I like to keep a batch on hand for drop-in guests or when I'm too busy to bake.'
