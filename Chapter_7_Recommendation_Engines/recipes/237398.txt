Ingredients:
1 skinless, boneless chicken breast half, cut into bite-size pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed, divided
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup cauliflower florets
1 cup broccoli florets
1/2 small onion, chopped
1 zucchini, chopped
1 carrot, chopped
1 celery rib, chopped
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons oyster sauce

Directions:
Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place flour in a shallow bowl. Gently press chicken into the flour to coat and shake off the excess flour.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute chicken until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.
Heat remaining olive oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add cauliflower, broccoli, onion, zucchini, carrot, and celery; cook and stir until vegetables are slightly tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add chicken, soy sauce, and oyster sauce to vegetable mixture; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and vegetables reach desired tenderness, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
My mom used to make this dish served over white rice. This is how we call it. Even if the ingredients are not Chinese, the taste resembles the Chinese cuisine in Mexico.
