Ingredients:
1 envelope unflavored gelatin
2 Cups scalded milk
1/4 Cup cold water
2 eggs separated
1/4 Cup sugar
1/8 tsp. salt
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1/2 Cup heavy whipped cream
1/2 Cup toasted coconut

Directions:
1.  Soften gelatin in the cold water.
2.  Scald milk on medium heat in small pan, do not let it boil.  Remove from heat and dissolve gelatin mixture into milk.
3.  In large mixing bowl mix slightly beaten (wisked) egg yolks, salt, and sugar.  Add hot gelatin mixture gradually and stir until sugar has dissolved.  Chill until it begins to set (about 1 1/2 to 2 hours).
4.  Add vanilla to chilled mixture and beat with mixer until foamy.  Fold in stiffly beaten egg whites with spatula.
5.  Toast coconut in toaster or conventional oven at 350 for a couple minutes until golden/tan color.  Whip the whipped cream with mixer (make sure beaters are well rinsed between uses).  Stir the mixture well then fold in the whipped cream and most of the toasted coconut.  Pour into serving glasses and chill well (about 3 hours) until set.  Garnish with remaining coconut and serve.

Description: 
A family recipe usually saved for special occasions.  Looks beautiful served in wine or martini glasses.  It has a rich taste with a light texture.  I recommend starting early on this, as the dessert needs time to set in the refrigerator.  Great for when the oven is occupied with other dishes!
