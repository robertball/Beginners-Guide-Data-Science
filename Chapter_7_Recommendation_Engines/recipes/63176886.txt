Ingredients:
Fresh broccoli, 2-3 stalks, cut up into 1/2" dice with florets of similar size.
One average size sweet potato, sliced into approximately 1/2" slices
1/2 onion, diced
3/4 cup milk
3-4 slices American cheese
1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon flour

Directions:
Put broccoli, onion and sweet potato into pan with sufficient water to just barely cover.
Bring to boil, cover and lower heat. Cook for ten minutes, or until vegetables are tender.
Remove broccoli and onions and put aside, in the cooking water.
Place sweet potato slices in small bowl with a small amount of the cooking water and mash well.
Put butter in 2 quart pan, and melt. Mix in flour, and then add milk. When the roux begins to thicken, add some of the reserved cooking water, then add in the mashed sweet potato, the reserved broccoli and onions, and American cheese slices. Heat on medium heat, and stir until the mix is a creamy consistency. Add more cooking water to thin if necessary. Add the cheddar shreds and stir gently. Reduce heat to warm and serve.

Description: 
This Broccoli soup uses a mashed sweet potato to give it that pretty orange color, and reduce dramatically the amount of cheese needed to give the soup a thick, creamy rich texture, that tastes good, and has a lot less fat, and more vitamins, than the old recipes with lots of processed cheese.
