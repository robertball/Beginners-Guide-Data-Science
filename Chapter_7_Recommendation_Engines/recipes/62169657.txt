Ingredients:
½ litre whole milk
½ cup condensed milk
¼  cup dry milk powder
½ teaspoon cardamom (elaichi) powder
1 pinch saffron threads
Sugar (if you want it more sweet)
¼ cup chopped Pista (pistachio) nuts

Directions:
Add the milk, condensed milk, and milk powder together in a heavy bottomed pan. Bring to a boil. Add the saffron and the cardamom powder. Add sugar now if you choose to.
Simmer the mixture for 10 minutes, stirring often. Cool till warm. Add the nuts.
Pour the mixture into 4 – 6 kulfi moulds (depending on size). Freeze at least 6 hours. Overnight is better. You can make the kulfi up to 1 week ahead and freeze.
To unmold, take the moulds out of the freezer 10 minutes before serving. If the kulfi is stuck, you can dip the mould in hot water and run a sharp knife along the edges to help release it. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Kulfi is best described as Indian-style ice cream. However, unlike ice cream, kulfi is not churned. This is a fantastic summer dessert. This is a quick and easy version of kulfi. I almost never make kulfi the old way any more.
