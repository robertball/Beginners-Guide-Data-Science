Ingredients:
Ingredients:
8-10 chicken thighs (about 2 pounds)
1 cup orange juice
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup rice vinegar
1/8 cup fish sauce
1 tbl soy sauce
1 tbl grated ginger
1 bunch green onions
1 jalapeno pepper
1 red bell pepper
4 oz sugar snap peas, or snow peas (a handful)
4 cloves garlic
1 tsp hot chili flakes
2 tbl orange zest
cilantro to garnish
*I served on some brown rice, which was a very nice combo with the orange flavors, since the brown rice has that slight nuttiness to it.

Directions:
Cut chicken into 2 inch pieces. Marinate in juice, sugar, vinegar, fish sauce and soy sauce (30 minutes to an hour). While marinating, peel and grate ginger. Slice green onions, separating white and light green from dark green tops. Slice hot pepper, and chop bell pepper. Mince garlic, zest orange. Chop cilantro.
Drain chicken, reserve marinade - it will be used to make the basis of the sauce. Heat oil in a hot skillet. Add well-drained chicken. As the chicken heats, more juices will be expelled. Spoon off the juices - this allows chicken to brown instead of steam. Once browned, add ginger white part of green onions and orange zest with the remaining marinade. Continue cooking to reduce the sauce. Once chicken is browned and cooked through, add remaining ingredients except for cilantro and green onions to the pan. Stir until lightly cooked: no longer raw, but not soft. Off heat, but while pan and ingredients are still hot, add dark part of green onions. Garnish with cilantro.
