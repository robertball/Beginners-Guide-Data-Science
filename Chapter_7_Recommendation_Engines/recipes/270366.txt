Ingredients:
5 ounces crushed shortbread cookies, or as needed
24 ounces cream cheese (such as Philadelphia®)
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste
1 cup confectioners' sugar
12 ounces sour cream
1 (10 ounce) jar strawberry fruit spread (such as Smucker's® Simply Fruit)
1 pint fresh strawberries, sliced

Directions:
Reserve about 1/2 cup crushed cookies and press remaining into the bottom of a springform pan to create a crust.
Blend cream cheese, heavy cream, vanilla bean paste, and 1/2 the confectioners' sugar together in a bowl. Set cheesecake mixture aside. Blend sour cream and remaining confectioners' sugar in a separate bowl and set whipped sour cream aside.
Top cookie crust with alternating layers of cheesecake mixture, fruit spread, sliced strawberries, and reserved cookie crumbles. Add whipped sour cream as the final layer. Garnish with any remaining cookie crumbles.
Refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours.
