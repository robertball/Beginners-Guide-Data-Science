Ingredients:
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon Greek herb medley seasoning (with salt)
1 teaspoon no salt lemon pepper seasoning
4 medium skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
6 chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1 tablespoon oil from the sun-dried tomatoes

Directions:
Whisk together the lemon juice, zest, extra-virgin olive oil, Greek seasoning, and lemon pepper in a bowl. Set aside.
Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry. Lightly pound each breast to flatten. Place marinade in a large freezer bag and add chicken. Press air out, seal and marinate, refrigerated, for a minimum of 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl, stir together the feta cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and the 1 tablespoon of oil. Remove the chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Divide the stuffing mixture onto each piece of chicken. Fold the edges of the chicken over the filling, and secure with toothpicks. Place into a lightly oiled 8x8 baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink, 20 to 25 minutes. Remember to remove the toothpicks before serving.

Description: 
This recipe has been scaled to serve 4, as the original recipe did not seem to scale properly (amounts of ingredients were way too high and it made far too much marinade as well). See link above for original recipe.Modified from: Feta and Sun-Dried Tomato Stuffed Chicken
