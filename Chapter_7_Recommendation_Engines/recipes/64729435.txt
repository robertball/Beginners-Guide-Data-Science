Ingredients:
Total of 4 cups of chopped citrus to include:
Juice & pulp (no pith or peel) of 2 large satsumas (approx. 3-1/2" across)
Juice of 2 large lemons
Kumquats (washed, quartered, deseeded, center pith cut out, then chopped in food processor
4 cups of water
4 cups sugar
1/2 box low-sugar pectin
9 jelly jars, lids & rings (washed & sterilized in a boiling water bath)
canner pot, jar grabber/lifter, jar funnel, magnetic lid lifter, wooden spoon, ladle, dishrag , finepoint Sharpie.

Directions:
After preparing citrus, boil it for 30 minutes with 4 cups of water until skins are soft and translucent.  (While that's cooking, sterilize the jars, rings & lids in the canner. )  Stir in 4 cups of sugar mixed with 1/2 box low sugar pectin into the orange mixture.  Cook about 10-15 minutes more on  high heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until a few drops placed on a cold metal spoon from the freezer will gel up.   Remove  jars, rings & lids using lid lifter and jar grabber and place on a spread-out dishrag next to the pot.  Leave water in canner and on high heat.  Ladle marmalade into prepared jars using the ladle and jar funnel.  Place lids and rings on top of each jar and secure tightly.  Place jars of marmalade back into the canner, making sure jars are covered by at least 1/2 inch of water and boil for at least 5 minutes.  Remove jars with the jar lifter and place back onto the dishrag to cool.  Label and date the lids with a finepoint Sharpie.  Jars lids will pop in and stay if they seal properly.  Refrigerate any jars that don't seal.  Marmalade will continue to gel until fully cooled.
