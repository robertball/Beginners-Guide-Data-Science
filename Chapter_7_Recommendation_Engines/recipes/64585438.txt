Ingredients:
2 bottles red Spanish table wine (Garnacha, Tempranillo, Merlot, Bonarda or Zinfandel are good choices)
1/2 cup triple sec
3/4 cup peach brandy
3/4 cup blackberry brandy
1 cup orange juice
1/2 cup pineapple juice
1 cup pomegranate liqueur (If you do not have liqueur, use juice)
1/2 cup simple syrup, or more to taste (Simple sugar is equal parts sugar and water, heated until sugar dissolves, and then cooled)
Orange slices
Apple slices
Nectarine slices
Blackberries
Blueberries

Directions:
Mix all liquid ingredients together and let stand in a tightly sealed container or pitcher for at least 24 hours in the refrigerator before serving.
Do not add the fruit until ready to serve.  Leaving it in overnight will cause the Sangria to taste sour or bitter.
Tip:  Freeze grapes in place of ice cubes to avoid diluting the Sangria and add a splash of club soda for a little 'fizz'!.
