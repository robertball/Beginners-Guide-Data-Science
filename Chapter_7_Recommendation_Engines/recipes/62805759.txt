Ingredients:
1/3 cup olive oil
5 carrots, peeled and chopped
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1 T dried basil
2 28 oz cans whole Italian style tomatoes in puree
3 32 oz boxes low sodium chicken broth (12.25 cups)
2 cups heavy cream
Kosher salt to taste
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 T thinly sliced basil leaves

Directions:
In a 6 to 8 quart saucepan over medium heat, warm the oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. Add the carrots, onion and dried basil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the tomatoes, including the puree and the broth, and bring to just a boil. Reduce the hear to low and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes to blend the flavors.
Remove from the heat. Working in batches, puree the soup in a blender or food processor fitted with a metal blade. Return the pureed soup to the saucepan, add the cream and place over medium heat. Warm until heated through. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into a warmed soup tureen or individual bowls, garnish with the basil leaves and serve immediately.
