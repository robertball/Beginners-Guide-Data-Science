Description: 
Any decent Big Game snack table has to have a few substantial dips, and this loaded baked potato dip, with its three pounds of bacon, is nothing if not substantial. It's also shaped like a football, which of course has been proven to taste better to people drinking beer than dips in a bowl. Speaking of beer, I think this will pair nicely with something cheap, domestic, and in a can.
