Ingredients:
1/2 gallon pasteurized whole milk
1/2 cup unflavored yogurt with live active cultures

Directions:
Place milk in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Heat, stirring often, until a thermometer inserted into the milk reads 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Turn off heat and let milk cool, stirring often, to 115 degrees F (46 degrees C).
Pour about 1 cup of warm milk from the saucepan into a bowl and whisk in yogurt. Pour this mixture back into the saucepan and stir to combine. Ladle the liquid yogurt into clean glass jars and cover loosely with lids.
Place the jars in a warm spot in your kitchen, wrapped in a towel if your kitchen is breezy. Let incubate until yogurt thickens, 12 to 24 hours.
Move the jars to a refrigerator to cool.
