Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) pork tenderloin
1 small onion chopped
1 whole carrot, peeled, chopped
2 garlic cloves, smashed
2 cups chicken stock (from concentrated paste)
1 tablespoon olive oil
freshly ground black pepper and salt to taste
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 tablespoon all purpose flour

Directions:
In a non-stick saute pan heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium high heat.  Heat onion, carrot and garlic cloves until a caramelized crust begins to form.  Place the vegetables in the bottom of the slow cooker.  Add chicken stock.
Season the tenderloin with salt and pepper and place on top of the vegetables in slow cooker.  Cook on low for 4 hours.
Remove tenderloin and vegetables from slow cooker and set aside to rest.  In same saute pan as you used to caramelize vegetables pour the remaining juices from the slow cooker and reduce over medium high heat by half.
In a small bowl with your fingers mix together the butter and all purpose flour until a paste forms.  Whisk into the reduced juices and cook until slightly thickened.  Season gravy with salt and pepper to taste.  Serve over slices of tenderloin.

Description: 
If you must cook your pork tenderloin in the slow cooker, don't cover up the natural pork flavor with packages of onion soup and red wine.  Keep it simple and use fresh vegetables and a little stock to flavor your dinner.  The finished result is quite delicious. Serve over rice or buttered noodles.Modified from: Amazing Pork Tenderloin in the Slow Cooker
