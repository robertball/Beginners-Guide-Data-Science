Ingredients:
8 cups Swanson's Chicken broth
4 large stalks celery, diced - fine
1 Package Bacon - diced
1 medium carrot - fine chopped (shreaded is best)
1 small onion (Coarse Chopped)
2 Medium potatoes, diced
4 Tbls. Sweet Cream Butter
1 Tbls. Parsley
salt and pepper to taste
Knepfla Dough:
2 cups flour
1 egg
1 tsp. salt
2 Tbls. Sweet Cream Butter
1/2 cup milk (or water)
2 cups Heavy Cream.

Directions:
In a small skillet cook the diced bacon and onion to a rich brown color.  In a stock pot combine broth, celery, carrot, potatoes, Butter, Parsley, salt and pepper bringing to a slow boil.  Combine sauted bacon, onions, and bacon grease to soup mix and allow to simmer while making dumplings.
To make the dumplings combine flour, egg, salt, and butter into a mixing dish.  Slowly mix in 1/2 cup milk to create a thick dumpling mixture.  Make sure to mix well.
Remove the dough and make small round snakes with your hand about 1/4 in diameter.
Using a pair of scissors cut the dough directly into the broth.  Small dumplings are the key to allowing the rich flavor to soak into the dumplings.
Heat to a slow boil and allow to cook for 10-15 minutes or until dumplings are cooked.
Remove from heat and slowly stir in the heavy cream.  50/50 cream can be used in place of heavy cream for a thinner soup.
Serve hot and prepare to send your taste buds into heaven.
