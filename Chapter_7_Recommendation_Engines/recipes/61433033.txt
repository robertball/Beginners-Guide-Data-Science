Ingredients:
1 pound thin asparagus spears
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 ounce shaved Parmesan cheese
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, or to taste
1-2 cloves minced garlic

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place asparagus on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and garlic, and toss to coat (Alternatively, you can marinate the asparagus in a balsamic/olive oil mixture). Arrange asparagus spears in a single layer.
Bake 6 minutes in the preheated oven, then spread parmesan cheese over asparagus, and season with freshly ground black pepper. Return to the oven for another 2 to 10 minutes, until cheese is melted and asparagus is tender but crisp - when they just start turning bright green. Serve immediately on warm plates, sprinkling with balsamic vinegar to taste.
