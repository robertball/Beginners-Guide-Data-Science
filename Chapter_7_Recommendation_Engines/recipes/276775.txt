Ingredients:
Pumpkin Spice:
3 tablespoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon ground cloves
Soup:
3 pounds peeled and cubed butternut squash
2 large onions, quartered
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 cups vegetable broth
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (6 ounce) container Greek yogurt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Mix together cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves in a small bowl. Set pumpkin spice mix aside.
Place butternut squash and onions in a large bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat. Transfer to a baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until soft, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to the bowl of a food processor. Add vegetable broth, cream, and salt; blend until smooth. Add 4 tablespoons of the reserved pumpkin spice mix, and blend until combined. Ladle into 6 microwave-safe soup bowls.
Cook each serving in the microwave on high for 1 minute. Stir soup and continue to cook and stir, every 30 seconds, until hot. Top each serving with 1 1/2 tablespoons Greek yogurt and 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin spice mix.
