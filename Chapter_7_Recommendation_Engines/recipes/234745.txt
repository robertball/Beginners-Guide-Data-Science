Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package kielbasa sausage, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
4 small zucchini, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 (6 ounce) package baby portobello mushrooms, sliced
1 red bell pepper, cut into strips
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 teaspoon basil
1 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook and stir sausage slices in a skillet over medium heat until cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer sausage to a plate using a slotted spoon and set aside.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
Heat oil in the same skillet used for sausage over medium heat; cook and stir onion, zucchini, mushrooms, red bell pepper, and garlic in the hot oil until tender, about 10 minutes. Add cooked sausage, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and black pepper to vegetable mixture; cook until sauce and sausage are heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir pasta into sauce and mix well; top with Parmesan cheese.
