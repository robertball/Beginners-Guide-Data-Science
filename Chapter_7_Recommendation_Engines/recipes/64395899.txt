Ingredients:
10 red potatoes
2/3 cup raw cashew
2/3 cup water
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
3 stalks celery
3 tablespoons red onion
2 sprigs fresh dill
2 tablespoons chives
Black Salt opt & Pepper, to taste

Directions:
Before starting, measure 2/3 cup raw cashews in a bowl. Cover them with several inches of water and allow them to soak and soften for at least 30 minutes, or up to 6 hours.
Boil potatoes until tender, about 20 minutes.
While potatoes cook, drain the cashews of their soaking water and add them to a blender with 2/3 cup of water, 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar, and a pinch or two of sea salt. Blend until completely smooth.
Cool potatoes with cold water. Cut into quarters, add them to a large mixing bowl with some lemon juice and a pinch of salt & pepper.
Thinly slice 3 stalks of celery, very finely dice about 2-3 tablespoons of red onion, chop up 2-3 sprigs of fresh dill (about 2 tablespoons), and grate a tiny 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest.
Add the cashew cream to the potatoes along with all remaining ingredients (celery, onion, dill, zest) and carefully mix â€“ clean hands are the perfect tool for this job.
Chill before serving.
