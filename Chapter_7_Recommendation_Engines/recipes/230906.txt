Description: 
This is a slightly healthier spin on traditional fried apples. The skin is left on, and the reduced butter and sugar are offset with flavor-boosting bourbon, raisins, cinnamon, and lemon juice. I use Cameos for this recipe, as they are naturally sweet and hold their shape well, but if you're using a tarter variety, you may wish to increase the brown sugar and omit the lemon juice. Golden rum can substitute for the bourbon.
