Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups cake flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons dry buttermilk mix
1 1/4 cups water
4 large egg whites
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 stick butter - soft
1 tablespoon clear vanilla extract

Directions:
Set oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour two, nine inch round pans.  Set aside.
In a small bowl mix water with buttermilk powder until well combined.  Add egg whites and whisk until foamy.
In your mixers bowl beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add extract and blend.
In a separate bowl sift the flour, salt and baking powder together.
Put 1/3 of the flour mixture in with the butter and sugar and begin to mix.  Add 1/2 of the wet ingredients and mix well.  Add another 1/3 of the dry ingredients and blend.  Add remaining wet ingredients then finish with the remaining 1/3 of the dry ingredients.
Beat for 2 or 3 minutes on low speed.
Divide batter between the pans.  Tap filled pans lightly on the table to remove air bubbles.
Bake for about 30 minutes or until centers are set and spring back when touched.
Cool completely and frost.
I also make cupcakes - about 20 and bake for about 15 minutes.  Depends on how big you make them so keep watch.... if the center is set and springs back they are done.
