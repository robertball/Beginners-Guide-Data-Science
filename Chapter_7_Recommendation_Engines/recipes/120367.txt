2 cups packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/4 cup all-purpose flour
Dash salt
3/4 cup milk

My kids start begging me for these cake-like sandwich cookies as soon as autumn arrives. I haven't med a person yet who doesn't like these fun treats.                                         --Deb Stuber, Carlisle, Pennsylvania
