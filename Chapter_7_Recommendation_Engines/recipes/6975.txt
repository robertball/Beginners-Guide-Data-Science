Ingredients:
5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
2 cups water
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons orange zest
1 1/2 teaspoons caraway seed
1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seed
2 eggs, room temperature
2 cups rye flour

Directions:
Boil water, sugar, oil, salt, orange rind, caraway seeds, and fennel seeds in a saucepan for 3 minutes.  Cool until warm
In a large bowl, whisk together 3 cups flour and yeast.  Stir in cooled orange rind mixture.  Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes.  Blend in eggs.  Add 1 cup flour, and beat 1 minute on medium speed.  Add rye flour and enough additional white flour to make a stiff dough.
Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead for 8 to 10 minutes, or until smooth and satiny.  Shape into a ball.  Place in lightly greased bowl, turning to grease  the surface.  Cover with a damp cloth, and place in a warm spot.  Allow to rise for 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled.
Punch dough down, and divide in half.  Shape into 2 balls.   Let rest for 10 min.  Shape into 2  loaves, and place into ungreased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans.  Brush with oil.  Allow to rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes, or until done.
