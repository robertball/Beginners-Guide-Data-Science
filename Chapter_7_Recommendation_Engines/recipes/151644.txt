5 large potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces

2 tablespoons butter
Generous dash ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat broth and potatoes in 3-quart saucepan over high heat to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Drain, reserving broth.
Mash potatoes with 1/4 cup broth, cream, butter and black pepper. Add additional broth, if needed, until desired consistency.
For an interesting twist: Stir 1/2 cup sour cream, 3 slices bacon cooked and crumbled (reserve some for garnish) and 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives into hot mashed potatoes. Sprinkle with remaining bacon.
