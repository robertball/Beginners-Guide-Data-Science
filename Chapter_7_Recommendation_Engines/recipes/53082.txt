Ingredients:
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling
1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate fudge cake mix
2 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon almond extract
Frosting:
1 cup white sugar
1/3 cup milk
5 tablespoons butter
1 (6 ounce) package chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 15x10-inch jelly roll pan.
Stir cherry filling, cake mix, eggs, and almond extract together in a bowl by hand. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely.
While brownies are cooling, bring sugar, milk, and butter to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in chocolate chips until melted. Remove from heat. Spread over cooled brownies.
