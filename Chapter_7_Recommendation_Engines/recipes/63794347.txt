Ingredients:
2 Tbs. olive oil
10 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 Tbs. fennel seeds
3 bay leaves
1/4 cup tomato paste
1 1/2 tsp. salt
1 large fennel bulb
1 large can crushed tomatoes, with juices
5 cups fish or vegetable stock
1 pinch saffron (about 20 strands)
2 lb. fresh cod, cut into 2-inch chunks

Directions:
In a dutch oven, warm olive oil over low heat.  Add garlic, fennel seeds and bay leaves and cook for about 10 minutes. Careful not to brown the garlic, it becomes bitter.  Stir in the tomato paste and salt and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and fish stock.  Puree the soup with an immersion blender.  Transfer the contents of the pan to a slow cooker.
Cut off the stem of fennel bulb and coarsely chop the feathery tops to yield 2 Tbs. Cut the bulb lengthwise into wedges and trim away the core, leaving only a little bit of the core intact to hold each wedge together. Add the fennel wedges.  Cover and cook on low for 3 hours. Add fish chunks and saffron, re-cover and cook until the fish is firm but tender, about 30 minutes.
Discard the bay leaves and ladle into bowls.  Garnish with orange zest and chopped fennel tops.
