Ingredients:
24 jalapeno peppers, seeded and halved lengthwise
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (8 ounce) package sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded
1 (2.5 ounce) package bacon bits
5 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls
1 (12 ounce) package cocktail sausages

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Put jalapenos on a baking sheet.
Cook in the preheated oven until jalapenos have softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.
Unwrap crescent dough and separate into triangles.
Combine cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, and bacon bits in a bowl; mix well. Stuff each jalapeno with the cheese mixture and press a cocktail sausage on top. Wrap each stuffed jalapeno with a crescent triangle and place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until dough is puffed and golden brown and cheese has melted, 12 to 14 minutes.
