Ingredients:
•1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
•1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
•1 cup sugar
•1 cup brown sugar
•1 1/2 cups rolled oats
•1 Tbs. cinnamon
•2 tsp. baking powder
•1 tsp. salt
•1 cup vegetable oil
•1/2 cup plain yogurt
•4 eggs
•1 1/4 pound fresh strawberrys
•(optional 1/4 cup flax seed)

Directions:
1.Preheat oven to 350
2.Stir together both flours, both sugars, oats, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt (and optional flax seed) in a large bowl. In a smaller bowl whisk the eggs, oil and yogurt. Stir into flour mixture just until combined, I sometimes even use my hands because the batter is pretty thick. Fold in strawberries, or use your hands once again ;)! Pour into two greased loaf pans
3.Bake about 50 to 60 minutes until toothpick comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. Enjoy!
