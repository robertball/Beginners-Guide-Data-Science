Ingredients:
6 hard-cooked eggs, diced
1/2 c diced celery
2 1/2 Tbsp mayonnaise
1 Tbsp vinegar
1/4 tsp onion powder
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp worcestershire sauce
1/8 tsp pepper

Directions:
Place the eggs in a single layer in a heavy saucepan and cover with cold water by at least one inch. Add a teaspoon of salt. Leaving the pot uncovered, turn the heat to high. As soon as the water comes to a boil, turn off the heat and cover. After 10 minutes, remove the cover and run cold water over eggs for 1 minute.
To peel, gently tap each egg against the counter, turning to make a crackle pattern. Start peeling at the broad end, where there is an air pocket.
To make the egg salad: Combine all ingredients and chill.
