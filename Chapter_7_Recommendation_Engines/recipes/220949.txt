Image:
NA
Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles
2 tablespoons butter, melted
3  Macintosh apples, sliced
3  eggs, separated
1 cup white sugar
¼ cup golden raisins
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease a 2-quart baking dish.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Stir melted butter and noodles in a large bowl.
Mix apples, egg yolks, sugar, raisins, cinnamon, and vanilla extract into noodle mixture until well blended.
Beat egg whites in a large bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape.
Fold egg whites into noodle mixture; pour into prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 40 minutes.
