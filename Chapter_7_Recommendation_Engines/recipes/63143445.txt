Chocolate-Glazed Baked Banana Bread Doughnuts Recipe

Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cake flour, sifted
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 medium overripe bananas, mashed
2 Tablespoons canola or vegetable oil
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup miniature chocolate chips (optional)
3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
colored sprinkles or chopped, toasted pecans, or toasted coconut (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 2 6-cup doughnut pans with cooking spray.
In a medium bowl, whisk together first five ingredients.
In a separate bowl, stir together bananas, oil, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.
Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir just until combined. If adding mini chocolate chips, stir into the batter at this time.
Fill each doughnut cup 2/3 full.* (I dump the batter into a zippered plastic bag, seal it, and cut off one corner. This makes filling the cups a breeze!)
Bake 8-10 minutes in the preheated oven until the tops are brown and spring back when lightly touched. Cool slightly in pans before glazing and moving to cooling racks.
*****************************************************
To make glaze, place 3/4 cups chocolate chips, corn syrup, and butter in a heavy glass bowl. Microwave at 50% power in 15 second intervals, stirring after each, until melted and smooth. Add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and stir to combine.
Dip bottoms of warm doughnuts into glaze, flip over, and place on cooling rack (I place parchment paper underneath to catch drips). Top with topping of your choice or leave plain.
