Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts
12 slices bacon, diced
1/2 cup chopped onion
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups milk
1/3 cup dry white wine
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
3/4 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/8 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Cut an X in the stem end of the Brussels sprouts.  Bring a pot of water to a boil.  Add Brussels sprouts and cook until tender, about 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and place in a shallow baking dish.
Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, reserving 1 tablespoon of grease, and set aside.
Saute onion in reserved bacon grease, until limp.  Stir in flour and cook until bubbly.  Remove from heat and whisk in milk.  Return to heat and cook, stirring, until the mixture boils and thickens.  Stir in wine, salt, oregano, dill, pepper, and all but 2 tablespoons of bacon.  Pour mixture evenly over the Brussels sprouts and sprinkle with remaining bacon.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until heated through.
