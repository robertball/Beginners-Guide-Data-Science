2 tablespoons ground flax seeds, or more to taste
4 eggs
1 teaspoon baking powder

1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Mix banana and ground flax seeds together in a bowl. Add eggs, baking powder, and cinnamon; beat together until combined.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Drop small spoonfuls of batter into the skillet. Cook until bubbles form and edges look dry, 4 to 5 minutes per side.

Description: 
I've done a lot of experimenting with flourless pancakes and came up with this version recently. So far these are my favorite! They taste best with maple syrup and a dollop of whipped cream on top if you have some handy. My kids like to use cookie cutters to make shapes out of these pancakes before they gobble them up. Enjoy!
