Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter for greasing, or as needed
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
1 (12 ounce) can poppy seed filling
4 eggs
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
2/3 cup milk
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
2 cups white sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with butter.
Combine oil, poppy seed filling, eggs, evaporated milk, and milk in a bowl. Sift flour and baking soda together in a separate bowl and stir in sugar. Add flour mixture to the milk mixture and mix well. Pour batter into the prepared Bundt(R) pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 70 minutes.
