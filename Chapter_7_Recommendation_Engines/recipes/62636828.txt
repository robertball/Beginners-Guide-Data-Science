Description: 
A modest amount of full-fat, full-flavored creamy Gorgonzola cheese is blended in along with tangy lemon juice, Champagne vinegar and chopped fresh chives. The resulting dip gets all the reduced-fat benefits of its lighter ingredients, plus all the fantastic flavor of the sweet and pungent Gorgonzola.
