3 small eggplant - peeled, halved, and sliced into half-moons
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 red onion, sliced
1 yellow onion, sliced

1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Heat a large skillet to about 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) or over medium heat.
Place eggplant in a large bowl and add salt; stir. Add red onion, yellow onion, and green bell pepper and stir. Mix garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, and cayenne into vegetable mixture. Crack egg over vegetable mixture and stir. Add bread crumbs and stir well.
Pour olive oil into hot skillet. Cover skillet and cook vegetable mixture in the hot oil, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This happened by accident during my first year as a gardener. I quickly tired of the whole 'salt/wait/rinse' routine of prepping eggplant, and tried it this way. The first time we made this, the hubs asked me what kind of sausage I had used in it as it tastes 'meaty'. We both stared at the empty bowl in amazement as I am not a good cook and this is GOOD! I serve this with sausage or any type of grilled meat. If doubled, it is a meal in itself.
