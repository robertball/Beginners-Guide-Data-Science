Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 3/4 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 cup water
3/4 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs, room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans or line them with parchment paper.
Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, sugar, salt, cocoa powder, 3/4 cup water, and vegetable oil in a mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add the eggs, vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup water and beat for another 2 minutes.
Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven until the surface of the cake springs back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
This is a recipe from the American Women's Association in Kenya from the late 70's. It has been 'the' chocolate cake in my family since our Kenya days. This recipe has survived for one reason...the final product is delicious.
