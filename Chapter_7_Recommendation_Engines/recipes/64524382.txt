Ingredients:
1 tbsp. soy sauce
1 tbsp. honey
2 boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into bite-sized pieces (about 1")
1 tbsp. olive oil
1 bunch asparagus cut into bite sized pieces
4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
2 scallions, chopped
2 tsp. toasted sesame oil
1 tsp. toasted sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
In a small Ziploc bag combine soy sauce and honey.
Add chicken and stir to coat.  Set in refrigerator until ready to cook.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add asparagus, and sauté until cooked, about 5 minutes.
Remove asparagus with a slotted spoon, and set aside.
Remove chicken from marinade, and add to skillet.   Sauté until nearly cooked through (with the insides still slightly pink), about 5 minutes.
Then add garlic, scallions, and the reserved marinade to the pan.  Saute for an additional 2 minutes until the chicken is cooked and the garlic is fragrant.
Combine with asparagus and toss lightly in the pan.
Remove from heat and stir in sesame oil.  Serve immediately with rice, garnish with toasted sesame seeds if desired.
