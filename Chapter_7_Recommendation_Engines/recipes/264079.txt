Ingredients:
1 eggplant, cut into 1/4-inch rounds
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 cup shredded Gouda cheese

Directions:
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Arrange eggplant slices on a baking sheet and place under the broiler. Cook until slightly browned, about 5 minutes per side.
Turn off broiler and heat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Arrange 1/2 of the eggplant slices in a single layer in a baking dish. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with cilantro, garlic, and 1/2 cup Gouda cheese. Top with the remaining eggplant slices and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
Everyone in my family is a proponent of healthy eating, and as a result I have to exercise great care in picking ingredients and recipes. As a rule, eggplants absorbs too much oil when being cooked in a pan. This recipe uses no oil, which makes it lighter.
