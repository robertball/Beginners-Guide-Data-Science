Ingredients:
1 box puff pastry (2 sheets)
1 8oz container Philadelphia Chive and Onion flavor Cream Cheese
1/2 C shredded mozzarella cheese
1 1/2 C cooked shredded chicken breast
1/3 C cooked crumbled bacon
3 Tbs finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1 egg
1 Tbs water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Warm cream cheese in the microwave for 20-30 seconds to soften.  Place in a mixing bowl with mozzarella cheese, chicken, bacon, and sun-dried tomatoes.  Stir to combine and set aside.
Defrost puff pastry sheets according to package directions.  Lightly dust a work surface with flour and roll one sheet at a time into a 12 x 12 inch square.  Cut 4, 3 inch strips each direction to make 16 squares, 3 x 3? each.
Place about 2 teaspoons of cream cheese mixture onto each square.  With your finger, brush a dab of water around the edges of each square and fold over diagonally to make a triangle.  Press edges together and crimp with a fork to seal.
After stuffing and folding each pastry, place on a baking sheet.  Whisk egg and 1 tablespoon water together and brush over the top of each pastry.  Bake in preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until puffed and golden brown.  Cool 10 minutes before serving.  Can also be served at room temperature.
Freezer instructions: Follow directions through egg wash.  Place baking sheet in the freezer.  When pastries are solid to the touch, transfer to an airtight container and store in the freezer.  When ready to bake, place frozen pastries directly on a baking sheet in preheated 400 degree oven and bake for 15-20 minutes or until puffed and golden.
