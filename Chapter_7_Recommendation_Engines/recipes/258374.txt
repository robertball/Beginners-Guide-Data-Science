Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water
2 (750 milliliter) bottles Cabernet Sauvignon
4 fluid ounces brandy
1 fluid ounce triple sec
2 apples - peeled, cored, and coarsely chopped
1 orange, cut into thin wedges
1 orange, juiced
1 lemon, cut into thin wedges
1 (12 ounce) can citrus-flavored soda (such as FrescaÂ®)

Directions:
Combine sugar and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until water is hot, 30 to 45 seconds. Stir until sugar dissolves into a syrup. Let cool.
Transfer syrup to a large pitcher. Pour in Cabernet Sauvignon, brandy, and triple sec. Add apples, orange wedges, and orange juice. Squeeze juice from lemon wedges into the pitcher; add wedges to the pitcher. Refrigerate until flavors combine, 12 to 24 hours.
Stir citrus-flavored soda into the sangria before serving.
