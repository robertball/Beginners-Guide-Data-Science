Ingredients:
1/4 cup flour (can use part whole wheat flour)
1/3 cup uncooked oatmeal
2 tablespoons milled Flax Seed
1 Tablespoon Sunflower Seeds (Roasted & Salted)
1 Tablespoon Wheat Germ
1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 Tablespoon finely chopped raw onion
About 1-inch of uncooked breakfast Sausage torn into bits.  Add more or less to taste.
1 egg
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Put all dry ingredients into a bowl and mix thoroughly. Add the sausage and minced onion and mix well. Add the egg and milk and again mix well. Allow to stand a few minutes till liquid is absorbed into the oatmeal. Mixture should be thick but not dry. Add a bit more milk if necessary.  Heat a skillet with a little cooking oil to medium heat.  Drop by the spoonful into the heated skillet. Flatten to about 1/2 inch thick with a cooking spatula. Fry like you would meat patties, turning several times. Cook till browned and well cooked. Can be eaten as is or used like meat patties.
