Ingredients:
2 (6 oz) cans minced clams (i use three little cans or two big cans)
4 potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes
4 slices bacon
1/2 c. onion chopped
1 c. bottled clam juice
1/2 c. heavy cream (optional)
1 c. half and half
1 T all-purpose flour
2 T fresh chopped parsley (dried is ok)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
NOTE:  hang onto the juice from the cans of clams - you may need a little extra when you put the potatoes in the clam juice to simmer!!
Fry bacon in a large saucepan over med/high heat until crisp, about 10 min.  Drain, saving the bacon fat in the pan, crumble bacon and place aside.
In the same pan with the fat, saute the potatoes and onion for 3-5 minutes.  Sprinkle with flour and stir to coat thoroughly.
Add the clam juice and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 15 minutes, or until potatoes become tender. NOTE! it took like WAY longer for mine to get tender... like over a half hour... so first time you make it... be aware of that!
Mix in the half and half and minced clams, then season with salt and pepper.
If desired, stir in the heavy cream at this point and allow to heat completely...for about 5 minutes.  Garnish soup with crumbled bacon and parsley.
NOTE:  if adding cream, do not boil.
