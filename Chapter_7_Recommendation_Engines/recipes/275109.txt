Cold Barbecued Eggplant (Melanzane Alla Campagnola) Recipe

Ingredients:
4 large eggplants, cut into 1-inch slices
coarse sea salt
4 leaves fresh basil, finely chopped
3 leaves fresh mint, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, or more to taste, minced
1 sprig fresh parsley, stem removed and finely chopped
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup olive oil

Directions:
Place eggplant slices on a large cutting board and sprinkle both sides with salt. Tip the cutting board so it drains into the sink and allow to sit for 1 hour to draw out the bitter juices.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Rinse eggplant to remove salt, place on a clean kitchen towel, and dry fully.
Lay eggplant on the preheated grill and cook until golden-brown, 10 to 12 minutes, turning halfway.
While the eggplant is cooking, combine basil, mint, garlic, and parsley in a small bowl.
Arrange browned eggplant slices on a serving dish. Sprinkle garlic and herb mixture over top, and drizzle with olive oil. Allow to cool to room temperature before serving.

Description: 
My aunt's recipe from the 'Old Country' (Italy)
 is a delightful way to use eggplant.
 I adapted this for the BBQ rather then fried. 
It is best eaten cold.
 Takes time but it will not disappoint. To enjoy this dish at it's best, leave it for 7 to 8 hours in the fridge.
