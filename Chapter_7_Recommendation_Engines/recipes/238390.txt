Ingredients:
1 pound dried small red beans
8 cups water, divided
1 1/2 pounds beef roast, cut into quarters
3/4 cup barbeque sauce
3 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce - rinsed, seeded, and chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste
2 tablespoons red cooking wine
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon beef bouillon powder
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
5 dashes liquid smoke flavoring

Directions:
Place beans in a large pot and cover with 7 cups water; bring to a boil. Cook beans for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer until beans are tender, about 1 1/2 hours; drain.
Mix beans, 1 cup water, beef roast, barbeque sauce, chipotle peppers, cilantro, cooking wine, garlic, chili powder, cumin, beef bouillon powder, red pepper flakes, and liquid smoke together in a slow cooker.
Cook on High until meat shreds easily when chili is stirred, 5 to 7 hours (or cook on Low for 12 hours). Stir chili to distribute meat before serving.
