Ingredients:
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1  yellow onion, finely chopped
4 stalks celery, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme
salt and ground black pepper to taste
7  potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2 cups whole milk
1 (15 ounce) can fish broth
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 (8 ounce) bottle clam juice
1 ½ pounds Dungeness crab meat, chopped

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, celery, thyme, salt, and pepper in hot butter until onion and celery start to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir potatoes, milk, broth, cream, and clam juice into onion mixture. Bring to a simmer; cook until potatoes are soft, about 10 minutes.
Pour broth mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return pureed soup to pot and stir in crabmeat. Cook until soup is hot and crab is heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This is the tastiest soup I've ever encountered and the only one I'll ever submit. For a thicker sauce use more cream and less milk.
