Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup butter, melted
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup heavy cream
2 (16 ounce) packages cottage cheese
4 egg yolks
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
4 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, confectioners' sugar and cinnamon. Reserve 1/2 cup of this mixture and set aside. Stir in butter to remaining crumb mixture. Mix well and press into the bottom and 1 inch up the side of a 9 inch springform pan. Chill in refrigerator.
In a large bowl, stir together sugar and heavy cream until sugar is dissolved. Beat in cottage cheese, egg yolks, flour, vanilla, lemon juice and lemon zest.
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites and salt until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain. Pour batter into crust. Sprinkle top with reserved crumb mixture.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until filling is just set. Turn the oven off, and let cake cool in oven, with the door closed, for 1 hour. Chill in refrigerator.

Description: 
A very delicious cheesecake made with cottage cheese. Egg whites are whipped and folded into the batter to lighten it and give it a cake-like consistency. You may substitute ricotta cheese if you like.
