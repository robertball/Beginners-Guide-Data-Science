Description: 
This is my friend Jennifer's recipe that she uses alot for any function that requires food. Everyone loves these so much that I asked for the recipe. The key to making these taste so good is to cook them so the cheese melts but the rolls do not get toasted. These are also good using Roast Beef and Havarti Cheese.
