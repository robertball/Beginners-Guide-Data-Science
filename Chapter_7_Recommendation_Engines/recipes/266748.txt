Ingredients:
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup cornmeal
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 large zucchini, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
canola cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat 2 baking sheets lightly with olive oil.
Mix flour, cornmeal, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder together in a bowl.
Lightly spray both sides of zucchini rounds with cooking spray. Dredge rounds in flour mixture, slightly pressing it into the zucchini. Arrange coated rounds in a single layer on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned on the bottom, 5 to 10 minutes. Flip and bake until browned on the second side, 5 to 10 minutes more.

Description: 
Because these turn out so well without having to dip them in any milk or eggs, they make a fantastic vegan treat! But even for the die-hard carnivores in my house, this makes an easy and delicious appetizer, quick snack, or side dish.  The breading is nice and light, and they are crispier than traditional breaded zucchini because they are baked rather than fried. They are good just as they are, but my son loves to dip his in ranch dressing!
