Ingredients:
2 pounds cranberries, fresh or frozen
1 cup applesauce, any kind
2 or 3 whole mandarins, diced, entire pieces added (seeds removed, if necessary)
1 cup cranberry juice, unsweetened
1 cup sugar, or more if necessary
2 tsp ground cinnamon
2 tsp ground ginger or 1 tsp freshly grated
Spicy:
1/8 c minced chiles, such as jalapeno,  Anaheim chile, chipotle, chile powder, smoked paprika, etc.
1/8 c minced onion, any kind
1 T minced garlic
1/8 tsp black pepper, ground
Savory & Spicy:
1/2 c Broth, any kind, and omit 1/2 c cranberry juice, totaling 1 c liquid
***1 c Broth can be used in lieu of cranberry juice, keeping liquid at 1 cup total.
1/8 c minced chiles, such as jalapeno,  Anaheim chile, chipotle, chile powder, smoked paprika, etc.
1/8 c or more minced onion, any kind
1 T or more minced garlic
1/8 tsp black pepper, ground

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, stir to combine:
Cranberries, applesauce, mandarins wedges, cranberry juice, sugar, cinnamon and ginger.
Heat at medium heat for 10-15 minutes as cranberries plump up and begin to pop and mandarin pieces begin to take on the red fruit color.  Stir, cooking over medium heat, a further 5 minutes or until all of the cranberries have popped open.
****If the cranberries have not yet popped open in the pot, the liquids in the pot will also be rather loose and runny at this stage, so when you raise the heat to medium high, they will still pop, but because the liquid is also rather fluid, that sugary fluid will splatter at the higher heat and perhaps burn you.  It is never a bad idea to be patient at medium heat to see the cranberries pop open****
Once cranberries are popped and dark red, raise heat to medium high (NOTE:  If you are not comfortable with sugary ingredients at such a high heat, continue, longer, at medium heat), and stir constantly, lid off, until contents of the pot have reduced enough liquid to bring the desired consistency.
NOTE
****  Always use oven mitts when operating a stove top heat source with ingredients that tend to splatter, such as oil, oil and water, liquids that are sugary, etc.  Their temperature will be mountains hotter than you realize!  This is never the place for shortcuts****]
Once the contents of the pot are cooked through to your preference,  allowing it to simmer 5 minutes longer on the lowest heat setting will allow the flavors to come together better.  Or, just turn off the pot with the lid on and let it sit, heat off, for an hour or 2.
Altering thickness or tartness:
Add 1/4 c at a time, orange, cranberry, apple or pear juice if needed to alter thickness and/or tartness.
Be mindful of which flavor the juice is making to your creation! Cranberry juice will add tartness, while orange juice will add sweetness, but both will also make it less thick.
Add sugar, 1/8 c at a time for sweetness ***You might not want to add sugar if you are also adding the juices of orange, apple or pear.  Add only a little juice or sugar at a time, based on the ingredients you already have on hand or have already added to the pot.
Meat or vegetable broth can be added as well, either at the very end to tame the thickness, or at the beginning while simmering the fresh or frozen cranberries.
NOTE:
Adding apples, pears or oranges and mandarins will add sweetness to the pot.  So will orange juice and other juices.  Try to use the ingredients to adjust the flavorings or the consistency, example, oranges and orange juice add sweetness, texture, and fluidity.  But that is also a lot more of orange to compete with the cranberries.  If that is the desired result, great! If you like to keep it tart, however, add cranb

Description: 
Great as a dipping sauce for turkey or chicken meatballs at Thanksgiving, Christmas or New Year. I add jalapenos at the very end to dip or glaze chicken-kabobs, or keep it sweet-tart as a condiment.  This recipe is crazy versatile.
