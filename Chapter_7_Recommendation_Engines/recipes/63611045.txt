Ingredients:
1 cup lemon juice (Fresh is best)
1/2 cup honey
1T dijon mustard
3 T chia seeds
1 T Fresh Italian Parsley
1/2 cup olive oil
10 garlic cloves
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
Peel garlic (or if you have a vitamix no need to peel and extra health benefits) and mince through garlic press, mix in all ingredients and let it sit for at least a hour or longer to allow flavors to infuse with each other.  I prefer just throwing everything into the vitamix and blending.  Great both ways
