1/2 spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
1 (8 ounce) salmon fillet
1/2 cup pesto
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
salt to taste

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.
Place spaghetti squash, cut-side up, on a baking sheet.
Bake squash in the preheated oven until tender, 30 to 40 minutes; cool slightly. Shred the squash meat using a fork and discard peel. Transfer shredded squash to a baking dish.
Place salmon in the prepared baking dish.
Bake salmon in the preheated oven until the flesh flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Cut salmon into 1/4-inch pieces.
Decrease oven temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Mix salmon, pesto, olive oil, garlic powder, and salt with the spaghetti squash. Cover dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
I needed to clean out my freezer and threw this together. I was surprised at how good it was for being so simple. It is a recipe I will keep in mind next time I have extra pesto.
