Ingredients:
1/2 cup uncooked brown rice
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/2 cup minced carrots
1/4 cup celery
6 bell peppers (any color) stems and seeds removed, cut in half lengthwise
1/2 pound ground beef
1/4 pound pancetta or lightly smoked bacon, finely diced
1 1/2 cups prepared spicy marinara sauce
1/4 cup red wine
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/3 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1/4 cup breadcrumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until tender and fluffy; set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Cook and stir carrots and celery until tender. Add ground beef and pancetta, and cook until browned and crumbled; drain off any excess liquid, and return to heat. Add marinara sauce, wine, and red pepper flakes, and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in cream, half of the Parmesan cheese, and rice. Simmer 5 minutes more, or until most liquid has absorbed.
Boil water and cook peppers for 2 min 30 seconds.  Then blanch by immediately putting into a bowl with water and ice.
Dry peppers and place in a shallow baking dish, and fill with beef mixture. Drizzle with remaining olive oil and top with remaining Parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs.
Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Serve hot.
