Ingredients:
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 drops hot pepper sauce
1/2 cup finely crushed butter-flavored crackers

1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/2 pound lean ground turkey
1 cup V-8 juice
1/4 cup chicken broth
2 garlic cloves, minced
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Crumble turkey over mixture and mix well. Shape into six meatballs. Place in a greased 9-in. pie plate. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the V8 juice, broth and garlic. Turn meatballs; spoon sauce over top. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F. Bake 20 minutes longer, basting every 5 minutes. Serve over rice.

Description: 
This is a pared-down recipe that my husband and I enjoy. It makes a satisfying dinner for two, served over hot rice or noodles. I like to accompany it with baked acorn squash. -Audrey Thibodeau, Mesa, Arizona
