Ingredients:
3 (3 pound) whole chicken (store bought rotisserie fully cooked chicken)
4 cups diced celery
2 cups chopped onion
1 cup chopped carrots
1 cup diced green pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp poultry seasoning
2 tsp parsley
1/2 tsp minced garlic
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 cups frozen corn
salt to taste
ground white pepper, to taste
1 tablespoon dried parsley

Directions:
Place vegetables into a large stock pot and cover with chicken broth. Add salt and seasonings Bring to a boil, then simmer for 1/2 hours or until vegetables are tender
When chicken is cool enough to handle, remove and discard skin and bones. Chop chicken meat and return to the stock pot.
In a food processor, combine the flour with 1 teaspoon of salt. Put the lid onto the processor and slowly pour another can of chicken broth through the opening in the lid while the machine is processing, until the dough forms a ball. You may not need to use all of the reserved broth. Remove dough from the food processor and set aside to rest for 20 minutes.  Return any unused broth to the stock pot.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into thin strips and then cut the strips  into pieces to form short thin noodles. Add noodles and the corn. Cook for another 10 minutes or until noodles are firm. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot garnished with parsley flakes.
