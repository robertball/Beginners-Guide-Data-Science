Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons zero-calorie brown sugar substitute (such as Lakanto Golden®)
1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups chicken stock
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons heavy cream, or to taste (optional)
3 tablespoons crushed walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and add garlic. Saute until onion is beginning to soften, 2 to 3 more minutes. Stir in sugar substitute, pumpkin pie spice, and salt. Pour in chicken stock and stir to combine. Whisk in pumpkin puree, cover, and simmer over medium-low heat for 10 minutes.
Blend soup carefully until smooth using an immersion blender. Stir in 1 cup heavy cream and adjust salt, if necessary. Garnish with a drizzle of heavy cream and crushed walnuts.

Description: 
This creamy fall favorite is perfect for those following a keto or low-carb diet, and the whole family will love it! I use bone broth if I have it on hand, however chicken stock works just as well. Use a keto-friendly brown sugar substitute that measures 1:1 like sugar, such as Lakanto® Golden or Swerve® Brown Sugar Substitute.
