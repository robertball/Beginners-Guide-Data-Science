Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 red onion, chopped
1 tablespoon butter
1 lemon, sliced into rounds
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated
2 teaspoons garam masala
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 cup half-and-half
1/4 cup plain yogurt
3 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon olive oil
6 ounces paneer, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 (16 ounce) can chickpeas, drained
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir red onion in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add butter, lemon, ginger, garam masala, chili powder, and cumin; stir to coat, about 1 minute.
Stir half-and-half, yogurt, and tomato paste into onion mixture and cook until well mixed and smooth, about 5 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate skillet over low heat. Pan-fry paneer in the hot oil until slightly brown, about 5 minutes per side.  Mix cooked paneer and chickpeas into the spiced cream sauce. Simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes.
