Ingredients:
(Refer to photo for amounts)
3 Roma tomatoes
4 peppers (about 1/2" to 1" around and 3-4" long) or the equivalent - whatever kind you like
1 hot Serrano pepper 2" long
2 layers of a red onion
5-6 cloves garlic with paper skins on
1/2 - 1 cup cilantro
black pepper to taste
Salt to taste

Directions:
Use a stovetop grill for best results.  If your grill has slits, use a vegetable basket.
Core, halve, and grill tomatoes on medium heat
Halve peppers (except Serrano) lengthwise
Remove seeds and white ribs
Add peppers to grill
Add whole Serrano to grill
Cut slits in red onion so that it lays flat on grill
Add onion to grill
Add garlic to grill
If grill has slits, wrap garlic in foil.  If not, put garlic under onion or pepper to steam it.  Or you can use a cast iron lid or skillet
Grill until tomatoes are mushy, peppers are soft and have nice grill marks, and onion is marked, soft, and semi-translucent.
Garlic should be soft and mushy when squeezed
Remove skins from tomatoes.  Skin should come off right away, if not, cook longer.
Remove stem top from Serrano pepper
Squeeze out garlic centers from cloves
Put tomatoes, peppers, and garlic centers into a food processor, blender, or a container for an immersion blender (my preference)
Puree until the mixture is even textured
Add salt and pepper as needed
