Ingredients:
2 tablespoons corn oil
1 pound flank steak
1 large Spanish onion, thinly sliced
4 large cloves garlic, chopped
5 Roma tomatoes, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons black pepper, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 1/2 cups water
2 cubes beef bouillon, crumbled

Directions:
Heat the corn oil in a skillet over medium heat. Gently lie the steak in the oil and cook each side until brown. Remove the steak to a plate. Add the onions, garlic, tomatoes, salt, pepper, and cumin to the skillet; cook and stir until the onions are tender. Return the steak to the skillet. Pour the water into the skillet. Stir in the crumbled bouillon. Bring the water to a boil and drop the heat to low; cover. Allow to simmer until the meat easily pulls apart with a fork, about 2 hours.
Remove the steak to a cutting board. Use two forks to shred the meat. Transfer to a serving plate.  Pour the onion and tomato mixture from the skillet over the shredded beef.

Description: 
This wonderful dish has so much flavor. It reminds me of the great flavors of Colombian cooking. Slow-cooked, simmered steak makes this dish so tender and juicy! If you desire some heat, like I do, add a jalapeno pepper. You can also substitute beer for half the water for another variation on the flavor. Serve over rice or with tortillas.
