Ingredients:
2 ripe bananas, peeled and cut into chunks
1/2 Hass avocado, pitted and cut into chunks (my avocados were small so I used a whole one)
5 large ripe strawberries, hulled and halved
1 tsp vanilla extract (optional, but I used it)
1/3 cup unsweetened coconut milk
2 tsp coconut oil

Directions:
Place all ingredients into a food processor or blender and blend until completely smooth.
Pour into a covered container and put in the freezer for 1 hour.
Stir well, then return to the freezer. Continue to stir/freeze at hourly intervals until the mixture is firm.
The ice cream should be at the ideal serving consistency after 6 or 7 hours. You can, of course, keep your ice cream in the freezer for longer than this (up to one month), but it will harden considerably after the first 24 hours or so. It will still taste great, but take it out of the freezer 30 minutes before serving to soften it up a bit!
It can also be poured into popsicle trays and served on a stick!
