Ingredients:
3/4 cup bulgur
3/4 cup boiling water
2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cups sliced onions
4 cloves garlic, minced
6 cups thickly sliced zucchini
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 eggs
1 cup grated feta cheese
1 cup cottage cheese
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon tamari
1 cup grated Cheddar cheese
2 medium tomatoes, thinly sliced
1 1/2 tablespoons sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
Place bulgur in a bowl and cover with boiling water. Cover and set aside until water is absorbed.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square casserole dish.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and garlic and cook until just translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add zucchini, oregano, basil, marjoram, and black pepper. Cook until zucchini is tender but not falling apart, about 5 minutes more.
Beat eggs lightly in a bowl. Add feta cheese and cottage cheese.
Add parsley, tomato paste, and tamari to the bowl with the bulgur and mix well.
Layer bulgur mixture, zucchini mixture, cheese mixture, Cheddar cheese, and tomato into the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
My local gourmet grocery store use to sell single servings of this, but they quit selling it. I was addicted to it, so one of the employees emailed me the recipe so I could do it myself. A great vegetarian dish or side dish.
