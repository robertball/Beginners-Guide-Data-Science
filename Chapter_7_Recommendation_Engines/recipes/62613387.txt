Description: 
An assortment of chili powders and other seasonings make this lean chili rich and flavorful.  Adjust the spices to your liking. I bought most of these at MySpiceSage.com, and was looking for a way to experiment with the different chili powders.  Garnish with sour cream or shredded cheddar cheese, if desired.
