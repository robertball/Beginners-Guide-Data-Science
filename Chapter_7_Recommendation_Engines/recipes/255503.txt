2 cups raw pumpkin seeds, rinsed and dried

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

Description: 
I whipped up this easy recipe after carving Halloween pumpkins and decided to add a little flavor to the seeds by using Chef Paul Prudhomme's® seasoning. You can use other mixes or you own choice of meat seasoning to make an equally delicious fall treat.
