Do not return to boiling point.  Pour dip in a crock pot to keep hot for your party.  Serve with white round corn tostitos chips.  This is a spicy dip for those of you that don't like it quite so hot you can modify by changing taco seasoning to regular, Cheese to mild instead of hot and hormel chili to regular instead of  hot.  This dip is always a big hit, they do everything but lick the crock pot! Enjoy!
