Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds pork tenderloin, sliced into 1/2-inch thick medallions
1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste, divided
1/4 teaspoon pepper, plus more to taste
3 teaspoons olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons chopped shallot
3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup dried tart cherries

Directions:
Season the pork medallions with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and pepper.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over a medium-high heat and cook the meat until there is just a slight blush in the center about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the meat to a plate and tent with foil.
Add the remaining teaspoon of oil and the shallots to the pan and saute until they begin to soften, about 1 minute. Add the chicken broth, balsamic vinegar, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt and the cherries and cook until the liquid is reduced by half, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Pour the sauce over the pork medallions and serve.
