Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter
1 cup chocolate chips
1 egg
1/4 cup milk
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 2 quart casserole dish with vegetable cooking spray. Melt chocolate chips in a measuring cup in the microwave, stirring every 20 seconds until smooth. Let stand for 5 minutes to cool slightly.
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut in butter until the dough is a uniform crumbly texture. Beat the egg into the melted chocolate chips, then stir the milk in. Pour the chocolate mixture into the dry ingredients, and stir until well blended.
Pour the cherry pie filling in an even layer in the bottom of the greased casserole dish. Drop spoonfuls of the chocolate batter over the cherries in a random pattern.
Bake for 40 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until top crust is not doughy when lifted. Serve warm.
