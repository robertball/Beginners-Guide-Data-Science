Ingredients:
1 package active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees)
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups all-purpose flour
Oil for deep-frying
Powdered sugar

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large mixing bowl. Add milk and next 5 ingredients. Vigorously beat in flour. Dough will be very sticky.
Work a fourth of the dough at a time. Place dough on a heavily floured surface. Use a well-floured rolling pin to roll dough to about 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into 2-inch squares. Drop beignets, a few at a time, into 370 degree oil. As beignets rise to the surface and puff, turn over to brown other side. When uniformly browned, remove from oil and drain on paper towels.
Dust with powdered sugar and serve warm.
