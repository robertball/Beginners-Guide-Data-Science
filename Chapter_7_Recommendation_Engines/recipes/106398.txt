Ingredients:
1 cup slivered almonds
1 1/4 cups SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
3 large eggs
2 tablespoons milk
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 egg white, lightly beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray a cookie sheet with vegetable cooking spray; set aside.
Bake almonds in a shallow pan for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring once, or until lightly toasted. Set aside.
Beat SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, 3 eggs, and milk at medium speed of an electric mixer for 3 minutes or until mixture is smooth and pale yellow in color. Beat in extract.
Combine flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; add to SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener mixture and beat on low speed until a stiff dough forms. Stir in almonds. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead lightly 4 or 5 times. Divide dough in half; shape each portion into an 8-inch log. Place logs on prepared cookie sheet and flatten to 3/4-inch thickness; brush with beaten egg white.
Bake for 20 minutes or until puffed and golden brown; reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Remove from baking sheet to a wire rack; cool 10 minutes. Cut each log diagonally into 1/2-inch thick slices with a serrated knife, using a gentle sawing motion. Place slices on cookie sheets. Bake 10 minutes; turn cookies over, and bake 10 additional minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool.
