Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
16 ounces Italian pork or chicken sausage links, cut into small rounds
2 cups finely chopped kale leaves
3/4 cup milk
1/4 cup flour
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
3/4 cup shredded Gruyere cheese
Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-inch square baking dish with Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil. Grease the foil and set aside.
Heat the olive oil in a large pan over high heat. Add the sweet potatoes and Italian sausage. Stir to coat. Cook for a few minutes until starting to brown and then move everything around. Repeat until the sweet potatoes and sausage both have golden brown exteriors.
In a bowl, combine the sweet potato and sausage mixture with the kale. Transfer to the lined baking dish.
Bring a 1/2 cup milk to a low boil and then lower the heat to simmer. Whisk in the flour and remaining 1/4 cup milk to form a thick paste. Add the broth, whisking to keep the sauce smooth. Add 1/4 cup Gruyere and stir until melted.
Pour the sauce over the sweet potatoes, kale and sausage in the baking dish. Top with remaining 1/2 cup cheese and bake for 10 minutes or until the sauce is bubbly and the cheese is melted.
