Description: 
Feta makes everything betta! This variation on the classic guacamole recipe can turn this dip into a meal. Whenever I serve this appetizer, my guests rarely make it hungry to the main course. And if, by chance, you plan to have leftovers, a no-fail tip when slicing or mashing avocados is to add a squirt of lemon to keep the fruit from turning brown in your fridge.
