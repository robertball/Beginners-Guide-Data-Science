Ingredients:
1 1/2 c A/P flour
1/2 c stone-ground cornmeal
1 T baking powder
1/2 t baking soda
1/2 t salt
1/4 t ground pepper
1/2 c shredded extra sharp Cheddar cheese
2 T cold butter, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
3/4 c sour cream
1/4 c fresh chives, finely chopped
1 T honey, optional
3-5 T low fat milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.
Combine flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, salt, pepper in food processor. Pulse a few times to mix.
Add cheese and butter. Pulse again until the mixture looks pebbly with small oat-sized lumps.
Transfer mixture to a large bowl.
Add sour cream, chives and honey (if using).  Stir with a rubber spatula until almost combined.
Add 3 T milk, stirring just until dough comes together. Add more milk as needed until the dough holds together in a shaggy mass. Don't overmix.
On a lightly floured surface lightly pat the dough into a rectangle about 9X5" and just over 1/2" thick.
Using a large chef's knife divide the dough evenly into 12 biscuits.
Place on ungreased baking sheet.
Bake biscuits until lightly browned on top, 14-16 mins.
