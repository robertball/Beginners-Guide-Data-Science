Description: 
If a crepe and a pancake had a baby, it'd be the Dutch baby, boasting crisp, chewy edges surrounding a custardy middle. Here we dress it up for the holidays by baking a homemade cranberry sauce into the batter and mixing Chinese five-spice into the butter that goes on top. And that, my friends, is how you do brunch in a time crunch!
