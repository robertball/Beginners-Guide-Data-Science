Ingredients:
1 medium or large sweet potato
Salt
Pepper

Directions:
Peel a medium to large sweet potato
cut off the ends so there are less thin pieces(they burn easily)
Cut the potato in half and then into strips(I like mine cut like steak fries)
Careful they are tough and can be tricky to cut
place in bowl
drizzle with olive oil
add salt & pepper
stir to cover
place in a thin line on cooking sheet at least 1/2 inch apart
Bake at 400
do not turn or disturb while cooking
cook 20-25 minutes depending on how thin you cut them.
