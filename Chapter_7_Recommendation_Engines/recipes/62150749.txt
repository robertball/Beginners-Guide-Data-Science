Ingredients:
1 box puff pastry thawed
2 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 8 oz jar roasted red peppers
1 package rondele or alouette herb cheese spread
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Boil 3 cups water
Add chicken breasts and braise 1/2 hr or until cooked through
Dispose of water
Shred chicken with 2 forks
Add balsamic vinegar and herb cheese spread to chicken and stir until combined
Seperate each of 2 sheets of puff pastry into 4 rectangles for a total of 8 rectangles
Divide chicken mixture into 8 equal portions
Place a portion of chicken mixture on each puff pastry rectangle
Place 1/8 jar of roasted red peppers on each rectangle
Bring up sides of rectangle to completely cover chicken mixture - it is stretchy and it is okay to pull
Seal the overlapping edges of pastry
Place sealed side down on parchment or silpat lined baking sheet
Bake according to puff pastry package directions (chicken is already cooked so just long enough for pastry to be golden brown)
Eat warm or refrigerate and eat cold
Can also be reheated in toaster oven or oven
