Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds skinless salmon, cut into 4 fillets
2 tablespoons ghee, melted
1 tablespoon lemon juice
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 head Romaine lettuce (or other leaf lettuce)
1 small red onion, sliced
1 small cucumber, sliced
1 cup halved cherry tomatoes
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon dried dill
Pinch of onion powder
Pinch of sea salt
1 clove garlic, pressed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Rinse salmon and pat dry. In a small bowl, combine ghee and lemon juice then brush evenly over salmon; season with salt and pepper. Bake for 6 to 10 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. In a large bowl, toss together lettuce, onion, cucumber and cherry tomatoes. In a small bowl, whisk together remaining ingredients (olive oil through garlic). Arrange salad on dinner plates and top with a salmon fillet; drizzle with vinaigrette.
