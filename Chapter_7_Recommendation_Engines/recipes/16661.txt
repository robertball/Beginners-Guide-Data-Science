Ingredients:
1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 cup fresh spinach, cleaned and stemmed
4 tablespoons water
Â¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
1  onion, chopped
2 tablespoons butter
5  eggs
1 cup cottage cheese
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and pepper to taste
2  tomatoes, thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a quiche dish with non-stick cooking spray.
Line the quiche dish with puff pastry, press the pastry firmly in place and trim away any excess pastry. Blind bake for 10 minutes.
In a large skillet place spinach and 4 tablespoons water. Heat the mixture over medium and cover the skillet. Cook until the spinach is done, approximately 2 minutes then drain well. Add nutmeg to the spinach and puree the mixture.
In a large skillet, saute the onion with butter or margarine to taste. Saute until the onions are soft and transparent.
In a medium-size mixing bowl, beat eggs. Stir in the cottage cheese, spinach, and 1/2 cup of cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange onions along the bottom of the pastry-lined quiche dish. Arrange the tomatoes over the onions. Pour the egg-mixture over the onions and tomatoes, and top entire concoction with the remaining cheese.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the quiche has set in the middle. Serve hot or cold, your choice!
