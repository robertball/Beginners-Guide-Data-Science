Ingredients:
2 cups cooked garbanzo beans
1 cup cooked red lentils
4 cloves garlic, roasted
1/4 cup lemon juice

1 tsp ground chipotle chile powder
1/4 cup water (or as needed to obtain a smooth consistency)

Directions:
To make 2 cups of COOKED Garbanzo beans: Re-hydrate 1 cup of dried garbanzo beans overnight.  Drain and rinse beans and place in a large pot, cover by one inch with cold water, bring to a boil and simmer on med-low for about an hour until beans are cooked through, stirring occasionally.  Drain and rinse beans. To make 1 cup COOKED Red Lentils: Rinse dried lentils in a strainer, place in a small pot and cover with water, bring to a boil, then simmer for 10-15 minutes until done.  Drain and rinse.
Place all ingredients (except water) in a food processor and pulse a few times to combine, scrape down sides and puree on lowest power of food processor adding water as necessary to obtain the desired consistency.
Chill several hours to blend flavours.

Description: 
I had some leftover roasted garlic and red lentils to use up so I decided to make a hummus out of them.  After the initial tasting, it was on the bland side, so I added some ground chipotle chile powder for a smoky zing ~ it is exactly what was needed! Also, with no oil, it is much lower in calories than traditional hummus.
