Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package frozen cauliflower
1 (8 ounce) package whipped cream cheese
1/2 cup heavy cream
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the cauliflower into a pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until soft, about 10 minutes. Drain and place cauliflower into a large bowl.
Add cream cheese, heavy cream, salt, and pepper to the cauliflower; mash using a potato masher. Pour contents into a glass 8-inch square casserole. Top with Cheddar cheese and cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is slightly browned and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
