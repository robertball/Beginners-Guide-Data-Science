2 lb. beef (soup-bone included),1/2 lb baby lamb (not mutton), 1 medium chicken, 2 c. diced red potatoes, 1 small hot red pepper, 3 C. corn, 2 t. salt, 1/2 t pepper, 1 "toe" of garlic, 2 C. diced yellow onions, 2 C. butterbeans, 3 diced carrots, 1/2 C cabbage, 1 diced green pepper (seeds removed), 4 quarts of water (or little more) 12 tomatoes.(optional 1 C. okra)

Directions:
Put beef, baby lamb, and dis-membered chicken in big cooking pot with water, salt, pepper and red pepper. Cover, and let come to very hard boil. Reduce heat and simmer about 2 hrs. with the lid on.Add potatoes, onions butterbeans, carrots and green pepper. Add corn last about 2 hrs. or until it seems really thick. Watch carefully so it doesn't stick and may have to add a little more water to keep from sticking.Add cabbage and tomatoes and simmer for another 1 1/2 to 2 hours until everything is done and well blended. Old lady insisted this needed to cook on simmer for at least 8/10 hrs, but would probably be done in less time than that.
