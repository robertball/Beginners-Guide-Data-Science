Ingredients:
18 chicken wings
6 tbsp butter
1/4 cup hot red pepper sauce
Vegetable oil for frying
Bleu cheese or ranch dressing for dipping
Paper towels

Directions:
Cut the chicken wings into three sections and discard the wing tips.
Melt the butter in a small sauce pan. Add the hot sauce and remove from heat. Set aside.
Heat one inch of oil in a large frying pan or deep fat fryer to 360 degrees. Fry the wings in batches, without crowding them for 10-15 minutes, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Brush the wings with a spicy butter mixture and serve warm with dressing for dipping.
