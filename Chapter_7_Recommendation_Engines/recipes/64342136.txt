Ingredients:
1.5 cups gluten free all purpose flour
1 tsp gelatin powder
1 egg, beaten
3-4 tablespoon cold water, divided

Directions:
Sift flour and gelatin together in a medium sized bowl. Add gelatin powder and mix with a wire whisk until well-combined. Make a well in the center. Place egg and 1 Tbsp cold water in well. Mix with a wooden spoon until a smooth dough has formed. Use more water as necessary*. Knead until a solid, uniform dough has formed. Do not over knead. Cover and chill in the refrigerator 30 minutes.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a square approximately 12x12" square. Cut into 8 equal squares. Roll each square into a very thin 6x6 inch square. Do not over work the dough, it will dry out and crack. Use immediately.
