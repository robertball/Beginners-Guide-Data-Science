Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
For the apples: In a large bowl, combine the apples with the brown sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, orange juice, diced butter and cinnamon and reserve.
For the crisp: In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, oats, cinnamon and salt. Add the butter and, using your hands, rub the mixture until it resembles crumbs. Cover and refrigerate for about 20 minutes.
Pour the apple mixture into an 8-by-8-inch baking pan. Sprinkle on the caramel squares and salt. Place the crisp mixture on top of the apples, scattering evenly without pressing it down. Bake until crispy and golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool.
Serve warm with vanilla ice cream if desired
