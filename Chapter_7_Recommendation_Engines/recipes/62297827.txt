Description: 
I know this recipe is stupidly simple (and I know the term should really be *omnivore*...poetic license, people...), but it's one of my family's all time favorites and I've been surprised to learn most don't cook pot roast this way.  Despite it's simplicity, give it a shot; you'll be pleasantly surprised!
