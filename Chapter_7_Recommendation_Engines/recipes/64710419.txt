6 radishes
1 large red onion, cut into 12 equal pieces
1 red bell pepper, cut into 12 equal pieces
1 eggplant, cut into 12 cubes
Juice of one lemon

2 tsp ground black pepper
6 10-inch bamboo skewers
6 tbsp tahini
1 tsp lemon juice
1 lemon, cut into 6 wedges

Directions:
In a large bowl, add the halloumi cubes, whole cherry tomatoes, whole radishes and vegetable pieces.
Drizzle the lemon juice and olive oil over the cheese and veggies. Sprinkle the fresh ground black pepper and ras el hanout over the mix. Toss to coat. Allow to marinate for 15 minutes.
Preheat a grill.
On each skewer, slide1 piece of eggplant, 1 piece of bell pepper, 1 piece of onion, 1 piece of cheese, 1 tomato, 1 radish, 1 piece of cheese, 1 piece of onion, 1 piece of bell pepper, and finally, 1 piece of eggplant. Do the same with the other five skewers. Reserve the liquid.
Place the skewers on the grill. Brush them with the reserved liquid and turn the skewers to cook them until evenly cooked on each side.
Meanwhile, mix together six tablespoons of tahini and teaspoon of lemon juice. When the skewers are ready, put them on plates. Drizzle equal amounts of tahini sauce over each skewer. Top with fresh coriander and dukkah before serving. Serve with lemon wedges.
