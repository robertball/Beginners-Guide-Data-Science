Description: 
When it comes to parties and celebrations, I always tend towards Mexican cuisine. As my dad likes to say, 'Mexican food is fun.' He says that because he knows it is not always the healthiest and is often greasy, something you would eat with a drink at a bar or a party. There is time for pleasure food, and then there's the other time to eat healthy.
