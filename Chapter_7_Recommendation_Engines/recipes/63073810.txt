Ingredients:
6 Ears Sweet Corn, or 2 cups frozen corn, thawed
4 Cups Chicken Broth
4 Tablespoons unsalted Butter
1 Shallot, finely chopped
2 Cloves Garlic, minced
1 Cup Arborio Rice
1/2 Teaspoon Fresh Thyme Leaves
1/4 Cup Grated Parmesan
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
If using fresh corn, remove husk from corn & roast on grill until lightly brown. When cool, remove kernels from cob. Should approximate 2 cups.
In a food processor or blender, puree 1 cup of the corn until smooth.
In a saucepan, heat the chicken broth.
In a large skillet, melt the butter. Add the shallot and garlic and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the rice and toast lightly, stirring, 3 mintues. Stir in 1 cup of the chicken broth and the pureed corn. Cook stirring, until the rice has absorbed the liquid, 5 to 7 minutes. Continue cooking with the remaining broth, adding 1 cup at a time.
After the last cup of broth has been absorbed, let the risotto cook 3 minutes, stirring. Add the remaining cup of corn and thyme, cook 2 minutes more. Stir in the Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste.
