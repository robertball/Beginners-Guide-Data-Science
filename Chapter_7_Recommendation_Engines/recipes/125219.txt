Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked long grain rice
1 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup butter or margarine
4 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme

Directions:
In a skillet, saute rice, celery and onion in butter until the rice is lightly browned and the vegetables are tender. Spoon into a greased 2-qt. casserole. Combine all remaining ingredients; pour over rice mixture. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F for 50 minutes or until the rice is done.

Description: 
The zesty flavor of onion is great with the crunch of celery in this light dish. It's a tasty side dish for a holiday meal. I sometimes add chopped shrimp, chicken or beef to make it into a one-dish meal.
