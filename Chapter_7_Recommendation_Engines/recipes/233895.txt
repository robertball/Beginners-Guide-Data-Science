Ingredients:
1 whole wheat tortilla
1 tablespoon peanut butter
1 tablespoon cream cheese
1/2 kiwi, peeled and thinly sliced

Directions:
Cut rounded edges from tortilla to form a square. Spread peanut butter on one half of the tortilla; spread cream cheese on remaining half.
Place kiwi slices in a single layer over cream cheese. Starting with the cream cheese end, gently roll up the tortilla to form a log shape. Serve as a wrap or sliced into thick rounds.
