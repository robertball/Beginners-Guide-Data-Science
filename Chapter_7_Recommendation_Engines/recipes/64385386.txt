1 1/2 pounds Le Gruyère cheese, shredded
1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 2/3 cups dry white wine
1 loaf crusty bread, cut or torn into 1-inch pieces
24 bite-size new potatoes, boiled until tender
2 apples, cored and cut into 1" pieces

Directions:
Toss cheese and cornstarch together and set aside. Bring wine to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in cheese and cornstarch mixture. Lower heat to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly in a figure-8 or zigzag motion, until cheese is melted and the mixture thickens slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.
