Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
Ground black pepper
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup water
2 bay leaves

Directions:
Heat oil and garlic in a large skillet over low heat. Place chicken in a medium bowl; season with pepper, vinegar and soy; toss to coat.
Increase heat under skillet to medium and cook garlic cloves until they turn golden brown. Remove garlic and add marinated chicken to the hot oil; cook, until well browned on both sides, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add reserved marinade, water and bay leaves. Cover pan, reduce heat and simmer until chicken is fully cooked, about 8 minutes. Remove lid and continue to simmer about 2 minutes longer.
Remove chicken to serving dish, top with sauce and serve.
