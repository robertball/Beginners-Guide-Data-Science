Ingredients:
3/4 cup water
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons sriracha sauce
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon salt
1 (14 ounce) package classic coleslaw mix (such as DoleÂ®)
1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced
1 (12 ounce) bag tortilla chips
3 cups cooked pulled pork
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Combine water, vinegar, sriracha, sugar, oregano, and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Turn off heat, stir, and let cool for 10 minutes.
Combine coleslaw and onion in a large bowl. Pour sriracha mixture on top, stir, and set aside while you prepare nachos.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler on low setting, if available.
Spread tortilla chips on a baking sheet and scatter pulled pork on top. Top with shredded Cheddar cheese.
Broil nachos in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 6 minutes. Top with sriracha slaw.
