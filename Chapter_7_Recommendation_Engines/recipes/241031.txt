Ingredients:
1 ½ pounds skirt steak, trimmed and cut into 2 1/2-inch wide pieces
1 teaspoon adobo seasoning, or to taste
1 ½ tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Season skirt steak pieces all over with adobo seasoning.
Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook steak in hot oil and butter, turning often, until steak begins to firm, and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 6 to 8 minutes.

Description: 
This is the most requested main dish in my house. Everyone loves it and that is a rare thing indeed! These steaks are almost too simple to believe and they turn out great every single time. So tender and flavorful - you just can't mess them up! The adobo seasoning is quite salty, so keep that in mind as you season the steaks.
