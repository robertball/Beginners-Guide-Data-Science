Ingredients:
2 cans tuna in water, drained
1 tub hummus
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp parmesean cheese
2 Tbsp relish
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 tsp curry powder (optional)
chopped parsley (optional)

Directions:
Mix tuna and hummus in small amounts at a time, until you get the consistency you like.  For a chunkier, drier salad, add more tuna, and make sure it's completely drained.  For a wetter salad, add more hummus.
Add relish, cheese, and other seasonings and herbs: garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  Some additional recommendations are curry powder, dill, parsley, chives, worcestershire sauce, or mustard.

Description: 
A twist on a super quick, easy tuna salad without mayo.  It's a good base recipe if you don't like mayo but love tuna salad!  You can adjust the amounts of the ingredients to your preference for taste and consistency.  This is a recipe w/ regular hummus, but you can even try flavored/seasoned hummus to make prep easier + faster.
