Ingredients:
8 bone-in pork chops
seasoned salt to taste
3 onions, sliced
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Season the pork chops with seasoned salt and place in a glass baking dish. Arrange onion slices on top of pork chops, then pour the water into the pan. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, then reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about another 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a homemade recipe from my dad.  Whenever I make these for someone, they fall in love with it and always request I make more.  It fills your home with a wonderful smell and is the best way to have cheap chops go so tender they fall right off the bone. Serve with hot sauce and mashed potatoes.
