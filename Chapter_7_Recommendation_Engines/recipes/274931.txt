Description: 
This pumpkin chili recipe is super easy; throw ingredients in the slow cooker and relax with my company. I usually serve it with bowls of sour cream, diced green onion, crackers, and shredded Cheddar cheese for people to add if desired. I put it together one day when friends were coming for lunch and I wanted to use the slow cooker instead of having to fuss in the kitchen.
