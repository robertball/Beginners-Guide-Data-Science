Ingredients:
3/4 pound pork sausage links, sliced
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
1 (16 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes, drained
2 tablespoons dried basil
2 tablespoons dried parsley
crushed red pepper to taste
salt to taste
2 teaspoons crushed garlic
1 (4.5 ounce) can mushrooms, drained
1 (28 ounce) jar pasta sauce with mushrooms
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and return to pan.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
To the sausage add the tomatoes, basil, parsley, crushed red pepper, salt and garlic.  Stir in mushrooms and pasta sauce.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low.  Stir in cooked pasta and top with Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This is a quick, but elegant dish that does well for informal get-togethers as well as formal dinner parties.  The spiciness of the sauce can easily be adjusted as well, as the flavor is wonderful either mild or hot.
