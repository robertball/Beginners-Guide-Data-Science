Ingredients:
6 large potatoes
1 large onion
1 cup sliced mushrooms
2 cans Chicken broth (or bullion)
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons olive oil
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
8 ounces Swiss cheese, grated

Directions:
The object is to make a large potato cake that is light brown and crisp on the outside with soft distinct potato strips on the inside (Think "big hashbrown").
Boil the potatoes in the chicken broth plus enough water to cover the potatoes.  Cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, and refrigerate overnight.
Grate the potatoes without peeling. Discard the skin and lumps that didn't pass through the grater.
In a large skillet, saute the onions and mushrooms in the mixture of butter and olive oil until soft but not browned.
Add the potatoes to the onions and mushrooms. Add the seasonings and mix carefully so as to not mash the potatoes. Form the mixture into one large potato cake.
Brown the bottom of the potato cake lightly. Turn it over and brown the other side. A plate placed upside down on the potatoes can help with the turning.
Sprinkle the grated cheese on top of the Potato cake and bake at 400 degrees F. until the cheese starts to brown. If your skillet is not oven proof you can slide the potato cake into a shallow baking dish.
Let the dish cool for 10 minutes before serving.
