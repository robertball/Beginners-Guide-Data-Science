Easy Fruit Smoothies Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1/2 to 1/3 cup plain or vanilla non fat yogurt
1/4 to 1/2 cup each of the following (fresh, canned, or frozen):
-peaches
-pineapple
-mandarin oranges
-strawberries
-bananas
-or any other fruits you can get your hands on... "seedless" fruits are best, as pits and seeds can damage your blender.  So be sure to first remove any seeds and pits from the fruits you use.
2 tablespoons sugar, optional
4 or 5 ice cubes(add one at a time)
1/4 to 1/2 cup skim milk or favorite fruit juice (pineapple, orange, etc)

Directions:
1.  In your electric blender, combine yogurt, fruit of choice, sugar for a little extra sweetness, ice, and milk or juice.
2.  Blend until smooth
3.  For a pretty serving suggestion, I use glass goblets or milkshake glasses, and garnish with a sprig of mint and a slice or fruit on top....half a strawberry or an orange slice looks nic and is easy too.
** You can play with your smooties and develop a flavor that suits your tastes best.  My favorite combination is Peach/Pineapple/Banana, but my husband's smoothie of choice is Strawberry/Banana.
**I don't usually measure anything, I just dump it all in and blend.  Adjust the ammount of yogurt and milk or juice for the consistancy you want.  And instead of ice, for an extra frothy smootie, try freezing your fruit first.  Be careful to add your frozen fruit to the blender slowly so as not to burn up the motor.
