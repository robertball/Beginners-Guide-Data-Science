Ingredients:
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1/4 cup water
1 pound sea scallops
3 tablespoons sesame seeds
3 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 red bell pepper, cut into strips
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into strips
1 cup fresh snow peas, trimmed

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, vinegar, ginger and 1/4 cup water in a small bowl.
Place scallops in a medium bowl with half of the soy sauce mixture; let stand 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Toast sesame seeds 1 minute. Transfer to a plate.
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in same skillet. Add vegetables; cook 2 minutes. Stir in remaining soy sauce mixture and cook 3 minutes, until vegetables are tender. Transfer to a plate; cover and keep warm.
Wipe out skillet. Heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil over high heat. Add scallops; cook 5 minutes or until golden, turning halfway through. (Scallops should feel firm to the touch.) Divide vegetables between 4 plates; top with scallops and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
