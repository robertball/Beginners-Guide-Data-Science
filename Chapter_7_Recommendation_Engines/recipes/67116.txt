Ingredients:
1 pound sliced bacon
2 (12 fluid ounce) cans evaporated milk
2 (20 ounce) cans white hominy, drained

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain grease from the skillet.  Crumble the bacon, and return it to the skillet. Reduce heat to medium, and add hominy and evaporated milk, and cook, stirring often. Let it bubble, but don't let the milk scorch. Cook until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
Hominy and bacon in a simmered milk gravy. A great accompaniment to eggs. An old old breakfast side dish served in logging camps and homes in the Pacific Northwest. My Grandmother, who was born in the late 1800s, told me her mother ate this as a child.
