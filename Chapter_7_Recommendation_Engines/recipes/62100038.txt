Ingredients:
1 lb. salmon fillet
1 bunch fresh dill
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 cup butter, melted
Juice of one lemon
1/4 cup white wine
1/2 cup almonds, toasted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.
Mix butter with lemon juice, white wine and garlic in a small bowl.
Pour a little bit of the butter mixture in the bottom of a 8x8 sq. pan and spread so the bottom is evenly coated.
Trim stems off dill, and place a thin layer in the bottom of the pan.
Place salmon on top of dill, skin size down.
Layer the rest of the dill on top of fish, and pour remaining butter mixture on top.
Cover tightly with foil.
Bake until fish flakes with a fork, between 25-35 minutes, depending on thickness.
When serving, sprinkle generously with toasted almonds.

Description: 
I had a craving for fresh fish and dill, so played around and came up with this.  It's been rated one of my greatest hits!  Great with rice or potatoes, and steamed green beans.
