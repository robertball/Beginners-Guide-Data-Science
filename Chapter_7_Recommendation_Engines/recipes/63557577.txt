Ingredients:
1 Cup Butter (softened)
2 Cups Sugar
2 Eggs
1 Cup Sour Cream
1 tsp Vanilla
1/4 tsp Lemon Extract
2 tsp Baking Powder
1/2 tsp Baking Soda
1/2 tsp Salt
4 1/2 Cups All Purpose Flour

Directions:
Mix together the butter, sugar, eggs, sour cream, vanilla, lemon, baking powder, baking soda and salt, until well blended. Add the flour one cup at a time to form dough. The dough will be sticky to the touch. Cool dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Divide dough into quarters and roll on clean, floured surface to approximately 1/4" thick. Cut out cookies with your favorite shape and place on ungreased cookie sheet. Place cookie sheet on middle rack and bake for 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool for approximately 5 minutes before removing from cookie sheet.  Allow to cool completely before frosting.

Description: 
This is my mom's sugar cookie recipe.  She made these as a special treat for us as kids, and now my wife makes them as a special treat for me, and I love that.

Frosted or unfrosted, these are some of my all time favorite cookies. They taste great, are always soft, never dry and floury. I can eat a dozen myself in a sitting.
