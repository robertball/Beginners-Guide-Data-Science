Ingredients:
1 (18 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed
8 cups prepared stuffing
1/2 cup softened butter
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Set oven rack to the lowest position so the turkey will fit.
Rinse the turkey and pat dry. Place in a large roasting pan and loosely fill the cavity with stuffing. Rub butter all over the outside, and season with salt and pepper. Use a large sheet of aluminum foil to make a tent over the bird.
Place in the preheated oven, and here's where it gets interesting.  Baste every 5 to 10 minutes - everywhere! Whenever you're not doing something, baste! If you are too busy to baste, take turns with someone else. After 2 hours, remove the foil tent. Keep roasting until the internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (82 degrees C) when taken in the thickest part of the thigh. It should take about 4 hours total.

Description: 
I made this at a Christmas party last year. It was the first time I'd ever done a turkey by myself, and my mother told me I was basting too much. I showed her; it was the most tender turkey any of the guests had ever had. Better than the woodchips she fed us every Christmas Day!
