Ingredients:
Dough:
350g flour
10g instant dry yeast
50g sugar
pinch salt
50g butter / margarine
1 egg
100ml lukewarm milk
50ml lukewarm water
To prepare buns:
50g butter
50g sugar
150g mixed dried fruit (raisins and sultanas)
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
2 tablespoons syrup
Icing:
Icing sugar
water

Directions:
1. Mix flour, sugar, salt and yeast. Lightly rub in the butter.
2. Beat egg and add to the dry ingredients with the milk, while mixing. Add water as necessary to form a smooth dough.
3. Knead the dough well for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover the bowl with greased plastic and leave in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes.
4. Knock down dough and roll out into a 30x25xm rectangle. Spread the butter onto the dough and sprinkle over the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and dried fruit.Roll up loosely like a swiss roll. Cut into 9 equal slices and arrange slices onto a greased 23cm square tin. Cover with greased plastic and leave to rise for 30 minutes.
5. Bake for 20 minutes until golden. Brush with syrup while still hot. (For a real treat, make a thin icing by combining icing sugar with a little water, and drizzle over buns). When cool, tear into individual buns to serve.
