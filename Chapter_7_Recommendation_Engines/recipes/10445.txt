Ingredients:
3/4 cup peanut butter
2 pounds vanilla flavored confectioners' coating
80 buttery round crackers
2 1/4 ounces colored candy sprinkles

Directions:
Spread approximately 1 teaspoon peanut butter on each of half of the crackers.  Top with remaining crackers to make peanut butter "sandwiches".
Melt chocolate-flavored almond bark OR vanilla candy coating in the top of a double boiler over hot, not boiling, water.  Reduce heat and keep chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water.
Dip each cracker "sandwich"  in chocolate, allowing excess to drain back into pot.
Place coated crackers on wax paper to cool.  Sprinkle with multi-colored sprinkles or other holiday decoration.  Allow coating to completely set, placing in refrigerator for 15 minutes, if necessary.  Store between layers of wax paper in cool, dry place, or refrigerate.  These also freeze well.
