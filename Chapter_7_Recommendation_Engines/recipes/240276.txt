Ingredients:
1 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup Mott's® Natural Applesauce
1 (3 ounce) package pineapple-flavored gelatin mix (such as Jell-O®)
1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin
3 teaspoons freshly squeezed lime juice
3/4 teaspoon coconut extract
1/2 cup granulated sugar for coating

Directions:
Spray an 8x8-inch baking dish with non-fat cooking spray. Place dish in refrigerator.
Combine granulated sugar, applesauce, pineapple-flavored gelatin, unflavored gelatin, lime juice, and coconut extract in saucepan.
Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Boil for about 1 minute. Remove saucepan from heat, and cool at room temperature for about 10 minutes. (Do not pour boiling hot liquid into a chilled glass dish.)
Remove baking dish from refrigerator, and pour warm mixture into the cooled baking dish. Refrigerate until firm,  1 to 2 hours.
When firm, remove from refrigerator, lift one side with a spatula, and turn out onto a cutting board or parchment paper sprinkled with granulated sugar.
Using a sharp knife, cut gelatin into squares or use a small cookie cutter for decorative shapes. Coat the jellies on all sides with sugar. Place on a rack, and allow to dry overnight.
Store in an airtight container.
