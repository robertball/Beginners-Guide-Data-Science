Ingredients:
3 1/2 pounds russet potatoes
1 quart heavy cream
6 cloves garlic, crushed
2 tablespoons kosher salt
6 ounces grated Parmesan

Directions:
Peel and dice potatoes, making sure all are relatively the same size. Place in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and then reduce heat to maintain a rolling boil. Cook until potatoes fall apart when poked with a fork.
Heat the heavy cream and the garlic in a medium saucepan over medium heat until cream is simmering. Remove from heat and set aside.
Remove the potatoes from the heat and drain off the water. Mash and add the garlic-cream mixture, salt, and Parmesan; stir to combine. Serve immediately.
