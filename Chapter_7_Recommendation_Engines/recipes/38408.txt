2 slices bacon
8 small zucchini, cut into 1/2 inch slices
1/2 red onion, thinly sliced

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown.  Crumble, and return to pan.  Add zucchini, onion, and salt to the bacon; cook, stirring frequently, until zucchini is tender-crisp. Add tomato wedges, basil, and ground black pepper; heat, stirring gently, until tomatoes are warm.
Using a slotted spoon, transfer vegetable mixture to a serving bowl. Top with crumbled blue cheese.

Description: 
This is a quick and easy vegetable dish my mother made frequently, using vegetables fresh from our garden.  Almost any type of cheese can be substituted if your family doesn't care for blue cheese.
