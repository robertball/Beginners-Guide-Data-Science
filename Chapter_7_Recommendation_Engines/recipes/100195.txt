Ingredients:
3/4 cup milk
2 teaspoons salt
3/4 cup bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon ground dried thyme
4 haddock fillets
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
In a small bowl, combine the milk and salt.  In a separate bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and thyme.  Dip the haddock fillets in the milk, then press into the crumb mixture to coat. Place haddock fillets in a glass baking dish, and drizzle with melted butter.
Bake on the top rack of the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily, about 15 minutes.
