Ingredients:
6 chicken fillets (about 3 oz each) pounded out flat
6 slices proscuitto
10 oz box frozen chopped spinach (thaw out and squeeze the water out)
1/3 C. shredded parmesan cheese
1 tbsp. oiive oil
1//2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. pepper
16 oz. can reduced sodium/fat free chicken broth
3 tbsp. lemon juice

Directions:
1. Place the proscuitto slices over the chicken.
2. In a bowl, mix spinach, olive oil, salt and pepper. Then put the spinach mixture on top of the proscuitto.  Sprinkle the parmesan cheese over the spinach.
3.  Roll (as if making a jelly roll) starting with the smalles end.  Put a toothpick (or two) in to hold them together.
4.  In a skillet drizzle the olive oil in a pan on medium high heat.
Place the chicken rolls in the skillet for about 2 minutes on each side, just long enough to brown. Then add the chicken broth and lemon juice and return to a boil.
5.  Reduce to medium heat and cover until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
6. Remove the chicken rolls and place on a plate.  Return the remaining mixture to high heat and boil until reduced to about 2/3 c.  Salt and pepper to taste and drizzle over the chicken rolls.

I like this recipe, but don't make it a lot because my husband isn't crazy about the spinach.
