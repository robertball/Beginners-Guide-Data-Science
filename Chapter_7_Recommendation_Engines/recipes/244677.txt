Ingredients:
1 cup sour cream (such as Breakstone's®)
2 tablespoons soy sauce (such as Kikkoman®)

Directions:
Mix sour cream and soy sauce together in a bowl until evenly combined.

Description: 
This creamy dip is great for all things potato (fries and chips especially) and also makes a great steak dip. It's even good spread on a roast beef sandwich!  Everyone loves it, and no one can guess what's in it. The combination of the two ingredients is surprisingly different than either alone. I strongly encourage using Kikkoman® soy sauce, as other brands I have tried tasted very different and not nearly as good.
