Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless, chicken breasts (I prefer Perdue)
1 Tbs & 1 Tsp EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil)
1 Tbs & 1 Tsp butter (I prefer Brummel & Brown)
2/3 cups Panko crumbs
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1/4 cup & 1 Tbs fresh parmesan, grated
1/8 Tsp ground black pepper
3/4 Tsp dried basil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Grease cooling rack.
In bowl, blend butter, garlic, and EVOO. In separate bowl mix parmesan, panko crumbs, basil, and pepper.
Coat each breast in oil, butter, and garlic mix, then panko mix. Arrange breasts on cooling rack and top with remaining panko mix.
Bake 30 minutes or until juices run clear.
