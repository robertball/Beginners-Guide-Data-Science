Description: 
This was a basic cookie recipe I converted into a secret recipe using my wildest imagination. It's since become a family favorite, as well as one friends enjoy. If you are brave enough to try these (don't worry, you won't regret it!), play the 'guess what's in these cookies?' game. Your family will surely be surprised at this great mixture of flavors! Praline paste may be substituted for chestnut paste.
