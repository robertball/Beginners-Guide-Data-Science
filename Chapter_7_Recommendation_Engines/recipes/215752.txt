Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 portobello mushroom cap, sliced
1/4 cup chopped red onion
4 egg whites
1 teaspoon water
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup shredded low-fat mozzarella cheese
1 teaspoon prepared pesto

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the portobello mushroom and red onion in the olive oil until the mushroom has softened, 3 to 5 minutes.
Whisk the egg whites and water together in a small bowl; pour over the mushroom and onion mixture. Season the egg whites with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the egg whites are no longer runny, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the mixture; top with the pesto. Fold the omelette in half and continue cooking until the cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes.
