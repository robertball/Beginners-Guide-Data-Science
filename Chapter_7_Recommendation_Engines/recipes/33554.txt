Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
3/4 cup uncooked long-grain white rice
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, diced
3 (5 ounce) cans water packed tuna, drained and flaked
1/2 cup milk
3 tablespoons self-rising flour
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 eggs
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan, and stir in rice. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in onion, cover tightly, and cook until tender but not browned, about 5 minutes.
In a large bowl, mix tuna, milk, flour, parsley, sugar, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in rice, onion, and eggs. Mold the mixture into 12 balls using 2 teaspoons.
Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet or deep fryer. Fry the tuna balls in batches until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
