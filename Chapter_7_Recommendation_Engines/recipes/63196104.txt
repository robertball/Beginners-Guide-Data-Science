Ingredients:
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thigh and/or breast, trimmed of fat
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon honey*
1 tablespoon rice wine or mirin
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon grated ginger
1 tablespoon sesame oil
Pinch of black pepper
1 teaspoon sesame seeds

Directions:
Cut the chicken into 2-inch-by-1-inch pieces. In a bowl, mix all of the ingredients together except for the chicken until the sugar has dissolved. Coat the chicken pieces with the marinade. Marinate for about 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces, reserving the marinade. Cook until slightly browned and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. (The sugar and honey in the marinade will burn easily, so watch it carefully and add the reserved marinade 1 tablespoon at a time when the pan gets dry. If needed, reduce the heat to avoid burning.) Remove from the heat and serve immediately.
