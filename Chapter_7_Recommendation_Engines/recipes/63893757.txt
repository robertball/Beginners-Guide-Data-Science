Directions:
Sift:
3/4 cup bread flour
in a bowl.
Resift with:
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon any baking powder
2 tablespoons powdered sugar.
In another bowl beat:
2 eggs
Add and beat:
2/3 cup milk
1/3 cup water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla.
Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour in the liquid ingredients. Combine them with a few swift strokes. Ignore the lumps, they'll take care of themselves. Heat a frying pan on the stove to about medium heat. Spray the pan with cooking oil. Add a small quantity of batter. Tip the pan and let the batter spread over the bottom. Cook the pancake over moderate heat. When it is brown underneath, flip it and brown it on the other side. When it is fully browned and ready to eat, get it to a plate and serve hot.

I got this recipe from the 1943 Joy Of Cooking cookbook.
I could tell that this recipe was used very much because of the weathered page!!
