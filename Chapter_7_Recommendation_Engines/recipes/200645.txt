Description: 
An ice cold coffee beverage that is perfect as a pick me up when you don't want hot coffee, or a super sweet soda.  It is very easily modified to suit your tastes, depending on how strong you like your coffee. To make a drink, combine 2-3 tablespoons of the syrup with 8 oz of cold milk and serve over ice. As an extra special treat, add a scoop of ice cream, or a shot of Irish Cream!
