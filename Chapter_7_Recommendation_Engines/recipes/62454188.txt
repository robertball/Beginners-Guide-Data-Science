Ingredients:
1 seeded baguette
2 tablespoon olive oil
4 roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
1 cup chopped fresh basil for mix
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
3-4 cloves fresh garlic
1-2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar
liberal sprinkling of fresh ground 3 colour pepper (black, red, white)
1 16oz tub of fresh buffalo mozzarella cheese pearls.
1/2 cup of torn basil leaves for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F.
In a medium bowl combine all ingredients except bread and olive oil.  Use a garlic press to  crush the garlic and then chop fine before adding to ingredients. Mix well. Let sit in fridge for at least 1-2 hours to let flavours blend. Can sit for up to 8 hours.
Slice the baguette into 1/2 inch diagonal slices and place in single layer on baking sheet. Brush lightly with the olive oil on both side.  Slow bake in 250 degree oven until crisp and toasted.  Remove from oven when done and arrange on platter.
Remove the tomato, cheese, herb mix from fridge and stir to blend. Mound each toast slice with a heaping serving of your bruschetta  mix. Top with the fresh basil garnish.
Enjoy!
