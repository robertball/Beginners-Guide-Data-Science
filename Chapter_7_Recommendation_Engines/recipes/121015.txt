Ingredients:
2/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 1/4 cups sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/2 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon grated orange peel
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
GLAZE:
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons orange juice

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add yogurt, orange juice and peel. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture. Pour into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cover loosely with foil if top browns to quickly. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to wire rack.
For glaze, combine confectioners' sugar and enough orange juice to achieve desired consistency. Drizzle over cooled bread.

Description: 
My mother made this often when I was growing up. Now I make it for my husband and two girls. The slightly tangy glaze complements the moist bread.
