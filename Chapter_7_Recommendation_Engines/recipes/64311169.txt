Ingredients:
Cheesy Cauliflower Patties = YUM YUM!
1 head cauliflower
2 large eggs
1/2 c cheddar cheese, grated
1/2 c panko (found in the bread crumb aisle, healthier option)
1/2 t cayenne pepper (more of less to taste)
salt
olive oil

Directions:
Cut cauliflower into florets & cook in boiling water until tender about 10 minutes. Drain. Mash the cauliflower while still warm. Stir cheese, eggs, panko, cayenne & salt to taste.
Coat the bottom of a griddle or skillet with olive oil over medium-high heat. Form the cauliflower mixture into patties about 3 inches across. Cook until golden brown & set, about 3 minutes per side. Keep each batch warm in the oven while you cook the rest.
