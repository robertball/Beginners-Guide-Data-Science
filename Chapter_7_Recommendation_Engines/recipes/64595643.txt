Ingredients:
3 Extra Large Eggs
1/2 tsp Sesame Oil
1 tsp Oyster Sauce
2 tsp Soya Sauce
1 cup chopped cooked pork and/or chicken (I used half a cup each of roast pork loin and chicken breast)
1 cup fresh bean sprouts
1 large scallion (green onion) sliced thin (about a 1/4 cup)
1/4 cup chopped mushrooms
1 large clove of garlic smashed
6 thin slices of ginger
3 tbsp oil for frying

Directions:
Wisk together eggs, oyster sauce, soya sauce and sesame oil.  Add enough water to make one cup.  Heat an 11" non-stick omelet pan.  Saute the oil, garlic and ginger over medium-high heat until browned.  Remove garlic and ginger from pan.
Stir fry the meat and vegetables for about 2 minutes over medium-high heat . Place mixture into a side-dish.
Return pan to medium-high heat and pour half of egg mixture (1/2 cup) into the pan spreading over the bottom of the pan.  Cook for 1/2 a minute then spread half the vegetable meat mixture over the half of the egg mixture.  Turn heat to low and cook until eggs are set.  Using a spatula turn the egg that doesn't have any vegetable/meat on it over the vegetable meat mixture.  Slide from pan onto a plate and place into warm oven.  Repeat cooking instructions for second foo yung omelet.  Serve with your choice of sauce (I used Rachel Ray's) with a little slivered scallion for color.

Description: 
Delicious Authentic Flavored Egg Foo Yung.  I used Rachel Ray's foo yung sauce, but any gravy flavored with a bit of oyster sauce and soya sauce will do.  My husband says this is the best he's had anywhere.
