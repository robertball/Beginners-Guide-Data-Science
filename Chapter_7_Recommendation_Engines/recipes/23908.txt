3 tablespoons soy flour
2 tablespoons white sugar

Preheat griddle to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl combine dry ingredients.  In another large mixing bowl combine eggs, oil and almond extract; whisk until combined. Stir in soy milk.  Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until combined.  Batter should be slightly thick, adjust liquid if necessary.
Pour batter by the 1/4 cup full onto hot griddle.  Cook until edges look dry and bubbles burst. Flip and cook another minute or so until golden brown.  Serve warm.

Description: 
These healthy pancakes with a hint of almond are delicious.  They're thick and fluffy and they really stick to your ribs. Serve warm with maple syrup or peach jam. Leftovers are great served cold with a little peach jam spread on them, yum!
