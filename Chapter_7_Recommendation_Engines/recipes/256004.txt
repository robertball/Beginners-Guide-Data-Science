Ingredients:
1 cup pecan halves
1 cup light corn syrup
1 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
1/4 cup bourbon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup dark chocolate chips
1/3 cup milk chocolate chips
1/3 cup white chocolate chips
1 pastry for a 9-inch pie crust
2 teaspoons milk, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread pecan halves on a baking sheet.
Toast pecans in the preheating oven, stirring occasionally, until golden and fragrant, 6 to 10 minutes. Chop coarsely.
Whisk corn syrup, sugar, eggs, melted butter, bourbon, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir pecans, dark chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips into the filling.
Line a 9-inch fluted glass pie plate with pie crust. Brush milk over crust.
Bake pie crust in the preheated oven until hot to the touch, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour filling into the hot crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are firm and center is mostly set, about 45 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack; cool for at least 1 hour before serving.
