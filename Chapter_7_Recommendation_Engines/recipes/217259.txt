Ingredients:
3 tablespoons white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons Hellmann’s Lite mayonnaise
1 tablespoon Hellmann’s Dijonnaise
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1/4 pound blue cheese, sliced and crumbled
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 cups thinly sliced romaine lettuce
8 slices turkey bacon, cooked until crisp and coarsely chopped
2 cups coarsely shredded chicken (from a store-bought rotisserie chicken,) white and dark meat
4 wraps (white, whole wheat, tomato or spinach)

Directions:
Whisk together the vinegar, mayonnaise, Dijonnaise and olive oil in a large bowl until combined.
Put the romaine, bacon, chicken and blue cheese in a large bowl and toss to combine.
Heat the wraps in a dry saute pan over low heat, or place on a plate, cover with a damp paper towel and microwave for 25 seconds to make more pliable. Place the wraps on a flat surface and spread some of the dressing over the surface. Divide the mixture among the wraps, fold like a burrito, slice in half and drizzle top with more dressing, if desired.
