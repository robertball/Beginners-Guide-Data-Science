Description: 
My way of making pulled pork is simple.  Slow Cooker, 1 can of beer, a 5-6 pound pork butt, seasonings and a bottle of barbecue sauce. 

My beer choice-Shiner Bock.  My seasoning choice-salt, pepper, onion and garlic powders.  My barbecue sauce choice-Sweet Baby Rayâ€™s Barbecue Sauce.

Just put it in a slow cooker before you go to bed, and when you wake up the magic has happened.  See for yourself.
