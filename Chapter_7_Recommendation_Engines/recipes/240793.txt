Ingredients:
Filling:
1 tablespoon oil, or as desired
1 small onion, chopped
5 cups mixed vegetables
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 pinch salt
4 large eggs
3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/2 cup milk

2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Add vegetables, lemon juice, and 1 pinch salt to onion; stir well. Remove skillet from heat.
Mix eggs, feta cheese, milk, mozzarella cheese, salt, and pepper together in a separate bowl.
Mix cold water and corn oil together in a bowl. Place flour and 1 pinch salt in a separate bowl. Slowly pour oil mixture into flour mixture, mixing until a thick dough forms. Press the dough into two 9-inch round baking pans. Spoon the vegetable mixture into the crusts and top with egg mixture.
