Ingredients:
1 box pasta (short noodle of any kind)
1 stick butter
1 can evaporated milk
1 1/2 cups milk
20 oz cheese (any kind will work depending on your taste. I like a pepper jack/cheddar mix)
1 egg, beaten
Salt and pepper to taste
Paprika to taste
1 lb kielbasa or chicken sausage (any flavor)

Directions:
Cook the pasta for half the time on the box directions
Spray the inside of the crock pot with non stick spray (also using a crock t liner will drastically help with the mess)
Combine the milk, evaporated milk, beaten egg, butter in the crock pot
Cube the cheese, add it to the crock pot
Chop the meat, add it to the crock pot
Add the cooked pasta to the crock pot, stir
Season to taste, stir
Cook on low 1 1/2 hours, stir about every 1/2 hour
Allow to cool about 10 minutes before serving
