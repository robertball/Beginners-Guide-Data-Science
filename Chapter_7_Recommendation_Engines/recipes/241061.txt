Ingredients:
3/4 pound Italian sausage links, casings removed
3 cups thinly sliced mushrooms
1 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
5 1/4 cups water
1 (28 ounce) can chopped tomatoes with juice
1 1/2 cups hearty red wine
5 cubes beef bouillon
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (8 ounce) package spinach and cheese tortellini (such as RonzoniÂ® Ricotta and Spinach)
2 cups chopped zucchini

Directions:
Cook and stir sausage in a large saucepan over medium heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain. Add mushrooms, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until mushrooms and onion are tender, about 5 minutes.
Mix tomatoes with juice, red wine, beef bouillon, basil, and pepper into sausage mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover saucepan, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 15 minutes. Bring liquid to a boil and add tortellini; cook until pasta is heated through, about 12 minutes.
Stir zucchini into soup and simmer until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove soup from heat and let stand 5 minutes before serving.
