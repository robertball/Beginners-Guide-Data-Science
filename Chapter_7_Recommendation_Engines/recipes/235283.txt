Ingredients:
2/3 cup water
2/3 cup white sugar
1 cup raspberries

Directions:
Bring water and sugar to a boil in small saucepan, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir in raspberries. Mash mixture using a potato masher or fork. Let mixture steep for at least 1 hour.
Drain mixture through a fine mesh strainer, pressing raspberry pulp with a spatula to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids and store syrup in a sealed container in the refrigerator.
