Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's® Condensed Cheddar Cheese Soup
1/2 cup Pace® Chunky Salsa
1/2 cup frozen whole kernel corn, thawed
1 1/2 cups elbow macaroni, cooked and drained
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 12 (2 1/2-inch) muffin-pan cups with foil liners.
Cook the beef in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Remove the skillet from the heat.
Stir in the soup, salsa, corn, macaroni and 3/4 cup cheese. Spoon about 1/2 cup beef mixture into each muffin-pan cup. Sprinkle each with about 1 tablespoon remaining cheese.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the beef mixture is hot and the cheese is melted.
