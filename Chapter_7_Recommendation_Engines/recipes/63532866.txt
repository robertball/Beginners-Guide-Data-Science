Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1 1/2 tsp salt
2 cups water
3 Tbsp Vinegar
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
1-2 lb chicken tenders

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the flour, salt, and water. In a separate bowl, combine the vinegar and baking soda (it will foam up) and pour into the flour mixture.
Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a large Dutch oven or skillet and heat to 350 degrees.
Dip the chicken tenders in the tempura batter and shake off excess. Once the oil is hot, fry the tenders in small batches for about 5 minutes and then drain on paper towels.
Serve with your favorite dipping sauces.
