Ingredients:
1 cup milk

Description: 
If you're looking for a rich and decadent chocolate pudding then keep moving. As nutritious as this 'superfood' is supposed to be, you can't expect the same results substituting birdseed for eggs, butter, and cream. That said, if you're craving something sweet, relatively chocolaty, and comparatively healthful, then chia seeds may be a good option.
