Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup sour cream
4 green onions, chopped
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
14 (10 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Mix cream cheese, sour cream, green onions, and taco seasoning in a bowl until well blended. Spread a thin layer of the cream cheese mixture onto each tortilla. Roll each tortilla tightly to create a long tube. Spread more of the cream cheese mixture on the edges of the tortilla to seal. Freeze rolls on a baking sheet for 20 minutes for easier slicing. Cut each roll into 1-inch pieces and thaw before serving.
