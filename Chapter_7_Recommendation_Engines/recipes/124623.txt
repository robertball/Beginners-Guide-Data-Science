Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 pounds (1/2 inch thick) beef round steak, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
1/4 cup cooking oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 green pepper, chopped
1 garlic clove, minced
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 (16 ounce) can kidney beans, juice drained and reserved
1 (16 ounce) can whole kernel corn, juice drained and reserved

Directions:
Combine flour, salt and pepper in a large plastic bag. Place beef cubes in bag and shake to coat evenly. In a Dutch oven or large skillet, brown beef in oil. Add onion, green pepper and garlic; cook until peppers are crisp-tender. Stir in chili powder, oregano and reserved vegetable liquid; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until meat is tender, about 45-50 minutes. Stir in beans and corn; simmer 10 minutes or until heated through.

Description: 
To the best of my knowledge, this recipe came from the early days in Colorado...or from the cattle trails leading into Colorado. It is a cowboy recipe and the ingredients can be varied, depending on what's available. In the old days, you couldn't always find what you needed...and sometimes it's fun to vary the ingredients.
