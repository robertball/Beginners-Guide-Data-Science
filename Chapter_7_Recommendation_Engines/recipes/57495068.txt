Description: 
I have used this simple rub to make ribs on the barbi in both Memphis, where I learned, and England, where I now live. The dry rub will stop the ribs from burning on the outside, as happens with some wet sauces. This rub is hot and sweet, which makes it perfect for ribs. The proportions of ingredients can be adjusted to taste. On two continents, I've received nothing but compliments for this recipe. I use this for approximately 2 kilograms ribs.Modified from: Simple Pork Rib Dry Rub
