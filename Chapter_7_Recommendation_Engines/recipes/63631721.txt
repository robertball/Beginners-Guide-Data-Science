Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups vegetable oil
1 tbsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 (1 ounce) envelopes ranch dressing mix
2 tbsp crushed red pepper flakes
1 tbsp chili seasoning
2 tsp cayenne powder
1 (16.5 ounce) package salted tops saltine crackers

Directions:
Place the vegetable oil, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, ranch dressing mix, and crushed red pepper flakes in a 2 one gallon bags or 1 2-gallon plastic zipper bag. Seal the bag(s) and smoosh with your hands to thoroughly combine the oil and spices. Place the crackers into the bag, seal, and turn the bag over to cover the crackers with the spice mix. Let the bag sit for about 10 mins, then turn again. Repeat for about an hour or until the crackers are well-coated with spice mix, spread crackers out on trays and allow to sit overnight. Enjoy! (On a scale of one to ten, ten being hottest, these are a 7-8)

Description: 
great little recipe, easy to make and cheap too! I made this spicier than another similar one I found, and added cayenne, my family likes them hot! You can leave out the cayenne or adjust it to taste. Some people prefer multigrain crackers, or you can also opt for unsalted tops.
