Ingredients:
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 cup butter
1 onion, minced
2 cups frozen cooked peeled and deveined jumbo shrimp
3 cups chopped leftover honey-baked, spiral-cut ham
1 ham bone
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup coconut milk

Directions:
Stir garlic, turmeric, chili powder, basil, and cayenne pepper together in a small saucepan; heat over medium heat until aromatic, about 1 minute. Melt butter into the mixture, add onion, and cook until the onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Scoop onion mixture from saucepan into a slow cooker, reserving as much butter in the saucepan as possible.
Increase heat under saucepan to medium-high heat. Saute frozen shrimp in hot butter until just firm, about 2 minutes; transfer mixture to slow cooker. Add ham, ham bone, black beans, and tomatoes to the slow cooker.
Cook on High until the ham on the bone is falling off, 4 to 6 hours (or on Low 6 to 8 hours).
Remove and discard ham bone, stir coconut milk into the mixture, continue cooking on Low until the coconut milk is warmed, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Great for finishing off that holiday ham that just won't quit! Also able to freeze and save for later if hammed out. Two of my 3 young sons loved it. The third asked for no beans and shrimp which was easy to filter out in his bowl.  Husband devoured it and wished it had more shrimp. Overall a success considering it was a week out from daily doses of Easter ham. Serve by itself or over white rice.
