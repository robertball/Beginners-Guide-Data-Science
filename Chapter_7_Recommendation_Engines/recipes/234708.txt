Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) boneless beef chuck roast
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 cup baby carrots
1 1/2 cups green beans, sliced diagonally (also known as "Frenched")
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
2/3 cup water
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Sear roast in hot oil until browned completely, about 2 minutes per side.
Spread potatoes into the bottom of the slow cooker. Layer baby carrots atop the potatoes and green beans atop the carrots. Place the roast atop the layers of vegetables.
Mix cream of mushroom soup, water, and dry onion soup mix together in a bowl; pour over the roast and vegetables.
Cook on Low 8 to 10 hours.

Description: 
A wonderful roast beef slow cooker recipe that makes it own delicious gravy while the beef and veggies are cooking. Try also with dry onion-and-mushroom soup mix in place of the onion for added flavor. Feel free to change the vegetables to make the dish to the liking of you and your family. You can add sliced mushrooms, sliced sweet onion or pearl onions, whatever strikes your fancy. I found a good ratio is 3 cubed potatoes and about 2 handfuls of additional vegetables.
