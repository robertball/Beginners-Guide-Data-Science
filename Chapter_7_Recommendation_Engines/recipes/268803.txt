Ingredients:
3/4 pound beets - trimmed, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 (8 ounce) package goat cheese, softened
1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 teaspoons fresh thyme
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon coarsely crushed pine nuts
1 tablespoon balsamic glaze

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil.
Place beets into a bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat and place in the roasting pan.
Roast in the preheated oven until soft for 20 minutes, stirring halfway through. Remove from oven and fold foil over beets to keep warm. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine goat cheese, cream cheese, thyme, garlic, and lemon juice in a mini food processor; blend until smooth.  Transfer mixture to a small oven-proof dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot and lightly browned, 15 to 17 minutes. Create a well in the center of the cheese mixture and top with beets. Garnish with pine nuts and drizzle with balsamic glaze. Serve warm.

Description: 
Goat cheese and beets not only make a great side or salad, they also make a tasty dip! Serve with crostini, pita chips or crackers. Beets will stain, so wear gloves if desired.
