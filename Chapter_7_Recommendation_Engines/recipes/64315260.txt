Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup diced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
15 ounces Mild Tex Mex-style diced tomatoes
4 ounces chopped green chilies
1 tsp dried cilantro
4 Tbsp. taco seasoning mix
20 ounces refried black beans
20 ounces red enchilada sauce
4 cups shredded Mexican blend cheese
6 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1/2 cup sour cream, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Wrap the bottom of 8-inch spring form pan in foil.
Cook and stir ground beef and onions in a large skillet over medium-high heat until meat is browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in diced tomatoes, green chiles, cilantro, and taco seasoning mix. Remove from heat.
Mix black beans and add just enough enchilada sauce to the beans to be a good spreadable consistency.
Cook tortillas, one at a time, in a skillet until slightly crisp, about 15 seconds per side.
Place one tortilla on the bottom of pan. Spread a generous layer of black bean mixture on top of tortilla, then spread a layer of ground beef mixture on top. Sprinkle 1 cup of cheese on top of meat mixture and pour 1/4 cup red enchilada sauce over the top. Repeat the tortilla, bean, meat, cheese, and sauce layering process, finishing with cheese and enchilada sauce on top.
Cover pan with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and enchiladas are cooked through, about 40 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes and serve with sour cream.
