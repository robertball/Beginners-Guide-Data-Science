Ingredients:
2 lbs of dry black beans
1 onion
1 bell pepper
6 garlic cloves
1 T dry oregano
1 T cumin powder
1/2 cup olive oil (no substitutes!)
1/8 cup white vinegar
salt to taste

Directions:
Clean and wash the black beans in cold water
Place the beans in a large pot, cover the beans with twice their volume with water, 1/2 the peeled onion, 1/2 the bell pepper (cut in two pieces), 3 garlic cloves mashed, 1/2 T of the oregano, 1/2 T cumin and 1/4 olive oil. Bring to boil, lower the temperature and cook for approximately 1 hr 30 minutes until the beans are soft. (in a pressure cooker, cook for 45 minutes). If the beans dry too much, add boiling water in 1/2 cups at a time. Should not be too watery though.
Once the beans are soft, add the rest of the onion (another half), the bell pepper, 3 mashed garlic cloves, the rest of the oregano and cumin, the last 1/4 cup of olive oil, and add salt to taste.
Cook for another 20 minutes until the beans liquid (soup)starts the thicken.
Remove from the stove, add the white vinegar, stir, and let rest for a couple of minutes before serving
Served over rice, and drizzled with 1/2 Tablespoon of good olive oil.
