Ingredients:
1 package small Won Ton wraps (found near the tofu in store usually)
1 cup chicken, (Chopped, or use turkey or pork)
1 - 8 oz package cream cheese
Dash of Onion powder
Dash of Garlic powder
Dash of Worcestershire Sauce
Dash of Soy Sauce
Dash of Salt
Dash of Pepper
Peanut Oil

Directions:
Preheat oil in fryer. Make sure the oil is about 4 inches or so deep.  There will be oil splatter, so use deep pan. If you use stove, cook at medium heat.
In medium bowl, with a spoon, mix cream cheese, onion & garlic powder, Worcestershire & soy sauce, salt & pepper, all to your taste.
Add fully cooked chopped chicken, turkey or pork to the mix and stir.  (You can use leftovers!)
Follow instructions on the Won Ton wraps package to wrap your Rangoon.  Place about a teaspoon (more or less) of mixture to your Won Ton, wrap, then drop into hot oil.  They are done, when lightly browned.  Takes only a few minutes.  Drain on paper towel or on wire rack, and enjoy!

Description: 
I had everything to make crab Rangoon one night, except the crab. So I used leftover roast chicken. Needless to say, my family fell in love with them, I'm sharing my recipe, because I think your family will too!
