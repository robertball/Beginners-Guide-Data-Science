Ingredients:
3 pounds bottom round roast
1 cup red wine vinegar
1 cup water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 onion, thinly sliced
2 bay leaves
3 whole cloves
2 tablespoons salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup water
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tomato, cut into wedges

Directions:
Place meat in large, non-metal bowl.  In separate bowl, combine red wine vinegar, 1 cup water, lemon juice, onion, bay leaves, cloves, salt and pepper.  Pour over meat.  Cover and refrigerate 48 hours.
Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Remove meat from marinade and brown in oil on all sides, 1 to 2 minutes a side.  Remove bay leaves and cloves from marinade.  Pour in 1 cup water and pour marinade into pan with meat.  Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 3 hours, or until tender.
Remove meat from pan.  Increase heat and sprinkle flour, a little at a time, over juices, cooking until mixture thickens to form gravy.  Return meat to pan with tomato wedges, heat through and serve.

Description: 
This is an original German sauerbraten recipe handed down to me. The meat is more tender, and flavorful the longer you marinade, I usually marinade for 2 days.
