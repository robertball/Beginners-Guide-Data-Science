Ingredients:
1 - 29 oz can of cut sweet potatoes drained
1 tablespoon of chili powder
1.5 tablespoons of cumin
2 cloves of garlic crushed
1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon of hot sauce or more to taste
2/3 cup of salsa (used the chipotle because we like the smoky flavor)
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
2 tablespoons of fresh lime juice
Salt and pepper to taste
1 small onion chopped fine
1.5 cups of shredded cooked chicken
1 – 4 oz can green chilies
1 - 15.5 oz can of black beans drained and rinsed
1 – 4 oz can of sliced black olives drained
1.5 cups of shredded co-jack divided
1 - 28 oz can of green enchilada sauce
10 small corn or flour tortillas
Sour cream for garnish
Fresh chopped cilantro for garnish

Directions:
Add potatoes to large bowl with the next nine ingredients. Mash the potatoes with the spices to a smooth consistency. Add the chicken, onion, chilies, beans, black olives and 1 cup of the cheese. Mix until distributed evenly.
In a 9 x 13 baking dish, spray with cooking spray and add half of the enchilada sauce. Fill the tortillas with the potato/chicken mixture and place seam down in the baking dish. When all the tortillas are filled, cover with the remaining sauce.
Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. Add the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese and bake until cheese is bubbly and melted.
Garnish with sour cream and cilantro to serve.

Description: 
Not your typical enchilada! The sweet and spicy taste is a wonderful combination. Those who swear they do not like sweet potatoes are always amazed after trying. This is by far my family's favorite enchilada recipe.
