Ingredients:
12 oz. premium sharp white cheddar cheese, shredded
1/4 cup self-rising flour
3/4 cups plain flour
1 stick real butter
cayenne pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together thoroughly.
Roll out mixture into nickel-sized pieces.  Mash each one down with a small fork to flatten biscuits and groove the tops.
Bake at 350 deg. for 15-20 minutes.  When biscuits begin to brown and harden on the bottom, remove, let cool and enjoy.
