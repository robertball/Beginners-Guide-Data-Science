Ingredients:
1 (22 ounce) Costco jar pesto sauce
1/2 cup milk 2%
1/2 cup Contadina bread crumbs Italian style
2 tablespoon olive oil
12oz (350 g) Barilla plus multigrain penne pasta
1.4lb Trader Joes Pesto Genovese cubed Chicken Breast
1 cup daisy lite sour cream
1 (8 oz) Frozen Asparagus spears
1 (15 ounce) can S&W; Italian recipe diced tomatoes w/garlic, oregano & basil (undrained)
3/4 cup Costco BelGioioso crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
1/2 onion chopped
8 0z fresh Mushrooms Prepacked
1/3 cup Mezzetta Roasted Bell Peppers Strips
1 tablespoon Smoked Paprika
3 garlic clove, pressed
1/2 cup dry white wine such as Chardonnay

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish or pampered chef Deep Covered Baker.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the penne, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
In another pan, use olive oil to saute onion, garlic, mushrooms, roasted bell peppers, smoked paprika and Chardonnay (saute until sauce is reduced) set aside to cool.
Meanwhile, combine the chicken in a bowl with the bread crumbs, tomatoes, sour cream, pesto sauce, and milk. Stir in the pasta once done, and the sauteed mushrooms, onion and bell peppers scoop into the prepared baking dish. Top with the asparagus spears & crumbled Gorgonzola cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden brown on top, 1 hour.
