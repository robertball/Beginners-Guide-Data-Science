Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1/3 cup finely chopped red onion
1 (8 ounce) package fresh spinach
1/2 (14 ounce) package pastry for 9-inch double-crust pie
4 large eggs
3/4 cup whole-milk ricotta cheese
3/4 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; add onion and cook for 1 minute. Add spinach and cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to wilt, about 1 minute. Cover skillet and cook for 1 minute more, allowing condensation to build inside the skillet. Remove from heat, uncover, and stir.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press pie pastry into a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie pan. Prick bottom and sides with a fork.
Bake crust in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.
Combine eggs, ricotta cheese, cream, Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, basil, salt, and pepper in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth.
Spread spinach and onion mixture evenly over the crust. Pour egg mixture on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until center of quiche is set and the top is lightly browned, about 40 minutes. Allow to stand for 10 minutes before serving.
