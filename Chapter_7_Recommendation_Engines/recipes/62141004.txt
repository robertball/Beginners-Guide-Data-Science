Knead dough on a flat surface, roll out dough to 1/4 inch thick, and cut into desired shapes.
Place dough in preheated oven and bake until lightly golden brown, about 8 - 10  minutes.
In a seperate dish mix 1 cup sugar and 1 cup cinnamon. Drop and cover cookies in mixture as they come out of the oven.
