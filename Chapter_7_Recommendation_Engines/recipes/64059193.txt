Ingredients:
1/2 cup buckwheat groats
1 cup of water
1 small avocado, diced
1 lime, juiced
1.5 TBSP extra virgin olive oil
5 ripe cherry tomatoes, diced
1 TBSP chopped fresh Italian parsley, the flat leaf kind
1/2 tsp fennel seeds
1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper mix (red, black and green)
1/8 cup red onion, thinly sliced
1/4 cup soft goat cheese
1/2 tsp ground cayenne pepper

Directions:
Cook the buckwheat groats in 1 cup of water until al dente, about 8 minutes. The buckwheat should remain a bit crunchy to the teeth, but soft enough to chew pleasantly.
Rinse the groats under cold water.
Meanwhile, in a large salad bowl mix all the ingredients together, except for the cheese.
Add the buckwheat groats and mix well taking care not to crush the tomatoes, avocado or buckwheat.
Add the goat cheese in pieces on top of the salad immediately before serving.
