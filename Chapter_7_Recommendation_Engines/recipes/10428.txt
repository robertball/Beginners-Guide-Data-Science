Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 cup shortening
2 eggs
1 teaspoon lemon extract
1/2 cup milk
3/4 cup sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Grease cookie sheet.
Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cardamom in a large bowl.  Cut shortening in with a pastry blender or knives until the size of small peas.
Stir in eggs, lightly beaten, and lemon extract.  Stir in milk on tablespoon at a time, mixing after each addition.
Mix everything together thoroughly.  Break dough off in small pieces and roll in the hands to rolls about 1-1/2 inches long.  Flatten slightly and roll in sesame seeds.
Place on cookie sheet 3/4 inch apart.  Bake for 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned.

Description: 
There used to be a commercial version of these years ago but once you have had them home-made there is no comparison.  These are not too sweet but they are addicting.
