Ingredients:
8 oz cream cheese
8 oz butter
3 cups all purpose flour
Filling of your choice, OR
1 lb. walnuts  finely ground
2 egg whites
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1 cup granulated sugar

Directions:
Mix together and make 1 inch diameter balls (depending how big you want your kiffles).
Chill overnight. Buy or make a filling.
Next day - Have a lot of powdered sugar on hand (a bag of it).
Use powdered sugar like you would flour when rolling out the cookie balls.
Roll balls pretty thin into a square or circle, spread a little filling in center, fold edges in so that they overlap (pinch ends if you’re worried the filling will run out).
Bake 350° for about 15 minutes.
For the walnut filling: Beat egg whites until stiff, add vanilla extract and sugar towards the end of beating eggs (should already be pretty stiff before you add it).
Mix walnuts and egg white mixture together.
