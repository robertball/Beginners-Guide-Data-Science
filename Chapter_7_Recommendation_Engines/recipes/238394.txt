1 pound ground pork sausage
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent roll dough, or as needed
8 ounces mild Cheddar cheese, shredded

Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Line the baking dish with crescent roll dough.
Sprinkle cooled sausage and Cheddar cheese over crescent roll dough. Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.

Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Pour egg mixture over sausage and cheese in the baking dish. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove and discard aluminum foil and reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Continue baking until egg mixture is set, 15 to 25 minutes.
