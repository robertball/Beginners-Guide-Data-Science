Ingredients:
2 cups organic nut butter (almond/peanut/cashew/whatever you like best
1 large egg slightly beaten, cage free organic
1 cup fine grind almond flour
2/3 cup organic coconut palm sugar
1 cup organic mini dark chocolate chips
dash sea salt
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla (gluten free) optional

Directions:
Heat oven to 360, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Mix up cookie dough well by hand if necessary, then roll about 24 cookies into balls, place on sheets, smash down lightly with damp (water) fork to form the stripes we see in PB cookies.  Bake about 8-10 minutes.  Best if lightly browned, or less.  Let cool, serve with favorite milk.  Enjoy them warm, eat with fork if necessary.

Description: 
So very rich, perfect and healthy.  Made with any organic nut butter of choice.  Great with almond butter, peanut butter,  you name it!  We think better than the old fashioned PB cookie even.  Note coconut sugar to be high in magnesium, low glycemic index.  And the dark chocolate chips I find at our local Co-Op healthy food stores.  They even have some made with stevia if you like to be even lower in the sugars.  This is a fast easy recipe sure to please!  Keeps well in fridge or freezer best.  I like mine micro-waved a few seconds for that fresh warm cookie with melted chocolate goodness.
