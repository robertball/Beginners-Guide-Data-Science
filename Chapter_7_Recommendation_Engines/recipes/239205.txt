Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1 yellow onion, finely chopped
1/3 cup dry bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten
1 1/2 teaspoons Madras curry powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 pinch ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine turkey, onion, bread crumbs, egg, curry powder, salt, cumin, ginger, and cinnamon together in a bowl using your hands; form into about 20 balls.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook meatballs, working in batches, in hot oil until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer browned meatballs to a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

A great-tasting, lean meatball. I serve mine with pita bread, hummus, and a crispy salad.
