Ingredients:
1 medium cucumber, peeled and sliced in 1/4" thick slices
1 cup roasted red pepper hummus, homemade or store-bought
1/2 cup	bean sprouts
4 large	pita bread rounds

Directions:
Cut the top 1/3 off the pita bread (I dip this in the roasted red pepper hummus to use up).  Loosen pocket, and slather several tablespoons of red pepper hummus on both sides inside pita pocket.  Push some cucumber slices down into the bottom of pocket, taking care not to tear bottom of pocket.  Layer a few more cucumber slices, then add some sprouts on top and enjoy!

Description: 
This is a very simple, easy-to-put together sandwich - but it is oh, so good!  I make this a lot in the summer at work - I  just bring all the ingredients in and make my sandwich right there.
