Ingredients:
2 tablespoons dried rosemary
4 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion salt
1/2 cup salted butter, softened
1 loaf French bread, halved lengthwise
1/4 pound blue cheese, sliced
dried rosemary (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Stir the 2 tablespoons of rosemary, garlic powder, and onion salt together in a bowl. Add the softened butter to the herb mixture; mix to combine. Spread the butter mixture evenly onto the cut sides of the bread loaf; top with the blue cheese slices. Transfer the bread to a baking sheet.
Place the bread under the broiler until the cheese is slightly melted, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle with additional rosemary if desired.

Description: 
I just wanted to put my favorite flavors together! I normally suggest fresh herbs, but with this please use already-dried. Also works well with sourdough bread.
