Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Line bread slices on a baking sheet in a single layer. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon coarse salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool, about 10 minutes.
While bread cools, mix ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon basil, and remaining coarse salt and pepper together in a bowl.
