Ingredients:
2 peaches, thinly sliced
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or more to taste
4 cups milk
6 egg yolks, beaten
1 cup white sugar
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Arrange sliced peaches in the bottom of a serving bowl; sprinkle with cinnamon.
Combine milk, egg yolks, sugar, and flour together in a saucepan; cook and stir over medium-low heat until pudding thickens and clings to the back of a spoon, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Pour pudding over prepared peaches. Refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours.
