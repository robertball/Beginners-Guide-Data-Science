Ingredients:
1 pint of cherry tomatoes
3/4 cup of almonds (not salted)
1/2 cup of packed basil
1/2 cup of grated parmesan
2 tbsp of raisins
1/4 tsp, red pepper flakes
1 large clove of garlic
2 oz of anchovies in oil and capers (not drained)
2 pepperoncinis, seeded and stem cut off
shake of pepper
Fusili pasta
Extra parmesan to put on top of pasta

Directions:
Roast almonds at 400 degrees until aromatic
Blend the cherry tomatoes and then strain juice and put tomatoes in a bowl. Then add all ingredients but tomatoes and almonds in a blender together while pasta is cooking. Lastly put almonds in the blender and leave it so there will still be a little bit of a crunch.
When fusilli is done cooking (about 9 minutes) strain and mix blended ingredients with pasta. Top with parmesan and buen provecho!
