Ingredients:
1 bunch parsley
5 garlic cloves, peeled
1 splash water
¼ cup minced shallot
¼ cup red wine vinegar
½ cup extra virgin olive oil
2 tsp salt
¼ tsp red pepper flakes

Directions:
Separate the parsley leaves from the stems by shaving them off with a sharp knife.
Give the parsley leaves a rough chop and place them in the food processor.
Add the peeled garlic to the food processor and pulse several times.
Scrape the sides of the food processor down with a rubber spatula and pulse a few more times, until everything is finely chopped.
Transfer the parsley mixture to a bowl and add a bit of water to food processor.
Swish the water around in the food processor to get all of the parsley mixture out and scrape it into the bowl.
Add the minced shallot, red wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, and red pepper flakes to the bowl.
Add the minced shallot, red wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, and red pepper flakes to the bowl.
Whisk until well combined.
Let stand for several minutes to allow the flavors to combine.
Serve over grilled steaks (or grilled anything, really) and enjoy!
