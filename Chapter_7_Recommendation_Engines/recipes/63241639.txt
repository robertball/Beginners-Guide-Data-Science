Ingredients:
For the cake batter
2 - 1/2 cups AP Flour
1 cup Sugar
1 Tablespoon Baking Powder
1 - 1/2 teaspoon Kosher or Table Salt
3 large Eggs
1 cup Milk
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
2 teaspoon Vanilla Extract
For the Crumb Topping
1 stick butter, (softened)
1 - 1/2 cup flour
1  - 1/2 cup sugar
1 Tablespoon Cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon or pinch ground Cloves

Directions:
Cream sugar and butter, add eggs and remaining ingredients.  Pour into lightly greased 9x13 glass baking dish, (preferred, but any 9x13 is ok).
Place sugar and flour in mixing bowl, add cinnamon, cloves and shortening or butter.  Mix slowly with paddle to incorporate.  Compress handfuls of mixture in your palm and "crumble" over the batter in the pan, ensuring you cover the outside edges first and work your way toward center.

Description: 
This is a decades old recipe that we have enjoyed for years.  As I moved into Culinary School at Johnson and Wales, I modified it and made it moist and amazing.
