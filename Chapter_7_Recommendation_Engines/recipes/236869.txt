Ingredients:
5 (1-inch thick) pork chops
1/2 cup teriyaki sauce
1/4 cup ketchup
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha)
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon dried minced garlic
1 teaspoon dried minced shallots
1/2 teaspoon garlic-pepper seasoning
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
Arrange pork chops into the bottom of a slow cooker crock.
Whisk teriyaki sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, chile-garlic sauce, ginger, garlic, shallots, garlic pepper, and kosher salt together in a bowl; pour over the pork chops.
Cook on High for 1 hour. Switch slow cooker to Low and continue cooking until the pork chops are completely tender, about 3 hours more.

Description: 
I started with the Peking Pork Chops recipe (Thanks, Lynda!) from this site, reviewed the reviews, and made some adjustments of my own to get the precise flavor combination I've been seeking. They're easy to prepare, and everyone I've served has raved that they're fork-tender and flavorful without being overly spicy. Serve over steamed rice (basmati, jasmine, or white).
