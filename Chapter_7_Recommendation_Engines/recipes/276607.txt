Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter, divided
1 pound pork sausage
3 stalks celery, chopped
3 carrots, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
4 cups chopped cooked turkey, or to taste
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of chicken soup (optional)
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen riced cauliflower
1 (10 ounce) package frozen peas
16 ounces heavy cream
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning (such as Slap Ya MamaÂ®)
2 teaspoons ground thyme
2 teaspoons seasoned salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
2 teaspoons dried basil
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown sausage in the hot butter until browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer cooked sausage to a plate. Add celery, carrots, onion, bell pepper, and remaining butter to the pot. Cook over medium heat, scraping up browned bits and stirring to deglaze, 4 to 5 minutes.
Stir cooked sausage and turkey into the Dutch oven. Pour in chicken stock and cream of chicken soup. Stir and bring to a simmer, about 5 minutes. Add cauliflower rice and peas and return to a simmer, about 5 minutes. Stir in heavy cream, Cajun seasoning, thyme, seasoned salt, black pepper, smoked paprika, basil, oregano, red pepper flakes, and cayenne. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. Season to taste and serve.
