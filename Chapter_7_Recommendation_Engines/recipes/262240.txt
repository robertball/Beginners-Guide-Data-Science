Description: 
This is a super-easy way someone taught me to make homemade yogurt that requires only 2 ingredients. Pay attention to the notes. 
Halve the recipe if this is your first time. Usually because store-bought yogurts have lots of additives first-time yogurts do not turn out perfectly. But save 1 cup and use it as base the next time and you will see how well it turns out.
