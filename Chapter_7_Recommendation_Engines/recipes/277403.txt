Ingredients:
nonfat cooking spray
1 cup yellow cornmeal
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons minced onion
2 tablespoons minced green bell pepper
3/4 cup low-fat buttermilk
1 large egg

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (198 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Line the bottom of the air fryer basket with aluminum foil and spray with nonfat cooking spray.
Stir cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, cayenne, and garlic powder together in a large bowl. Mix in onion and bell pepper.
Whisk buttermilk and egg together in a separate bowl. Stir into cornmeal mixture. Let mixture rest for 5 minutes.
Drop cornmeal mixture into the foil-lined basket using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop, making sure not to have them touching each other. Coat with nonfat cooking spray.
Cook in the preheated air fryer until golden brown, crispy, and cooked through, 9 to 10 minutes. Serve hot.

Description: 
Forget about deep frying, and give your hush puppies a light update using an air fryer. They're just a bit denser in texture than deep frying, and look for a subtle hint of heat. They're the perfect sidekick to fried fish or shrimp, but they're equally good with a drizzle of honey.
