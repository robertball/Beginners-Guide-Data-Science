Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
6 slices bacon
3  eggs
½ cup milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons avocado oil (such as Acado™)
1 cup frozen petite peas, thawed
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble into small pieces.
Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
Heat avocado oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add spaghetti, milk mixture, peas, and garlic; cook and stir until milk mixture is heated through and coats the spaghetti, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in bacon and Parmesan cheese. Garnish with parsley.
