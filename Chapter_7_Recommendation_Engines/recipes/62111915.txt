Ingredients:
Bread ingredients
11 ounces milk (skim)
2 T butter or margarine, softened
2 3/4 bread flour
3/4 c oats (quick or old-fashioned)
2 T Splenda brown sugar
1 tsp salt
2 tsp cinnamon
2 tsp active dry yeast
1/2 c raisins (for really moist raisins, soak in hot water for 1 hr before use)
Cinnamon swirl ingredients
2 T butter or margarine, softened
2 tsp Splenda brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1 T butter, melted (optional)

Directions:
Add liquid ingredients and butter to bread machine pan. Add dry ingredients and yeast. Set machine to "dough" setting. If your machine gives you a reminder to add raisins or nuts, add at that time. Otherwise, add raisins after 5 to 10 minutes of first kneading.
When first rise is complete, remove dough from pan. Roll out onto floured surface. Mix together 2 T butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Spread evenly over dough (except 2 inch border along one side). Roll dough into loaf with the spread-free edge rolled last. Place into loaf pan.Cover with towel. Let rise in barely warm oven or other draft-free area until doubled in size, approximately 45 minutes.
Remove from oven. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Brush melted butter onto top of loaf. Bake for 30 to 40 mins until top is lightly browned (do not overbake!).
