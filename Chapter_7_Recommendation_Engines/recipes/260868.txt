Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package candy-coated chocolate-covered peanut candies (such as M&M's®)
1 (8 ounce) package pretzel twists
6 cups toasted oat cereal (such as Cheerios®)
6 cups crispy corn cereal squares (such as Corn Chex®)
1 (14 ounce) bag vanilla chocolate almond bark, broken into pieces
1/4 cup multicolored candy sprinkles, or as needed

Directions:
Combine chocolate-covered peanut candies, pretzel twists, oat cereal, and corn cereal in a large pot or bowl to make the party mixture.
Melt almond bark in a microwave-safe bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes total. Pour over the party mixture and stir well. Spread onto waxed paper. Sprinkle with sprinkles and cool, at least 10 minutes.

Description: 
Caution! Party bark is addictive. You can change the recipe up in many ways, but it's basically party mix covered in white chocolate bark. Makes a great gift.
