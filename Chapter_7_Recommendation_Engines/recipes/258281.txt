Ingredients:
1 pound linguine
1 onion, finely chopped
6 slices bacon, diced
1 pound sea scallops, halved horizontally
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/3 cup chopped Italian parsley
1 pinch lemon zest, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and bacon until onion is tender and bacon is crisp, about 6 minutes. Add scallops, garlic, red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt; cook and stir until scallops are cooked through, about 1 minute. Stir in wine; cook for 1 minute.
Remove skillet from heat and stir parsley into scallop mixture. Top linguine with scallop mixture and garnish with lemon zest.
