Ingredients:
4 (28 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
2 pounds lean ground beef
2 pounds chorizo sausage
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 large onions, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons ground cumin
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 (15.5 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15.5 ounce) can pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15.5 ounce) can small red kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 large green bell pepper, chopped
1 large red bell pepper, chopped
1 large yellow bell pepper, chopped
14 3/8 ounces frozen corn
1 dash hot sauce (such as Frank's RedHot Â®), or more to taste
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste

Directions:
Pour tomatoes into a large stockpot over medium heat.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Transfer beef to the stockpot.
Cook and stir chorizo in the same hot skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Transfer chorizo to the stockpot.
Heat oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onions and garlic until very well cooked and translucent, 7 to 10 minutes. Add cumin and chili powder and cook for about 3 minutes more. Transfer onions to the stockpot with lime juice, salt, and black pepper. Stir black beans, pinto beans, and kidney beans into the pot.
Heat the skillet over medium-high heat and lightly saute bell peppers, about 5 minutes. Add to the stockpot.
Add corn to the stockpot and season with additional salt and pepper. Add hot sauce to taste and simmer for 30 minutes more. Sprinkle cilantro on top and serve.
