Ingredients:
3 cups long grain white rice
6 cups water
3/4 cup butter
1 large onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 pound crawfish tails
2 tablespoons canned tomato sauce
1 cup water, or as needed
6 green onions, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning, or to taste

Directions:
Combine the rice and 6 cups water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until rice is tender and water has been absorbed.
While the rice is cooking, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, and saute until transparent. Stir in the garlic, and cook for a minute. Stir in the flour until well blended. Gradually stir in the tomato sauce and remaining 1 cup water, then add the crawfish tails and bring to a simmer. Add the green onions and season with salt, pepper, and Cajun seasoning. Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes over low heat, until the crawfish is cooked but not tough.  Serve over hot cooked rice.

Description: 
Here in Louisiana, there's nothing better than this classic during crawfish season.  This recipe is easy and can be substituted with shrimp when crawfish are out of season.  Even better when served with hot garlic French bread! Start cooking the rice first since this is a quick and easy dish.
