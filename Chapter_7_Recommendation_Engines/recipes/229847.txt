Ingredients:
Bread:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 1/2 teaspoons yeast
1/2 cup warm water (about 100 degrees F/38 degrees C)
2 teaspoons sugar
3 eggs
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup scalded milk
3 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 lemon, zested
1/2 orange, zested
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons orange juice
3 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed
Icing:
4 cups icing sugar
2 teaspoons lemon juice
8 tablespoons milk, or as needed
Coloured sprinkles

Directions:
Stir together 2 cups flour and the salt in a large bowl. Set aside.
Stir yeast into water; add 2 tsp sugar and stir until dissolved. Let mixture stand for 10 minutes until doubled in volume.
Meanwhile, beat eggs with electric mixer. Gradually beat in 3/4 cup sugar.
Make a well in the flour mixture and pour in scalded milk. Add egg mixture; beat well. Add butter, and lemon and orange rinds and juices, and yeast; beat until combined. Add 1 cup flour at a time, until dough is soft and holds its shape. Knead on a flour-covered surface until elastic and no longer sticky.
Place dough in a large bowl. Cover with a piece of plastic wrap that has been rubbed with a little oil. Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Punch down and let rise again until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Divide dough in half; form each half into a loaf shape and place into a lightly greased 9 x 5-inch (23 x 12 cm) loaf pan. Let rise until doubled in bulk, about an hour.
Bake in a preheated 325 degrees F (160 degrees C) oven until golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes.
Remove from oven, let cool for a few minutes, then remove loaves from pans and finish cooling on a wire rack.
Ice just before serving. For each loaf, stir together 2 cups icing sugar with 1 tsp lemon juice and enough milk (approximately 4 tbsp/60 mL) to make a smooth icing that can be spooned over loaf. Decorate with sprinkles.
