Ingredients:
Caramelized Onions (Made ahead - not included in prep time)
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1 1/2 large yellow sweet onions, cut into 1-inch dice ( Vidalia, Maui, Hermiston, etc.)
1 -2 tablespoon sugar
Meatloaf
o	1 lb ground grass fed beef
o	1 egg, lightly beaten
o	1 1/2 tablespoons stone ground mustard (Dijon will work)
o	1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
o	1 garlic clove, minced
o	1/2 cup Breadcrumbs (Option: Gluten Free)

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pan on medium-low heat. Add the onions and sugar; cook until brown and sweet-approximately 20-30 minutes. Lower the heat if the onions are browning too quickly.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the meatloaf ingredients with the caramelized onions (including all those browned bits at the bottom of the pan!); Do not overmix.
Transfer the meatloaf mixture to an oiled or parchment-lined loaf pan. (I used a large soup spoon, patting the mixture down and into the corners of the pan. Use the back of the spoon to smooth the top of the loaf.) If desired, lightly sprinkle the top of the loaf with dried parsley.
Bake at 375 for 45-60 minutes or until the meatloaf is no longer pink in the center.
