Ingredients:
5 Cups grape juice
6 Cups sugar
1 Package Ball Fruit Jell Pectin (not MCP)
4 springs fresh rosemary, leaves finely chopped
Makes about 4 or 5 8 oz. jars.

Directions:
Wash and rinse jars, lids and bands.
Keep lids in pan of simmering water, until needed.
Keep jars in 250 degree oven, or hot water.
Put juice in 6 qt. pan.
Gradually stir in pectin and bring to full boil over
high heat.
Slowly add sugar stirring constantly.
Bring to full rolling boil and boil about 15 minutes,
or til thermometer reads 212 degrees (at 5000 ft.)
(If at different altitude, add 8 degrees to
temperature at which your water boils.)
Ladle jelly into jars, wipe rims, and add lids and
bands--finger tight.
Invert jars onto folded towel for several minutes
to heat lids.  Turn right side up and jars should
all seal.  (Canning in boiling water for 5 minutes
is the recommended practice, but I've never found
it necessary.)

Description: 
I love the addition of rosemary.  It gives it a wonderfully subtle flavor.  We use a juicer to juice the grapes and this jelly is delicious!
This recipe is adapted from the Ball Fruit Jell recipe that came with the pectin.
