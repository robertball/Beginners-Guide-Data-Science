Ingredients:
2 sweet onions, peeled and quartered
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons dark brown sugar, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder, or more to taste
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 (6 pound) Boston pork butt roast
13 fluid ounces ginger beer

Directions:
Arrange sweet onions in the bottom of a slow cooker.
Mix salt, brown sugar, paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl until seasonings are well mixed; rub all over pork roast. Place roast in the slow cooker, fat-side up. Brush any leftover seasonings mixture from the work surface into the slow cooker.
Cook on Low for 1 hour. Pour ginger beer into slow cooker. Continue cooking until roast is tender and pulls apart easily with a fork, 9 to 11 hours.

Description: 
This is a relaxed slow cooker recipe. I've never really measured ingredients out as I've gone, but the end result is absolutely amazing. I never even use BBQ sauce, but you can if you want. Feel free to play with the ingredients, more or less here and there, to suit the tastes of your family. And get ready for a whole lot of mmmmmmm.
