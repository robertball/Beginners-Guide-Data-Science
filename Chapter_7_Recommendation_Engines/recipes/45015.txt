Ingredients:
1 pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
4 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1 tablespoon corn syrup
1/3 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). On a lightly floured surface, roll out pie crusts, and set aside. In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice; set aside.
Combine 1/4 cup brown sugar, butter and corn syrup; spread in bottom of a 9 inch pie dish (glass or ceramic works best). Sprinkle with chopped pecans. Cover with one pie crust. In a small bowl, mix together 1/2 cup brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon.
Arrange half of the apples in pastry lined plate. Sprinkle with half the brown sugar mixture. Repeat layers. Cover with remaining pie crust, fold top edge under, and crimp. Cut a few slits in the top to vent steam.
Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until golden brown. Let stand 5 minutes. Loosen edge of pie, and carefully invert pie onto a serving dish. Serve warm.
