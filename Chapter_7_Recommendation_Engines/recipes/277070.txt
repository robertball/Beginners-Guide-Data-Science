Ingredients:
1 pound beef rib-eye steak, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 medium onion, sliced into petals
4 ounces sliced baby portobello mushrooms
1/2 green bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground mustard
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 hoagie rolls
4 slices Provolone cheese

Place steak in a bowl and add Worcestershire and soy sauce. Cover and refrigerate 4 hours to overnight. Remove from the refrigerator and let come to room temperature, about 30 minutes.
Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine onion, mushrooms, and bell pepper in a large bowl. Add olive oil, salt, ground mustard, and pepper; stir to coat.
Place hoagie rolls in the basket of the air fryer and cook until toasted, about 2 minutes. Transfer rolls to a plate.
Place steak in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 3 minutes. Stir and cook for 1 more minute. Transfer to a plate.
Add vegetable mix to the basket of the air fryer and cook 5 minutes. Stir and cook until softened, about 5 more minutes.
