Ingredients:
1 tablespoon instant coffee granules
3 cups white sugar
1 pinch salt
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
3 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup pecan halves, for decoration (optional)

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, stir together the instant coffee, white sugar and salt. Stir in the milk and corn syrup, and add the butter. Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface. Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla. Let cool to room temperature, or about 110 degrees F (45 degrees C).
When the mixture is cool, beat with a wooden spoon until it loses its gloss. Add nuts and chocolate chips and stir slightly to create a marbled effect. Pour into a buttered 8 inch square baking dish. Arrange pecan halves on the top if desired. Cool completely before cutting into pieces.

Description: 
This is an easy traditional fudge that is best made using a candy thermometer. It is a creamy coffee flavored fudge with a hint of chocolate and pecans swirled in. If you like fudge without nuts, simply leave them out.
