Ingredients:
3 slices bread, crusts removed, soaked in water
2 large ripe tomatoes
2 avocados
1 orange bell pepper (any color)
1/2 cucumber
1/2 onion
2 cloves garlic
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
Juice of 1 lemon (don't add it all at once, start out slow and add more at the end if you need it)
1-2 cups water

Directions:
Puree the vegetables (all should be chopped) in a blender then transfer to a bowl. Squeeze the water from the bread and wizz that in the blender, then add the oil, and blend again. Then add the salt, turmeric and lemon juice.
Put some of the vegetable puree back into the blender and blend it together, then add the mixture in the blender to the vegetable puree in the bowl.
Stir in as much of the water as you want to reach your preferred consistency. Correct the seasoning and chill before serving.
