Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/3 cup powdered sugar
2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 cup dark corn syrup
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 cup flaked coconut
1/4 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix flour, 3/4 cup butter, and powdered sugar together to form pastry. Press about 1 teaspoon of pastry firmly against the bottoms and sides of 48 ungreased mini muffin cups. Do not extend pastry over the rims. Refrigerate while making the filling.
Heat chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons butter in a 1-quart saucepan over low heat until melted. Remove from heat; stir in corn syrup and white sugar. Beat in eggs until filling is smooth.
Fill each tart shell 3/4 full with chocolate filling, about 1 teaspoon. Sprinkle coconut and pecans on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is mostly set and pastry is golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Lift out tarts with the tip of a knife; cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
I hope you like chocolate, because these tarts sure have some! Top with whipped topping. You can also add a slice of strawberry to each tart, but it's not necessary.
