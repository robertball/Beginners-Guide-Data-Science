1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell'sÂ® Condensed Tomato Soup (Regular or 25% Less Sodium)
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Thoroughly mix the beef, 1/2 cup of the soup, bread crumbs, egg, onion, Worcestershire sauce and black pepper. Put the mixture into a 13x9 inch baking pan and firmly shape into an 8x4 inch loaf.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour or until the meatloaf is cooked through. Remove the meatloaf with a pancake turner from the pan to a cutting board.
Heat 2 tablespoons of the pan drippings, the remaining soup and water in a 1 quart saucepan over medium-high heat until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Serve with the meatloaf.
