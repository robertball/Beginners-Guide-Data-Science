Ingredients:
2 tablespoons oil
2 (12 ounce) packages frozen broccoli
1 onion, chopped
1/2 clove garlic, minced
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 cups half-and-half
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
1 pinch ground paprika
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup milk
1/4 cup cooked quinoa
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add broccoli, onion, garlic and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in spinach and cook for 2 to 3 minutes longer, until spinach is wilted and onion is translucent. Transfer to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until blended; set aside.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Gradually whisk the half-and-half into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook and stir until the mixture is thick and smooth, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in Italian seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, salt, and pepper.
Add broccoli mixture, milk, and cooked quinoa to the saucepan; stir to combine. Add Cheddar cheese and cook until soup is heated through and cheese has melted, 3 to 5 minutes.

Came up with this spinach-broccoli soup on the fly when none of the recipes matched my ingredients and even my son who doesn't like soup said it was good.
