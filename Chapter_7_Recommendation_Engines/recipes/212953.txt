Ingredients:
2 salmon steaks
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons cooking oil, divided
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 tomatoes, diced
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Season both sides of the salmon steaks with salt and pepper.
Heat 2 tablespoons cooking oil in a skillet over medium heat. Briefly fry the salmon in hot oil until lightly cooked, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from skillet and set aside.
Add 1 tablespoon cooking oil to the skillet and allow to get hot before adding the onion and garlic; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir the diced tomatoes into the mixture and season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking until the moisture from the tomatoes makes a sauce, about 5 minutes more. Return the salmon to the skillet and allow to simmer in the sauce until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes. Stir the beaten egg into the sauce and stir until well integrated; serve hot.
