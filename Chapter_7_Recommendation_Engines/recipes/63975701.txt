Beef Ragout over Spaghetti Squash Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash
6 cloves garlic, unpeeled
¼ cup olive oil
1 carrot, washed and finely chopped
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 pound ground grassfed beef
3 cloves garlic, minced
¼-½ cups fresh basil, roughly chopped
2 tomatoes
3-4 roasted peppers

Directions:
Cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds and stringy pulp. Rub with olive oil, place each half face down on the baking sheet and place 3 cloves of garlic under each. Roast at 350 degrees for about 1/2 hour, or until a knife inserted into the squash comes out easily.
In a saucepan over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add onion and and carrot and saute 4-5 minutes, until onions are translucent and carrots are tender.
Meanwhile, cut tomatoes in half or fourths and put them in a food processor or blender with roasted red peppers and basil, pulse until the sauce reaches the texture you desire. I like it to be slightly chunky.
Add garlic and ground beef to the onion/carrot mixture in the pan. Season with salt and pepper and cook 4-5 minutes until the meat is lightly browned but still slightly pink. Add the chopped tomato and red pepper combination. Turn the heat to high and simmer rapidly for 10 minutes.
Once the squash is finished, scrape out the noodle-like insides with a fork, drizzle with olive oil or butter, and serve with the beef/bison ragout over top.
Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese or basil if desired.
