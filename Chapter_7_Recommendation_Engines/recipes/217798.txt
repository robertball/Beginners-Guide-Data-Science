Ingredients:
1 cup fresh basil leaves
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup pine nuts
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
4 cups mini penne pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup pine nuts
1 cup chopped asparagus
1/2 cup sliced zucchini
1/2 cup sliced Kalamata olives
1/2 cup diced roasted red pepper
1/2 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Combine the basil, garlic, 1/4 cup pine nuts, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup olive oil, and lemon juice in a food processor and blend until well combined and has the texture of fresh pesto; set aside.
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta in boiling water until cooked yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Transfer the pasta to a large bowl. Pour 1 tablespoon olive oil over the pasta and toss to coat; set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Roast the pine nuts in the skillet until lightly browned; remove to a plate and set aside. Add the asparagus, zucchini, Kalamata olives, roasted red pepper, and sun-dried tomatoes to the skillet; cook and stir until hot, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the pine nuts into the vegetable mixture. Add the pasta and about 1/4 cup of the pesto, or more to your liking, to the skillet and toss to combine. Serve in bowls topped with the grated Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This is a recipe you can serve hot or cold. A great side-dish or can be a full meal. My kids love this and it's always a hit. You could also add poached or grilled chicken. You can also freeze any leftover pesto for later use.
