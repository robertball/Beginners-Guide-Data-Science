Ingredients:
1 pound ziti pasta
1 pound ground beef
1 large sweet onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 ounce fresh basil, chopped
salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 (26 ounce) jar tomato and basil pasta sauce
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Italian cheese blend

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook ziti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine beef, onion, garlic, basil, salt, and pepper in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until beef is no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce and cook until thoroughly heated, about 5 minutes more.
Drain cooked pasta and add to the skillet. Toss to coat.
Combine sour cream and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Stir into pasta mixture in the skillet. Sprinkle Italian cheese blend over pasta mixture. Cover the skillet, reduce heat to medium, and cook until cheese melts, about 5 minutes more.
