Ingredients:
2 Kielbasa (16 oz links)
1 liter Ginger ale (less expensive brands provide stronger flavor)
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon whole allspice

Directions:
Slice kielbasa into 2 inch pieces. Brown the pieces over medium heat in large sauce pan. Add ginger ale, brown sugar and allspice. Stir to dissolve sugar. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and allow to simmer 1 hour. Transfer to serving platter or refrigerate. (Refrigerating in cooking liquid for a day heightens the flavor). Serve hot or cold. Great served with prepared horseradish.
