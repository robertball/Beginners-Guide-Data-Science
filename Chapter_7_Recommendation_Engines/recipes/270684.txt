Ingredients:
4 tablespoons vanilla custard powder
4 cups milk
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 fresh pineapple, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
water to cover
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 (12 ounce) loaves prepared pound cake, crusts trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch squares
1 cup heavy whipping cream, whipped

Directions:
Mix custard powder with a few tablespoons cold milk in a bowl.
Pour remaining milk into a saucepan, stir in sugar, and bring to a boil over medium heat, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Add custard mixture to hot milk, stirring continuously until liquid has thickened. Set aside to cool completely.
Place pineapple in a large heavy pan, cover with water, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove from heat and allow to cool, about 30 minutes. Strain the juice and set aside. Place pineapple pieces in a bowl.
Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Sprinkle over pineapple pieces and toss to coat.
Layer 1/2 the pound cake in a trifle bowl. Sprinkle with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the reserved pineapple juice. Spread 1/2 the pineapple pieces over the cake. Spoon 1/2 the cooled custard over pineapple. Repeat layers. Spread whipped cream on top and smooth out evenly. Cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 1 hour.
