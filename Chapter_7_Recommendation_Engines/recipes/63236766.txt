Ingredients:
Glaze:
3 tablespoons honey
3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon grated ginger root
2 teaspoons minced or pressed garlic
2 teaspoons olive oil
4-6 4-ounce tilapia fillets (or other favorite fish)
Creamy Dipping Sauce
6 ounces fat-free plain Greek yogurt
1 small clove garlic, minced or pressed
1/2 teaspoon grated ginger root
1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons chopped green onions
Juice of 1 small, juicy lime (about 2 tablespoons)
1 teaspoon lime zest
Sriracha sauce to taste (1/8-1/4 teaspoon will suit most tastes)
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
Optional: 1-2 teaspoons finely minced cilantro

Directions:
Whisk together the honey, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, garlic, and olive oil. Marinate the fish in the mixture for 20 minutes-1 hour.
While the fish is marinating, whisk together the creamy sauce ingredients. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
Heat a grill pan over medium heat and brush with vegetable oil or spray with non-stick cooking spray. Cook the fish for 4-6 minutes per side or until it flakes easily with a fork. Serve immediately with the dipping sauce alongside steamed veggies and brown rice.
