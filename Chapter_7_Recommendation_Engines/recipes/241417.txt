Ingredients:
salt to taste
1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Bring a 4-quart pot of salted water to a boil; add cauliflower and simmer until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain cauliflower, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.
Blend cauliflower and 1/4 cup cooking liquid in a blender until smooth, adding more water until desired consistency is reached. Add butter and pulse until incorporated; season with salt.

Description: 
This simple but surprisingly flavorful puree is a satisfying stand-in for mashed potatoes, and it couldn't be easier. There's no cream in it and only a teensy touch of butter, so it's good for anyone counting calories or carbs. It pleases the meat-and-potatoes eaters at my table, even though it contains neither.
