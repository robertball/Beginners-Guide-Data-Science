Ingredients:
19 1/2 ounces baking chocolate, grated
6 eggs
2 1/3 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups unsalted butter
1 1/8 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1/4 cup instant coffee granules
2 tablespoons water
7/8 cup heavy cream
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 2 to 3 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Whisk eggs and sugar together in a bowl. Stir in melted chocolate and butter.
Sift flour and cocoa powder together in another bowl; add to the chocolate mixture. Dissolve instant coffee in water and pour into the batter. Add heavy cream and walnuts; mix well. Pour into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.
