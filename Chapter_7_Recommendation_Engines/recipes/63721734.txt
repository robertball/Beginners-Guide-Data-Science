Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
1 sweet onion
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 orange bell pepper, chopped
2 5 oz. cans mild chilies
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups chicken broth
2 (14 ounce) cans great Northern beans, undrained

Directions:
In a large pot, boil chicken until cooked through enough to shred.  Set aside shredded chicken and saved chicken broth.
While chicken is cooking, saute the onion, red bell pepper, orange bell pepper, cans of chilies and garlic in a skillet.
Return the chicken, along with the ginger, salt, sage, cumin and white pepper.  Mix thoroughly.
In a separate small saucepan or skillet, melt butter or margarine over medium heat. Stir in flour to make a roux. Whisk in the chicken broth and mix all together. Stir this mixture into the sauteed chicken and vegetables.
Stir in the beans with can liquid, and simmer all over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked and heated through.
