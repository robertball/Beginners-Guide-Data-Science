Ingredients:
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup ground almonds
1/4 cup ground flax seeds
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup almond milk
2 bananas, mashed
1 egg
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Mix whole wheat flour, ground almonds, ground flax seeds, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl.
Whisk almond milk, bananas, egg, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Mix into the whole wheat flour mixture until batter is just combined.
Melt butter on a griddle over medium heat. Drop 1/3 cup batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
