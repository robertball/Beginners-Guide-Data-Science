Description: 
A quick, simple recipe utilizing all of New Jersey's favorite summer produce: tomatoes, peaches, and corn. Easily adjusted to suit your fancy in terms of sweet/spicy. A favorite in my house, where the saying goes 'the spicier the better,' and this salsa has the taste of sweet peaches in the background.
