Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter for greasing
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
4 large eggs
1 cup heavy cream
4 ounces finely crumbled blue cheese
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter six 1/2-cup ramekins.
Beat cream cheese in a bowl using an electric mixture until smooth. Beat in eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add cream, blue cheese, nutmeg, black pepper, and salt. Mix well.
Scoop mixture equally into prepared ramekins. Place filled ramekins into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour 1/2 inch of hot water into the bottom of the baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until souffles are golden brown and puffy, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from baking dish and let rest 5 to 10 minutes. Dry bottoms of ramekins before serving.

Description: 
The Oyster Bar in Bellingham, Washington serves a goat cheese souffle that inspired this dish. I prefer blue cheese, but any cheese will do. It's a smooth and creamy comfort food that I serve with soup or salad or just as a snack! No toast necessary!
