Ingredients:
1 large beet
2 cups mixed salad greens
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Place beet in a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until beet is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Drain and allow to cool.
Peel beet and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices. Cut out red hearts using a heart-shaped cookie cutter.
Place salad greens in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt. Add beet hearts to the salad and toss. Arrange a couple of red hearts on top of the salad for serving.

Description: 
The little red hearts are cut out of cooked beet to turn this simple salad into a lovely romantic Valentine's Day appetizer. In Italy, lettuce is usually only dressed with olive oil and salt, but you can of course use another dressing. Fresh mozzarella cubes make a nice addition.
