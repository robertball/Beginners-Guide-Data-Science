Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) container whole-milk ricotta cheese
1/4 cup white sugar
3 cups half and half
1 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon rose water (optional)
1 pinch saffron
1 tablespoon chopped blanched almonds
2 teaspoons chopped pistachio nuts

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Blend the ricotta cheese and 1/4 cup sugar together in a bowl with a hand mixer; divide the mixture between 12 muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Arrange the cheese balls onto a dessert platter.
While the cheese bakes, pour the half and half into a saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat; simmer 10 minutes. Stir 1 cup sugar, the cardamom, rose water, and saffron into the half and half and simmer another 2 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely. Drizzle the cooled mixture over the cheese balls. Sprinkle the almonds and pistachios over the cheese balls to serve.

Description: 
Ras Malai is cheese dumplings in cream sauce. This is a popular Indian dessert and takes a long time to prepare the traditional way. I came up with some shortcuts and ended up with this recipe which tastes exactly the same as traditional Ras Malai.
