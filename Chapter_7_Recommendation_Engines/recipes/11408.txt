Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup apricot preserves
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar for decoration

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cream the butter and sugar in a medium size mixing bowl. Mix flour, baking powder, salt, egg and vanilla extract into the butter-sugar mixture.  Cool dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
On a lightly floured surface roll dough out to 1/4 inch thick. Cut the dough into rounds with a round cookie cutter or glass. Using the tip of a teaspoon place a small drop of apricot preserves into the middle of the circle. Brush edges with water and fold the dough over so that the cookie is in the shape of a half moon; seal edges Arrange on ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown.  Dust the cookies with powdered sugar while still hot.

Description: 
These cookies have a great tart and sweet taste. These are not just a Christmas cookie, but they get asked for every year! You can substitute cranberry sauce for apricot preserve, or try doing half apricot and half cranberry, yum!
