Ingredients:
4 (6 inch) corn tortillas
cooking spray
1 small tomato, chopped
2  green onions, sliced

1 ½ cups shredded cooked chicken
¾ cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
⅓ cup sliced black olives

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray both sides of each tortilla with cooking spray; place on a baking sheet.
Bake tortillas in the preheated oven until crisp and lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
While tortillas are baking, combine tomato, green onions, lime juice, and cilantro in a bowl; set aside.
Mix cream cheese and chipotle pepper in a separate bowl until well blended. Remove tortillas from the oven. Spread mixture over tortillas; top with chicken and cheese.
Return tortillas to the oven and continue baking until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Top with the tomato mixture, olives, and sour cream.
