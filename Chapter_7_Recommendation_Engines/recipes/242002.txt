Description: 
A quick version of the 'green monster' juice drink made with a regular blender (to keep the pulp) and no-sugar-added peaches instead of apples. Using peaches ensures an accurate carb count (especially needed for diabetics). Keeping the pulp increases the nutritional values in this great early-morning drink for people who have trouble eating all their veggies.
