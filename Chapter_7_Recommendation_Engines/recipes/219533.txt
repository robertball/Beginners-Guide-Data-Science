Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
8 ounces mushrooms, sliced
1 (16 ounce) jar PaceÂ® Picante Sauce

4 cups medium egg noodles, cooked and drained
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Cook the beef in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat.
Add the mushrooms to the skillet and cook until the mushrooms are tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in the picante sauce and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Stir in the sour cream. Serve the beef mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle with the parsley.
