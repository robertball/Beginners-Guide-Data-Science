Description: 
A skillet version of classic fruit crisp, healthy enough for breakfast! We love to eat this for breakfast in the summer and fall when fruit is abundant. It is a nice alternative to oatmeal if you want to avoid milk. You can substitute butter for coconut oil use different types of fruit: apples, peaches, plums, or nectarines, peeled or unpeeled. Add apple juice if oats are not yet complete and mixture begins to dry out.
