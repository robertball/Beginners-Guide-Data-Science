Ingredients:
1/2 cup (packed) light brown sugar
1/2 cup unseasoned rice vinegar
1/3 cup hot chili paste
1/4 cup fish sauce
1/4 cup Sriracha
2 teaspoons finely grated peeled ginger
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2"-2" pieces

Directions:
Prepare grill for medium-high heat. Whisk brown sugar, vinegar, chili paste, fish sauce, Sriracha, and ginger in a large bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat. Thread 4 or 5 chicken pieces onto each skewer.
Transfer marinade to a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until reduced by half (about 1 cup), 7-10 minutes.
Grill chicken, turning and basting often with reduced marinade, until cooked through, 8-10 minutes.
