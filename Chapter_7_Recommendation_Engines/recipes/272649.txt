Description: 
A great way to use pesto besides just serving it on pasta! How boring does that get, right? This pesto egg salad can be made spicy by adding a splash of hot sauce. It's also amazing with finely chopped giardiniera (mixed vegetables). Serve on crackers, cocktail rye, or use to top a summer salad.
