Ingredients:
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 onions, chopped
2 cups chopped celery
1 cup chopped carrots
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 pound ground veal
1/2 pound chopped pork
3/4 pound mild Italian sausage
6 ounces pancetta bacon, diced
2 (14.5 ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes, with liquid
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1/2 cup whole milk
5 teaspoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley
5 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
5 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
salt and pepper to taste
1 pound fettuccini pasta
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat.  Saute onions, celery, carrots and garlic until tender, about 10 minutes.  Increase heat to high and add veal, pork, sausage and pancetta; cook until meats are evenly brown.
Stir in tomatoes, chicken broth, milk, parsley, basil and thyme.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 hours; stir occasionally, breaking up tomatoes with spoon as you stir.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Serve fettuccini topped with the sauce and Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
I have experimented with making several different ragu or bolognese sauces, and this is by far the best and most flavorful. It takes a while to make, but is well worth the effort, and keeps very well. It actually seems better the second or third time. Enjoy!
