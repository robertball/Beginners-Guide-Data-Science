French Onion Potatoes Recipe

https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 envelope French Onion Soup Mix
2 tablespoons Olive Oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon rosemary
1-2 Potatoes per person

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425. Line a 9x13 pan with foil.
Slice potatoes to 1/4 inch pieces. Combine all other ingredients in a plastic bag. Toss potatoes in the plastic bag until covered - make sure to separate out the slices so that they get evenly covered.
Spread potato slices evenly in the pan so that they are not overlapping. Bake for 40 minutes. Make sure to scrape off any big chunks of seasoning before serving or the potatoes will be too salty/onion-y.
I recommend Klondike Rose, a golden red skin pototo, but you could use any type.
