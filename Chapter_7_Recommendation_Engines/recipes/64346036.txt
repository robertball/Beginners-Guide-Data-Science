Ingredients:
2 tbsp all purpose flour ( or 14/16 tbsp whole wheat flour )
2 tbsp coconut flour
1/4 tsp baking powder
1 tbsp cocoa powder
3 tbsp +1/2 tbsp almond milk, divided
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
3 tbsp Nutella or chocolate spread

Directions:
In a bowl or oversized mug, combine flours, baking powder, and cocoa. Mix well. Add in the 3 tbsp of milk and vanilla, stirring with the dry ingredients. Add the Nutella and 1/2 tbsp milk, stirring until there are no chunks and the batter is smooth. Transfer to a mug  and place in the microwave for 1 minute and 30 seconds. Stop the time after one minute and let it sit for about 5 seconds then resume the time. Once it has finished cooking, use a clean spoon or toothpick to test it, inserting it into the center. Wait 2-4 minutes before eating but enjoy it warm.

Description: 
I created this recipe for a somewhat healthier version of an easy Nutella mug cake so I wouldn't use so much Nutella.
