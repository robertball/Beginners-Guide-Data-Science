Ingredients:
Brownie:
1 cup blanched almond meal
2 tbsp coconut flour
1/4 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 cup cocoa powder
2 tbsp coconut oil, melted
2 tbsp honey
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 egg
Caramel Layer:
10 large (preferably soft) medjool dates, pitted
3 tbsp boiling water
slightly less than 1/4 tsp sea salt
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/3 cup creamed coconut
Chocolate Layer:
1/2 cup dark chocolate or chips (I used Enjoy Life chocolate chips)
1 tbsp ghee or coconut oil (ghee makes it taste better though!)
1/8 tsp sea salt

Directions:
For the Brownies:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease a deep silicone muffin tin and set aside (If you don't have a silicone muffin pan, I suggest using paper liners so as to not have to wrestle with it to get your goodies out).
Blend almond meal and coconut flour.
Add in salt, cinnamon and cocoa and blend with a fork.
Stir in the coconut oil, honey, vanilla and egg. Blend until completely mixed.
Spoon into six or seven of the muffin tin compartments.
Bake for 13-15 minutes. Remove and cool completely. (I use the freezer for speedier cooling, just don't forget them in there.)
For the Caramel Layer:
Place dates and boiling water in a blender or food processor and blend until liquefied.
Add in remaining ingredients and blend until smooth.
Pour over cooled brownie layer and cool again.
For the Chocolate Layer:
In a double boiler or a small metal bowl placed over a small pot of gently simmering water, add the chocolate chips, ghee and salt.
Stir continuously until just melted.
Pour over cooled cups and spread around with your finger or a small spatula.
Cool completely before trying to remove.
