Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 cup onion, diced
3/4 cup sour cream
3 (14.5 ounce) cans French style green beans, drained
2 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup crumbled buttery round crackers
1 C. French Fried Onions
1 tablespoon butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute onions till they are golden. Stir in flour until smooth, and cook for one minute. Stir in the salt, sugar, and sour cream. Add green beans, and stir to coat.
Transfer the mixture to a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish. Fold in shredded cheese to the mixture saving some for the top. In a small bowl, toss together cracker crumbs, and remaining cruncy onions and remaining butter, and sprinkle over the cheese.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top is golden and cheese is bubbly.
