Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs fresh cod or haddock fillets
pinch of sea salt
pinch of pepper
1 small fennel bulb, julienned
1 small leek, julienned
1 small carrot, julienned
4 stalks broccolini, slice lengthwise
4 garlic cloves, crushed
1 1/2 tbs extra virgin olive oil
4 slices lemon
1/2 tsp fennel seeds, crushed
2 tbs white wine
chopped fresh parsley for garnish
parchment paper
aluminum foil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450*.
Cut up the fish into 4 equal servings, season with salt and pepper.
Cut parchment paper into 8 pieces, approximately twice the size of each piece of fish.  Stack two pieces of parchment on top of an equal size of aluminum foil.
On each stack of parchment/aluminum foil arrange a 1/4 of the vegetables and garlic, then place one piece of fish on top and drizzle with the olive oil.  Lay a slice of lemon on each fish and sprinkle with fennel seed. Splash with wine.
Fold the parchment and foil, crimping the edges to seal completely.
Place the packets on a large baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, until the parchment is puffed.  Cut open the packets, garnish with parsley and serve.
