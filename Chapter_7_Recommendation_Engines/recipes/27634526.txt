Ingredients:
1 orange
1 lemon
1/4 cup cranberry-flavored cognac
1/4 cup orange-flavored liqueur
1 bottle pink or regular champange, or sparkling white wine, well chilled
6-8 fresh cranberries
citrus strips

Directions:
With citrus stripper or veggie peeler, remove colored peel, not white pith, from orange and lemon in long thin strips.  Refrigerate orange and lemon for another use.
Combine peels, cranberry-flavored and ornage-flavored liqueurs in glass pitcher.  Cover and chill 2-6 hours.
Just before serving, tilt pitcher to one side and slowly pour champange.  Leave peels in pitcher for added flavor.
Place a cranberry in the bottom of each glass, if desired.  Pour punch into champange glasses.  Garnish with citrus strips tied into knots, if desired.
