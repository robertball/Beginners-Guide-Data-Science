Ingredients:
2 pounds lean beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 Tbsp butter
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/4 tsp paprika
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 cup beef stock
4 slices bacon
1 Tbsp worcestershire sauce
2 large onions, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
3 large red potatoes, chopped
2 clove garlic, crushed
6 oz tomato paste
1 1/2 cups Irish stout beer (such as GuinnessÂ®)
2 cups chopped carrot
1/4 head cabbage, chopped
1 sprig fresh thyme

Directions:
Warm your crock pot on high while doing the prep work and putting the stew in it. Take flour and place in gallon bag with meat, shake to coat and set aside.
Cut bacon up and fry in pan with mix of butter and oil. Remove bacon, save bacon fat in pan. Add meat and brown, add onions and saute with meat. Move meat, bacon and onions to crock pot. De-glaze hot pan with stout, beef stock, and worcestershire sauce, add to crock pot. Add all other ingredients and cook on low for 8-10 hours. Check the liquid level, I had to add a total of 2 more cups beef stock while it was stewing.
