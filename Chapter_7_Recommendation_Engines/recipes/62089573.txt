Ingredients:
5 strips bacon, diced
3 tbsp. reserved bacon drippings
2 lbs. ground chuck
1 1/2 c. diced onion
4 cloves crushed garlic
1 pickled jalepeno, seeded and finely diced
1 (28 oz.) can undrained diced tomatoes
1 1/2 c. canned chopped green chiles, drained
2 large baking potatos, peeled and cubed
1 envelope instant beefy onion soup mix
1 envelope chipotle taco seasoning
2 (14.5 oz.)cans sweet corn, undrained
2 (14.5 oz.)cans green beans, drained
1/2 c. chicken broth
1 tbsp. salt
2 tsp. pepper
sour cream (optional

Directions:
In large Dutch oven, cook bacon, when crispy removed from pot and set aside to drain.  With 3 tbsp of bacon drippings, saute onions and garlic and jalepeno for one minute, then add ground beef.  Cook until ground meat is browned.  Add remained of ingredients, stirring after each addition.  Cover pot and bring stew to a boil, reduce heat to low and continue cooking covered, stirring occasionally until potatoes are fork tender, about 30 mins.  Sprinkle reserved bacon bits on each serving with a dollop of sour cream and serve with crusty bread or fresh baked corn bread.

Description: 
This is a great easy, satisfying meal that was a staple when I was growing up. Make a large pot because it only gets better day after day.  This is an easier, quicker version of the traditional stew that calls for stew meat, which takes longer to cook.  If you have the time, try it with stew meat, it's delicious.  I hope it becomes one of you family favorites, like it is mine.
