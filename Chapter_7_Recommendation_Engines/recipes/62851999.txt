Ingredients:
Cooking spray
2 pounds beef short ribs, trimmed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups fat-free, less-sodium beef broth
1 cup cabernet sauvignon or other dry red wine
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 1/2 cups (1-inch) slices celery (about 2 stalks)
1 cup (1-inch) slices carrot (about 2 medium)
6 garlic cloves, sliced
2 (6-inch) rosemary sprigs
1 medium onion, cut into 8 wedges
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
4 cups hot cooked wide egg noodles
Chopped parsley (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300°.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Sprinkle ribs with salt and pepper. Add ribs to pan; cook for 8 minutes, browning on all sides. Remove from pan. Add beef broth to pan, scraping pan to loosen browned bits.
Combine broth, wine, and tomato paste in a medium bowl; stir with a whisk. Place ribs, celery, carrot, garlic, rosemary, and onion in a 13 x 9–inch baking dish coated with cooking spray. Pour broth mixture over rib mixture. Cover with foil; bake at 300° for 3 1/2 hours or until ribs are very tender.
Uncover dish; strain broth mixture through a sieve over a bowl, reserving liquid. Reserve ribs; discard remaining solids. Place a zip-top plastic bag inside a 2-cup glass measure. Pour reserved liquid into bag. Seal bag; carefully snip off 1 bottom corner of bag. Drain liquid into a small saucepan, stopping before fat layer reaches opening; discard fat.
Add flour to pan, stirring well with a whisk. Place pan over medium heat; bring to a boil, stirring constantly with a whisk. Reduce heat, and simmer 3 minutes or until thick, stirring constantly with a whisk. Serve sauce with ribs and noodles. Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired
