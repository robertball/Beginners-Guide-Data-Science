Ingredients:
2 quarts water
2 cups kosher salt
1 cup white sugar
2 gallons cold water
3 sprigs fresh rosemary, or more to taste
3 sprigs fresh thyme, or more to taste
1 tablespoon crushed garlic
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (16 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed

Directions:
Bring 2 quarts water to a boil in a large pot; stir kosher salt and white sugar into the water to dissolve completely. Remove from heat and let cool somewhat before transferring to a large food-safe container large enough to hold the brine and turkey, but small enough to fit in your refrigerator. Pour 2 gallons cold water into the container; add rosemary sprigs, thyme sprigs, garlic, Allspice, and black pepper.
Gently submerge turkey into the brine; refrigerate for 12 to 36 hours.
Remove turkey from the brine and rinse both inside and outside thoroughly. Discard brine.

Description: 
I love a brined turkey. When you think about cooking any poultry for more than two hours, you definitely want a bird that was packed in a saline solution or brined yourself. Never again will you have a dry turkey. The osmosis will make your bird tender and juicy. This recipe is good for turkeys between 12 and 22 pounds. Roast as desired.
