Title:
Grilled Pork Tenderloin - from The Ultimate Southern Living Cookbook Recipe

Ingredients:
1/2 c. peanut oil
1/3 c. soy sauce
1/4 c. red wine vinegar
3 T. lemon juice
2 T. Worcestershire sauce
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 T chopped fresh parsley
1 T. dry mustard
1 1/2 t pepper
2 (3/4 lb.) pork tenderloins

Directions:
Combine marinade ingredients; add tenderloins and marinate, turning several times to coat in a large baggie or covered container 4 - 5 hours or overnight. (I have an oval casserole dish that is deep enough to keep the meat submerged - put a saucer on top to weight them down.)
When ready to grill, drain marinade off tenderloins and place in a small saucepan.  Boil for 2-3 mins; pour 1/2 cup out for basting; save the rest to serve with the meat.
Grill over med. coals (300 - 350 degrees) about 16 min or until meat thermometer inserted in thickest part registers 160 degrees, basting occasionally, turning once.  Let stand 5-10 min before slicing.
Spoon a tsp or so of the boiled marinade over each serving.  Enjoy!

Description: 
This is really really good.  I don't think I have ever added the parsley because I never have it, and don't think I added dried.  Not sure about this.
