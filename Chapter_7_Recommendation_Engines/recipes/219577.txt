Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 ¼ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 large onion, chopped
1 ½ cups Swanson(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Chicken Broth
1 (8 ounce) jar pesto sauce
1 (7 ounce) package fresh baby spinach
½ (16 ounce) box fettuccine, cooked and drained
¼ cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 10 minutes or until well browned on both sides. Remove the chicken from the skillet.
Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion and cook for 3 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in the broth and pesto sauce. Add the spinach. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the spinach is wilted.
Stir in the fettuccine. Return the chicken to the skillet. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Sprinkle with the cheese, if desired.
