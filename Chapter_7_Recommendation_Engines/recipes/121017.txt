Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
4 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups diced peeled pears

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, ginger, baking soda and nutmeg; set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat the sugar, oil and butter. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened (batter will be stiff). Stir in pears. Pour into two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.

Description: 
My friends and family thoroughly enjoy this old-fashioned bread. The mellow flavor of pears is a refreshing change of pace from more traditional apples.
