Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
2 1/4 cups packed brown sugar
1 cup sugar
5 eggs
3 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 cup finely chopped pecans
confectioners' sugar
Fresh fruit

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter. Gradually beat in sugars until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Stir in vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; add to the creamed mixture alternately with milk. Beat on low speed just until blended. Fold in pecans. Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. tube pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve with fruit if desired.

Description: 
My state is known for the delicious pecans it produces, so this recipe definitely represents Georgia. The pecan flavor comes through nicely in this cake.
