Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup honey
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 egg, beaten
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped almonds (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Beat shortening, honey, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add egg and vanilla extract; beat until light and fluffy.
Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; stir into honey mixture until just incorporated and dough comes together. Fold chocolate chips and almonds into dough. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges just begin to brown, 12 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
My grandmother would send a huge box of cookies and candies to us every Christmas when I was a child. She always included these cookies because they were my dad's favorite (mine too). I am allergic to walnuts so if I decide to add nuts I use almonds. Now my daughter and I enjoy making them together.
