Ingredients:
2 cups butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups crushed salted potato chips

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets.
Mash the butter, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until creamy and well combined; mix in the flour a little at a time. Gently fold in the potato chips. Drop dough onto the prepared baking sheets by teaspoonful.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove cookies from sheets immediately and cool on wire racks.
