Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
2 cups sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
5 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
FROSTING:
1/2 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
4 cups confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons milk
Food coloring

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; add to the creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or until easy to handle. On a lightly floured surface, roll out to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with 2-1/2-in. cookie cutters dipped in flour. Using a floured spatula, place 1 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.
In a mixing bowl, cream butter, sugar, vanilla and enough milk to achieve spreading consistency. Add food coloring if desired. Frost the cookies.

Description: 
This is an old-fashioned recipe that was given to me by a friend's grandmother. You can easily tint the frosting with food coloring for a festive look throughout the year.
