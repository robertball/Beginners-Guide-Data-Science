Ingredients:
1 Cup Coffee
1 Cup Water
1/2 Cup applesauce
2 Teaspoons Vanilla
2 Teaspoons Lemon Juice
2 Teaspoons Ground Flax Seed
2 1/2 Cups whole spelt Flour
1 Cup Dutch-processed Cocoa
1 1/2 Cups Sugar
1 Teaspoon Salt
2 Teaspoons Baking Powder
1 Teaspoon Baking Soda

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 325 degrees.
Prepare cake pans using parchment paper cut to fit
Mix the wet ingredients in a separate mixing bowl from the dry before you join them. We don't want to activate the baking soda and powder too quickly. So in a small mixing bowl mix together the coffee, water, applesauce, vanilla, lemon juice and the ground flax and whisk together.
In a large mixing bowl, mix together the flour, cocoa, sugar, salt, baking powder and soda until well incorporated.
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir with a rubber spatula, slowly stirring, scraping the sides and mashing the lumps out as you stir. Stir until the batter is pretty much free of lumps.
Pour equal amounts of the batter into cake pans. Or if making cupcakes, pour cupcake tins 3/4 the way full. Place into oven immediately.
Cupcakes usually take about 15 to 20 minutes to cook. The pans take about 25 to 35 minutes. Don't open the oven door until after the first 25 minutes of cooking, but after that stick a toothpick in the middle and check to see if it comes out clean. Keep checking every 5 minutes and don't take them out until the toothpick comes out clean. Let cake cool completely before icing.
