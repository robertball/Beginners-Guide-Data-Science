Description: 
I threw this together one night after I realized my saucepan wasn't big enough for my Thai Chicken, and I needed to quickly transfer it into a large pot. I added more ingredients then slow cooked it for a bit longer. Was a big hit with my Filipino friends. Bear in mind, the different types of vegetables can be lessened, increased, or omitted, based on preference. Serve over white rice.
