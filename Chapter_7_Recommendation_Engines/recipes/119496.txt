In a 1-qt. microwave-safe dish, heat the milk, uncovered, on high for 3 minutes or until hot (do not boil). With an electric mixer, beat in sugar, eggs, salt and vanilla. Pour into six ungreased 4-oz. microwave-safe custard cups. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 5 to 5-1/2 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
