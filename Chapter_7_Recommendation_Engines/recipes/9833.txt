Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 2/3 cups vanilla baking chips
4 ounces macadamia nuts, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
In a large mixer bowl, beat butter and sugar until creamy. Add eggs and vanilla extract; beat until light and fluffy.
In a separate bowl, stir together flour, baking soda and salt; gradually  blend into butter mixture.
Stir in vanilla chips, and macadamia nuts. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake for 9 minutes. (Do not overbake; cookies will be soft. They will puff while baking; flatten upon cooling.) Cool slightly, remove from cookie sheet to wire rack. Cool completely.
