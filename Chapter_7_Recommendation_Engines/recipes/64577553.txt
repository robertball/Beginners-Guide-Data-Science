Ingredients:
6 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla extract (don't sweat it if you don't have this)
1 Tbsp of sugar (this can be left out too)
3/4 cup milk

Directions:
Dump semi-sweet chocolate chips, vanilla, sugar and egg in blender
Bring milk to boil
Pour boiling milk into blender (don't worry, no need to drizzle, just dump it in there)
Cover blender and blend on high for one minute
Pour into individual small cups or bowls or martini glasses (get creative)
Refrigerate for two hours or more until they are set nice and firm (overnight is fine... you may want to cover with foil if you go overnight)

Description: 
Real simple and fancy dessert. All you need is five ingredients... really only three if you want to dial it back. Note, this recipe requires a blender... may not work after EMP or zombie apocalypse.
