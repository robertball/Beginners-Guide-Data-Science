Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash
1 tablespoon olive oil, unsalted butter or ghee
2 chicken breasts, boneless and skinless
2 cups broccoli, florets
2 cloves garlic, minced
½ cup heavy coconut cream, canned
2 tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon sea salt, divided
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper, divided

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.
Take the spaghetti squash and using a metal skewer poke about 10 holes in it.
Line a baking sheet with foil or parchments (just for easy cleanup but not necessary) and place squash then cook for 45 minutes.
Let cool, slice in half then remove seeds with a spoon then fork out the threads to create your spaghetti and set aside.
Slice the chicken into slices or cube.
Heat a large sauté pan over medium heat.
Add in oil, butter or ghee.  Once hot and melted add in chicken.  Season with 1/2 teaspoon sea salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Cook for about 7 minutes tossing to brown all sides.  Add in broccoli florets and garlic.  Sauté for another 5 minutes.
Add in coconut cream, butter, basil, parsley, thyme, red pepper flakes, 1/4 teaspoon sea salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  Toss around.
Add in spaghetti squash to the pan and heat through. Enjoy!

Description: 
I love my one-pot Paleo comfort meals!  To make the spaghettis squash is so easy.  Just poke about 10-15 holes by using a metal skewer then roast.  I also use my Le Creuset Braising pan for so many great meals and it goes from the stove to the table!  How amazing is that?
