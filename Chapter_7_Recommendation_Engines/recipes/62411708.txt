Ingredients:
1 package Quinoa elbow noodles
1.5 liter Water
1 can cream of Mushroom soup (if possible, skip campbells)
8 oz Mushrooms, sliced
4 oz Spinach (3 or 4 generous handfuls)
2 tsp Thyme
2-3 tsp Garlic, minced (the pre-minced garlic at the store is a huge timesaver)
8 oz Tempeh, broken apart by hand
1-2 tsp Tamari soy sauce
½ large Onion, chopped into small pieces (half inch x half inch)
1 generous Tbsp Mayo
1 Tbsp Mustard (spicy brown or Dijon taste great in this)
2 Tbsp Oil of your choosing (olive oil, butter, perhaps a mix)
A splash of white wine (optional)
½ cup milk (almond milk, rice milk, goat/cow milk  your pick)
Garnish with parmesan cheese and your favorite green herb
Salt, black pepper and red pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Bring water to a boil, add quinoa noodles then reduce heat to medium. Stir noodles constantly for their first two minutes in hot water so that they don’t stick together. Continue to stir occasionally until the noodles are finished cooking. Drain the noodles, add cool water (to stop cooking), then drain the water again and set aside.
Put 2 Tbsp oil and about 2 Tbsp water in large pan or wok; add sliced mushrooms, minced garlic and thyme. Add a bit of salt. Saute over low-medium heat for 5-6 minutes. Place cooked mushrooms and spices into the largest mixing bowl you own. Place the same wok or pan back on the stovetop (unwashed so it still has all the garlic and thyme flavors) to cook the tempeh. Crumble in the tempeh, once again using low-medium heat, and add tamari. Cook for 5-7 minutes; place cooked tempeh in large bowl with mushrooms.
Fold in the spinach with the hot contents in the large bowl so that they reduce in size. Add eggs, mayo, mustard, wine, cream of mushroom, raw onions, and mix; then add noodles, salt and pepper and mix some more. Add milk so it’s nice and liquidy. Pour all of this into a casserole dish, cover and put into oven for 30-35 minutes. Garnish with parmesan and some of your favorite green herb (for color). Let it cool, then enjoy!!
