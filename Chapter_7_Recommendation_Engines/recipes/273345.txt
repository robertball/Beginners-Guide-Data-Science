Ingredients:
1 (3.5 ounce) package microwave popcorn
1 (13 ounce) package crunchy cheese puffs (such as Cheetos®)
1 (8 ounce) package nacho cheese-flavored corn chips (such as Doritos®)
1/2 cup pretzels
1 (2 ounce) package mini pepperoni slices, or to taste (optional)
1 tablespoon bacon bits, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch salt (optional)

Directions:
Place packaged popcorn in the microwave; cook on high until popping begins to slow down, about 2 1/2 minutes.
Mix 1 cup cheese puffs, 1 cup corn chips, and pretzels together in a large snack bowl using your hands. Pour popped popcorn into the bowl and mix once more. Mix in pepperoni and bacon bits lightly, making sure they don't pile at the bottom of the bowl. Season with salt.
