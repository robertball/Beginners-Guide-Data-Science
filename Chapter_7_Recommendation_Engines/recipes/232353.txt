Ingredients:
2 cups chopped tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese
2 cucumbers, chopped
1 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 cup chopped red onion
1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
2 cups shredded cooked chicken
1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing

Directions:
Mix tomatoes, Cheddar cheese, cucumbers, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, red onion, black olives, and Italian seasoning together in a large bowl.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and run under cold water.
Toss spaghetti with tomato mixture; fold in chicken. Pour salad dressing over salad; toss to coat. Refrigerate until flavors have blended, about 2 hours.
