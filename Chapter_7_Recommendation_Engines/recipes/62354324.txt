Ingredients:
2/3 (16 ounce) package dried thin spaghetti
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into strips
salt and pepper to taste
2 clovs garlic
1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1 bunch slender asparagus spears, trimmed, cut on diagonal into 1-inch pieces
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
juice of 1/2 lemon

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente, about 6-7 minutes. Drain, and set aside.
Warm 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic, saute until lightly browned.  Stir in chicken, cook until chicken is mostly cooked , about 5 minutes. Remove chicken to paper towels.
Pour chicken broth into the skillet. Then stir in asparagus,  salt, and pepper. Cover, and steam until the asparagus is just tender, about 4- 5 minutes. Squeeze in lemon juice.  Return chicken to the skillet, and warm through.
Stir chicken mixture into pasta, and mix well. Let sit about 5 minutes. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, stir again, then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
