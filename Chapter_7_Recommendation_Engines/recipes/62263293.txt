Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
4 deli slices (or equivalent) Pepperjack cheese
1 fresh jalapeno, sliced
Coating:
1/2 c. Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 c. grated parmesan/romano blend cheese
1 t. chili powder
1/4 t. salt
1/2 t. cumin
1/4 t. black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
Mix coating ingredients together; set aside.
Slice each breast lengthwise, but not all the way through (like a hot dog bun).
Place pepperjack cheese inside the chicken (not more than one deli slice per breast).
Close the flap so the chicken looks as it did before you sliced into it and roll the chicken in the coating.
Place coated chicken in an 8x8" pan or pie dish.
Top chicken with jalapeno slices and bake for 20 minutes.
