Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground beef
2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
4 ounces cooked, cubed chicken breast meat
1 tomato, seeded and diced
1 (4 ounce) can mushroom stems and pieces, drained
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced ripe olives, drained
3/4 cup spaghetti sauce
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 frozen double pie crust, thawed
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened - divided
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed - divided
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook and stir ground beef and onion in a skillet over medium heat until the meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain grease.
Combine ground beef mixture, chicken, tomato, mushrooms, and ripe olives in a bowl. Stir spaghetti sauce into ground beef mixture. Lightly mix mozzarella, sharp Cheddar, and Parmesan cheeses into the filling.
Place a pie crust flat onto a work surface; spread with half the cream cheese, leaving an edge about 1/2-inch deep without cream cheese. Spoon half the filling over cream cheese. Fold the crust over the filling to make a large half moon-shaped calzone; press the edges together with a fork. Cut several slits in the top of the calzone to vent steam. Repeat with second crust and remaining filling. Place calzones onto a baking sheet. Brush tops with olive oil.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is hot, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle tops with Italian seasoning; return to oven and bake until crusts are lightly golden brown, about 5 more minutes. Let calzones stand for 5 minutes before cutting into servings.

I think you could substitute anything, just keep the liquid down. My tomatoes should have been seeded and patted dry.
