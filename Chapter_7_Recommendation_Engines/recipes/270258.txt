1/2 cup cornmeal
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)

2 tablespoons plain yogurt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups grated zucchini
1 cup grated carrots
1 cup corn kernels
1/3 cup minced onion
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Mix flour, cornmeal, Cheddar cheese, egg, yogurt, baking powder, salt, and pepper together. Add zucchini, carrots, corn, and onion.
Coat the bottom of a large frying pan with oil. Heat over medium heat. Place spoonfuls of mixture into the hot pan, gently pressing down each fritter. Cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.

Description: 
With all the zucchini I have fresh and frozen, this is my favorite way to eat it for breakfast. It's also great for the kids to eat as a snack, cold right out of the refrigerator (no need for plate or silverware).
