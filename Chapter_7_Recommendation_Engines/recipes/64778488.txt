Ingredients:
1/2c butter, unsalted preferably*
2c heavy cream
Pinch of nutmeg
1/8t salt*
1c shredded Parmesan
2T flour**
*If using salted butter, no additional salt is required
**If adding directly to pasta, decrease to 1/2T flour & increase salt to 1/4t
This is the recipe that lead me to my variation:
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/26249/alfredo-mostaccioli/

Directions:
Place butter in pan over low heat.  Once butter has melted enough to cover bottom, add the cream & nutmeg.  Stir as the mixture heats.  Once hot, very, very, very slowly add Parmesan a small, small, small amount at a time.  After all cheese is added, combine 1T cold water & 1T flour.  Add a small amount of the sauce to mixture; then, while constantly stirring, return to pot & stir till thickened.  Let stand five minutes before using.
This makes enough sauce for 1/2# fettuccine, 1 1/2c.  If using another pasta, like spaghetti, you'll want to cook more than a half pound, 3/4#,  because the sauce goes farther with a thinner noodle.
ManassasMa: Given this SAUCE tossed over pasta, you can decide about your accompaniments (chicken, beef, seafood, vegetables, etc.). Add whatever you like (cooked onions, peppers, peas, corn, carrots, zucchini; cooked beef, poultry, seafood or whatever) to your PASTA. If you feel like it, add (fresh is preferred, but dried is OK, too) Tarragon, Dill, Marjoram, Basil, Oregano, or Cilantro. Think about incorporating bacon and/or one or more "shakes" (approx 1T) of Worcester Sauce and/or Hot Sauce and/or prepared Horseradish) into the SAUCE. Use ANY pasta of your choice. IMO, the "thicker ones" (e.g., rigatoni, rotini, gremeli, penne, etc.) are preferred (they're more prone to absorbing the SAUCE, as well as the flavor(s)).
reeree818:   I modified it somewhat. Instead of boiling the pasta and making the sauce seperate, I used 2 cups of water and 1 cup of 2% milk, added the butter and parsley, left out the salt. I brought the mixture to a boil, then added 1/2 box of no.9 spegetti. I boiled that till the liquid was reduced by 1/2, took if off the heat, then added the parmesian cheese. I let it stand till all the liquid was absorbed by the pasta, we each added the salt to taste and it was great!!!!

Description: 
'Worth the calories.  Placing spoonfuls of refrigerator-cold, only cold, alfredo in the middle layer of lasagna is magic.  As it bakes, it gently melts, doesn't separate.
