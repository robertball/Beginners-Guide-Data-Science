Ingredients:
1/2 cup finely diced celery
1 1/2 cup thinly sliced leeks
2-3 large shallots (minced)
3 Tbsp vegetable or olive oil
5 Tbsp butter
2/3 cup flour (approximately)
4 cups chicken stock
2 cups heavy cream
16 oz cream cheese (cut into 1-2" cubes)
1/2 tsp garlic powder (to taste)
1/2 tsp white pepper (to taste)
Optional ingredients: after soup is blended, add 1/2-1 cup diced ham or blistered diced tomatoes.

Directions:
Sweat celery, leeks, and shallots in oil until very soft (~15 minutes).
Add chicken stock & bring to boil
In a separate saute pan melt butter and whisk in flour to make a smooth paste.  Cook together approximately 5 minutes until mixture turns nutty color.  Set aside.
Add heavy cream to chicken stock mixture & return to boiling point.  Add cream cheese (reducing heat slightly).  Stir constantly until cream cheese is melted.
While stirring constantly, add ~ 1/2 butter-flour mixture into soup; continue stirring & check for thickness.  If thicker soup is desired, add remaining butter-flour mixture.
Using an immersion blender, blend all ingredients together until smooth.
