Ingredients:
200g self-raising flour, sifted.
100g golden caster sugar.
100ml sunflower oil.
75ml milk.
1 large egg.
50g good quality milk/dark chocolate, chopped.
1 heaped tablespoon good quality mincemeat.
50g good quality white chocolate, chopped.
50g fresh (or dried) cranberries.

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5 and put 24 mini-muffin cases inside a mini-muffin tin.
Mix the flour and sugar in a bowl, then make a well in the centre. Whisk together the oil, milk and egg and slowly pour into the well, stirring gently. Divide this mixture between two bowls.
In one bowl, add the milk/dark chocolate and mincemeat. Add the white chocolate and cranberries to the other bowl. Stir both bowls gently.
Divide the two mixtures among the mini-muffin cases and bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown and risen.
Remove the muffins to a wire rack and serve warm.
