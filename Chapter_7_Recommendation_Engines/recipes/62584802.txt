Ingredients:
Dough:
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup semolina flour
* 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small cubes
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/4 cup shortening
* 1 egg, beaten with 1 tablespoon water, for egg wash
* Confectioners' sugar (about 1/2 cup)
Filling:
* 1 cup whole milk
* 1/4 cup semolina flour
* 1 cup ricotta cheese
* 1 egg
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped mixed candied orange and lemon bits
* Ground cinnamon, for dusting
* 2 nonstick baking sheets

Directions:
n a medium saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer. Whisk in the semolina flour and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. If it forms lumps as it cooks, whisk until smooth. Transfer the milk and flour mixture to a bowl to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir in the ricotta, the egg, sugar. Add the candied orange and lemon bits and sift a dusting of cinnamon over the surface. Stir to blend. Taste for seasoning and refrigerate until ready to use.
Remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide in half. Flour a flat surface and roll 1 of the halves into a rectangle about 14 inches by 24 inches. The shorter end of the rectangle should be close to you. The dough should feel very thin. The thinner the better! Brush the entire rectangle with a layer of the shortening. Sprinkle it with an even dusting of confectioners sugar. Gently and evenly roll it up into itself like a jelly sponge roll. Roll carefully, taking care that it rolls up very tightly. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Use a sharp knife to cut the roll into 1 to 1 1/2-inch thick pieces. Repeat the same process with the other half of the dough.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Description: 
In a large bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, the semolina flour and salt. Use your fingers to work the butter into the dough until it forms pea-like balls. Alternatively, sift the dry ingredients into the food processor and pulse the butter into the mixture until it is blended and relatively smooth. Work the water in with your fingers (or in the mixer). Turn the dough out onto a flat surface and roll it into a ball. Wrap it in plastic wrap and press it down. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
