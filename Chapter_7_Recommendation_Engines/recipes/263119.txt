Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1 tablespoon seasoned salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon lemon pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 eggs
1/4 cup oil
1 pound tilapia fillets, cut into chunks
24 corn tortillas
Chipotle Salsa:
1/2 (8 ounce) bottle ranch dressing, or to taste
1/4 cup hot chunky salsa
1/2 lime, juiced
1 canned chipotle chile, thinly sliced
1 small head shredded cabbage, or to taste

Directions:
Place 1/2 cup flour in a small bowl. Combine remaining flour with panko bread crumbs, seasoned salt, garlic powder, lemon pepper, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne pepper in a shallow bowl. Whisk eggs in a separate small bowl.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Roll tilapia in flour, dip in the egg mixture, roll in the panko-flour mixture, and place in the hot oil. Fry until light brown, about 3 minutes per side. Place on a paper towel-lined plate.
Heat tortillas in a separate skillet over medium-low heat.
Combine ranch dressing, salsa, lime, and chipotle chile in a small bowl for the salsa.
Divide tilapia over the warmed tortillas and serve with salsa and cabbage.
