Description: 
This is a must make Holiday stuffing! This, my sister's recipe, uses sausage (use high quality like Bob Evans), boxed mix, pumpernickel, parsley, and lots of other herbs.  I always double/triple the recipe because it dissapears so fast! It actually feeds fewer than 12 since everyone gets 2nds and 3rds.
