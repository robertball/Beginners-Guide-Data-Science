Ingredients:
1 large turnip, peeled and cubed
2 tablespoons butter
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper
2 large apples - peeled, cored, and diced
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 pinch ground cinnamon
Topping:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch casserole dish.
Place turnip into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl.
Mash turnip, 2 tablespoons butter, salt, and pepper together until smooth.
Toss apples with 2 tablespoons brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.
Spread half the turnip mixture into the prepared casserole dish; top with half the apples. Repeat with remaining turnip mixture and apple mixture.
Mix flour, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 2 tablespoons softened butter by hand in a bowl until mixture is an evenly coarse meal-texture; sprinkle over casserole.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and bubbling, about 1 hour.
