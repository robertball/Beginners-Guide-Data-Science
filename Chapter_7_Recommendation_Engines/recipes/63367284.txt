Ingredients:
•	5 oz honey
•	4 oz sugar
•	3 ounces pine nuts, chopped
•	3 oz walnuts, chopped
•	3 oz almonds, chopped
•	3 oz candied pineapple, chopped
•	3 oz candied ginger, chopped
•	3 oz dried dates, chopped
•	2 oz cocoa powder (70%)
•	1/3 tsp nutmeg)
•	1/2 tsp ground coriander
•	1/2 tsp all spice
•	confectioner's sugar (powdered sugar)

Directions:
1.	Put the honey and sugar into a pan and stir over a gentle heat, until the sugar is dissolved.
2.	Bring to a boil and let it gently boil until the mixture reaches the "soft ball" stage (238F). A little of the mixture should form a soft ball when dropped into a cup of cold water Do not over boil.
3.	Remove the pan from the heat and stir nuts, pineapple, ginger, cocoa, nutmeg, coriander, and all spice into the honey syrup. It will be very stiff.
4.	Press the mixture into 8-9" pan with a removable bottom. I use rice paper and line sides.
5.	Bake for 25 minutes at 300F.
6.	Remove to a cooling rack.
7.	Remove the panforte from the pan.
8.	Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.
