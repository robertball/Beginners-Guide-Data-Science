Ingredients:
1 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
8 chicken thighs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a small bowl, stir together the orange juice, soy sauce, onion soup mix and garlic powder; set aside. Rinse chicken, and pat dry. Place chicken thighs into a 9x13 inch glass baking dish. Pour the orange juice mixture over.
Bake, uncovered, for 1 hour and 30 minutes in the preheated oven, basting every half hour. If using boneless chicken, reduce cooking time to 1 hour.

Description: 
I got this recipe from a co-worker. This has to be one of the easiest recipes ever. Chicken is roasted in a flavorful orange sauce. It is great with chicken thighs or breasts, bone-in or not. You can't go wrong!
