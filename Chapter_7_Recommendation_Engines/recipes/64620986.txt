Description: 
Recipe from the Gastroparesis-Friendly Kitchen. Many gastroparesis patients avoid berries due to the seeds and skins. The strawberry juice drinks used in this recipe are a great alternative as
they are pulp-free. This low-fat, low-fiber “recipe” has about 7 grams of protein and provides a significant amount of vitamins B6, B12 and C. Best of all, it’s really tasty.
