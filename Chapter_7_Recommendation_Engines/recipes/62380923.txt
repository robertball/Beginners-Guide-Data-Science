Ingredients:
4 hothouse cucumbers, thinly sliced
2 sweet bell peppers julienne
4 cups plain whole milk yogurt
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar
1/2 to 1 cup freshly chopped dill
2 tsp black pepper
3 tsp salt

Directions:
Slice cucumbers and sweet pepper and let drain for four hours so most of the liquid comes out.
Sieve yogurt in a paper towel for four hours to get most of the liquid out.
Mix in a bowl your cucumbers, sweet peppers, yogurt, sour cream, vinegar, and black pepper. Finish by mixing in at least a 1/2 cup of fresh dill, add more if you like! Chill in fridge until ready to serve.
