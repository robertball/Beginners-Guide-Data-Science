Ingredients:
1/4 cup mild olive oil
4 shallots
1 mild red chile pepper, seeds removed, or to taste
3 large cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons shrimp paste
1 2-inch piece fresh lemongrass
1 2-inch piece fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
3/4 cup coconut milk, or as needed
1/3 cup palm sugar
4 kaffir lime leaves
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
2 teaspoons sea salt, or to taste
2 teaspoons ground white pepper
2 1/4 pounds beef sirloin, cubed

Directions:
Blend olive oil, shallots, chile pepper, garlic, shrimp paste, lemon grass, ginger root, and turmeric together in the bowl of a food processor until smooth paste forms, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Heat paste in a large saucepan over medium heat until very fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add coconut milk, palm sugar, kaffir lime leaves, cinnamon, cloves, sea salt, and white pepper. Bring mixture to a boil and cook until thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir in beef; reduce heat to gentle simmer. Cook mixture until beef is tender and sauce is thick, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Remove kaffir lime leaves to serve.
