Ingredients:
14 ounces uncooked rotini pasta
2 cucumbers, chopped
1/2 onion, finely chopped
10 cherry tomatoes, quartered
3/4 cup pitted black olives, sliced
1 cup Italian-style salad dressing

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the rotini, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and cool by running cold water over the pasta in a colander set in the sink.
Combine cooked and cooled pasta with the cucumbers, onion, tomatoes, and olives in a large bowl. Pour the Italian dressing over the salad and stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate for at least two hours before serving.

Description: 
Great for brunch, luncheons, or whatever. Easy and quick to make. I find that this salad is always popular at get-togethers and usually disappears rather quickly...
