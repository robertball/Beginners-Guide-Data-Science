Ingredients:
4 cups 1% milk
2 cups steel-cut oats
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 ripe bananas, mashed
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup raisins, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring milk to a boil in a saucepan; immediately reduce heat to medium-low. Stir oats and vanilla into the milk. Stirring occasionally, cook at a simmer until the oats are soft, about 20 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly.
Mix bananas, eggs, and applesauce in a large bowl. Mix baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl; stir into the banana mixture. Add oats mixture to the bowl; stir. Fold raisins through the oat mixture; pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover dish with plastic wrap; refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Remove plastic wrap from baking dish and bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 45 to 60 minutes.

Description: 
Breakfasts have always been a challenge for me, so I created this recipe as a quick and portable way to have healthy breakfasts all week. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Feel free to experiment with different dried fruits and flavorings to your taste. I imagine that adding quinoa, hemp protein, flax seed or other nutritional supplements would taste great.
