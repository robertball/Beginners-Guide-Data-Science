Ingredients:
2 dried hot peppers (about 2.5 inches long)
1 Tbsp Mexican oregano
2 tsp smoked salt
2 tsp cumin seeds
3/4 tsp cane sugar
1/2 tsp multicolored peppercorns
2 cloves garlic
2 Tbsp New Mexico chile powder
2 Tbsp smoked paprika
2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
1 Tbsp water
1 and 1/2 pounds ground turkey breast

Directions:
In a mortar, add the dried hot peppers. Grind them with the pestle until they have broken into medium sized pieces. Add oregano, salt, cumin seeds, sugar, and peppercorns. Grind into a rough powder. Add garlic and continue to grind until a paste forms. Using a wooden spoon, mix the chile powder and the smoked paprika into the paste. While stirring the paste, add the vinegar and the water. Mix well.
In a large bowl, add the ground turkey. Using food-grade gloves on your hands, mix the seasoning paste into the meat until well combined.
Allow to rest in the refrigerator at least one hour before use.
My note: I've made this using dried Calabrese peppers as well as dried Thai red peppers with excellent results. A friend used dried cayenne and he said the taste is very good. Therefore, it seems any hot pepper will work.
Baking Nana advised me to use gloves when mixing meat to avoid over mixing. It does help texture in sausage, meatloaf, amd meatballs.

Description: 
Revised version of Janelle's Turkey Chorizo (Loose, not Encased). I have adjusted the spices and method to suit my tastes. My friends who eat chorizo often have told me the end result is very good and close to an original recipe.
