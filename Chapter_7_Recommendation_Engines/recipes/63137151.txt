Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) package dried penne pasta
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into cubes
salt and pepper to taste
1 tbs garlic powder or to taste
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1/2 small Bell Pepper (Red, yellow, or orange) sliced
1/2c white wine
1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 bunch slender asparagus spears, trimmed, cut on diagonal into 1-inch pieces
1/2 clove garlic, thinly sliced
1/8 cup Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, and set aside.
Mix the garlic, salt, pepper, and Cayenne together. Coat the chicken in the mixture. Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in chicken and bell pepper. Cook until chicken is cooked through and browned,and the bell pepper is tender, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken to paper towels.
Pour wine into the skillet to de-glaze, and then add chicken broth to the skillet. Then stir in asparagus, garlic, and a pinch more garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cover, and steam until the asparagus is just tender, about 5 to 10 minutes. Return chicken to the skillet, and warm through.
Stir chicken mixture into pasta, and mix well. Let sit about 5 minutes. Drizzle with 1 tablespoons olive oil, stir again, then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
