Ingredients:
1.5 pounds lean pork sausage
1 egg
2/3 cup breadcrumbs (I like panko breadcrumbs for this)
1/2 cup buttermilk
1/2 white onion, chopped
1 shallot, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper, or more to taste
2 tablespoons ketchup

Directions:
Place the pork sausage, onion, shallot and breadcrumbs in a large bowl. Pour the buttermilk over the breadcrumbs to moisten, and mix thoroughly. Gently pat the mixture into a loaf pan and top with ketchup.
Bake for 45 minutes in a 350 degree oven. Check and if the edges of the meatloaf are bubbling, remove from the oven and cool for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving.
If you have leftovers, slice and wrap and place in freezer for future weekend brunches. Reheat in a grill pan.

It's a pork sausage version of my favorite meatloaf recipe and it's awesome with pancakes, omelets, French toast and on a Brunch Burger.
