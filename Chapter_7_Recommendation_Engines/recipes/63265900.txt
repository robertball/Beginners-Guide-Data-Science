Ingredients:
20 chicken wings
4 c sugar
2 large cloves garlic, minced
3 c apple cider vinegar
1-1/2 c cornstarch
1/4 c water
3 eggs
1/2 c soy sauce
1-1/2 c water
2 c catsup
canola oil
1 c slivered almonds

Directions:
Cut wings at first joint and discard the tips.
Wash and dry on paper towels and sprinkle  with garlic and lightly with kosher salt.
Mix cornstarch, eggs and water, stirring to form a smooth batter.
Dip wings in batter and deep fry in oil.
Let sit while making the sauce.
SWEET & SOUR SAUCE:
Select a pan in which all wings can be coated evenly.  Combine sugar, vinegar, water, soy sauce, catsup and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
As sauce begins to thicken, add wings and cook on medium heat.
Turn wings carefully to coat thoroughly with sauce.
Toast nuts and drench in sauce and serve over chicken.

Description: 
Great almond chicken recipe that rivals what we experienced at the Arirang, a fantastic Korean Asian Restaurant we frequented the short two years it was in operation in Pullman, WA.
