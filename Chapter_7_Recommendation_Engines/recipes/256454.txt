Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups grated zucchini
1 1/3 cups finely chopped onions
1/3 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/3 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 jalapeno pepper, minced
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
salt to taste
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/2 cup chickpea flour
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 cup rice flour
3 tablespoons canola oil, or as needed

Directions:
Place zucchini in a colander. Cover with cheesecloth or paper towels and squeeze out as much moisture as possible.
Transfer zucchini to a large bowl; mix in onions, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and jalapeno pepper. Add eggs, cumin, coriander, and salt; mix well. Stir in feta cheese, chickpea flour, cilantro, and rice flour until batter is well blended and thick.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Drop pancake-sized scoops of batter into the skillet; cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a serving plate. Repeat with remaining oil and batter.

Description: 
Thanks to the inspiration from two other AllRecipes recipes, I concocted this and it was a winner. It wasn't really spicy at all and the kids loved it. Excellent served with a dollop of sour cream.
