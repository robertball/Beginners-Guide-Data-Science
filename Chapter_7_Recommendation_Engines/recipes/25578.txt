In a large bowl, Beat cream cheese and sugar on low speed until smooth. Beat in heavy cream, sour cream and half-and-half. Add vanilla and beat in the eggs one at a time. Pour filling into prepared pan. Wrap bottom of the pan on aluminum foil to prevent water from seeping in.
Place cheesecake in a water bath. Bake in the preheated oven for 75 minutes, or until filling is set.
