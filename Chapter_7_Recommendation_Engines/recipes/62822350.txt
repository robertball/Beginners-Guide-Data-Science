Ingredients:
Six ears corn
3 tablespoons flour
2 teaspoons sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 cups water
3 Tablespoons butter

Directions:
Shuck the corn by peeling off the outer layers.
And snap off the husk.
Pull any remaining silks off the corn and rinse under cool running water.
In a large bowl, cut the corn from the cob with a sharp knife.
Start in the middle and work your way down.
Then flip over to get the other side.
Once you’ve cut off all the corn…scrape up the cob with spoon to get the milk.  The creamy corn milk is completely worth it.
Next, combine 3 Tablespoons of flour, 2 teaspoons of sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, and sprinkle in 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.
Dump all of this into one and a half cups of water and stir with a fork or a whisk to combine.
Melt three tablespoons of butter in a large, heavy bottomed skillet over medium-low heat.
When the butter is melted, swirl to evenly coat the bottom of the pan and add the corn…
Then pour in the flour and water mixture.
Cook this over medium-low heat for 40-45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Here’s what it looks like after 45 minutes, a lot of the liquid has been absorbed.
