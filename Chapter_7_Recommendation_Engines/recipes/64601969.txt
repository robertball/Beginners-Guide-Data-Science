Ingredients:
-rack of ribs (I usually use pork spare ribs)
-rib rub (I like Fiesta brand)
-mustard
-bbq sauce
-heavy duty aluminum foil

Directions:
-bring smoker upto about 225
-cut membrane from ribs, coat with layer of mustard, apply liberal amount of rub to both sides (let ribs sit out on counter about 30 minutes before putting on smoker; mustard is just used to make rub stick to the meat, it doesn't make the ribs taste like mustard)
-place ribs on smoker, bone side down
-smoke at 225 for 3 hours
-take ribs off of smoker and lay in foil bone side up
-wrap foil tightly around ribs (some people add about 1/4 cup of apple juice. I sometimes put some butter in the foil.)
-place back in smoker and smoke for 2 more hours
-take ribs out of foil and place back in smoker bone side down and smoke for one more hour (check ribs before putting back in smoker because I've had them not need the additional hour before and sometimes they only needed 20-30 more minutes; it varies every time)
-if you like bbq sauce on your ribs, apply about 10 minutes before taking off grill.
-after removing ribs from pit, wrap in foil again and let them "rest" for 30-45 minutes
