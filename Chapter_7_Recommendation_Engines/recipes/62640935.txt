Ingredients:
1 524g Chocolate cake mix, any kind will do

1/2 to 1 cup of chopped lightly toasted almonds.
2 cups mini marshmallow's

Directions:
Mix cake mix with the oil and egg spread dough on bottom of 9x13 inch greased or lined baking pan.  Bake for 15 minutes at 350 and or till toothpick comes out clean. Remove from oven, in the mean time heat the icing for 30 seconds in microwave pour over baked cake mix cookie crust.  Top with half the almonds, half the chocolate chips.  Add the marshmallow's to cover then top again with the remaining cup of chocolate chips and almonds.  Bake  for 10 min, the top should be a nice golden brown.  Let cool before cutting, I put mine in the freezer for a few hours makes cutting so much easier and cut into 18 pieces.  Enjoy.
