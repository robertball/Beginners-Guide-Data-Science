NA
Ingredients:
½ cup water
1 cup vegetable oil
¼ cup chocolate syrup
1  egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1 cup plain bread crumbs
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Pour water into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Whisk oil, chocolate syrup, egg, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl. Mix bread crumbs and cocoa powder together in a shallow bowl.
Poke holes into chicken breasts using a fork. Dip chicken in the oil mixture, covering completely. Press chicken into bread crumb mixture until both sides are coated. Arrange chicken in the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
