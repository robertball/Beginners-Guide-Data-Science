Ingredients:
3/4lb fresh broccoli, diced
2 large carrots, peeled and diced
3 large cloves garlic, diced (not minced)
3-lb butternut squash
1 15-oz can chickpeas, rinsed
water
1lb fiori or rotini pasta
olive oil
salt
ground (dry) garlic
thyme
savory
rosemary
parsley

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Cut and clean the squash and place in a pot.  Pour water in until covered.  Boil for about 20 minutes until thoroughly cooked; a fork should be able to slide in and out of the squash.  Strain.  Place back in the pot, off of the burner.
Meanwhile, combine the broccoli, carrots, and garlic in another pot and cover with water.  Boil until thoroughly cooked; this should take less time than the squash.  Strain.
Also meanwhile, prepare the 1lb of pasta according to directions.
Place the chickpeas in with the squash.  Mash until the squash is completely smashed and all the chickpeas are crushed and mixed in with it, adding olive oil until you have a smooth but not liquid consistency.
Pour the broccoli, carrots, garlic, and pasta into the pot.  Mix.
Add salt, ground garlic, and parsley to taste, liberally.  Add thyme and savory to taste.  Add rosemary to taste, sparingly.
Pour the mixture into a casserole dish.  Add some salt and olive oil on top.
Place in the oven for about 10-15 minutes, or until heated throughout and somewhat crispy on top.  Serve.
