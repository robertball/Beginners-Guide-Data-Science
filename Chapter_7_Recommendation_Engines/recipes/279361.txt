Ingredients:
3 cups basmati rice
2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 cup olive oil
1 (16 ounce) jar tomato salsa
2 cups chicken broth
2 (15 ounce) cans kidney beans, rinsed and drained

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour white rice into a casserole dish and season with salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, and oregano. Pour in olive oil and stir until rice is thoroughly coated with oil. Add salsa, chicken broth, and kidney beans; stir until evenly combined. Cover very tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until rice is tender, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Remove foil, taste and adjust seasoning if necessary, and fluff with a fork. Serve hot.

Due to certain worldwide events, I've been getting lots of requests for easy, hearty recipes that can be made using basic dry and canned goods. This incredibly delicious Spanish-style baked rice and beans is all that and more. You'll also see a fantastic, foolproof way of making perfect rice, every time. Garnish with Monterey Jack cheese, sour cream, and chopped cilantro, if you like.
