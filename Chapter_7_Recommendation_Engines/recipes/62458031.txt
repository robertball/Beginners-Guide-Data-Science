Ingredients:
2 lbs. French bread
32 oz. heavy whipping cream
24 oz. white chocolate chips
14 egg yolks
3 table spoons vanilla extract
¼ cup sugar (optional)
Pre-heat oven to 325°

Directions:
Makes 3 loaf pans or a bunt pan.
Combine white chocolate, cream, and sugar over a low heat in a sauce pan or double boiler. Heat slowly until the chocolate melts and is incorporated into the cream. Separate the egg yolks from  the whites and save the whites for another project. You can place the whites in a freezer container, cover with a plastic wrap to keep the air out and freeze. While the cream mixture is on, tear the French bread (or any stale bread or buns in your freezer), into small pieces about ½ - ¾ in. in a large bowl. Beat the egg yolks with a fork and add ¾ cup of cream mixture into the egg yolks slowly, stirring constantly. This will temper the yolks. Add the rest of the cream mixture to the egg yolks stirring constantly. Pour the mixture on the bread and stir until the mixture is completely absorbed into the bread.  Pour the mix into 3 loaf pans or a large bunt pan that has been sprayed with a non stick spray. Bake at 325° for about an hour. The center pan will be done in about 50 minutes. When the center of the loaf pan rises to the same height as the end of the loaf and the edges are a nice golden brown it is probably done. DO NOT OVER COOK. The loafs or bunt pan should be moist when cut with a knife.
