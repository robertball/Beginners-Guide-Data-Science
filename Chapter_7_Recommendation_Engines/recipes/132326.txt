Ingredients:
1/2 pound bulk mild Italian sausage
1/2 pound bulk hot Italian sausage
1/4 cup olive oil from jar of sun-dried tomatoes
1/2 large onion, coarsely chopped
3 tablespoons minced garlic
1 (28 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes
1 1/2 cups oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and sliced
salt and pepper to taste
Italian seasoning to taste
1 cup cream
1 pound cherry tomatoes, halved

Directions:
Cook mild and hot Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until crumbly and no longer pink. Drain excess grease and set aside. Heat olive oil in the same pan over medium heat; stir in onion and garlic, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent.
Stir in diced and sun-dried tomatoes, and the crumbled sausage; season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes until sun-dried tomatoes have softened.
Before serving, stir in cream and garnish with cherry tomatoes.
