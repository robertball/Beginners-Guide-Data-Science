Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup finely minced onion
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon Montreal steak seasoning
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (8 ounce) package sharp Cheddar cheese, cut into 8 cubes
4 slices bacon, cut in half
2 tablespoons barbecue sauce (such as Sweet Baby Ray'sÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a cooking rack on top of a baking sheet.
Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, onion, egg, Worcestershire sauce, steak seasoning, salt, and pepper in a bowl; mix until combined. Shape mixture into 8 meatballs, forming each one around a cube of Cheddar cheese. Wrap each meatball with 1/2 slice of bacon and place seam-side down on the cooking rack, leaving 1 to 2 inches between each one.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and continue baking until meatballs are browned, about 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
Remove from oven and drizzle meatballs with barbecue sauce.
