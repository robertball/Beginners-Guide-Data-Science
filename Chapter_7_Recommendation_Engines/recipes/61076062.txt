Ingredients:
1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon garlic herb seasoning
salt and pepper to taste
6 (4 ounce)  tilapia fillets

Directions:
Preheat your oven's broiler. Grease a broiling pan or line pan with aluminum foil.
In a small bowl, mix together the Parmesan cheese, butter, garlic herb seasoning, and lemon juice. Season fish with salt and pepper.
Arrange fillets in a single layer on the prepared pan. Broil a few inches from the heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the fillets over and broil for a couple more minutes. Remove the fillets from the oven and cover them with the Parmesan cheese mixture on the top side. Broil for 2 more minutes or until the topping is browned and fish flakes easily with a fork. Be careful not to over cook the fish.
