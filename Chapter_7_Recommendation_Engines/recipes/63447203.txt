Ingredients:
1 cup chicken sauce (chicken broth made into rue)
2 teaspoons Asian (toasted) sesame oil
1/3 cup apple juice
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 pound beef round steak, cut into 1/8-inch thick strips
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more if needed
1 thin slice of fresh ginger root
1 clove garlic, peeled and smashed
1 pound broccoli, cut into florets
8 oz mushrooms

Directions:
Whisk together the sauce, sesame oil, apple juice, soy sauce, sugar, and cornstarch in a bowl, and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Place the steak pieces into a shallow bowl, pour the sauce mixture over the meat, stir to coat well, and marinate for at least 30 minutes in refrigerator.
Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat, and stir in the ginger and garlic. Let them sizzle in the hot oil for about 1 minute to flavor the oil, then remove and discard. Stir in the broccoli,mushrooms and toss and stir in the hot oil until bright green and almost tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the broccoli/mushroom mixture from the wok, and set aside.
Pour a little more oil into the wok, if needed, and stir and toss the beef with the marinade until the sauce forms a glaze on the beef, and the meat is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Return the cooked broccoli to the wok, and stir until the meat and broccoli are heated through, about 3 minutes.
