Ingredients:
3 cups brown sugar
1 cup whipping cream
1 tsp. vanilla
1 tbsp. butter

Directions:
Mix brown sugar and cream in a medium saucepan.
Stir well and put on medium heat.
Cover the saucepan until it starts to boil.
Let boil until it reaches the soft ball stage (240 degrees F).
Do not stir too much while it is boiling - just sort of mix in the edges once in awhile.
When it reaches soft ball stage, remove from heat.
Stir in vanilla and butter.
Let this cool until it starts to thicken, then beat with a spoon until it starts to set and crystalize a bit.
Pour and spread in a greased 8" x 8" pan.
