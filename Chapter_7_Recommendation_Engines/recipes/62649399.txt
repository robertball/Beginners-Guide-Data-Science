Ingredients:
4 boneless chicken breasts
1/4 cup fat free low sodium chicken broth
2 tsp minced thyme
1/3 cup seedless blackberry jam (no sugar added)
1 TBSP balsamic vinegar
1 TBSP olive oil
Cornstarch

Directions:
Combine chicken broth, thyme, jam and vinegar together. Brown chicken breasts in olive oil 2-3 min each side. Add blackberry mixture.  Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes, turning chicken breasts half way through. If you want a thicker sauce, add a little cornstarch half way through cooking. Sauce will naturally thicken upon reduction.
