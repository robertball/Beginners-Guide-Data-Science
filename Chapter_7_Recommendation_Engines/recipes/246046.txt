Ingredients:
1 large head cauliflower, broken into florets
2 tablespoons butter
2 large cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups milk
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 ounces grated fontina cheese
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch ground white pepper

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until crisp tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain well.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until soft and fragrant, about 1 minute. Whisk in flour until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in milk and cream. Increase heat to medium and simmer, whisking frequently, until sauce starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Bring to a boil; continue to cook until sauce is thick, about 5 minutes.
Stir Parmesan cheese, fontina cheese, salt, nutmeg, and white pepper into sauce. Cook, whisking vigorously, until cheese is melted into the sauce, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.
Spread 1 cup of sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange cauliflower on top. Drizzle remaining sauce over the cauliflower, coating each floret.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and lightly browned on top, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Served bubbling hot in a savory garlic and cheesy cream sauce, this side dish can take the center stage if paired with a risotto or semolina gnocchi. In the autumn, this dish makes a regular appearance at our dinner table as we harvest it straight from the garden.
