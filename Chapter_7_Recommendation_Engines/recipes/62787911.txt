Ingredients:
1 Kg of peeled solid Farmer’s Market potatoes?, pinch of Salt, 25 grams finely chopped Parsley, (you might don't want to peel the potatoes before you cook them, just make sure you get rid/cut out any bad spots or "Eyes")

Directions:
Take a larger pot so the potatoes fit in loosely (cut larger potatoes, so they are cooked in the same) and cover them completely with cold water, ad desired amount of salt, cover and boil until fork tender, around 20min, ?When tender drain water move into a nice bowl, sprinkle with the parsley and serve hot.
This is the perfect simple side for a couple of quality German Bratwurst and a tasty Onion-Bacon-Sauce

Description: 
In Germany we have a lot of Potato varieties.
Hansa & Hansa Gold I remember. One was used to boil and or made mashed potatoes out of it and the other was used to make Potato Salad with.  For instance I wouldn't use the Baked Potato kind to do this side dish. I believe they would fall apart, they are used to cook/bake as a whole.
