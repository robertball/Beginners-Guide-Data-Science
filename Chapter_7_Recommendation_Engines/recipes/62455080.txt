Ingredients:
8 c. chopped, fresh kale
1 Tbsp. olive oil
6 shallots, finely chopped
1/2 c. water
2 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar
1 tsp. Dijon mustard
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. freshly ground pepper

Directions:
In a large, nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium heat.
Add shallots and saute approximately 5 minutes or until translucent.
Add water, vinegar and mustard and bring to a boil.
Cook, stirring constantly for 1-2 minutes.
Carefully add kale, tossing to combine with vinaigrette.
Cover and steam, stirring occasionally until kale is just wilted (approximately 10-15 minutes).
Sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss one final time before serving.

Description: 
Another recipe adapted from WW.  My technique differed a bit to reduce the preparation time.  I found that it still worked fine.  I posted this recipe because I don't like kale but I did like it prepared this way.
