Ingredients:
oil for deep frying
1 cup potato, cut into matchstick sized strips
2 cups small cauliflower florets
3 tablespoons tahini (sesame seed paste)
2 tablespoons olive oil (optional)
3 tablespoons plain yogurt
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup torn arugula leaves
1 cup torn lettuce leaves

Directions:
Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Deep fry the potato sticks until crispy and golden brown, about 4 minutes. Remove, and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Deep fry the florets in two batches until golden brown; drain on paper towels. Allow the cauliflower to cool until it's just warm.
Stir together tahini and olive oil in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in yogurt, lemon juice, vinegar, cumin, salt, and pepper. Add cauliflower, arugula, and lettuce; toss to coat with the dressing. Place salad onto serving plates, and sprinkle with the potato sticks.
