Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent roll dough
1 medium onion, chopped
1 red pepper, chopped
8 eggs
about 1/2 c milk
(4 ounces cream cheese, softened - optional)
salt and pepper to taste
4 ounces sliced ham, chopped
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Press the crescent rolls from one package into a lightly greased cookie sheet to form a rectangle.
Separate and divide the crescents from remaining package. Spacing half of these separated rolls evenly down the long side of the rectangle, press the triangles' short (and widest) side to the edge of the rectangle, pointed ends extending over the sides of the pan. Repeat on the other side then set aside.
Heat a skillet with some butter in it and saute the onion and pepper together until onion is translucent.
If using the cream cheese, beat the milk and cream cheese together until smooth.
Mix in eggs, and season with salt and pepper.
Add egg mixture to the skillet with the onions and peppers and make scrambled eggs, cooking only until the eggs are almost set.
Arrange the ham in a layer down the center of the dough.
Spoon the cooked egg mixture on top of the ham and then sprinkle the cheddar cheese on top of the eggs.
Fold the triangles over the egg mixture at a slight angle, forming a 'braid' shape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until cheese is melted and rolls are golden brown.
