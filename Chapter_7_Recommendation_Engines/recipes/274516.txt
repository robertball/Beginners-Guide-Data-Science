Ingredients:
¼ cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons cooking sherry
2 tablespoons prepared pesto
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon pepper
1 ½ pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms
1 small zucchini, cut into chunks
1 medium red onion, cut into chunks
12  grape tomatoes
6 metal skewers

Directions:
Whisk oil, sherry, pesto, lemon juice, salt, and pepper together in a glass bowl. Add chicken pieces and stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Thread marinated chicken, mushrooms, zucchini, red onion, and tomatoes alternately onto skewers. Reserve remaining marinade.
Place kabobs onto the preheated grill, and cook, turning occasionally and brushing with the reserved marinade, until chicken is cooked and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
Pesto can sometimes be overpowering, but not in this recipe! Using it in a marinade adds the wonderful flavors of basil and garlic, without taking away from the natural flavors of the chicken and vegetables.
