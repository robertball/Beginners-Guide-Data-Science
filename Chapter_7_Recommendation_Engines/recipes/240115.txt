Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter, divided
1  Granny Smith apple, peeled and sliced
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
4 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1  onion, sliced into rings and rings separated
½ cup apple cider
¼ cup apple cider vinegar
2 cups cooked wide noodles

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir apples until lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle brown sugar over apples and cook until apples are tender, about 5 minutes more. Transfer apples to a plate.
Arrange chicken on a sheet of waxed paper; season both sides with cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Melt remaining butter in the same skillet and cook chicken until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate.
Cook and stir onion in the same skillet used for chicken until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir cider and vinegar into onion, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.
Return chicken to onion mixture, spooning cider sauce over chicken and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the liquid is reduced by half, 5 to 10 minutes more. Spoon apples into chicken mixture and cook until apples are warmed, 2 to 3 minutes.
Arrange noodles on plate, top with chicken, and spoon sauce over chicken.
