Ingredients:
2 Tb active dry yeast
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ginger
1 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
5 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoons salt
3 Tb vegetable oil
2 cups chopped dried apples
4 teaspoons cinnamon
1/2 cup baking soda
4 cups hot water
1 egg white, mixed with 2 Tb water
1/4 cup turbinado sugar, for topping

Directions:
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast, ginger and 1 teaspoon sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
In a large bowl, mix together flour, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt. Add the oil and yeast mixture.  Mix and form into a dough. If the mixture is dry, add one or two tablespoons of water. Process with dough hook until smooth, about 7 to 8 minutes.
Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Add apples & cinnamon and mix in with dough hook.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 12 equal pieces.  Roll each piece into a rope and twist into a pretzel shape, dabbing water under ends to stick them down.
Once all of the dough is shaped, heat water and soda to boiling, and put each pretzel into soda water 2 minutes, turning once.
Remove pretzels to parchment-lined baking sheet.
Brush with egg white mixture & sprinkle with turbinado sugar.
Bake in preheated oven for 12 minutes, until browned.
