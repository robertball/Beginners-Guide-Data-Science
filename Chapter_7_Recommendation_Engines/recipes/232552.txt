Ingredients:
2 pounds beef chuck, cubed
12 ounces chorizo sausage
1/4 cup garlic, minced
1/4 cup white vinegar
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
3 cups tomato sauce
2 cups peeled and cubed potatoes
1 cup drained canned peas
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Combine beef chuck, chorizo, garlic, vinegar, and soy sauce in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until beef chuck is browned and liquid is reduced, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat.
Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and green bell pepper in the hot oil until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomato sauce and simmer until liquid is slightly reduced, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir beef-chorizo mixture into tomato sauce mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover pot, and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes.
Stir potatoes, peas, salt, and pepper into stew; simmer until beef is tender and potatoes are cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes. Add water if needed.
