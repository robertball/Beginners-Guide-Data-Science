Ingredients:
4 pork loin chops, 3/4-inch thick
1 teaspoon McCormick速 Worcestershire Ground Black Pepper Blend, divided
3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
1 tablespoon oil
3 tablespoons dry white wine
2/3 cup heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon McCormick速 Ground Mustard
1/2 teaspoon McCormick速 Rubbed Sage

Directions:
Sprinkle pork chops with 1/2 teaspoon each Worcestershire Pepper and salt.
Heat oil in large skillet on medium-high heat.  Add chops; cook 4 to 6 minutes per side or until desired doneness (if chops brown too quickly, reduce heat slightly).  Remove skillet from heat.  Transfer chops to serving platter; cover and keep warm.
Stir wine into skillet, scraping to loosen any browned bits.  Add cream, mustard, sage and remaining 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire Pepper and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Bring to boil on medium heat.   Reduce heat to low; simmer, uncovered, 2 minutes or until reduced to about 1/2 cup.  Serve sauce over chops.
