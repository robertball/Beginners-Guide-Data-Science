Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 cup white sugar
5 eggs
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup milk
3 3/4 cups applesauce
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch rimmed baking sheet or baking pan and line with parchment paper.
Combine butter and sugar in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Mix flour and baking powder together in a bowl. Sift gradually into butter mixture, mixing well.
Transfer 6 to 8 heaping tablespoons of the cake batter, about 1 cup, to a separate bowl. Mix in milk gradually until batter is creamy and the consistency of pancake batter.
Spread thick cake batter into the prepared baking pan and level out with the back of a spoon. Mix applesauce and cinnamon together and spread on top in an even layer. Top with the thin cake batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top of the cake is a deep golden brown, about 50 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Dust with confectioners' sugar before cutting into squares.

Description: 
Use homemade or store-bought apple sauce to make this easy Polish cake. I make applesauce with cinnamon, which then in turn flavors this cake, but if you're using plain applesauce, simply add 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the applesauce before spreading over the cake mixture (which is how I have written the recipe).
