Ingredients:
1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 eggs, room temperature
1/3 cup margarine, melted
4 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup white sugar
1 (1/4 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/3 cup brown sugar, packed
1/4 cup white sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1/3 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Pour warm milk, melted margarine, and sugar into bread machine.  Sprinkle package of yeast over top.  Add all purpose flour, salt and eggs.  Set machine on dough cycle.
After the dough has doubled in size turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, cover and let rest for 10 minutes. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, sugar and cinnamon.
Roll dough into a 16x21 inch rectangle. Spread dough with 1/3 cup butter and sprinkle evenly with sugar/cinnamon mixture. Roll up dough and cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Bake rolls in preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. While rolls are baking, beat 1/2 cup softened butter and confectioners' sugar.  Spread frosting on warm rolls before serving.

Description: 
These cinnamon rolls are really delicious and easy to make, let the bread machine do all of the work!!  Make the original even more budget friendly by reducing the amount of sugar rolled inside, using all purpose flour instead of the more expensive bread flour, and leaving the cream cheese out of the frosting.  You will never miss the extra calories!  My family loved these!!Modified from: Clone of a Cinnabon
