Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup cold butter, cut into small pieces
1/2 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup 2% low-fat milk
1 pint fresh blueberries, rinsed and dried
4 fresh apricots, pitted and sliced
1/2 pound cherries, pitted and halved
3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, divided
3/4 cup whipping cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender or two forks, cut in the cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture; pour in the buttermilk and milk, and mix just until the dough gathers together. Do not overwork. Cover the bowl, and allow dough to rest 10 to 15 minutes. Roll or pat the dough into 6 rounds, each about 3 inches in diameter. Place on prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until puffed and golden, about 15 minutes. Place on a rack and cool to room temperature.
Meanwhile, combine the blueberries, apricots, and cherries in a bowl. Toss to blend and set aside.
Beat the whipping cream in a mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Stir in 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar; continue beating until stiff peaks form. Split the shortcakes in half and place the bottom halves on 6 serving plates. Spoon whipped cream over each half, top with fruit, and place a shortcake top on each. Dust tops with remaining 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar.
