Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
2 yellow onions, diced
3 ribs celery, diced
1/2 cup white wine
4 potatoes, chopped
2 cups fish stock
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1 bay leaf
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 (4 ounce) fillet sea bass, chopped, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
3 dashes hot sauce

Directions:
Heat olive oil and butter in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir onions and celery in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add wine; raise heat to medium-high and cook until wine is reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes.
Mix potatoes, fish stock, thyme, seafood seasoning, bay leaf, salt, and pepper into onion mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover stockpot, and simmer until potatoes are tender but not falling apart, 10 to 15 minutes.
Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium heat just until cream is steaming, about 5 minutes. Stir cream and sea bass into potato mixture; cook until sea bass is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Season chowder with sugar, hot sauce, salt, and pepper.

Description: 
Fish chowder that's a little thinner than restaurant chowders. I made this with a homemade fish stock made from sea bass and used the cooked fish from the stock for the chowder as well. Serve with crusty French bread.
