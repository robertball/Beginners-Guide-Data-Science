Ingredients:
6-8 new (baby) potatoes or 2 1/2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into pieces
3 cloves garlic, sliced
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup water
juice of one lemon
good pinch of salt
1 tsp. dried Oregano

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F. Put the potatoes into a baking dish and scatter garlic around every one of the potatoes. Whisk everything else together in a bowl and drizzle over potatoes. Stir it around so the potatoes are well coated, being careful to ensure the garlic is in the bottom of the tray in the liquid.
Bake for 20 minutes, turn the potatoes, return to the oven for another 20 minutes. Turn potatoes again and put back in the oven for another five to ten minutes if necessary, until they are cooked through.
Serve hot or at room temperature.
