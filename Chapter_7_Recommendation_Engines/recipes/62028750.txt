Ingredients:

Directions:
1/3 cup margarine or butter
1 small onion, choppped
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
2/3 cup milk
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper
2 cups frozen peas and carrots
2 cups cooked, shredded or diced chicken
*1 recipe baking powder biscuits
Melt the margarine in a lg saucepan; add the chopped onion and saute until onion is soft. Add flour and stir well; cook for 1 minute. Add chicken broth and milk. Heat to boiling,stirring constantly. Cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add frozen peas and carrots and cooked chicken. Pour into buttered 2-qt casserole dish.
Prepare baking powder biscuits  ( or use canned refrigerator biscuits) and place on top of the hot mixture. Bake
at 450 degrees for 12-15 minutes, or until biscuits are golden brown and cooked on the bottom. This tends to bubble over so I place a piece of aluminum foil under the pan to catch the drips.
