Description: 
I could not get my husband to eat pork loin or roasts. I tried dozens of recipes, but he would just say it was okay but would never want me to make it again. After numerous tries I came up with this, and he likes it, but only if the rub stays on it for 24 hours. Believe me he knows when it doesn't! Now it is a regular on the menu without complaint. I hope others like it.
