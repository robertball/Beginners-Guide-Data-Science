Ingredients:
Chive Butter:
1/4 cup butter, softened
3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Cheddar Biscuits:
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons cold butter
1 1/4 cups shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup buttermilk
1 egg, lightly beaten

Directions:
Beat softened butter, chives, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl until well-combined and smooth.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Cut cold butter into flour mixture with a pastry blender or two knives until mixture resembles oatmeal. Add Cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese; toss to coat. Stir buttermilk into flour mixture until dough is just-moistened.
Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and gently knead until dough comes together, about 6 to 8 times. Roll dough into a 9-inch square (1/2 inch thick) with a floured rolling pin. Cut dough lengthwise into 4 strips and crosswise into 6 strips. Place biscuits on a baking sheet and brush tops with beaten egg.
Bake biscuits in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a rack and cool until warm, at least 15 minutes. Serve with chive butter.

Description: 
Chives are the first herb to come up in the spring, and their delicate flavor pairs well with these biscuits. A little bit of Parmesan cheese makes the flavor of Cheddar cheese really pop; try it next time you make mac and cheese!
