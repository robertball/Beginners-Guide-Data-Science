Ingredients:
1 cup yellow cornmeal
3/4 cup hot water
1/2 cup milk, warmed
2 teaspoons instant yeast
2 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

Directions:
Mix together the cornmeal and hot water in a small bowl. Stir in the warm milk and let mixture cool to lukewarm.  Add the remaining ingredients and mix and knead them together to form a smooth, slightly sticky dough.
Place dough in a lightly greased bowl, turn so that top is oiled.  Cover dough and let rise for 1 1/2 hours or until puffy.
Turn dough onto lightly floured surface, knead lightly (just once or twice) and form into a ball.  Place onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.  Cover and let rise 45 minutes or until very puffy.
Just before placing loaf in preheated 450 degree oven, spritz lightly with water and make four slashes about 1/4" deep, into the top crust, in the shape of a box.
Place loaf in oven and bake for 10 minutes, then turn oven down to 400 degrees and continue to bake another 15 minutes, or until it's golden brown.
