Description: 
I was trying to find a dessert that was no-carb and high in protein to fit in my diet so one night I decided to make my own recipe and it turned out delicious and my family even loved them. They don't like healthy food that much and they requested I make more! It has no sugar but they have a real sweet flavor to them. And you can lose weight and build muscle by eating brownies, how great is that?
