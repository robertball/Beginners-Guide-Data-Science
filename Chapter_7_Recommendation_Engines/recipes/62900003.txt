3/4 teaspoon salt

2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast

Great tasting bread and texture. I don't use a bread machine since I don't think the texture comes out as nice as oven baking. For people without machines, this recipe couldn't be simpler. Warm the milk and add the sugar and the yeast. Stir and let sit for about 15 min. to proof (the yeast will foam). If it doesn't foam, your milk probably wasn't warm enough. Then add the foamy yeast mixture to the rest of the ingredients and mix. This dough is easy to mix by hand so you really don't need the KitchenAid. The dough will be sticky. So after mixing, cover and let it sit in the bowl to rise 1-2 hours. Punch down and let rise again or form into rolls at this time. Super quick and easy. If you want a sweeter, richer bread, increase sugar to 1/2 cup and add one extra egg yolk. If making one large loaf, bake for about 30-35 min. at 375.
