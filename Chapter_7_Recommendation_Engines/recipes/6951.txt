Ingredients:
3 zucchinis
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
2 1/4 cups sifted unbleached all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
3 eggs
1 1/3 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups chopped walnuts
1 cup golden raisins

Directions:
Soak raisins in warm water for 30 minutes. Drain thoroughly in a colander or strainer; set aside.
Clean the zucchini and trim off the ends. Do not peel. Shred with a medium sized shredder. You should have about 4 cups when finished. Sprinkle the zucchini with 1 teaspoon of the salt and place on a plate. Mix it with your hands to evenly distribute the salt. Place a heavy saucepan on top of the zucchini and allow it to sit for 20 minutes to purge itself of liquid.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4 inch loaf pans and set aside.
Set aside 2 tablespoons of the flour. Sift together the remaining flour, soda, spices, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.
Beat eggs on medium speed for about 3 minutes. Add the sugar, a little at a time and beat for a good 5 minutes. The mixture should be light in color and thick. While beating, slowly pour in the oil.
Empty the zucchini into a colander and squeeze to release the juices.
Add the vanilla to the beating eggs and then add in the zucchini. Add the dry ingredients, a little at a time and mix just until the dry ingredients are mixed in. Do not overmix.
In a small bowl combine the remaining 2 tablespoons flour, nuts, and drained raisins, and mix together to coat. Fold into the batter. Pour into the prepared pans.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) about 1 hour or until a toothpick comes out clean. Remove to a rack to cool for 10 minutes. Remove from pans and cool on a rack completely.

Description: 
Abby was a French friend I knew years ago. She taught me the method of dejourger, which means to draw out water. Using this method I developed a moist but not heavy zucchini bread. It makes other zucchini breads look like lead bombs!
