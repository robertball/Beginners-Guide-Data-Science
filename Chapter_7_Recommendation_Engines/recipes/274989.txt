Ingredients:
2 tablespoons herbes de Provence
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons lemon juice
8 (5 ounce) lamb loin chops
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Combine herbes de Provence, olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice in a small bowl. Rub mixture over lamb chops and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Season chops with salt and pepper.
Place chops on the preheated grill and cook until browned and medium-rare on the inside, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove from grill and place on an aluminum foil-covered plate to rest for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Don't let their small size fool you, these chops are packed with maximum flavor! Try and find loin chops that are at least 1-inch thick for best results. These are best served medium to medium-rare, but add a few extra minutes per side if you prefer them a little more done.
