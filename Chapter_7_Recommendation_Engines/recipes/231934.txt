Ingredients:
1 cup cola-flavored carbonated beverage
1/2 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon prepared horseradish (optional)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 pounds sirloin steak

Directions:
Whisk together cola, soy sauce, Dijon mustard, horseradish, garlic, and black pepper in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add steak, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.
Preheat the grill to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Remove steak from resealable bag and discard remaining marinade.
Cook steak on the preheated grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
