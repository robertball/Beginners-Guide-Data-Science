Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) frozen pie crust, thawed
1 3/4 pounds sliced bacon
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
1/2 teaspoon spicy brown mustard
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 1/2 cups shredded Swiss cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prick bottom and sides of pie crust and bake 10 minutes, until lightly brown; set aside to cool.
Place bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
In a bowl, mix eggs, milk, mustard and nutmeg. In a separate bowl, toss bacon with flour to lightly coat. Spread 3/4 bacon mixture and Swiss cheese over bottom of pie crust. Pour egg mixture over bacon mixture. Top with remaining bacon mixture.
Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until a fork inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
We love quiche in our house; however, my mother is allergic to onions, so we created a recipe that she can enjoy with us. This is great with a cup of broth on a rainy day.
