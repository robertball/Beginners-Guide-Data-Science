Ingredients:
6 lemon peels, cut into 1/4 inch strips
4 orange peels, cut into 1/4 inch strips
(try cutting very thin with vegetable peeler or sharp knife)
2 cups white sugar
1 cup water
1/3 cup white sugar for decoration

Directions:
Scrape out pith with grapefruit spoon. Place lemon and orange peel in large saucepan and cover with water.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Boil for 20 minutes, drain and set aside.  Repeat if necessary.
In medium saucepan, combine 2 cups sugar and 1 cup water.  Bring to a boil and cook until mixture reaches thread stage, 230 degrees F (108 degrees C) on candy thermometer, or small amount dropped in cold water forms a soft thread.  Stir in peel, reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Drain.  (Try putting peel in at the beginning of this step.)
Spread pieces into single layer and allow to dry 12 hrs. or overnight.
Roll peel pieces, a few at a time, in remaining sugar.  Let dry on wire rack several hours.  Store in airtight container.
