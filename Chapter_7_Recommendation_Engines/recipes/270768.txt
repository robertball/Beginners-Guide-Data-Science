Ingredients:
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 pinch saffron threads
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups pearl (Israeli) couscous
3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed
1 1/2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Pour white wine into a small bowl; add saffron. Let soak, about 10 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a 4-quart pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add couscous and stir until toasted, about 3 minutes.
Carefully stir in saffron-infused wine, chicken broth, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and cover; cook until liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Add more broth if couscous starts to stick to the bottom and cooking is not yet complete.
Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes, covered, before serving.
