Ingredients:
4 T. oil
1/2 c. red chile powder
6 large cloves garlic, chopped
1 T. cumin
1/4 c. flour
1 dozen corn tortillas
6 small zuchinni, sliced
5 ears of corn--cut off the cob
1 # firm tofu, crumbled
1 bunch cilantro, chopped
1 tsp. salt
1 T. chile pequin
2 c. black beans (cooked)
1/2 # soy/almond cheddar, grated

Directions:
Make red chile sauce:  heat oil, add cumin, red chile powder, garlic and salt.  Cook for a couple minutes, then add the flour and mix as a roux.  After a minute or so add approximately 1 qt. water and stir well.  Cook over medium heat till thickened.
Steam or roast the zuchinni ( or just leave raw).  Place in large bowl along with corn, tofu, cilantro, cheese, beans, and chile pequin.  Mix well.
Lightly grease a 13 x 9 pan.  Pour in a cup of the sauce then layer 6 tortillas in the pan.  Top with corn mixture, layer with remaining tortillas, and top with about two cups of sauce.  (Leftover sauce can be served with the dish.)
Bake at 350 for 45 minutes.
