Ingredients:
1 pound elbow macaroni (you can also use campanelle, cavatappi or shells)
3 cups whole milk
1 cups packed fresh spinach
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons flour
4 cups grated white cheddar cheese
2 cups chopped broccoli florets
1 cup peas

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350Â° F.
2. Cook pasta in salted water for about 3 minutes less than package directions call for, until al dente. Reserve half a cup of the pasta water and strain.
3. While the pasta is cooking. Place the milk and spinach in a blender and blend on high speed until smooth.
4. In a large pot melt the butter and then add the flour, whisking continuously over low-medium heat for 2-3 minutes to make a roux. Slowly whisk in the milk mixture and bring to a boil.
5. Reduce heat and simmer, whisking occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until sauce is gently bubbling and starting to thicken.
6. Add reserved pasta water and cheese and whisk until melted. Stir in the pasta, broccoli and peas.
7. Transfer to a greased 13? x 9? baking dish and bake for 20 minutes, or until cheese is bubbling and the pasta is set.
