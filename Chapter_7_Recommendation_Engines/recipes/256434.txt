Ingredients:
8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
8 ounces white chocolate, chopped
1/2 cup conversation heart candies (such as NeccoÂ®)
3/4 cup freeze-dried strawberries
1 tablespoon pink sprinkles, or to taste

Directions:
Melt semisweet chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.
Melt white chocolate in a separate microwave-safe bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour semisweet chocolate on the parchment paper; spread into a large rectangle. Drizzle white chocolate over the semisweet chocolate in lines and zigzags. Swirl chocolates together into a marble pattern using a toothpick or skewer.
Scatter conversation heart candies over chocolate. Scatter freeze-dried strawberries and pink sprinkles in the remaining gaps. Let stand at room temperature for about 20 minutes.
Refrigerate chocolate bark until firm, about 30 minutes. Break into large chunks.
