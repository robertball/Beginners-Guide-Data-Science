Ingredients:
6 cups water
2 cups quick-cooking grits
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk (optional)
1/4 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon butter, or to taste

Directions:
Place water and grits into the bottom of a slow cooker. Let grits settle to the bottom; use a strainer to fish out any grits that float to the top. Add salt. Stir or whisk well.
Cover and let cook on High for 2 hours, stirring well after 1 hour to avoid clumps.
Stir in milk, heavy cream, and butter. Mix well. Cover and continue to cook on High until grits have a fairly thick, creamy, uniform consistency, about 30 minutes more.

Description: 
This is my favorite way to make grits. So simple! Just a little prep work and then let the slow cooker turn your grits into a delicious, smooth base for any dish. Season as you wish with cheese, bacon, chives, pepper, etc.
