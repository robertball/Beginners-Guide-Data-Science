Ingredients:
12 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
¾ cup port wine, ruby
¾ cup unsalted macadamia nut, chopped
½ cup whipping cream
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 ½ cups plums, chopped
1/3 cup sugar
½ cup port wine
1 pinch nutmeg
1 cup whipping cream
2 tablespoons powdered sugar, sifted
1 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Prepare the pâté:  Line a 9x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper or foil; set aside.  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over low heat.  Add the wine and whisk to blend.  Remove from the heat and stir in the nuts.  Cool to room temperature.
Whip the cream until soft peaks form.  Gently fold the chocolate mixture into the whipped cream.
Pour into lined loaf pan, cover, and refrigerate overnight or at least 3 hours.  (The pâté can be made up to 5 days in advance.)
Prepare the sauce: Melt butter in a sauté pan over medium heat.  Add the plums and sauté until the plums begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the sugar and cook until the sugar begins to caramelize, 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the wine and simmer over low heat until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the nutmeg.  (The sauce can be prepared and refrigerated up to 24 hours in advance.  Serve at room temperature.)
Prepare the topping:  Whip the cream until soft peaks form.  Sprinkle in the sugar and vanilla and whip just to blend.
To serve:  Use a warm knife to slice the pâté  into ½-inch slices.  Top each serving with plum sauce and whipped cream.
