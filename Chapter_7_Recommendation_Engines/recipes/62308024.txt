Ingredients:
4 pounds corned beef brisket (5+ lbs)
1 cup brown sugar (1/2 cup may be better - can substitute light brown sugar))
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Irish stout beer (e.g. Guinness®))(can use Murphy's or Modelo as well - Use 2 cans/bottles plus some water to completly cover the brisket)
1 - Package of spices
2 bay leaves
2 tsp chopped garlic
2-3 cloves
2-3 Allspice
Pinch of thyme

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Rinse the beef completely and pat dry.
Place the brisket on roasting pan or Dutch oven. Rub the brown sugar on the corned beef to coat entire beef, including the bottom. Pour the bottle of stout beer around, and gently over the beef to wet the sugar. Cooked covered and immerse in the beer,
Cover, and place in preheated oven. Bake for 2 1/2 hours. Allow to rest 5 minutes before slicing.
