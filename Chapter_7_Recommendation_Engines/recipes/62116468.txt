Bacon Reuben Potato Skins Recipe

Ingredients:
6 Medium-to-Large sized baked potatoes
12 strips of cooked bacon
1 cup Russian dressing
2 cups Sauerkraut
5 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
6 slices of deli-thin sliced swiss cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Slice the baked potatoes in half length-wise and remove most of the potato pulp with a small spoon. (Tips: bake your potatoes the night before and refrigerate them overnight. They will be a LOT less likely to fall apart. And score around the perimeter with the tip of your spoon before removing the pulp. That gives a nice perforation and makes them easier to core-out. Also, remove as much pulp as possible. Ideally, the shell is no thicker than 1/4 inch. After all, the fillings are the star of the show!)
Baste the inside of each skin with a thin layer of Russian dressing (No Russian dressing? No problem. It's just a mix of these common condiments: Ketchup, yellow mustard, relish and Mayo)
Spoon equal amounts of sauerkraut into each potato skin
Lay 1/2 slice of Swiss chess on top of the sauerkraut in each potato skin
Crumble 1 1/2 slice of bacon onto each potato skin
Heap equal portions of mozzarella cheese on top of each skin
Bake at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown
Top with the remaining bacon crumbs

Description: 
Everyone loves these so much that I've stopped bothering to make traditional Potato Skin appetizers when I have a party. Here I use bacon because I tend to have that on-hand more than Corned Beef or Pastrami. But traditionalists can substitute 1/4 lb of cubed Pastrami for the bacon. Enjoy!
