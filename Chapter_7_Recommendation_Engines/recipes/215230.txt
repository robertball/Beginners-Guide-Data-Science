Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds pork loin
2 cups Goya Mojo Criollo
2 teaspoons Goya Adobo All-Purpose Seasoning with Pepper
2 teaspoons Goya Oregano Leaf
1 teaspoon Goya Ground Cumin
1/4 cup Goya Corn Oil
1 medium yellow onion, cut into 1/4-inch strips
2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh cilantro
2 cups cooked Goya Medium Grain Rice
1 (11 ounce) box Goya Maduros, cooked according to package directions
1 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
In a large bowl or in large zip-top bag, combine pork, Mojo, Adobo, oregano and cumin; transfer to refrigerator. Marinate at least 4 hrs, or overnight.
Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove pork from marinade; discard marinade. Place pork in roasting pan; bring to room temperature. Cover roasting pan with foil. Cook pork until internal temperature registers 140 degrees F with thermometer when inserted into thickest part of pork, about 40 min. Transfer pork to cutting board; let rest 10 minutes. Cut pork into 1-inch cubes.
Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Season pork with Adobo. Cook pork, in batches, until golden brown and crisp on all sides, about 10 min; transfer to paper-towel lined plate to drain. Cook onions in oil until soft and starting to brown, about 5 minutes.
Arrange pork and onions on serving plate; sprinkle with cilantro. Serve with cooked rice, sweet plantains and lime wedges.
