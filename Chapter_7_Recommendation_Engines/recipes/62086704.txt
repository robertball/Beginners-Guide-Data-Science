Ingredients:
12 cannelloni shells (oven-ready)
1 lbs lean ground beef
1/2 white onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/5 jars of tomato sauce
1/2 ball mozzarella cheese, grated and divided
1 package of ricotta cheese
3 tbsp Parmesan cheese
2 eggs
salt and pepper to taste
for a vegetarian version, substitute beef for roasted zucchini

Directions:
In a frying pan on medium, cook onions and garlic in olive oil until onions are transparent. Add ground beef and cook on medium until beef is browned. Set aside.
In a bowl, combine eggs, ricotta, salt and pepper, half of the mozzerella, and the meat mixture.
In a large casserole dish, cover the bottom with a generous amount of tomato sauce. Stuff the shells with the mixture and place on the dish. When all shells are stuffed, pour the remaining sauce over the shells and top with mozzerella and parmesian cheeses.
Place in oven for 20 minutes or until the top is lightly browned.
I recommend using the whole 1 1/2 jars of tomato sauce if you are using ready-bake shells. They tend to suck up all the liquid and you will be left with really dry cannelloni.
