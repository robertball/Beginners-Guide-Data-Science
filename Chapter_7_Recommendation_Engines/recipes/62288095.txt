Easy Delicious Goulash Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
1 very large onion, or 2 medium, diced
1/2 pkg medium egg noodles
1 can cream of tomato soup, undiluted
8 oz. light sour cream (daisy is good)
Black pepper to taste
Optional:
1/4-1/2 tsp garlic powder or garlic salt or 1-2 cloves minced garlic

Directions:
Cook noodles according to package directions, with a bit of salt and oil.
While they are cooking, brown ground beef, adding onions after a couple of minutes, after most of the beef is no longer pink.  Cook, stirring, until beef is thoroughly cooked and onions have softened a bit.  (Keep onions a bit firm; do not cook until translucent.)
Mix in tomato soup; stir well and heat for a minute or so, then stir in sour cream and heat another minute or so.  Add drained hot noodles; stir thoroughly and enjoy!
Note: I have also added garlic, salt and pepper to this recipe (we love seasoning!), but my teens prefer this one best as written, without additional seasoning.  Somehow it works, though it seems pretty plain, even to me :-).

Description: 
This is a quick, easy, delicious family favorite.  For a vegetarian version, use morningstar crumbles instead of the ground beef - it works well.
