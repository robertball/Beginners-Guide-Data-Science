Ingredients:
1.5 cup butter
1.5 cup white sugar
2 tsp cinnamon
6 cups apple peeled and sliced
3 1/2 cups flour
2 tbsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
2 tbsp sugar
1.5 cups warm water
¼ cup milk

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350. Grease a 9 x 13 baking dish
2. Melt butter in large saucepan then add 1.5 cup white sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon. Continue to heat over medium low heat, stirring occassionally until a thick syrup has formed, now add the apple slices to the pan to warm and soften.
3. Prepare bannock by mixing dry ingredients in a bowl, starting with 3 cups of flour.  Slowly add warm water and continue to mix. If the batter is too sticky to handle add flour until a soft batter forms.  Try not to over knead the bread.  Press it out onto a floured surface and cut into 15 equal portions (or how ever that will fit in your baking pan)
4. Pour your apple mixture into a well greased baking pan. Cover with the bannock squares. Pour the ¼ cup of milk over top of bannock.
5. Bake for 30 minutes - or when the bannock is lightly browned and baked through.
