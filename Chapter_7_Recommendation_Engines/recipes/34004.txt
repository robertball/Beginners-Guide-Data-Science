Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1 cup mashed banana
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup chopped pitted prunes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a muffin pan, or use paper liners.
In a large bowl, combine sugar, oil and eggs. Beat until smooth. Blend in banana and vanilla. Mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, then stir into egg mixture until just moistened. Mix in the prunes. Spoon into muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of  a muffin comes out clean.

Description: 
They are so delicious - you wouldn't believe that something with prunes would be so good, but they are! And they are low in fat - 1 muffin is less than 5grams of fat. They are so moist and not rubbery or chewy! A definite must try. I had the whole lot devoured in a day.
