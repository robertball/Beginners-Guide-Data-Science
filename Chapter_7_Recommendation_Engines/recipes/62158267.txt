Description: 
Nothing brings a recipe to life like fresh lemons!  For a change of pace from the standard Southern-style Lemon Bars, you need to look no further!  This recipe is easy and the taste is divine.  I have also made this with Splenda and lowfat cream cheese and they were just as wonderful.
