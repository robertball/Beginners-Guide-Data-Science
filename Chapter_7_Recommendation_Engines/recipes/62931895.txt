Ingredients:
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 - 1 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup butter/margarine, melted
1 1/2 - 2 cups packed brown sugar
2 eggs, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons vanilla
Semisweet, milk chocolate, butterscotch, peanut butter and/or white chocolate chips to make 1 cup total (optional)
1/2 - 3/4 cups chopped nuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
In a medium bowl combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk to combine.  Mix in  chopped nuts (if using)and set aside. In another bowl combine melted butter, brown sugar and vanilla mixing well. Cool slightly. Add eggs.  Blend well. Add flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time (to minimize flour "clouds") and mix well.  Stir in (optional) chips (if you want to top dough with some chips, remove about 1/2 cup and reserve). Spread in 13x9 inch pan.  Sprinkle reserved 1/2 chips on top if using.  Bake for 28 to 30 minutes or until golden and baked through.
