Ingredients:
4 lbs. red sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1" cubes
Zest from 1 orange (1 tsp.)
Juice from 1 orange (1/4-1/2 cup)
1 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp. nutmeg
1/2 tsp. sea salt
3 Tbsp. olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
In a large bowl, add orange zest and juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, sea salt and olive oil.  Stir to combine.
Add sweet potatoes and mix until they are completely coated in mixture.
Spread sweet potatoes on a foil lined cookie sheet so they are almost in a single layer.
Bake at 400 for 30 minutes.  Give them a quick stir, rotate the pan, and return to the oven for 10 more minutes.
