Ingredients:
3 pounds boneless pork loin, cubed
3 tablespoons peanut oil
3 stalks celery, chopped
2 tomatoes, chopped
7 green chile peppers, chopped
4 cloves crushed garlic
4 cups chicken broth
1 (10 ounce) jar prepared green chile salsa
salt to taste

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium high heat, brown the pork in oil, doing so in 2 to 3 batches.
Place the meat in 3 to 4-quart covered casserole and add celery, tomatoes, chilies, and garlic.
Add about 1 cup chicken broth or water to skillet pork was cooked in, stirring over high heat to scrape up browned bits on bottom and bring to boil. Add to pot with enough additional water or broth to barely cover the ingredients. Cover and simmer until stew is thick and meat very tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Add salt to taste before serving. If stew is not hot enough, add a bit of jalapeno salsa.
