Ingredients:
6  potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 cloves garlic, chopped, divided
2 tablespoons butter
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
12 large mushrooms, quartered
3  Roma tomatoes, diced
1  green bell pepper, cut into large chunks
1 slice onion (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a 10x15-inch glass baking dish.
Spread potatoes into the baking dish; drizzle olive oil on top. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and 1 garlic clove over potatoes.
Roast in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
Melt butter in a large skillet over low heat; season with 1 garlic clove, salt, pepper, and garlic-herb seasoning. Add mushrooms, tomatoes, bell pepper, and onion. Cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes.
Remove baking dish from the oven. Flip potatoes and stir in mushroom mixture.
Return baking dish to the oven; continue roasting until potatoes are slightly browned, about 15 minutes more.

Description: 
This is an easy recipe that does not really need accurate measurements to come out well. The time that you bake the potatoes depends on how fat you make the chunks.
