1 tsp. chopped dried thyme
2 tsp. dried rosemary

1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
In a small bowl, stir together thyme, rosemary, olive oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Divide the oil/vinegar/herb mixture between the two bowls. Toss with vegetables until they are coated. Spread root veggies evenly on a large roasting pan.
Roast for 15-20 minutes before adding the other vegetables. Toss together and continue roasting 25 or 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.
