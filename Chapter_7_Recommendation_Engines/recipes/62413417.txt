Ingredients:
1 bunch of fresh swiss chard or spinach (lots as cooking really reduces it)
1/3 pound of whole wheat pasta or Barilla Plus pasta (thin speghetti or feticini preferred)
1 teaspoon of small capers rinsed
1 clove garlic
salt and pepper to taste
parmesean cheese to taste
Extra Virgin olive oil as needed.

Directions:
Wash the chard or spinach thoroughly and spin or dry.  Cut heavy part of stem off if you prefer.  YOu can cook these as you would asparagus.
Add enough of the olive oil to cover the bottom of a large frying pan and heat over moderate to low setting.
Put water on for the pasta and boil the pasta to within one minute of the package direction time.
Add the chard to the heated oil, enough to be able to stir and keep adding until all of the leaves have wilted.  It may be necessary to add oil as you go.  You can add the foamy water from the pasta as well to make a nice tasty liquid for the leaves to cook in.
Mince the garlic or press it and add it to the leaves.
Add the capers and cover.
When the stem portion of the leaves has softened sufficiently, add the drained pasta and stir over medium heat.
If the mixture is not tart enough, you can add a squirt or two of lemon juice.
Season to taste and serve with parmesean cheese.
