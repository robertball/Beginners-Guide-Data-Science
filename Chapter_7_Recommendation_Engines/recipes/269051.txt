Ingredients:
2 cups cubed firm tofu
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
½ clove garlic, chopped
2 cups frozen mixed vegetables
1 teaspoon dried basil
½ teaspoon cumin
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce

Directions:
Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat. Add tofu, vinegar, oil, and garlic; gently stir-fry 3 to 5 minutes. Add mixed vegetables, basil, and cumin. Cook and stir carefully, to avoid breaking the tofu cubes, until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
Add additional vinegar or water if tofu or vegetables stick to the pan. Stir in soy sauce just before serving.

Description: 
Who says vegan food has to be boring? This quick and easy recipe will have you drooling over this hearty main dish of lightly fried tofu, rich spices, and yummy vegetables. Lightly frying the tofu and veggies in mostly red wine vinegar rather than all oil cuts the calories down tremendously. This dish is delicious! One of my favorites and a crowd-pleaser. Goes great with rice.
