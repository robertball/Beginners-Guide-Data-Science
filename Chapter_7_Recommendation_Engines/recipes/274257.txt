Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar, divided
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 tablespoons butter, divided
1 large egg
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1/4 cup sour cream
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Combine flour, 7 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in 4 tablespoons butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Beat egg using a whisk in a bowl. Add pumpkin, sour cream, and ginger; beat until well blended. Stir pumpkin mixture into the flour mixture until a soft dough has formed.
Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface and knead gently 10 times. Roll or gently pat into a 9x6-inch rectangle. Cut dough into 6 squares. Cut each square in 1/2 diagonally, making 12 triangles.
Place the dough triangles 2 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Melt remaining tablespoon of butter and brush over scones. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a scone comes out clean, 10 to 12 minutes.
