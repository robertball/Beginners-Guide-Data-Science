Ingredients:
Pizza dough for large (12-15") pizza
3/4 lb sausage
1/2 lb shrimp
16 oz diced tomato
8 oz tomato sauce
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped green pepper
2-3 chopped serrano peppers
1/2 tbsp oregano
1 tsp minced garlic
1/2 cup mozarella cheese
1 tbsp parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place about 1/4 of the onion plus the garlic in a skillet and warm. When onions are softened, cook sausage and shrimp until done, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper if desired, drain any grease. Ground sausage or sliced whole sausage will work equally well.
Mix cooked meat and onions with diced tomatoes and tomato sauce and half of the oregano, layer this evenly over pizza dough.
Sprinkle remaining onions, green peppers, serrano peppers over the surface. Shake parmesan cheese over pizza, add mozarella cheese and top with remaining oregano.
Cook for about 20 minutes, until the pizza crust is lightly brown.

Description: 
This is a fun pizza recipe which I made on a whim one night, when I was short of hamburger for our traditional family pizza. If you like it spicy, you can go for it with some good hot serrano peppers. If not, cut this part down or leave it out - the green peppers will do fine for taste. The recipe shown here is fairly heavy for one pizza - but that's how we make our pizza, heavy on toppings. You can cut the quantities down slightly if you want, or spread this over two pizzas, adding a little extra tomato sauce. Serve with a tossed salad and a light red wine.
