Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter
1 tablespoon water, or as needed
1 cup water
1/2 cup butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
3 eggs
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon heavy cream
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
To make the dough cut 1/2 cup butter into 1 cup flour using a knife or pastry blender. Add water as needed and mix until crumbly, leaving pea-sized chunks. On a floured surface roll the dough out to 3 or 4 inches in width.  Place on a rectangular cookie sheet.
In a small saucepan over high heat, bring 1 cup water and 1/2 cup butter to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in flour; mix until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Stir in 1 teaspoon almond extract.  Spread filling over dough.
Bake in preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes. The pastry will fall a little as it cools.
Meanwhile, combine confectioners' sugar, cream, 1 tablespoon butter and 1 teaspoon almond extract. Spread icing over pastry as soon as it's removed from the oven.

Description: 
This is a flaky bar-type treat that my mom made many times when I was a kid. It is a tasty almond-flavored treat that is nice at Christmastime!
