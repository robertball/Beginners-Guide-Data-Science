1 cup strawberry preserves
1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans or line them with parchment paper.
Prepare the brownie mix according to package directions, and pour batter into two 8-inch round cake pans. Bake as directed. Cool in pans on a cooling rack.
Run a knife around the outer edge of the cake pans, and tap out one of the rounds onto a serving plate. Spread half of the strawberry preserves over the top. Place the second brownie round on top, and spread the remaining strawberry jam on it. Frost the top and sides of the cake with whipped topping. Arrange the sliced strawberries on top.
