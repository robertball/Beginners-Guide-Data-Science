Description: 
Macaroni Grill made this but then they changed a few ingredients and the name to Pasta Milano. Macaroni Grill was my favorite restaurant but then it closed and I rarely visit other locations. As a child, my family and I would always go to Macaroni Grill for special occasions and order the Bow Tie Pasta.
