Ingredients:
For Cupcakes:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup Stevia In The Raw® Bakers Bag
1/4 cup sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup canned sweet potato puree
1/4 cup sour cream
For Buttercream:
1 cup powdered sugar
1 cup Stevia In The Raw® Bakers Bag
1/2 stick unsalted butter, softened
2 tablespoons milk, or more as needed
1/2 teaspoon maple extract
12 pecans (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup cupcake pan with paper liners.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, baking soda, cloves, and salt.
In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter with stevia and sugar until fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, scraping down bowl and beaters after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Beat in 1/3 of flour mixture, then sweet potato puree, then another 1/3 flour mixture, then sour cream, then remaining flour mixture just until combined.
Divide batter between cupcake cups and bake until lightly browned and firm, about 25 minutes. Let cool completely, at least 45 minutes.
For frosting, in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat sugar, stevia, and butter until smooth and creamy. Add enough milk to reach a smooth, spreadable, but not runny, consistency. Beat in maple extract. If frosting is too loose, refrigerate, covered, until spreadable.
Use a small offset spatula to frost cupcakes. If desired, top each cupcake with a pecan.
