Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes, peeled
1/2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
Spray olive oil
Sea salt

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil, then add peeled sweet potatoes.  Boil for about 15 minutes, until they can be pierced with a fork, but still firm.  Do not overboil, or they will be messy to grate.
Allow sweet potatoes to cool, then grate into a bowl using a box grater.
Carefully mix in Cajun seasoning.
Form sweet potatoes into tater tot-shaped cylinders.
Spray the air fryer basket with olive oil spray, then place tots in the basket in a single row without touching each other or the sides of the basket (depending on the size of your basket, you may need to cook the tots in batches).  Spray the tots with olive oil spray, then sprinkle with sea salt.
Heat the air fryer to 400 degrees, and cook the tots for 8 minutes.  After 8 minutes, turn the tots, spray with more olive oil spray, and sprinkle with more sea salt.  Cook for an additional 8 minutes.
Serve with ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce.
