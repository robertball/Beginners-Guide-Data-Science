Ingredients:
1 cup raw cashews, soaked for up to 4 hours and drained
¼ cup water
1 teaspoon sea salt
juice of half a lemon (about 1½ tablespoons)
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
? teaspoon turmeric
14 oz. can diced tomatoes with green chiles

Directions:
In a high-speed blender, or food processor, combine the first six ingredients, plus the liquid from the can of diced tomatoes and green chiles. (I was able to get about ¼ cup of liquid from the can.)
Blend until a smooth and creamy "cheese" sauce is created.
Transfer the cheese mixture to a large bowl, then add in the can of diced tomatoes and green chiles. Stir well to combine.
At this point, be sure to adjust any flavors to your taste, then warm the dip using a small crock pot, or by heating it gently over a stove top. As the dip is warmed, it becomes even more authentic!
Serve with baked tortilla chips and fresh sliced veggies, for a nutrient-rich party snack!
