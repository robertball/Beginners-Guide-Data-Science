Ingredients:
8 tomatoes
3 Cornish game hens
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
For the Sauce:
2 zucchini, cut into thin rounds
1 small onion, chopped
6 small mushrooms, sliced
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add tomatoes and cook, uncovered, until skins are loosened, about 2 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain. Peel and quarter tomatoes.
Remove the feet and wing tips from the hens before cutting each one in half.
Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat; add butter. Add chicken once butter is bubbling. Fry, flipping once, until evenly browned, about 15 minutes.
Stir the tomatoes, zucchini, onion, mushrooms, garlic, salt, and pepper into the pan with the chicken. Cover and reduce heat. Simmer, basting chicken frequently with the sauce, until bird is no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
