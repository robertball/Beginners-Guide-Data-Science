Ingredients:
2-1/2 cups water
3 cups white wine vinegar
1/4 cup canning salt
3 lb. to 4 lb. green beans (thin are best or cut thick beans in half lengthwise)
4 large garlic cloves, peeled and cut in half lengthwise
4 teaspoons,  crushed red pepper flakes, divided
4 dill sprigs
4 pint canning jars and lids (or 2 quart jars)

Directions:
Wash, rinse, and sterilize the canning jars and lids in boiling water.  Set aside.
Combine the water, vinegar, and salt in a non-reactive saucepan, and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
Trim and string the beans, and rinse under cold water.  If using older, thick beans you need to blanch them for 1 to 2 minutes in boiling, salted water and then plunge them into ice water to halt the cooking process.
When the jars are cool enough to handle, fill them with beans until theyâ€™re somewhat tightly packed in . To each jar add some of the garlic cloves, dill and red pepper.   Carefully ladle the hot brine over the beans making sure to leave 1/2 inch headspace. Wipe the jar rims clean and screw on the two-piece lids. Process in a boiling-water bath for 10 minutes Allow to cool, then  store for three to four weeks for the flavors to ripen.
If not canning the beans, you need to keep them refrigerated for three to four weeks to allow the flavor to develop and penetrate the beans.
