Ingredients:
1 pound pork steak
½ cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ cup butter
3  tomatoes, finely chopped
1 cube beef bouillon
¾ cup water, divided
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Place pork steak between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound with the smooth side of a meat mallet to 1/2-inch thickness. Pat dry with a paper towel.
Mix flour, paprika, salt, and ground black pepper on a plate. Measure out 1 tablespoon of the mixture and set aside. Dredge pork in remaining mixture, coating both sides.
Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add pork; cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Add tomatoes to the skillet; cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes.
Dissolve beef bouillon cube in 1/2 cup water in a small bowl. Stir into the tomatoes. Cook, covered, until sauce thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Return pork steak to the skillet. Reduce heat and simmer until pork is tender and reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 15 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish.
Mix reserved 1 tablespoon flour mixture with remaining 1/4 cup water in a small bowl. Stir into the sauce in the skillet. Cook and stir until thickened, about 4 minutes. Pour sauce over pork and garnish with parsley.
