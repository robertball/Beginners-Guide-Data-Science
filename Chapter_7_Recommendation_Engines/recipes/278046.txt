Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups edamame
2 cloves garlic
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled
4 tablespoons water
4 teaspoons black truffle oil
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 teaspoons soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 (16 ounce) package dumpling wrappers

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil; add edamame. Cook in the boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes.
Strain and transfer edamame to a food processor; add garlic, ginger, 4 tablespoons water, truffle oil, olive oil, soy sauce, and pepper. Puree until completely smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
Set a small bowl of water on the table alongside dumpling wrappers and stuffing mixture.
Take one dumpling wrapper, dip the tip of your index finger in the bowl of water, and rub it along the rim of half of the wrapper rim, making a half-moon shape. Take a small spoonful of stuffing and place in the middle of the wrapper. Gently fold dumpling in half, pressing down the ends so it is sealed. Repeat until all dumplings are made.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add dumplings, cover, and steam until wrapper is soft, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
This creamy edamame filling was punctuated with a dash of truffle oil and it was served in a delicate shallot-Sauternes broth. It was far and away the star of the meal and I was immediately inspired to make my own version back home.
