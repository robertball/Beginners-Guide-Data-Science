Ingredients:
1 (5 ounce) can light tuna in water, drained
1 egg
2/3 cup quick-cooking oats
3 tablespoons barbeque sauce
3 tablespoons chopped green onion
1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon dried savory
1 pinch salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the tuna, egg and oats until blended. Mix in the barbeque sauce, green onion, hot pepper sauce, savory, and salt.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Spoon tablespoonfuls of the tuna mixture into the pan, and flatten slightly. Smaller patties hold together better. Cook until browned on each side, about 3 minutes per side.

Description: 
A fun way to make canned tuna taste less like canned tuna. These thin tuna patties are tasty enough to be eaten plain or in a pita pocket with lettuce and tomato.
