Ingredients:
1 lb fresh broccoli florets
2 table spoons olive oil
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese (preferably grated but not too finely)
Fresh ground black pepper to taste
Sea salt to taste

Directions:
Heat oven to 450 degrees
Break up broccoli into small florets
Mix with enough olive oil to coat lightly
Season with salt and pepper to taste
Wrap broccoli in foil, seal, and place in over for 10 minutes
In 10 minutes, open foil so that broccoli is exposed and sprinkle with Parmesan
Cook for additional 10 minutes or until floret tips begin to blacken and stalk is a greenish-brown
Drizzle with olive oil and some more cheese

Description: 
A simple and quick way to cook broccoli that even picky eaters love. Best part: I don't even use dishes to prepare it (all mixing and cooking happens in the foil).
