Ingredients:
4 Mahi Mahi fillets (or other white fish)
garlic salt
pepper
1 Tbsp. Butter
1 box frozen chopped spinach, defrosted and VERY well drained
1 pound of bacon, cooked and chopped
6 green onions, chopped
3 cloves of garlic, chopped
2 cups of grated Monterey Jack Cheese
2-3 dashes of hot sauce, to taste
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Shake the garlic salt and pepper on both sides of the fish. Grill the fish on med until barely cooked (Just barely starting to flake).
While the fish is cooking, saute the green onions, garlic, and spinach for 2-3 minutes in the butter in a large skillet. Be sure that the spinach is very well drained by squeezing all liquid out or it will be too runny. Add the chopped bacon, hot sauce and half of the milk. Bring to a slow simmer.  Add the Monterey jack cheese a little at a time and allow it to melt.  Add more milk as necessary to create a sauce.
When the fish is done on the grill, place each fillet in a baking dish and top the center of each fillet with the sauce. Sprinkle a little Parmesan on each fillet.  Place under the broiler for 3-5 minutes until the cheese browns.
Excellent served with twice baked potatoes and steamed green beans.

Description: 
A twist on the classic Oysters Rockafeller. My family loves Oysters Rockafeller and I wanted a main meal that would be available any time of the year. It became a hit that is requested frequently. This is also good with tuna or other firm white fish.
