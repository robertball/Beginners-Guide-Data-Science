Do Nothing Cake Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
Cake:
2 CUPS All purpose flour
2 CUPS Granulated sugar
2 Eggs, Slightly beaten
1 tsp Vanilla
1 tsp Baking soda
Pinch of salt
1 Large can 20oz crushed pineapple with juice
Frosting:
2 Sticks (1 cup) Butter
2 CUPS Sugar
1 Can 12oz Evaporated milk
2 CUP Chopped Pecans
2 CUP Shredded coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a large bowl, Whisk together all the batter ingredients until just combined.
Pour into a greased 13×9 baking dish, and bake for 30-40 minutes or until a wooden toothpick, inserted in the middle comes out clean. Don’t over bake.
While cake is still baking, prepare the frosting.
Heat the butter, sugar, and evaporated milk in a small saucepan until boiling.
Cook and stir for about 5 minutes, or until slightly thickened.
Remove from heat and add in the coconut and pecans.
Remove the cake from oven, and using a wooden spoon handle, or some similarly-sized object, begin poking holes in the cake.
You need holes so that hot frosting has plenty of room to get down and soak the cake.
Pour frosting over the hot cake, spreading it out to make sure it’s all evenly dispersed.
Allow cake to cool for a bit before cutting.
