Ingredients:
For Crust:
24 Oreo Cookies, crushed
1/4 Cup melted butter
For Filling:
1 Cup Sugar
3 - 8 oz packages cream cheese
4 large eggs
1/3 Cup green Creme de Menthe liqueur
2/3 Cups Andes Mint Chips or Mini Chocolate Chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Mix the crushed cookies and melted butter together.  Press into the bottom and up one inch of sides of a 9 inch spring-form pan. Set aside.
Beat together sugar and cream cheese until creamy.  Add eggs one at a time.  Stir in Creme de Menthe, then the chips.  Pour mixture into prepared pan.
Wrap the bottom and up sides of outer pan with one large square of heavy duty foil.  Place in a jelly roll or shallow pan and pour 2 cups of water around to create a water bath.  This will prevent the cheesecake from cracking on top. Place on middle rack of preheated oven and bake for approximately 55 minutes or until set.  Crack oven door open and let sit for one hour before removing.  Run knife around edge and allow to cool completely.  Refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours.
