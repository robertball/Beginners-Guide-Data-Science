Ingredients:
1 large jar sauerkraut
1 large carrot, shredded
1 medium onion, diced
1 cup sliced celery
1 green or red pepper, chopped (I prefer red for the color!)
Dressing:
1 1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup vinegar
1/2 cup canola oil (olive doesn't work in this one & I haven't tried avocado yet)

Directions:
Mix veggies and kraut in large bowl.
Add dressing and mix well.
Best if left in fridge several hours before serving.
Keeps very well for a long time.
