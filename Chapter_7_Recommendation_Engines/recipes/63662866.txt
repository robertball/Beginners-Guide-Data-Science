Ingredients:
1 russet potato, peeled
2 sprigs fresh Italian flat leaf parsley
Cooking spray
Salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper & spray lightly with cooking spray.
Using a mandolin, make paper thin slices leaving them in order as cut.
Work with 2 side-by-side matching slices at a time. Place the smaller ones on baking sheet. Using the larger slices toward the middle of the potato, separate the 2 matching slices. Place a perfect parsley leaf onto one & pat so leaves are spread apart, flat & still leaves a border around the edges. Replace matching slice, match up the sides & press together. Place on baking sheet. Continue with remaining slices. Spray lightly with cooking spray & sprinkle lightly with salt.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes, turn each over & continue baking another 5 minutes or until edges are brown & center is lightly golden. Remove from oven. If any are puffed, use the back of a spoon to pat down. Let cool completely. Place in single layers between paper towels in a lightly covered dish & use within 2 hours.
