Ingredients:
12 (8-inch) fat-free flour tortillas
1 pound lean ground turkey
1/2 cup chopped onion
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 (16 ounce) package broccoli coleslaw mix
1 tablespoon canola oil
1/3 cup low-sodium teriyaki sauce
1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 cups shredded reduced-fat Mexican cheese blend

Directions:
Wrap tortillas tightly in foil. Warm in oven at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook the turkey, onion and garlic over medium heat until turkey is no longer pink; drain. Pour into a bowl and set aside.
In the same skillet, stir-fry broccoli in oil for 2 minutes. Add the teriyaki sauce, five-spice powder, garlic powder and pepper; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in cheese and turkey mixture; heat through.
Spoon about 1/2 cup filling off center on each tortilla. Fold sides and ends over fill and roll up. Place seam side down in an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes or until heated through.
