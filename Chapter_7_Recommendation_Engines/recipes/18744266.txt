Ingredients:
1 loaf of Bread or White Texas Toast
4 eggs
1 c milk
2 Tb sugar
1/4 t cinnamon
1 pinch nutmeg
3/4 t vanilla
8 oz cream cheese
6 Tb preserves, your choice
4 Tb butter
2 Tb oil

Directions:
In a small mixing bowl, mix 4 eggs, 1 cup milk, 2 Tbls Sugar, 1/4 tsp Cinnamon, 1 pinch nutmeg and 3/4 tsp vanilla.
Set aside.
Slice 1 loaf French bread into 1 1/2 to 2 inch thick slices or use the thick-sliced Texas Toast bread. Cut diagonally into triangles. Make a deep slit into the long side of each triangle.
Stuff each piece with 1 Tbs preserves and 1 Tbl cream cheese. Soak the stuffed bread in the egg mix until soaked through.
Place on medium heated skillet or grill, when golden brown flip and grill until golden brown. Turn down the heat and allow to rest in the pan or grill until the cheese is melted. Or place on sheet pan and into 325°F oven for about 5 minutes.
Serve with your favorite topping such as caramelized apples or assorted fresh berries. And of course syrup of your choice.
You can also use day-old French bread. Another hint:
You can take the slices, before grilling them, freeze uncovered then wrap each one in plastic wrap and return to freezer. To serve remove from freezer the desired number of slices. Place on a slightly greased baking sheet. Brush each slice with melted butter. Bake in 500°F oven for 8 minutes. Turn slices over; brush with melted butter and bake an additional 10 minutes or until nicely browned.
