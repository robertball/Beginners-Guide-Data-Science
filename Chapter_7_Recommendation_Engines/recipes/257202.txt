Ingredients:
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons Marsala wine
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 center-cut boneless pork chops

Directions:
Whisk mayonnaise, Marsala wine, basil, paprika, garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, celery salt, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add pork chops, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat grill to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and lightly oil the grates.
Remove the pork chops from marinade and shake to remove excess moisture.
Cook pork chops on the preheated grill, basting with marinade every 15 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 30 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
This surprising combination of flavors will have your guests asking for more! Mayonnaise is substituted for oil: not only does it add its creamy texture to the marinade, but it also keeps the raging flames at bay.
