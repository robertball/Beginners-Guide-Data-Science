Ingredients:
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can  cream of asparagus soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can low sodium cream of potato soup
2 1/2 cups 2% milk
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 (6 ounce) container lump crabmeat
1/2 pound peeled and deveined shrimp, cut in 1/2 lengthwise
3/4 cups white wine
fresh chopped parsley
old bay seasoning
fresh green onions, chopped

Directions:
Blend all cans of soup in large pot, stir in milk and cream. Simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently (so milk and cream do not scorch). When boiling point is nearly reached, turn down heat.
Add shrimp and flake crab meat and add to soup. Simmer an additional 5 minutes, then add white wine. Add small amount of butter to surface (optional) and sprinkle with chervil or parsley.
Variations: (1) For a low-fat version, omit butter. Instead of milk and cream, substitute non-fat milk. (2) Instead of canned crab, use fresh or imitation crab. If using fresh crab, be sure to remove all cartilage and shell. (3) Substitute crab with lobster, clams, or mussels (shells or no shells). For an exquisite "seafood bisque," combine all of the above. Yum!
