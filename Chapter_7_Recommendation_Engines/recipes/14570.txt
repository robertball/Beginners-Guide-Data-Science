Ingredients:
2 Cornish game hens, halved
1 cup chopped parsley
3 tablespoons olive oil
5 cloves garlic, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
1 cup white wine

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the garlic, parsley, and 2 tablespoons olive oil.
Rinse hens and pat dry. Rub remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil on the inside and outside of the hens. Stuff the garlic and parsley mixture under skin and around each bird.  Season with salt and pepper. Place seasoned hens in an airtight, plastic container.  Sprinkle with rosemary, and pour wine over birds. Cover, and refrigerate at least overnight to marinate.
Preheat grill for low heat.
Remove hens from marinade, and place on heated grill.  Cook for 40 minutes, turning  once, or until done.

Description: 
There is no question in my mind, marinating for at least 24 hours makes a barbeque!  I don't cook chicken until it's bone dry!  Marinating makes the flavor.
