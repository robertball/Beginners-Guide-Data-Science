Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup applesauce
1/4 cup molasses
3 tablespoons vegetable oil

1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

Stir together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, cloves, ginger, and nutmeg in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to applesauce mixture, stirring until combined. Add water; mix until well combined. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full. Sprinkle lightly with remaining sugar.
