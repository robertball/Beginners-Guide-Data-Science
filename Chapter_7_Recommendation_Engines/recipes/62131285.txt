Description: 
I was looking to make something quick, easy and good.  This was a hit.  Many things could be added to suit your taste (green peppers, parmasean cheese, onions, etc.)  It cooked all day, while we weren't even home and my son (the pickiest eater in the world) loved it.  I served it with a side of pasta.
