Ingredients:
2 lbs chicken breast, chopped
1/2 cup buffalo sauce (I use Frank's Red Hot)
12 oz. mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
2 15 oz. jars alfredo sauce (I use Bertolli Alfredo Sauce)
16 oz Pasta of choice (I Used Barilla Elbow)
2 tbsp. olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Spray a 9x13 baking dish and set aside.
Add oil to a large skillet and cook chicken, about 15 minutes. Add buffalo sauce and cook another 5 minutes.
Combine the alfredo sauce, pasta, and half of mozzarella cheese and set aside.
Spoon half of pasta into the greased baking dish. Top with chicken then add the other half of pasta. Add the Parmesan cheese and sprinkle remaining cheese on top.
Cover with foil and bake 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake another 5-10 minutes or until cheese is bubbly.
Remove from oven and allow to set a few minutes before serving.
