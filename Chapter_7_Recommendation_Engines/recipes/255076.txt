Ingredients:
1/2 pound beef sirloin steak
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 Mexican squash
1/3 large carrot
2 radishes
1/2 avocado, diced
1/2 cup grape tomatoes, halved
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1/2 cup sour cream (optional)
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce (optional)

Directions:
Season steak with garlic salt and black pepper.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak; cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer steak to a cutting board and let rest, about 5 minutes. Slice into thin strips.
Cut Mexican squash, carrot, and radishes into noodles using a spiralizer.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add carrot noodles; cook and stir until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add squash noodles; cook, stirring constantly, until tender, about 5 minutes.
Divide carrot and squash noodle mixture between 2 serving plates. Top with sliced steak. Garnish with radish noodles, avocado, grape tomatoes, and cilantro.
Whisk sour cream and sriracha sauce together in a small bowl. Drizzle over serving plates.
