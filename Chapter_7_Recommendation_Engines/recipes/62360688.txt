Description: 
A wonderful Italian neighbor showed me how to make this recipe after I commented on how good it made the neighborhood smell when she had her windows open when she made it.  This American-Italian term refers to food prepared 'hunter-style,' with mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, various herbs, and sometimes wine.  I found adding cheese gave it something special, it also made it mine.Modified from: Slow Cooker Pork Cacciatore
