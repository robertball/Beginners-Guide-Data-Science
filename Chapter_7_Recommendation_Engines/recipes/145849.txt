Ingredients:
3 fluid ounces fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons white sugar, or as needed
2 fluid ounces vodka
1 fluid ounce triple sec

Directions:
Pour 1/4 to 1/2 inch of sugar onto a small, shallow plate. Moisten the rim of a margarita glass with a wedge of lemon, dip the moistened glass into the sugar; set aside.
Pour the lemon juice, 2 teaspoons of sugar, vodka, and triple sec into a cocktail shaker over ice. Cover, and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into the prepared margarita glass, and serve.

Description: 
This one is worth the extra work! I run whole lemons through a JuicemanÂ®, which produces a thick juice that requires diluting equal parts with water. Makes a generous drink I like to put in a fiesta glass.
