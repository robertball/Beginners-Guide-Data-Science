Ingredients:
2 cups packed brown sugar
1 small can pineapple juice
1 (8 pound) cured, bone-in picnic ham

Directions:
Spread about 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar on the bottom of the slow cooker crock. Place the ham flat side down into the slow cooker - you might have to trim it a little to make it fit. Pour juice over ham. Use your hands to rub the remaining brown sugar onto the ham. Cover, and cook on Low for 8 hours.
