Ingredients:
2 1/2 pound salmon fillet, skinned
3/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup minced red onion
1 tablespoon dijon mustard
2 teaspoons prepared horseradish
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
Horseradish Mayonise
1/2 cup mayonaise
2 tablespoons of prepared horseradish ( or more if you like it hot )

Directions:
Prepare the salmon by chopping the fish until well minced or put in food processor and pulse until well chopped/minced, like hamburger texture. ( PS - Be sure to remove any remaining bones).
In a large bowl, mix the chopped salmon with bread crumbs, red onion, dijon mustard, horseradish, and eggs. Season with rosemary, salt, and pepper. Chill 30 minutes or more in the refrigerator.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
Form the salmon mixture into 6 burger patties. Lightly coat each patty with olive oil.
Place salmon patties on the grill, and cook 2 or 3 minutes on each side.
*Serve on a sesame seed bun with swiss cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and the horseradish mayo !
