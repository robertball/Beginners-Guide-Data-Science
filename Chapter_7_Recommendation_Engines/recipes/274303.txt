Ingredients:
Bread:
2 3/4 cups bread flour
1 (.25 ounce) package rapid rise yeast
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
3/4 cup milk
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup butter, softened
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
cooking spray
1/2 cup dried blueberries
1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
2 teaspoons milk
2 tablespoons sliced almonds
Lemon Glaze:
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons lemon juice

Directions:
Combine flour, yeast, and cardamom in a large mixing bowl.
Combine 3/4 cup milk, sugar, butter, and salt in a small saucepan and heat to 115 to 120 degrees F (46 to 48 degrees C). Pour into flour mixture and beat using an electric mixer until just moistened. Add egg and beat until smooth. Stir in enough additional flour to form a soft, sticky dough.
Turn dough out onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes. Place dough in a bowl coated with cooking spray, turning dough once to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Combine blueberries, lemon zest, and lemon extract in a small bowl. Set aside.
Punch risen dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface; knead fruit mixture into the dough. Divide dough into thirds. Roll each portion into a 16-inch long rope. Place ropes on a 15x10-inch baking pan coated with cooking spray. Cover and let rise until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Lightly brush ropes with 2 teaspoons milk and sprinkle with almonds.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool, about 30 minutes.
Combine confectioners' sugar and lemon juice in a bowl for glaze; drizzle over cooled bread.
