Description: 
There are so many great way to enjoy eggs. I love making a big batch of boiled eggs and using them in different recipes! Have you tried my Egg Salad, Bacon Deviled Eggs, or my Roasted Buffalo Chicken Deviled Eggs? Now you can boil a few more and make this great Paleo recipe. 

Try Lettuce Cups with Smoked Salmon and Eggs and top with avocado or fresh herbs from your garden! I love to drizzle a little extra extra virgin olive oil. 

Enjoy!
