Title:
Pickled Green Beans Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 1/2 c cider or white wine vinegar
1/4 c salt
3-4 pounds green beans
4 large cloves garlic, peeled
4 long, thin, red chilies, fresh or dried
1 T peppercorns, preferably mixed or pink
4 fresh dill sprigs or 4 t dried dill weed

Directions:
Fill a canning kettle two-thirds full of water and bring to a boil.  Wash, rinse, and sterilize the canning jars and lids.
Combine 2 1/2 c water with the vinegar and salt in a nonreactive saucepan, and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
Trim and string the beans, and rinse under cold water.  I prefer very young, thin beans.  If you use, mature, large beans, blanch them for 1-2 minutes in boiling, salted water and then plunge them in ice water.
When the sterilized jars are just cool enough to handle, pack them with beans until they're comfortably tight.  To each jar add a garlic clove and insert two chilies, preferably around the outside.  Then add one-quarter of the peppercorns and the dill.  Ladle the hot brine over the beans, leaving 1/2 inch of headspace.  Wipe the jar rims clean and screw on the two-piece lids.  Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes.  Allow the jars to cool, and then label and store in a dark place for one month for the flavors to develop.

Description: 
These salty, sour vegetable snacks are addictive.  You can use the same technique and brine recipe to make pickled okra, asparagus, hot peppers, pearl or cippolini onions, or an antipasto mix of carrots, celery, peppers and cauliflower.
