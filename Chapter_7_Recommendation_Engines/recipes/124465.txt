Description: 
My mother made this dish years ago, when she was a young girl living in Germany. Later on, she continued to make it for our family. Today when I cook it, the wonderful aroma of sauerkraut fills the house, bringing back many warm memories for me. Mother usually served plain boiled potatoes with this dish, but for a special treat she'd serve steamed dumplings.
