1/2 cup sugar
1 egg
2/3 cup water
1/4 canola oil

In another bowl, whisk egg, water and oil.  Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.  Fold in blueberries.
2.  Fill paper - lined muffin cups two thirds full.  Bake 14-16 min. or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool 5 minutes before removing from pan to wire rack.
Note:  If using frozen blueberries, use without thawing to avoid discoloring the batter.
