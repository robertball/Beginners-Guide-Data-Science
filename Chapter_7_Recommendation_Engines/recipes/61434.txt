Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, separated into florets
1 cup sour cream
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup crushed corn flakes
1/4 cup finely chopped green bell pepper
1/4 cup finely chopped red bell pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
paprika (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart baking dish.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan, and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the cauliflower, and steam until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.  Drain, and set aside.
Combine sour cream, Cheddar cheese, corn flakes, bell peppers, and salt in a medium bowl. Stir in the cauliflower, and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and paprika over the top of the dish.
Bake uncovered until heated through, 30 to 35 minutes.
