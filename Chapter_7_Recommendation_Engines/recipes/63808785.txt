3 pounds chuck roast, trimmed of fat and cubed
28 oz tomatoes, squished by hand the Italian way
1/2 cup beef stock
1 medium onion, chopped
2 C carrots, sliced
3 medium red potatoes, chopped, skin on

1 t dried oregano
1 t dried thyme
1/2 t black pepper
1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, torn
1 T olive oil
1 bay leaf

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit
Pat the chuck roast dry with paper towels and trim all visible fat. Cut into chunks. Place in oven suitable pot with an oven proof lid. Dutch ovens are great for this.
Hand squish and add the tomatoes. You can use two cans of crushed tomatoes if you like. Add the beef stock.
Chop the onion, carrots, potatoes, celery and stir into the pot. Rinse and pat dry the mushrooms, remove the stems, and add to the pot.
Add the spices, fresh basil. Add the olive oil and stir the entire mixture. Insert a bay leaf into the center.
Cover and cook in the preheated oven for about 3 hours. Stir and taste the broth after 2 hours â€“ adjust the seasoning to suit your taste. At 3 hours, test with a fork to see if the veggies are done and the meat tender. Remove from the oven. Take out the bay leaf and allow to rest five minutes, and serve with warm baking powder biscuits.
