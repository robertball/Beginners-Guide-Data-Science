Description: 
Being Canadian, the only time we were able to enjoy this dish was when we travelled to Cali. When searching for a recipe (including this site) I unfortunately could not find the perfect solution. There were so many different variations with either too many ingredients or missing things we love most. I'm a busy Mom and want EASY so I decided to wing it and came up with my own version.
