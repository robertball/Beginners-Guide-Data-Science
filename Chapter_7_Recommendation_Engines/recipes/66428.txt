Description: 
This cornbread containing meat, cheese, peppers, and other ingredients is a family favorite. It's great alone or with a bowl of beans on the side. You may add extra cheese or peppers to suit your own taste. If making a double batch, use 1 can of whole-kernel corn and 1 can of cream-style corn.
