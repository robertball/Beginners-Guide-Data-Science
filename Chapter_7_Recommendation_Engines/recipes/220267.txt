Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 small onion, diced
3 cups water
7 cubes chicken bouillon
1 large russet potato, cubed
6 carrots, cubed
3 cups milk
1 (16 ounce) bag frozen broccoli florets
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons dried chives
1 bay leaf
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pound processed cheese food (such as Velveeta Â®), sliced

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot; cook and stir the onion in the hot oil until soft, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour water and chicken bouillon cubes to the pot; cook and stir until the bouillon dissolves, about 4 minutes.
Stir the potato and carrot into the mixture in the pot; cook another 4 minutes.
Pour milk into the pot; add broccoli, garlic, chives, bay leaf, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper to the mixture, stir, and cook until warm, about 4 minutes.
Stir the sliced processed cheese food into the soup, bring to a simmer, and cook and stir until the cheese food is melted completely into the soup, about 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking until the potatoes and carrots are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Remove and discard the bay leaf to serve.
