Description: 
My daughter had a Melonade at a restaurant out of town, and came home raving about it.  The menu gave the ingredients, but it took some experimenting to come up with proportions that matched the taste as she remembered it.  I'm not much of a drinker, but I find this refreshing and delicious.  I sometimes make mine without the vodka and think it's great as well.
