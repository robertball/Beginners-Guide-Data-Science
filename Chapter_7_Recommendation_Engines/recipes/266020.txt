Ingredients:
2 (1 1/2 pound) whole red snappers
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 lime, halved
1/4 onion, thinly sliced, or to taste
4 sprigs fresh basil, or to taste
kitchen string
1/4 cup pesto
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground fennel seeds
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup oil for frying

Directions:
Season fish cavities with salt and pepper.
Cut 1/2 of the lime into wedges and the other 1/2 into thin slices. Fill fish with lime slices, onion, and basil.
Poke a hole through both sides of the cavity in order to tie it closed. Push a piece of string through the holes using the handle of a spoon. Tie fish shut and trim strings as needed.
Cut a few shallow slashes in a crosshatch pattern on both sides of the fish. Cover with pesto.
Blend flour, fennel seeds, chili powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Dredge fish in the mixture.
Heat 1/2 inch oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add fish. Cover and cook until golden, about 8 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until browned, about 8 minutes more. Remove string and serve with reserved lime wedges.
