Ingredients:
1 12 inch untreated cedar plank
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon honey
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 (5 ounce) cod fillets
1 teaspoon olive oil

Directions:
Soak the cedar plank in water for at least 3 hours.
Combine the rosemary, parsley, garlic salt, and salt in a small bowl. Stir the honey into the melted butter. Brush the cod fillets with the honey butter. Sprinkle the herb mixture over the butter. Refrigerate the seasoned fish for 30 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-low heat.
Brush one side of the cedar plank with the olive oil. Center the fish on the oiled plank. Place plank directly on the grate of the grill. Cook over medium-low heat until fish flakes with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes.
