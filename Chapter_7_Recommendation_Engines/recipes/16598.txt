In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, clams, green onions, water chestnuts, paprika and ground black pepper. Place about 1 teaspoon of filling into the won ton skin and seal corner to corner forming a triangle.
In a large skillet, heat oil to a high temperature. Fry the won tons until they are browned on both sides. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.

Description: 
This is the only way I will eat cream cheese. I thought I would try it, because I love won tons and the kids love cream cheese.  Try it, it's onolicious! I usually use a little bit of beaten egg to seal the won ton skins into their package shape.
