Ingredients:
1 (5 ounce) can of olive oil-packed tuna
1/4 cup, plus 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 dill pickle, chopped
2 tablespoons red onion, minced
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, optional
4 slices Irish cheddar
2 tablespoons whipped cream cheese
4 slices rustic whole grain bread
1 cup potato chips, crushed, but not too finely

Directions:
Combine the tuna (don't drain the olive oil), 1/4 cup of mayo and mustard. Stir to mix. Add the onions and pickles, mix. Divide the mixture in half and spread on one piece of the bread.
Spread the cream cheese on the second piece of bread and arrange the cheese on top of the tuna, top with the slice spread with cream cheese. Spread 1/2 tablespoon of the reserved mayo on the outside of the bread and press that into the crushed chips. Repeat on the other side.
Toast on medium high heat in a dry grill pan or in a panini press until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side, careful not to let it get too dark.
Serve with more chips and pickles.

Description: 
This sandwich gets a crunchy finish with chips embedded onto the bread, very special potato chips that were sent to me from Pennsylvania by my dear friend, MP. But if you can't find Utz, your favorite chip will work just fine.
