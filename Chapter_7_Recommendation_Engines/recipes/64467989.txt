Ingredients:
250g Digestive Biscuits/Graham Crackers
150g Butter (melted)
50g Soft Brown Sugar
1 pack Lime Jello
285ml Boiling Water
100g 'Fluff' Marshmallow spread
100g Butter (softened)
200g Confectioner's Sugar
Kale, to garnish

Directions:
Grease and line a deep baking tray with greaseproof paper.
Using a rolling pin, crush the digestive biscuits into crumbs and place into a bowl.
Add the melted butter and brown sugar to the bowl and mix.
Tip the crumb mixture into the baking tray and press into a sheet for the base of your bites.
Place the tray in the fridge to chill for approx 1hr.
Place the jello cubes in a bowl and add the boiling water. Mix until dissolved.
Pour the jello mixture over the crumb base and return to the fridge for 1 hour or until completely set.
Remove the tray from the fridge and carefully lift the base out using the greaseproof paper - place it on a cutting board.
Cut the base into 3cm squares using a sharp knife.
Combine the softened butter, Fluff and confectioner's sugar in a bowl and whisk to make the topping.
Spoon the mixture into a piping bag and pipe a small swirl onto the top of each square.
Garnish with delicious kale, to taste.
Keep chilled for up to 5 days.

Description: 
Created for the 2015 giShWhes scavenger hunt, these little Dinobites pack a zingy punch! The sweetness of the marshmallow frosting balances nicely with the tang of the lime jello, much like the hunt balances craziness and kindness. True connoisseurs will include the kale garnish, but it is an optional extra!
