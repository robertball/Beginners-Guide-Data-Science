Ingredients:
5 green peppers
1 lb hamburger
1 cup rice
1 can (16 oz) tomato soup
2 cans (16 oz each) tomato sauce
1 small onion
1 tablespoon Worchestershire sauce
1 tsp onion or garlic powder
1 tsp season salt
1 tsp basil seasoning
pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Place the rice and water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and cook 20 minutes.
In a skillet over medium heat, cook the beef until evenly browned.
Remove and discard the tops, seeds, and membranes of the bell peppers. Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward.
In a bowl, mix the browned beef, cooked rice, 1 can tomato sauce, 1 can tomato soup, Worcestershire sauce, and seasonings.  Spoon an equal amount of the mixture into each hollowed pepper.
Pour remaining 1 can tomato sauce over the stuffed peppers.
Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven until the peppers are tender.
