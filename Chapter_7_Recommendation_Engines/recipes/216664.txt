Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, sliced
1/2 red bell pepper, sliced
1 leek, cut into thick wedges
6 carrots, cut into thick wedges
4 potatoes, halved
1 (1/2 pound) sugar pumpkin - peeled, seeded, and cut into thick wedges
2 zucchinis, cut into thick wedges
1 Jerusalem artichoke, sliced (optional)
4 cups water
10 saffron threads
1/2 cup red lentils
1/2 cup cooked chickpeas
1/2 cup frozen broad beans
1/2 cup frozen peas
2 teaspoons salt
1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion and bell pepper in the hot oil until slightly softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the leek, carrots, potatoes, pumpkin, zucchinis, and Jerusalem artichoke to the pot; cover the skillet and cook another 10 minutes.
Stir the water, saffron, and lentils into the vegetable mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low, return cover to the pot, and allow the mixture to simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.
Add the chickpeas, broad beans, and peas to the stew. Season with the salt and pepper. Cover again and continue cooking until the lentils are mushy, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is one of our family staples. It's very quick to prepare. Once all the ingredients are in the pot, all you do is wait for it to be cooked. Serve it over a mound of instant whole-meal couscous. This dish is quite flexible so feel free to play around with the vegetable combination. Try this with fennel, turnip, lima beans, oyster mushrooms, etc.
