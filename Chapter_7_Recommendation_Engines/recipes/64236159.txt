Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds beef, pork, or chicken, cubed
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup flour
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 medium onion, diced
2 teaspoons garlic, minced
32 ounces beef or chicken broth
1 can Rotel-style tomatoes with green chili
3 cups green chili peppers (Anaheim mild) canned or fresh, chopped
2 teaspoons ground cumin
3 medium potatoes, cubed

Directions:
Mix flour, salt, pepper and garlic powder together in a bowl.  Dredge all meat pieces well in the flour mixture and add to the hot olive oil in a large Dutch oven.  Brown the meat well on all sides.  Add onions and garlic.  Continue to saute for 5 or 10 more minutes.  Add the broth, tomatoes and green chili, along with the cumin.  Simmer on stove top for at least 2 or three hours.  One half hour or more before serving, add cubed potatoes, so they don't overcook.  Serve with flour tortillas.
