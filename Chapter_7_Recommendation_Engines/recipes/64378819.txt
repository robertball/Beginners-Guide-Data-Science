Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated crescent dinner rolls
8 large marshmallows
1/4 cup melted butter
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Separate crescent rolls into individual triangles.
In a small bowl, mix together cinnamon and sugar.
Dip a marshmallow into melted butter, then roll in sugar mixture. Place marshmallow into the center of a dough triangle. Carefully wrap the dough around the marshmallow. Pinch the seams together tightly to seal in marshmallow as it melts. Place on a baking sheet. Repeat.
Bake in a preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Crescent dough wraps around butter- and sugar-dipped marshmallows. They become hollow as they bake, representing Jesus' tomb on Easter morning -- when you break them open they are empty inside! A great Easter recipe to share with the kids!Modified from: Resurrection Rolls
