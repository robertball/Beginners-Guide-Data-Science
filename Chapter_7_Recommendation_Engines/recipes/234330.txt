Ingredients:
1 cup water, or as needed
3 small beets, greens removed
3 cups water
1 cup French lentils
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 vine-ripened tomatoes, chopped
4 carrots, shredded
1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, finely chopped
5 green onions, chopped
3 lemons, zested and juiced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour enough water into a baking dish to cover bottom with about 1/2 inch of water; add beets.
Bake in the preheated oven until beets are tender when poked with a fork, about 45 minutes. Transfer beets to bowl of cold water until cool enough to handle.
Bring 3 cups water to a boil in saucepan; add lentils and salt. Reduce heat and simmer until lentils are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Remove beets from water, pat dry, and slice ends and outer skin off each beet. Roughly chop beets and grate in the food processor.
Mix beets, lentils, tomatoes, carrots, cilantro, green onions, lemon zest, and lemon juice together in a bowl; season with salt.
