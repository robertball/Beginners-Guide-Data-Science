Description: 
I absolutely love potato salads. But, they have too many calories (or as we say in my house, kill-ories) to be enjoyed frequently. This is a healthy and absolutely delicious alternative. I couldn't stop eating as I was mixing the salad. You can eat it right away or keep in your fridge for up to a week and enjoy daily.
