Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons butter, softened
3 1/2 cups sugar
1 cup light corn syrup
1 cup water
3 tablespoons maple flavoring

Directions:
Grease a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan with butter; set aside. In a large heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup and water. Cook over medium-high heat until a candy thermometer reads 300 degrees F (hard-crack stage), stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat; stir in maple flavoring. Immediately pour into prepared pan; cool. Break into pieces. Store in an airtight container.

Description: 
During the war, the women at my grandmother's church would donate sugar rations throughout the year so they'd have enough to make candy as a fund-raiser each Christmas. I'm lucky enough to have inherited this tried-and-true recipe.                                   --Dorothea Bohrer, Silver Spring, Maryland
