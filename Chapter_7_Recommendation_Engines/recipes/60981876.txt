2 Tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
6 very ripe bananas, mashed

3 teaspoons baking soda
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease four 7x3 inch loaf pans. In a small bowl, stir together 2 tablespoons white sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Dust pans lightly with cinnamon and sugar mixture.
In a large bowl, cream butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar. Mix in eggs, mashed bananas, sour cream, vanilla and cinnamon. In a medium bowl, whisk together salt, baking soda and both flours. Stir into the butter mixture until just combined. Stir in nuts.  Divide into prepared pans.
Bake for 1 hour, until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.

Description: 
Esther is right! The sour cream makes this one so moist it melts in your mouth. I make it healthier by using light sour cream, whole wheat flour and less sugar and butter - and you know what? No one can tell the difference!Modified from: Banana Sour Cream Bread
