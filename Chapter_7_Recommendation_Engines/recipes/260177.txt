Ingredients:
3 medium bell peppers, with top 1/5th removed, including stem and seeds
2 cups cooked rice
1 package Patak's Butter Chicken for Two
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
1 medium onion, minced
1 cup plain Greek yogurt
3 sprigs fresh mint, finely minced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C).
In a saucepan over medium, saute the onions and chickpeas until onions are translucent.
At the same time, boil a pot of water big enough to submerge the peppers.
Boil peppers for 5 minutes and then remove and turn upside down in order to drain.
Once onion is cooked, add rice and Patak's Butter Chicken for Two.
Saute for 5 minutes.
Place peppers into a baking dish, fill with butter chicken mixture.
Bake for 15 minutes.
While baking, mix mint with yogurt and put aside.
Finish peppers with a healthy dollop of yogurt and a sprig of mint, if you're fancy like that!
