Ingredients:
1 cup cooked rice
1 egg
3-4 Tbsp. cooking oil
1/4 cup frozen peas (optional)
1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Combine the rice, egg and peas and/or cheese, if using.
Heat 1 Tbsp cooking oil in a large no-stick frying pan to medium high.
Drop big spoonfuls of the mixture onto the pan and flatten each cake with the back of the spoon.  Flip when the first side is crispy.  Add oil to the pan as needed.
Drain cakes on paper towels and serve (plain or with ketchup for kids and hot sauce for grownups).

Description:
