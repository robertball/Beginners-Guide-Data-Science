Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 vanilla bean, split (optional)
1 teaspoon unsalted butter
4 cups cherries (with pits)
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup white sugar
3 eggs
3 tablespoons heavy cream
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Combine milk and vanilla bean in a pot and steep for at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch baking dish with butter. Spread out cherries in the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
Combine 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar and salt in a bowl. Add eggs one at a time; beat with an electric mixer after each addition until smooth and creamy.
Remove vanilla bean from milk and discard. Add milk to egg mixture. Pour in heavy cream; mix until smooth. Pour mixture evenly over cherries.
Bake in the preheated oven until top of clafoutis is golden, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar on top. Let cool slightly before serving so that the clafoutis is set. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Description: 
A quick and classic cherry clafoutis, made the authentic French way with the pits still in the cherries. Should you wish to avoid the pits when enjoying this gorgeously simple dessert, you can remove them prior to baking. Clafoutis can be served warm or cool.
