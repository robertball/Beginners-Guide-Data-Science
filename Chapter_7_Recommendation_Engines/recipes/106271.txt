Ingredients:
For the Mango Coulis:
1 cup chopped ripe mango
2 tablespoons mirin
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1/2 cup olive oil
Kosher salt to taste
For the Summer Rolls:
12 (8 inch) Vietnamese spring roll wrappers (rice paper)
1 pound cooked lobster tails, sliced
1 (1/2 pound) avocado, sliced
3 ounces mizuna or similar type peppery salad green
2 teaspoons chopped fresh mint
6 ounces ocean greens, sea vegetables
1 cup hearts of palm, cut into 1/4-inch sticks
2 ounces enoki mushrooms
Kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste

Directions:
Prepare the sauce by pureeing the mango, mirin, lime juice, and olive oil until smooth in a blender. Season to taste with salt, and refrigerate until ready to serve.
Soak a spring roll wrapper in a bowl of warm water until just pliable, about 30 seconds. Gently shake off excess water, and place onto work surface. Place some of the sliced lobster, avocado, mizuna, mint, sea vegetables, heart of palm, and mushrooms in a strip on the bottom edge of the spring roll. Fold once towards the center, then fold in the sides and continue rolling into a cylinder. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
To serve, slice each roll diagonally, and serve two per person accompanied by mango sauce.

Description: 
This Asian fusion recipe combines great summertime flavors. Try to get Haas avocados if possible. Slipper, spiny, rock, or Maine lobster would all work in this recipe.
