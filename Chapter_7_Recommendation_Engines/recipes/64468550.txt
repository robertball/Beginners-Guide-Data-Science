Dinomites Fluffy Bites Recipe

Ingredients:
1 1/2 Cups of Coconut Sugar
1/2 Cup of Coconut Oil
1/2 Cup of Coconut Milk ( from the can)
2 Teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 Teaspoon sea salt
2 1/2 Cups Finely Shredded Coconut
1 cup Big Flake Coconut
2/3 Cup Dark Chocolate Chunks
3 drops of Dragon Tears
2 pinches of kale
1 dash of virgin blood

Directions:
1-In a large saucepan, combine the coconut sugar, coconut oil, and coconut milk. Bring the mixture to a boil, and boil for 2-3 minutes until the caramel thickens, stirring constantly to keep the caramel from sticking.
2-Remove the caramel from the heat and add the vanilla, sea salt, and coconut. Stir to combine. If you're using the almond or cashew butter, mix it in thoroughly. Finally, add the chocolate chunks and combine, stirring as little as possible to keep the chunks intact.
3-Portion the cookie on a parchment lined baking sheet and let cool. This version of no-bakes takes a full 3-4 hours to fully set up, but you don't have to wait that long because they're really good warm and gooey.
4-For extra Fluff, buy Fluff and add to recipe.
5-Add tears, blood, and kale
