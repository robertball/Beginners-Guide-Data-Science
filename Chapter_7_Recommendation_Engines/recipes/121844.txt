Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
salt and pepper to taste
4 bone-in pork loin chops, 1 inch thick
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1/3 cup maple syrup
1 tablespoon cornstarch
3 tablespoons water
2/3 cup packed brown sugar

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine flour, salt and pepper. Add pork chops and shake to coat. In a skillet, brown chops on both sides in butter. Place in an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 450 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until juices run clear.
Meanwhile, in a skillet, bring the vinegar to a boil. Reduce heat; add maple syrup. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. Combine cornstarch and water until smooth; add to the maple mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.
Place chops on a broiler pan; sprinkle with brown sugar. Broil 4 in. from the heat for 2-3 minutes or until sugar is melted. Drizzle with maple glaze.

Description: 
Everyone cleaned their plates when my mother made these succulent tangy sweet pork chops when I was growing up. Now, I get the same results when I serve them to my family alongside applesauce and au gratin potatoes.
