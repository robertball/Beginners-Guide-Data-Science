Ingredients:
Crust
36 Reduced-Fat Chocolate Wafers
1/4 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
5 tablespoons light butter, melted
Peanut Butter Center
1/2 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
3 tablespoons reduced fat peanut butter
3 tablespoons reduced fat cream cheese
Chocolate Filling
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate
8 ounces reduced fat cream cheese
1 3/4 cups SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1/2 cup skim milk
1/2 cup egg substitute
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 ounces sugar-free chocolate, melted (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Make CRUST.  Crush cookies into fine crumbs.  Blend all crust ingredients together in a small bowl.  Stir until well blended. Set aside.
Make PEANUT BUTTER CENTER.  Place all center ingredients in a small bowl.  Mix until well blended.  Set aside.
Make CHOCOLATE FILLING.  Melt chocolate in small saucepan over low heat.  Set aside. Place cream cheese and SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener in a small mixing bowl.  Beat until soft.  Slowly add skim milk. Mix, using a wire whisk, until smooth.  Add melted chocolate.  Stir well.  Add egg substitute and vanilla.  Mix until well blended.  Set aside.
Assemble CUPS.   Place 24 mini size foil baking cups on a sheet pan. Evenly divide crust between the 24 baking cups.  Firmly press crusts into the bottom of the cups.  Place approx. 1/2 tsp of the peanut butter center in the center of each crust-lined baking cup.  Spoon chocolate filling into each baking cup.  Firmly tap sheet pan on countertop to remove any air bubbles.
Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven 10-15 minutes, or until slightly firm to the touch.  Chill for approx. 2 hours before serving.  Drizzle optional melted chocolate over the top for a garnish.
