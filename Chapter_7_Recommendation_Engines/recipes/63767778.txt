Ingredients:
1 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 (1/2 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
1/4 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/8 cup milk
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (10.75 ounce) cans  condensed cream of chicken soup
1/2 (1/2 ounce) packet dry au jus mix
1/3 cup water

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, onion soup mix, bread crumbs, and milk using your hands. Shape into 8 thin patties.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge the patties in flour just to coat, and quickly brown on both sides in the hot skillet. Place browned patties into the slow cooker stacking alternately like a pyramid. In a medium bowl, mix together the cream of chicken soup, au jus mix, and water. Pour over the meat. Cook on the Low setting for 4 or 5 hours, until ground beef is well done.
