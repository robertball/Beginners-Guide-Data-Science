Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked white rice
4 cups water
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
2 teaspoons white wine vinegar
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into thin strips
3 tablespoons chopped garlic
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger root
3/4 cup chopped green onions
2 1/2 cups broccoli florets
1/3 cup unsalted dry-roasted peanuts

Directions:
Combine the rice and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until rice is tender. In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, peanut butter, vinegar, and cayenne pepper. Set aside.
Heat oil in a skillet or wok over high heat. Add chicken, garlic and ginger, and cook, stirring constantly, until chicken is golden on the outside, about 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium, and add green onion, broccoli, peanuts, and the peanut butter mixture. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until broccoli is tender, and chicken is cooked through. Serve over rice.

Description: 
This is a very tasty Asian-inspired dish made with chicken and broccoli in a spicy peanut sauce. If you like it mild, use less cayenne, like it spicy, use more. If you're salt conscious, use low sodium soy sauce.
