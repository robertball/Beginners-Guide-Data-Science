Ingredients:
3 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate
2 tablespoons butter
½ cup light corn syrup
½ cup white sugar
¼ cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a saucepan on very low heat, carefully melt the chocolate and butter, stirring constantly. Add the corn syrup, sugar, and milk. Increase heat to medium-high, bring to a boil, and cook for 5-8 minutes, stirring only occasionally, until the mixture becomes a candy-like, gooey fudge. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Let chill to spreadable consistency.
