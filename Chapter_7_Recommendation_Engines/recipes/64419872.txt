Ingredients:
2 oz. chocolate (65% cacao)
1/3 cup butter
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon espresso powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
2 tablespoon cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 egg whites
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Heat oven to 325 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly cover with non-stick spray.
Place chocolate and butter in a microwave safe bowl and heat in 30-second bursts until melted (making sure to stir in between).  Once melted, stir in sugar, espresso powder and vanilla extract; set aside.
Whisk together flour, cocoa powder, salt and baking soda; set aside. Beat egg whites until eggs are frothy, about 3-4 minutes. Add in chocolate mixture and beat until combined. Mix in the flour mixture until just combined. Batter will be very thick.
Spread batter onto parchment, using an offset spatula to spread mixture as thin as possible. Sprinkle mini chocolate chips on top. Bake at 325 degrees F for 25 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool in pan. Break up brittle with hand.
****If you want the brittle to have uniform cut pieces. remove pan at 20 minutes, using a knife score to preferred size. Return pan to oven for another 5 minutes to bake. Remove from oven and allow to cool in pan and break apart at scored marks.
