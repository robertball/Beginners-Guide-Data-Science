Ingredients:
16 ounces multigrain farfalle (bow-tie) pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound mild Italian sausage, diced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 small red bell pepper, chopped
2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
1 medium zucchini, thinly sliced
1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon adobo seasoning
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in sausage and garlic and cook until sausage is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and stir in bell pepper; bring to a boil. Add cherry tomatoes and zucchini, cover, and cook for about 4 minutes.
Reduce heat to low and stir in Parmesan cheese, butter, adobo seasoning, oregano, and black pepper. Let simmer until sauce has thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in cooked pasta and serve.
