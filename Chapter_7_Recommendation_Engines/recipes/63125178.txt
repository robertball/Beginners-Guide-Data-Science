Ingredients:
6 whole pork chops (medium to thin)
2 tbs olive oil
2 tbs butter
salt
pepper
1 1/2 cup red wine
1/2 cup beef broth (more if needed)
1 whole bay leaf
1 tbs balsamic vinegar
18 whole peeled garlic cloves
1 tbs butter

Directions:
Heat oil and butter in a heavy skillet over high heat.  Salt and pepper both sides of pork chops and sear them on both sides until they're nice and golden, about 2 minutes per side.  Remove the chops from the skillet and set aside.
Reduce the heat to medium high then throw in the garlic cloves.  Stir them around and cook them for several minutes, or until they get nice and golden brown.  Pour in the red wine, then add the bay leaf.  Stir around and let it reduce, raising the heat if necessary.  Cook the sauce for several minutes, or until it's nice and reduced and thick.  Stir in the beef broth (you can add more if it needs the liquid) and add the chops back into the cooking liquid, arranging them so that they're swimming in the sauce.  Allow the chops to cook in the liquid for a few minutes.  Add the balsamic vinegar.  Shake the pan to get it to distribute, then cook for a couple more minutes, or until the pork chops are done.  Remove the chops from the pan once more, then let the sauce reduce a little more if needed until it's very thick and rich and the garlic is soft.  Swirl in 1 tbs butter and sprinkle in a little salt and pepper.
Arrange pork chops on a platter, then pour the whole skillet of sauce (including garlic) over the top.  Serve with a green salad.  *You may substitute white wine for a slightly lighter sauce*
