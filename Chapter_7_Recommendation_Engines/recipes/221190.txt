Ingredients:
olive oil cooking spray (such as PAMÂ®)
4 unsalted matzo boards, or more to taste
1 cup unsalted butter
1 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed
3/4 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spray with cooking spray.
Arrange matzo to fit into pan; break boards if necessary.
Combine butter and brown sugar together in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly until boiling; boil for about 3 minutes.
Pour butter mixture evenly over matzo.
Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and immediately reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) if the matzo are smoking too much.
Remove baking sheet from oven and sprinkle matzo with chocolate chips. Let stand to melt chocolate, 5 minutes.
Spread the melted chocolate over matzo. Place in refrigerator until chilled and set. Break into pieces when cooled.
