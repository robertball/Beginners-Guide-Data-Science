Ingredients:
6 blackberries, plus more for garnish
1 1/2 teaspoons honey
1 1/2 fluid ounces spiced rum
1 1/2 cups crushed ice

Directions:
In a cocktail shaker, muddle blackberries and honey until berries are well smashed. Add spiced rum and 1 cup of the ice. Shake until well chilled. Pour contents of shaker into an old-fashioned glass. Mound with remaining 1/2 cup ice. Garnish with additional blackberries and serve with a straw.

Description: 
Crushed ice, and plenty of it, is key to this and other smashes. It's what, in pre-freezer days, made this cocktail style seem so very indulgent. A cobbler is a smash that involves fresh fruit and is usually served with a straw.
