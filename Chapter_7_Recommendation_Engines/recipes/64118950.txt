Ingredients:
1 1/4 cup cake flour, sifted
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/4 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp. salt
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 1/2 Tbs butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees
Coat the doughnut tin with melted butter or spray.
Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add buttermilk, egg, and butter and stir until just combined.
Fill each doughnut cup approximately 1/2 full.
Bake 4-6 minutes (for my oven, 5 min is perfect) or until the top of the doughnuts spring back when touched. 5 minutes doesn't allow for a browning of the doughnuts, instead it makes them soft and pillowy
Let cool in a pan for 4-5 minutes (again, 5 minutes is perfect) before removing. Finish doughnuts with glaze or sprinkles.
