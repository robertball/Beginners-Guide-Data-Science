Ingredients:
1/4 cup canola oil
1 large onion, diced
2 carrots, peeled and diced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 fresh chile pepper, minced
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
3 tablespoons curry powder
2 (14 ounce) cans vegetable broth, divided
1 cup lentils
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat canola oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion, carrots, salt, black pepper, and sugar until onion is a deep brown color, 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; add garlic, chile pepper, ginger, and curry powder. Stir constantly to incorporate, about 5 minutes.
Increase heat to medium-heat and stir 1 can vegetable broth into the onion mixture. Scrape up any vegetables or curry powder stuck to the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Add lentils and remaining 1 can of vegetable broth; cook until lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. Stir cilantro into lentils before serving.

Description: 
This recipe can be eaten as a main or side dish. The key to developing the flavor (and not missing the meat) is caramelizing and developing deep browning of the onions and carrots. In the Caribbean, cooks call this 'burning' the onions.
