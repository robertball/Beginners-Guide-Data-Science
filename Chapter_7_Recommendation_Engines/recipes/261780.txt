Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) packages Brussels sprouts
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
2 teaspoons smoked paprika, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Trim stems off Brussels sprouts. Quarter large sprouts lengthwise; halve small ones. Rinse and dry completely.
Toss sprouts in a bowl with 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 teaspoon paprika. Spread out on a baking sheet and sprinkle with sea salt.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, removing loose leaves after 5 minutes and turning whole sprouts every 5 minutes.
Whisk remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, remaining 1 teaspoon paprika, heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, red wine vinegar, lemon zest and juice, garlic, and brown mustard together in a bowl.
Transfer whole sprouts and any loose leaves to a bowl; pour in cream mixture and toss to combine.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite recipes that is perfect for any season. These are rich and tangy and smoky brussels and I've found this is my favorite way to prepare them. Coat with bread crumbs and serve warm or cold.
