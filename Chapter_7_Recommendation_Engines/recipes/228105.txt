Ingredients:
16 1/2-inch thick slices of cucumber
1/2 cup coarsely chopped cooked ham
3 tablespoons reduced-fat mayonnaise
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon curry powder

Directions:
Use a melon baller to scoop out the center of each cucumber slice, leaving the bottom of the slice intact to make a small cup.
Place ham, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, and curry powder in a food processor and pulse a few times to mince and combine the filling.
Spoon about 2 teaspoons filling into each cucumber cup.
