Ingredients:
4 teaspoons cumin seeds
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 onions, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes
1 bunch cilantro, finely chopped
2 roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
2 tablespoons chili powder
3 teaspoons mild paprika
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1 (15 ounce) can white beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 teaspoon sherry vinegar, or to taste

Directions:
Toast cumin in a skillet over medium heat until fragrant, being careful not to burn it, about 1 minute. Cool and grind in a mortar and pestle.
Heat oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-low heat and cook onions until soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in cumin, tomatoes, cilantro, roasted red peppers, chili powder, mild paprika, oregano, smoked paprika, cayenne, and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add all beans and simmer over low heat until flavors are well combined, at least 30 minutes. Season with more salt and sherry vinegar.

Description: 
I like chili con carne only with lots of different beans and no meat substitutes. Try it for yourself! It's a family favorite in our house.
