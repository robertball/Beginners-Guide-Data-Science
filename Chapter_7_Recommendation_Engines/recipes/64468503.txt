Ingredients:
1 cup shredder zucchini  (about 2 small zucchini)
1 egg
1/3 cup bread crumbs
1/3 cup shredded cheese
Pam (the cooking spray, not the woman from Archer) or similar non stick spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Words of encouragement to your appliance are encouraged. Squeeze shredded zucchini tenderly between several sheets of paper towels. Just kidding. Get as much water out as humanly possible. So not tenderly. The more water you get out, the crunchier your bites will be. Dump in cheese and breadcrumbs and mix, preferably with a spoon but hands work too. Add egg. If you've been using your hands, be prepared for unforgiving cold and gooeyness to squish through your tender exposed fingers. Now grab a mini muffin tin. Preferably yours, this recipe does not condone kitchen utensil theft under any circumstances. Spray thoroughly with cooking spray so that the demons of food stickage cannot touch your fluffy bites. Spoon mixture into muffin tin, making sure not to overfill each cup. Just don't overfill man. Pat each gently to pack and sing a nursery rhyme. It calms them. Place into oven for 15 to 18 minutes or until tops are slightly browned. Remove from oven. Use oven mitts. Third degree burns aren't cool. Allow to cool before making customary offering to the Dinomite and annoying your fluffy bites!
