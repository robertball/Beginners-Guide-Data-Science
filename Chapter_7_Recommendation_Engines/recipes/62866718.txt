Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups wheat flour
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup ground flax seed (optional)
1/2 cup unsweetened baking cocoa (I used Ghiradhelli)
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cardamon
4 eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
3 cups grated zucchini
1 pint blueberries
2 tablespoons flour

Directions:
Makes 8-12 mini loaves or 2 large loaves.
1.  Preheat oven to 375.  Grease bread pans.
2.  Whisk together oil, sugars, vanilla extract, & eggs.
3.  Add in grated zucchini.
4.  Next, add in all the dry ingredients.  Mix until everything is combined.
5.  In a separate bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of flour with the blueberries.  (Side note, the flour prevents the blueberries from sinking to the bottom of the batter).  Gently fold blueberry mixture into the batter.
6.  Fill mini loaf pans until 2/3 full.  Bake for 20-25 minutes.  If making large loaves, bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Please note, every oven is different, so baking time may be different.  Remove from oven when an inserted toothpick in the center of the bread comes out clean.

Description: 
Getting my super picky kids to eat vegetables is always a challenge.  My oldest loves chocolate & my youngest loves blueberries, so I combined the two into one recipe.  I used a blend of whole wheat & white flours, added some flax seed, & tried to keep both sugar & fat content on the lower end.  Enjoy!
