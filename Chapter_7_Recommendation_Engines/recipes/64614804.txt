Ingredients:
1/2 - onion, chopped
1 tablespoon - oil
1 pound - beef steak, sliced into thin strips
2 cloves - garlic, minced
1 head - broccoli, chopped
2 - carrots, chopped
1/2 - red pepper, chopped
4 cups - cooked brown rice
For the sauce:
1/2 cup - broth (chicken, beef, or vegetable), low sodium
1/4 cup - soy sauce, low sodium
1 tablespoon - vinegar
1 tablespoon - corn starch
2 teaspoons - honey

Directions:
Whisk together the 5 sauce ingredients and set aside. Chop all veggies and slice meat, if not already done. Set rice to cook ahead of time.
In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat and add chopped onion. Saute until slightly translucent. Add garlic and veggies and cover, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until vegetables begin to soften.
Meanwhile, cook beef in a separate skillet until brown, then add to veggies.
Pour sauce over everything and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 5-10 minutes, until veggies are done to liking and sauce has thickened a bit. Sauce will continue to thicken off the heat.
Serve over brown rice and garnish with green onions or sesame seed, if desired.

Description: 
Serve your stir-fry over rice, or even noodles if that’s your kind of thing. As always, we recommend brown rice because it’s so nutritionally superior to white rice! But, if brown rice is a battle for you, at least you’re getting veggies and healthy protein in for your family!
