Ingredients:
1 (8 pound) spiral cut bone-in cured ham
1 1/2 cups ketchup, or as needed
1 cup packed brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the ham in a baking dish or roasting pan with the flattest side down. Cover with ketchup then use your hands to pack brown sugar into the ketchup. Cover the ham loosely with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and sugar has caramelized, about 1 hour.

Description: 
Not a fan of ketchup or sugar, myself, I'm shocked that not even I can get enough of it.  The flavors are tangy, sweet, smoked and salty all at the same time...such a trip for the tongue!
