Ingredients:
- 16 oz. bag frozen broccoli/
cauliflower/carrots
- 14 oz. package fully-cooked beef hot links, cut into 1/4” slices
- ½ cup rice
- 1 cup chicken broth
- Seasonings to taste

Directions:
Add rice and broth to bottom of large skillet.  Top with vegetables, hot links and seasonings (I like to use a Cajun seasoning mix in this dish).  Bring to a boil, reduce to low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes until broth is absorbed and rice is tender.  Serve!

Description: 
This is a delicious and hearty complete meal that can be thrown together in a few minutes, but it sure doesn't taste like it!  It's also very versatile - you can substitute just about any frozen vegetable under the sun, as well as regular or turkey smoked sausage for the hot links.
