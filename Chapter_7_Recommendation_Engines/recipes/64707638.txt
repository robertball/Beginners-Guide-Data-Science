Ingredients:
1 pound pork sausage
8 large eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
1 tsp salt
1 tsp ground mustard
6 slices white bread
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a skillet, brown and crumble sausage; drain and set aside. In a large bowl, beat eggs; add milk, salt and mustard. Toast bread and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Stir in bread cubes, cheese and sausage.
Pour into a greased 11x7-in. baking dish. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 350Â° for 40 minutes or until a knife inserted in center comes out clean.
For variation, I sometimes go with different flavored sausage .. sage, maple or hot.
