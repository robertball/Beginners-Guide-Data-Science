Ingredients:
o 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil
o 4 medium onions, chopped
o 6 garlic cloves, minced
o Coarse salt and ground pepper
o 6 packages frozen chopped spinach (10 ounces each), thawed and squeezed dry
o 1 pound feta cheese, crumbled
o 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
o 1/2 cup plain dried breadcrumbs
o 2 teaspoons dried dill
o 8 large eggs, lightly beaten
o 8 ounces frozen phyllo sheets, thawed and thinly sliced

Directions:
1. Make the filling: In a large nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Add onions, and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and 2 teaspoons salt; cook until garlic is tender, 1 to 2 minutes.
2. Transfer mixture to a large bowl; stir in spinach, feta, Parmesan, breadcrumbs, dill, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Fold in eggs until combined.
3. Divide mixture evenly between two 9-inch springform pans or two 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie plates; press firmly to flatten.
4. Make the topping: In a large bowl, gently toss sliced phyllo to separate, then toss with remaining 1/2 cup oil until coated.
5. Divide phyllo between pies, covering the tops evenly and completely. (To freeze, cover pies tightly with plastic wrap, being careful not to flatten topping. Bake within 3 months; do not thaw first.)
6. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Bake until heated through and topping is golden brown, about 1 hour 15 minutes for frozen pie (30 minutes for unfrozen pie).
