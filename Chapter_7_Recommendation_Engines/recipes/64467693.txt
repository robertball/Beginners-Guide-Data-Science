Ingredients:
3 lbs. of potatoes
½ cup of sour cream
8 oz. cream cheese
1 small white onion, minced
½ tsp. white pepper
3/4 cup bacon, cooked and diced (about 12 slices)
5 jalapenos, finely diced
Egg
Panko breadcrumbs
Canola oil

Directions:
Peel and cut potatoes into 1” size cubes.  In a large saucepan, cover potatoes with water and bring to a boil.  Cook for until tender (15-20 minutes).  Drain and return to saucepan.
Add cream cheese, sour cream, onion and white pepper.  Whip with mixer until light and fluffy.  Fold in the bacon and jalapenos.
Allow mixture to cool until it is manageable by hand.
Whip eggs in bowl.  Shape potato mixture into 2” balls, dip in the egg, and then dredge in panko breadcrumbs.
Heat 2” of oil in a deep skillet (or electric skillet) to 375F.
Fry 2 or 3 balls at a time until golden brown (about 1 – 1½ minutes).
Remove from oil and drain on paper towel. Salt to taste and serve warm.
