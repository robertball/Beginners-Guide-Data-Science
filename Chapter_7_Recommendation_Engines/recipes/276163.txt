Ingredients:
1 small sugar pumpkin, halved and seeded
cooking spray
2 cups frozen cauliflower
3/4 cup skim milk
1/2 cup evaporated fat-free milk
1 teaspoon brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon ground marjoram
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spray cut sides of pumpkin with cooking spray. Place pumpkin halves, cut-sides down, in a roasting pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until pumpkin is soft, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven, and allow to rest until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Scrape pumpkin flesh into a blender and discard skins.
While pumpkin is cooling, place frozen cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until fork-tender, about 3 minutes. Add cauliflower to the blender with pumpkin flesh. Add skim milk and evaporated milk and puree until smooth. Transfer mixture to a microwave-safe bowl and stir in brown sugar, marjoram, cinnamon, salt, and pepper.
Microwave on high until soup is heated through, 3 to 4 minutes.

Description: 
This rich and flavorful pumpkin and cauliflower soup combines all the best tastes of fall--so easy to make, just use your blender! I like to serve this with a dollop of light sour cream and a sprinkling of bacon bits!
