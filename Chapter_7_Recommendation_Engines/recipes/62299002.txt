Ingredients:
3 cups water
1 cup milk
1 Tbsp. butter
1 cup steel cut oats
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 cups raisins (optional)

Directions:
Bring the water and milk to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium heat.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat, then add the oats and toast, stirring constantly until golden and fragrant with a butterscotch like smell, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.
Stir the toasted oats into the simmering liquid, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer gently until the mixture thickens and resembles gravy, about 20 minutes.
Stir in the salt and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the oats absorb almost all the liquid and the oatmeal is creamy, about 10 minutes longer.
Remove from heat and stir in the raisins (if using).
Let the oatmeal stand for 5 minutes before serving.
