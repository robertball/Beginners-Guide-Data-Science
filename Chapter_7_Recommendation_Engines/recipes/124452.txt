Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes, cooked and peeled
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 tablespoons water
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 dash ground nutmeg or ground mace

Directions:
Slice sweet potatoes into an 8-in. pie plate; set aside. In a saucepan, combine brown sugar, butter, water and salt; bring to a boil. Pour hot syrup over potatoes. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes, basting occasionally, or until syrup thickens and potatoes are glazed. Sprinkle with nutmeg or mace.

Description: 
I like this recipe because it can be prepared for two, or easily increased to accommodate a large gathering. The color and taste of sweet potatoes make them a must for any holiday dinner!
