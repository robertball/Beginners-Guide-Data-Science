Ingredients:
1 tablespoon sweet cream butter
1/2 cup brown rice
1/2 cup coconut milk
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Cook butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until beginning to brown, 2 to 3 minutes.
Grind uncooked rice in a blender until grains are broken; add to butter, cook and stir until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Stir coconut milk, water, sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl to dissolve sugar; gradually add to rice, stirring constantly.
Reduce heat to low, cover saucepan, and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.
