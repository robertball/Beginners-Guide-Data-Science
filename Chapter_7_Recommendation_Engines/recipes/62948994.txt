Pumpkin Spice Biscotti Recipe

Ingredients:
1/3 cup Butter
1 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1/4 cup molasses
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 Tablespoon baking powder
1 Tablespoon ground ginger
3/4 Tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 Tablespoon ground cloves
1 Tablespoon pumpkin spice
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line baking sheet with parchment paper (so much easier than greased baking sheets).
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth (I use my kitchenaid). Beat in the eggs one at a time, and then add the pumpkin puree and Molasses. Combine the flour, baking powder and spices.  Stir into the creamed mixture until mixed well. The mixture should be quite stiff when ready.
Divide the dough equally into 2. Shape into 9x2x1 inch loaves. Place onto the parchment lined baking sheet, 4 inches apart. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven until firm.
Remove the loaves along with the parchment paper and place on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes. (Do not let it cool for longer, as this is often one of the problems why people have crumbling Biscotti.)
Remove the loaves from the parchment and cut each of the loaves into 15 slices using a sharp serrated knife. Return the slices to the baking tray (no need to use the parchment paper) and bake on each side for a further 15 minutes until dry, taking extra care to make sure they donâ€™t burn.
Leave to completely cool on the wire rack, once cool drizzle with melted chocolate and pecans.
