Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
6 bone-in chicken breast halves, with skin
4 slices bacon
3 cups red wine
1 cup chicken stock
3 cloves garlic, smashed
2 sprigs rosemary
1 bay leaf
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook chicken breasts in hot oil until browned on both sides, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer browned chicken to a slow cooker.
Cook bacon in the same skillet, turning occasionally, over medium-heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to the slow cooker.
Stir red wine, chicken stock, garlic, rosemary, bay leaf, salt, and pepper into the slow cooker.
Cook chicken mixture in the slow cooker set to Low until chicken is tender, 4 to 5 hours.

Description: 
Love making this dish! It's super easy and looks fancy when it's done. I always seem to have open red wine on hand and making this is a great way to use it up! The chicken soaks up the red wine and bacon flavor and stays tender. Garnish with fresh parsley and a rosemary sprig and enjoy!
