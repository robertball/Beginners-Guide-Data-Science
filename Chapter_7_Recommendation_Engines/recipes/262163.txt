9 cups water, separated

1/2 cup lemon juice
6 cloves whole cloves, or more to taste
2 cinnamon sticks

Directions:
Bring 8 cups water to a boil in a large stockpot. Remove from heat. Add tea bags; steep, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and discard tea bags and return pot to medium heat.
Bring 1 cup water to a boil in a separate pot. Add sugar; stir well until dissolved. Pour mixture into the stockpot with the tea. Add pineapple juice, orange juice concentrate, and lemon juice. Stir.
Put cloves in a tea ball and place into the stockpot with the tea-juice mixture. Cook for 10 minutes; do not boil. Turn heat down to very low; let simmer until flavors blend, 15 to 20 minutes more.

Description: 
Nothing powdered or instant here. Just pure natural flavors to sip on a cold winter day. Smells great while it's brewing too. Vitamin C never tasted so good!
