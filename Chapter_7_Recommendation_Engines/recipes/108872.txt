Ingredients:
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pound skinless salmon fillet, cut into 6 - 3/4 inch strips
coarsely ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler to 500 degrees; set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Combine the balsamic vinegar and the garlic in a small bowl; reserve.
Roll the salmon strips, beginning on the thickest side, into 6 pinwheels. Secure with wooden skewers. Drizzle the balsamic and garlic mixture generously over each pinwheel.
Place salmon under hot broiler and cook for 7 minutes. Turn pinwheels over; cook until edges are brown, and fish is easily flaked with a fork, about 7 additional minutes. Sprinkle with pepper before serving.

Description: 
Super easy way to make great salmon.  The uniform thickness of the pinwheels makes broiling super easy and the pinwheel allows the seasoning to saturate the fish. Good balsamic makes the difference in the flavor. Presentation is great!
