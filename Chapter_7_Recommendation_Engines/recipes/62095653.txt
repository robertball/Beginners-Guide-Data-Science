Ingredients:
1 tbs plus 1 tsp yeast
1/4 cup warm beer
1 egg yolk
1 egg
1 tsp salt
3 tbs sugar
1 1/2 cup hot milk
4 cups bread flour

Directions:
First mix together the beer and yeast in a separate cup, and let them sit together. Preheat over to 375 degrees.
In a large bowl beat together the egg and extra yolk, then add the salt and sugar and beat till mixed.
Gradually add the hot milk to the egg mixture, stirring constantly to keep the eggs from curdling.
Scoop in the yeast mixture and add to the egg and milk mix, and stir it well.
Finally add the flour, and stir together well. The mixture will be like a thick batter. Do not knead.
Place the batter in a greased 6x10 inch bread pan and cover with a wet cloth or grased plastic wrap.
If the ingredients have been properly mixed and prepared, the bread will fully rise in 15 minutes. If you haven't made the batter warm enough or the yeast was not properly dissolved, it may take longer. The bread should be at least one inch over the rim of the pan.
Bake the bread for 30 to 40 minutes. When ready, it will sound hollow when tapped. Remove from pan and let cool slightly before serving.

Description: 
Adapted from an 18th century recipe from the book English Housewifery published in 1764. It was originally called French Bread but bears little resemblance to the modern perception, of a baguette. This bread is a very soft and flavorful bread with a slightly cake-like flavor and texture.
