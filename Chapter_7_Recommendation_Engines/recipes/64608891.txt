Ingredients:
1 can (29 ounces) solid-pack pumpkin
1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk
1-1/2 cups sugar
4 large eggs
2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
1 package butter recipe golden cake mix (regular size)
1 cup butter, melted
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°. In a large bowl, combine the first seven ingredients; beat on medium speed until smooth. Pour into an ungreased 13x9-in. baking pan. Sprinkle with dry cake mix. Drizzle butter over top; sprinkle with pecans.
Bake 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 1 hour on a wire rack.
Refrigerate 3 hours or overnight. Remove from refrigerator 15 minutes before serving. Cut into bars. If desired, serve with whipped topping.

Description: 
These bars taste like a cross between pumpkin pie and pecan pieyum! If you can't find butter cake mix, yellow cake mix works.
