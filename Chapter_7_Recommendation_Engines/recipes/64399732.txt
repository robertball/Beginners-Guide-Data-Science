Ingredients:
olive oil
1 large garlic clove, thinly sliced
142-g pkg baby spinach, or dandelion greens, about 8 cups
generous pinch nutmeg
squeeze lemon juice
1 tbsp white vinegar
2 to 4 eggs
2 large slices bread, such as multi-grain, focaccia or ciabatta
2 slices prosciutto, or thinly sliced Black Forest ham

Directions:
Lightly coat a large frying pan with oil. Set over medium-low. Add garlic. Sauté until golden. Add spinach, nutmeg and pinches of salt and pepper. Increase heat to medium-high. Sauté until greens are wilted, 1 to 3 min. Squeeze juice overtop. Turn heat off. Leave pan on burner to keep warm until eggs are ready.
Meanwhile, poach eggs by filling a wide pot with about 2 in. (5 cm) of water. Add vinegar. Bring to a boil over high. Then reduce heat to low so water is barely simmering. Crack an egg into a small dish. Slip egg into water. Repeat with remaining egg. Simmer, uncovered, until whites are set and yolks are done as you like, 3 to 4 min. Meanwhile, toast bread. Using a slotted spoon, remove eggs one at a time and dab whites with paper towel to absorb water. Top each piece of toast with prosciutto, sautéed greens and egg.
