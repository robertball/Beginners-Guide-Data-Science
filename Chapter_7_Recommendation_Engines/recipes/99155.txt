Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable or olive oil
1 1/4 pounds ground beef
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed French onion soup
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/4 cup ketchup
3/4 cup water
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons prepared Dijon-style mustard

Directions:
Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat.
In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, salt, pepper and 1/3 cup of the condensed soup. Form into four patties. Whisk remaining soup and flour in a small bowl; stir in ketchup, water, Worcestershire sauce and mustard.
Increase the heat under the skillet to medium-high and add the beef patties. Cook for about 5 minutes per side, until nicely browned and cooked through. Pour off fat. Pour onion soup sauce over patties. Cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, about 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer burgers to plates, pour a portion of sauce over each and serve.
