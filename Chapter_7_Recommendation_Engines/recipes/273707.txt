Ingredients:
6 wooden chopsticks
3 ripe bananas, peeled and cut in half, crosswise
1/2 cup chopped peanuts, or as needed
3 (4 ounce) bars milk chocolate

Directions:
Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper or waxed paper.
Insert a chopstick into the cut end of each banana half. Place bananas on the prepared baking sheet. Freeze for at least 2 hours.
Place peanuts on a rimmed plate.
Place chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.
Dip each frozen banana into the melted chocolate, using a spoon to help cover it completely. Dip into the peanuts, working quickly before the chocolate hardens.
Serve immediately, or wrap in foil and return to the freezer until ready to serve.

Description: 
I love to eat chocolate-covered frozen bananas when I am at the fair. So I decided to make my own recipe for them. They are a wonderful snack and kids will love eating them, too.
