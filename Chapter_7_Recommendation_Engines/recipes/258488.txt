Ingredients:
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup garlic powder
1/4 cup onion powder
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
1 lime, sliced into wedges
1 rack pork ribs
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks drained, juice reserved
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Mix brown sugar, honey, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, cumin, and cayenne pepper in a bowl to create the seasoning rub.
Squeeze lime juice over the ribs; rub the seasoning mix on both sides. Place the ribs in a large roasting pan; you may need to cut ribs in half to fit. Distribute the pineapple chunks on top of ribs. Pour beer and reserved pineapple juice directly into the roasting pan. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Let stand for 15 minutes.
Remove pan from oven; let cool for 15 minutes before serving.
