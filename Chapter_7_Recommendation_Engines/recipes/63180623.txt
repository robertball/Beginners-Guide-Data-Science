Ingredients:
For the Custard:
2 eggs
1/4 cup flour
1/2 cup sugar
Pinch of salt
1/2 cup skim milk
1-13.5 ounce can of light coconut milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
For the Coconut Whipped Cream:
1-13.5 ounce can of regular coconut milk, refrigerated
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons confectioner’s sugar
For the Pie:
1 prebaked pie crust
3 tablespoons toasted coconut

Directions:
Prepare the custard by whisking together the eggs, flour, sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl. Set aside.
In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine the skim milk and light coconut milk. Heat until small bubbles begin to form along side of pan (do not boil). Remove from heat. Stream milk slowly into egg mixture while whisking rapidly. When all the milk is added, return mixture to the saucepan over low heat. Simmer until thick and bubbly, about 10 minutes.
Remove from heat, transfer to a heatproof bowl and stash in fridge or freezer until custard is room temperature. Stir in vanilla extract.
To prepare the whipped cream, spoon out the top cream portion of the refrigerated coconut cream into the bowl of a mixer. Using the whisk attachment, beat on high until stiff peaks form, about 2-3 minutes. Stir in vanilla and confectioner’s sugar.
To assemble pie, pour cooled custard into crust. Top with whipped cream and toasted coconut. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4-6 hours or until custard is cold.
