Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3 eggs
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons lemon zest
1 cup finely chopped almonds
5 ounces almonds
3 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Combine the flour, eggs, margarine, sugar, vanilla, lemon zest and chopped almonds to form a smooth dough. Stir in the whole almonds.
Divide dough into 3 equal parts and roll each portion out into a cylindrical log shape.  Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place refrigerated rolls of dough onto a greased baking sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool then slice into  1/2 inch thick slices. Put cookies onto greased baking sheet and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. The cookies are very crisp when done.
