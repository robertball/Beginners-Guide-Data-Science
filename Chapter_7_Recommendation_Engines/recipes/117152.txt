Description: 
Zesty chicken strips pass the trim-and-tasty test LaDonna Reed gives most of her recipes. 'I prefer food that is low in fat but has lots of flavor,' she notes from Ponca City, Oklahoma. 'I made these chicken strips for supper one night...and they were a huge hit! They're simple to make, too.'
