Ingredients:
Thinly sliced leftover beef, trimmed
French bread, mini baguette or other crusty loaf
Provolone Cheese
1 cup beef broth
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
Bay Leaf
2 tsp Worcestershire
1/4 cup red wine, optional
1/2 tbs butter

Directions:
Saute onion and garlic in butter, until softened.  Add beef broth, bay leaf, wine (if using) and Worcestershire. Let simmer for 15 minutes or so.  Taste and adjust seasoning as desired.
Heat oven to 350.  Warm rolls if desired to ensure a crusty exterior.  Slice rolls open and place provolone cheese inside.  Put rolls back in oven to soften the cheese.
Once rolls and cheese are ready, turn off heat under broth.  Place sliced meat in beef broth mixture to warm it up for a couple minutes, but not long enough to cook it.  Using tongs, lift meat and let excess broth drip off.  Place meat in rolls.  Pour the broth through a strainer to remove onion, garlic and bay leaf into small ramekins/bowls.
Serve topped with sauteed onions and/or mushrooms if desired.

Description: 
This is a great way to use leftover beef.  Dipping the sandwich in the broth/au jus is so tasty!

This recipe is easily adjusted for the number of sandwiches being made.  The Au Jus ingredients are good for about 2 servings.

I also saute some onions and/or mushrooms to put on the sandwiches depending on taste.
