Ingredients:
1 bunch asparagus, cut into 2-inch pieces
1 white onion, chopped
1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1 (16 ounce) package egg roll wrappers, cut into quarters
1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine asparagus and onion in a 9x13-inch baking dish; season with garlic salt. Pour olive oil over mixture and stir to coat.
Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a plate and cover with aluminum foil or napkin.
Spread ricotta cheese over each egg roll wrapper; layer into the bottom of the baking dish. Sprinkle vegetable mixture over ricotta layer and top with a layer of mozzarella cheese. Repeat layering until vegetables are all used, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the oven until cheese is bubbling and melted, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
I received this recipe about two years ago from my sister-in-law. I was very skeptical because I hated onions and was not to fond of asparagus, but once I ate it I was in love. This is so simple but very delicious and simple to make. I hope you enjoy it! You can always substitute if you want and if you have any good recommendations let me know!
