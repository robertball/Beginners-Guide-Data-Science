Ingredients:
1 pound (about 2 cups) of short grain rice

Directions:
1. Wash the rice. Put it in a bowl of water and scrub it by hand for a full 10 seconds. Rinse, stir, and drain. Repeat until the water drains clear.
2. Soak in clean water overnight, or for 8 to 12 hours.
3. Strain the rice. It should have expanded to about 3½ cups’ worth.
4. Grind the rice finely with a coffee grinder or food processor.
5. Sift the ground rice flour into a bowl. If any rice pieces are too big to sift, grind them again until they can be sifted.
6. You’ll end up with about 4 cups of rice flour. Use it right away, or put it in a plastic bag and in the freezer until you need it.
