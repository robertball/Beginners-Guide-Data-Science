Ingredients:
1 rotisserie chicken, meat pulled and slightly shredded
2 heads broccoli, cut into florets (leaving a bit longer trunk than a normal floret)
1 cup mayo
2/3 cup heavy cream
1 TBSP chicken soup base
1 TBSP dill weed
1 tsp black pepper
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Push broccoli into a 9x13 casserole dish.  Layer chicken on top of broccoli and push down.  Mix together mayo, cream, soup base, dill and pepper and spread evenly over chicken, covering up to the edges of pan.  Sprinkle cheese on top.  Grease a piece of foil and cover with greased side down onto cheese.  Bake one hour, removing foil for the last  15 minutes. Let rest for 10-20 minutes before serving.
