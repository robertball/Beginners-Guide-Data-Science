Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package uncooked angel hair pasta or regular spaghetti
3 tablespoons olive oil
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into strips and seasoned with cajun blackened seasoning
2 tablespoons chopped garlic (or 2-3 teaspoons of minced jarred garlic)
2 tablespoons dried basil (or about 5 fresh leaves)
2 tablespoons Cajun-style blackened seasoning ( I make my own)
salt and pepper to taste
1 large can of diced tomatoes with garlic, basil & oregano added plus 1 small can of the same for added moisture (this will vary depending on your preferences, I try to keep 3 or 4 cans of these tomatoes around just in case)
2/3 cup crumbled feta cheese
Cajun chicken spice that I use:
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/8 teaspoon onion powder

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook following directions. Drain.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken pieces, and cook, stirring until browned on the outside. Add the tomato mixture and cook until tomatoes are semi soft, and chicken is cooked through. Toss with pasta, and serve with crumbled feta cheese on top.

Description: 
Angel hair pasta is tossed with chicken and roma tomatoes in this simple but flavorful dish. The spicy blackened meat seasoning combines well with the crumbled feta cheese.  Easy, but great for a company dinner!Modified from: California Chicken Spaghetti
