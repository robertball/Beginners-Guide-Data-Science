Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 onion, thinly sliced
4 cloves garlic, crushed
1 sweet potato, peeled and diced
2 (1 pound) lamb shanks
1 (14.4 ounce) can chopped canned tomatoes
1 1/4 cups chopped dried apricots
1 1/2 teaspoons harissa
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons slivered almonds
1 cup quick-cooking couscous
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy pot over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and cook until they release their aroma for about 1 minute. Stir in the onions, garlic, and sweet potatoes. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally so potatoes don't stick.
Put the lamb shanks in the pot and brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Add tomatoes, apricots, and harissa. Season with salt and pepper. If mixture seems a bit dry, add a splash of water. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and cover. Simmer until meat is tender and falling off the bone, one hour or more, depending on the size of the shanks. Stir occasionally.
Heat a small skillet over low heat and add the slivered almonds. Stir and cook until almonds are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
Place couscous in a large bowl and slowly pour in lukewarm water until just covered. Let sit until water is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Toss couscous with 2 tablespoons olive oil and toasted almonds. Transfer to a serving dish. Spoon the lamb over the couscous and serve.

This is a gorgeous, easy and pretty quick version of lamb tagine I made on Valentine's Day. For an authentic feel we ate it with our fingers--it was a complete hit!
