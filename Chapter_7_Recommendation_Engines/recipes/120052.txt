Ingredients:
1 cup water
2/3 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
1 medium onion, chopped
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1 1/2 cups egg substitute
5 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a small saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add asparagus; cover and boil for 3 minutes. Drain and immediately place asparagus in ice water; drain and pat dry. In a 10-in. ovenproof skillet, saute onion in oil until tender. Add parsley and asparagus; toss to coat.
In a small bowl, combine the egg substitute, 3 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. Pour over the asparagus mixture; cover and cook over medium heat for 8-10 minutes or until eggs are nearly set. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan. Place uncovered skillet in the broiler, 6 in. from the heat, for 2 minutes or until eggs are set. Sprinkle with cheddar cheese. Cut into quarters. Serve immediately.
