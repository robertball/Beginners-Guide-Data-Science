Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1/4 pound cooked smoked sausage, sliced (I like chourico)
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 tsp. of thyme
1/4 tsp. of pepper
4 tablespoons tomato paste
2 cans (about 15 ounces each) great northern beans
1 tbs. parsley

Directions:
Throw all the ingredients except parsley into the crock pot.
Cook on LOW 4 to 5 hours.
Before serving, sprinkle parsley over cassoulet.
I like to do one can of great northern beans and one can of garbanzo beans.

Description: 
This recipe says to brown the meat first and saute the onions. I don't bother. Maybe it is a tiny bit yummier if you do, but I don't really believe that. I throw everything in the crock pot and let it cook for 4 or 5 hours. It comes out great. My mother-in-law ate seconds.
