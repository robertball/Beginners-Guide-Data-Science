Description: 
Refreshing mint gives the gorgeous salad an unusual twist. It's a 'must' on my brunch buffet. Even people who aren't big fruit eaters devour this colorful combination...then ask for the recipe.                                     --Becky Murdock of Hernando, MississippiModified from: Minty Fruit Salad
