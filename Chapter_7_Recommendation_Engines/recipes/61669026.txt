Ingredients:
8 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1 large onion, chopped
2 (28 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 teaspoon white sugar, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Place the bacon in a Dutch oven, and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the fat starts to cook out, about 2 minutes. Add the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the diced tomatoes and tomato sauce to the pan. Season with sugar and black pepper. Simmer until the sauce is reduced by at least 1/4 and up to 1/3, 30 to 45 minutes. Stir in the butter just before serving.

Description: 
It is really a sauce (because there is no flour in it) but you can eat it for breakfast over biscuits, eat it at room temperature like a soup at lunch or the way we ate it at his house over rice with hoe cakes for dinner.  It is simple to make but tastes so good. It keeps in the refrigerator for several days and I think it tastes better the next day.Modified from: Grandpa's Tomato Gravy
