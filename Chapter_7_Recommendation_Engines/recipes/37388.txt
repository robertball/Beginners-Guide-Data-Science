Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen raspberries, thawed
3 cups water
1/3 cup sugar
1 family size tea bag
2 cups red grape juice
1 lemon, sliced
1 lime, sliced
1 (16 ounce) bottle orange soft drink, chilled

Directions:
PROCESS raspberries in a blender or food processor until smooth, stopping to scrape down sides. Pour puree through a fine wire-mesh strainer into a large container, discarding raspberry seeds. Set puree aside.
BRING 3 cups water and sugar to a boil in a saucepan, stirring often. Remove from heat; add tea bag. Cover and steep 5 minutes.
REMOVE tea bag with a slotted spoon, squeezing gently; cool tea mixture.
STIR together tea mixture, raspberry puree, grape juice, and lemon and lime slices. Chill.
STIR in orange soft drink, and serve immediately over ice.
