Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) jar dried beef
1/4 cup Italian-style salad dressing
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened

Directions:
Process dried beef, Italian-style dressing and cream cheese in a food processor until well blended. Transfer to a medium bowl. Chill until firm enough to form into a ball, about 2 hours.

Description: 
This has been a big hit for many years as an appetizer, or just for a snack. It is always nice to have when friends drop by, and it freezes very well. If you enjoy nuts, roll the cheese ball in about a half cup of chopped pecans. Serve with crackers. Refrigerate overnight for the best flavor.
