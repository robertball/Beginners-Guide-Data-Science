Description: 
The finest of all cold soups - and the very best thing invented in the USA!  This wonderful, smooth soup can be garnished with a very few finely chopped chives.   The chef at the Algonquin (where the soup originated) now sprinkles a very little curry powder, and provided it is a VERY little this can be very pleasant.  Enjoy.Modified from: Vichyssoise
