Ingredients:
12 graham crackers
2 tablespoons white sugar
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
6 half pint canning jars
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
4 egg yolks
1/2 cup fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon grated lime zest, divided
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 cup fresh raspberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a small pie pan with parchment paper.
Pulse graham crackers and 2 tablespoons white sugar in a food processor until fine crumbs form; add melted butter and pulse until combined.
Spoon 2 tablespoons of the graham cracker crumbles into each of the 6 half pint jars; gently press crumbles into the bottom. Place the jars onto a large, rimmed baking sheet. Press the remaining graham mixture into the bottom of the prepared pie pan.
Bake jars and pie pan in the preheated oven until the graham cracker mixture is golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk condensed milk and egg yolks together in a large bowl until smooth; add lime juice and 1 1/2 teaspoons lime zest and whisk until combined. Pour lime mixture into cooled jars.
Bake jars until lime mixture has just set, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to wire rack and let cool. Refrigerate jars until ready to assemble.
Beat heavy cream and 1 teaspoon white sugar with an electric mixer in a bowl until the whipped cream forms stiff peaks.
Top jars with fresh raspberries, whipped cream, and remaining graham cracker crust and lime zest.
