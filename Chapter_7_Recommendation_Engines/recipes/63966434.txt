Ingredients:
2 1/2 - 3 lbs. baby-back ribs
1 bottle KC Masterpiece (or your favorite) Barbecue Sauce

Directions:
Clean skin off ribs if necessary. Cut into pieces of 1 or 2 ribs and pierce all over with a sharp fork. Place ribs in plastic bags and add enough barbecue sauce to cover. Put bags with ribs in the fridge overnight.
Put ribs with sauce in a 7 qt. slow-cooker and cook on "low" for 6 hours or until tender and starting to shrink from the ends of the rib bones.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Remove ribs from the slow-cooker and place in a foil covered shallow pan (toss out the juices from the slow-cooker). Cover with more barbecue sauce to taste. Bake in the  oven for 20 minutes. Serve with greens, baked beans, and cole slaw.

Description: 
The only thing that is time consuming to fix is the barbecue sauce. Pick your favorite sauce like KC Masterpiece or use your own family recipe. I didn't add any other seasonings and the baked in flavor of the barbecue sauce was enough - and incredibly delicious!
