Ingredients:
3/4 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
1/4 cup olive oil
2 cloves garlic, chopped, or more to taste
1 cup water
1 (.7 ounce) package dry Italian-style salad dressing mix

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic in the hot oil until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix water and salad dressing mix into garlic; simmer until liquid has reduced into a sauce, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour sauce over spaghetti; toss to coat.
