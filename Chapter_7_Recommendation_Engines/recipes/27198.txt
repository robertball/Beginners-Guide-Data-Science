Ingredients:
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups rolled oats

2 tablespoons cold coffee
1/2 cup pearl sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until smooth. Stir in the oats, cocoa and vanilla until well blended then stir in the coffee. Roll the dough into balls slightly smaller than a ping pong ball. Pour the pearl sugar into a saucer and roll the balls in the sugar. Refrigerate cookies for 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
I learnt how to make this recipe in Sweden. It tastes great even if it's totally high fat! I don't really know how many of these balls the recipe yields because everybody was eating the dough before the balls were made!!! Perfect for a skiing break with hot coffee or tea.
