Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
8 onions, sliced
1 quart vegetable broth
1 1/2 cups white wine
salt and pepper to taste
6 slices baguette
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Saute onions until deep brown, about 20 minutes. Stir in broth and wine, using a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the pot. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until heated through.
Preheat oven on broiler setting. Ladle soup into heatproof serving bowls. Top each bowl with a slice of bread, and sprinkle with cheese. Place under a hot broiler until cheese is melted and slightly browned.

Description: 
Beautiful French onion soup. Good for a cold evening or after a late night as a midnight snack. Alternatively, grill the bread and cheese first, and serve in soup or on the side. This keeps well; in fact, it gets better with time. Enjoy and experiment!
