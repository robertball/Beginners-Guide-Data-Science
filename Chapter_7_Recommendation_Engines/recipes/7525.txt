Ingredients:
Cake:
3 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice
4 eggs
3/4 cup white sugar
4 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cups honey
1/2 cup strong brewed coffee
1/2 cup blanched slivered almonds
1/2 cup raisins
2 tablespoons slivered almonds for topping
Glaze (Optional):
1 1/2 cups honey
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 cup water
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Oil two loaf pans and line bottoms with parchment paper; grease the parchment as well.
Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and allspice. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, gradually adding the sugar. Beat until thick and light in color, about 5 minutes. Beat in the oil, honey and coffee.  Stir flour mixture into egg mixture. Chop the almonds coarsely and mix with raisins; stir into batter.
Divide batter between the two prepared loaf pans. Sprinkle with reserved slivered almonds.
Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes.  Let cool 10 minutes and remove from pan.
To Make Glaze: combine 1 1/2 cups honey, lemon juice, lemon zest and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. When glaze reaches a thick consistency, remove from heat and drizzle over warm cake.
