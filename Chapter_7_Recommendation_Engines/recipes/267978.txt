Description: 
This s'mores cookie recipe is something I came across through my travels and have made it many times. My kids love to help me make them and it isn't too difficult for them to join in on the baking. At first I thought it was a bit tedious, but it was more fun than expected! They are best eaten when just cool enough to handle. Enjoy!
