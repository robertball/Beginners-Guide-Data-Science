1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp ground ginger

1/4 tsp cloves

1 tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp molasses
1/2 cup vanilla yogurt
1 tbsp non-hydrogenated margerine
1 cup raisins
1 cup quick cooking oats
2/3 cup oatbran

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F
Mix flour, flax, salt, baking soda and spices together, set aside.
In a large bowl mix sugar, egg, vanilla, molasses, yogurt, and margerine until smooth.
Add dry mixture to wet and stir until just combined.
Stir in oats, oatbran and raisins.
Drop by Tbsp onto baking sheet lightly coated with non-stick cooking spray.  Bake for 8-10 minutes, until cookies spring back when you press lightly on the center.
Due to the yogurt in the batter these cookies should be stored in the refrigerator.
