Ingredients:
Cinnzeo Cinnamon Buns
Dough ingredients:
1 Tablespoon yeast (I use quick rise)
1 cup warm milk
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
4 cups flour
Filling Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter/margarine (softened)
1 cup brown sugar
cinnamon
Cream Cheese Icing Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter/margarine, softened
1 1/2 cups icing sugar
2 Tablespoons cream cheese
2 Tablespoons whipping cream or milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
pinch of salt

Directions:
DOUGH INSTRUCTIONS:
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm milk. Let sit for 10 minutes. In a large bowl mix sugar, butter/margarine, salt and eggs. Stir in yeast mixture. Add flour and mix well. Knead for a few minutes. Turn oven to lowest temperature and leave for 30 seconds. Turn oven OFF. Turn the light on for a perfect rising environment. Place dough in covered bowl in the oven. Let rise for 1 1/4 hours until doubled in size.
FILLING INSTRUCTIONS: On floured surface roll out dough to 1/4 inch in rectangular shape. Spread filling over dough. Roll up and cut into 12-18 slices. Place on greased 11x15" baking sheet. (sometimes I spread them out more and use two baking pans for the batch—a 9x13” and an 8x11”) Rise until doubled in size (approx. 1 hour). Bake at 400 degrees for approximately 10 minutes until golden.
ICING INSTRUCTIONS Whip until fluffy. Ice cinnamon buns while still warm.
