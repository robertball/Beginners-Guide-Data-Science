CBecker Black Bean Veggie Burgers Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup dry black beans
1 egg
2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
1/2 to 1 tablespoon cumin
1/2 tablespoon ground coriander
1/2 tablespoon tumeric
1/3 cup plain bread crumbs

Directions:
Presoak dry beans according to package directions [place 1 cup beans in bowl with water covering beans and about 2 inches above beans and let then presoak for at least 6-8 hrs; then drain off water; place beans and new water in saucepan and bring to boil, cover and reduce heat to LOW, and cook beans for 1 and 1/2 hrs].
In a food processor, grind black beans with chipotle peppers and egg (1/2 at a time).
In a medium bowl, put in food processor mixture and use hands to mix in the bread crumbs and spices.  You want the mixture to not "stick" to your hands as much as it did in the beginning of mixing.(you may need to use more bread crumbs to desired consistency).
Divide mixture into four patties.
Preheat George Foreman at 325 to 350 degrees Farenheit.
Cook for about 8 to 11 minutes (when you see grill marks on the patties).
Note: Chipotle Peppers in Adobe Sauce is purchased in a 7 oz. can. I use the leftover chiles after food processing them in chili within 7 days of opening the can (do not store can in the fridge - put leftovers in another container).
