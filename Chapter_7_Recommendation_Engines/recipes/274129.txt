Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk, or more as needed
2 eggs
2 tablespoons white sugar
pinch salt
1 tablespoon butter, melted
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup sliced fresh strawberries
1/2 cup plain yogurt
4 tablespoons strawberry jam, or to taste
1 tablespoon honey, or to taste
1 tablespoon cinnamon sugar
4 tablespoons whipped cream, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Combine flour, milk, eggs, sugar, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Beat using an electric mixer, adding more milk if needed, until smooth and thinner than a cake batter. Whisk in butter.
Heat oil over medium heat in a heavy skillet. Pour a large ladleful of batter into the middle of the pan; swirl around skillet to coat the bottom of the pan. Cook until underside of crepe is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen crepe; flip crepe and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.
Lay crepes flat and coat with strawberries, yogurt, strawberry jam, honey, and cinnamon sugar. Roll crepes into logs and serve with whipped cream.

Description: 
A Czech interpretation of the crepe. Slightly thicker than a French-style crepe, so they tend to be a little more filling. My family occasionally had these for 'brinner' (breakfast-for-dinner), but they make a great dessert too. In Czech, these are called 'palacinky.'
