Ingredients:
3 Tablespoons shea butter
3 Tablespoons baking soda
2 Tablespoons corn starch
2 Tablespoons cocoa butter
2 vitamin E oil gel caps (puncture and squeeze out the oil)
Essential Oil (ylang yang and orange is a good combo) (tea tree and lavender is another)

Directions:
Melt 3 Tbsp shea Butter, 3 Tbsp basking soda, 2 Tbsp Corn starch, and 2 Tbsp of Cocoa Butter for about 30 seconds in the microwave. Then add 1/2 tsp vitamin E oil, and Essential oils, stir again, and pour it in a jar, then place it in the fridge to set. This recipe filled the jar in my hand, which is a 1/4 pint.
(hint: Put half of it in the fridge to prolong shelf life)
