Heavenly Drinkable Chocolate Recipe

Ingredients:
1/2 cup whole milk (at least 2%)
1/2 cup total of dark and milk* chocolate combined (I do 1/4 and 1/4 but you could add more dark for instance if that's what you prefer)
3 pinches ground ginger
1 - 1.5 pinches cayenne pepper

Directions:
Using a double boiler once the water has boiled, add the milk first and bring it almost to a boil. Hot and steaming.
With a whisk, add your chocolate, slowly, bit by bit as it melts from your gentle whisking into the milk.
Your element should be off or on very low just to keep the heat from below.
Once you've achieved a velvety smoothness with no unmelted bits, add your pinches of ground ginger and cayenne. The heat from the cayenne will be more noticeable after you've had a sip.
Be sure to wipe the steam off the bottom to stop it from dripping into your chocolate.
Pour into espresso cups or other favourite small sized cups. It's not meant to fill a coffee mug, but hey, why not? :)
Optional: add a dollop of chilled freshly whipped cream (OMG!) and an ever so slight sprinkle of cayenne to make it look pretty :)
Have a sip and then wait for it... right?!?!
NOTES:
* don't use the cheap milk chocolate that's made of corn syrup and yucky things that makes it taste like wax. I've tried a few brands and I find that Dairymilk milk chocolate works really well and tastes great.
* for milk chocolate, a 1/4 cup is approximately half a 38g Dairymilk bar and for dark chocolate it's about 2 oz if you buy the squares
* never add cold milk when melting chocolate, it will make it lump up and do strange things
