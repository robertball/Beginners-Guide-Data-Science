Ingredients:
2 pounds rainbow sweet potatoes, peeled and cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick wedges
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Dipping Sauce 1:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch salt
Dipping Sauce 2:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon milk
1 1/2 teaspoons prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon snipped fresh dill
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line two 15x10x1-inch baking pans with aluminum foil.
Combine sweet potato wedges, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a very large bowl. Toss to coat. Arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking pans.
Roast in the preheated oven, rotating the pans halfway through, until potatoes are tender and starting to brown, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk mayonnaise, lemon juice, lemon zest, pepper, and salt in a small bowl to make the first dipping sauce.
Whisk mayonnaise, milk, horseradish, dill, and pepper in a separate small bowl to make the second dipping sauce.
Serve sweet potatoes warm or at room temperature with the two sauces for dipping.
