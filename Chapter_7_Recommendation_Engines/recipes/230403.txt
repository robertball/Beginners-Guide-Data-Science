Ingredients:
2 family-sized tea bags
1 quart boiling water
1 1/2 quarts water
6 whole cloves
1 cinnamon stick
1 (12 ounce) can pineapple juice
1 cup white sugar
1 (6 ounce) can frozen orange juice concentrate
1 (6 ounce) can frozen lemonade concentrate
1 teaspoon ground allspice

Directions:
Steep tea bags in boiling water until the tea is of desired strength, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove and discard tea bags.
Combine 1 1/2 quarts water, cloves, and cinnamon together in a large pot; bring to a boil. Stir brewed tea, pineapple juice, sugar, orange juice concentrate, lemonade concentrate, and allspice into the boiling water to dissolve the sugar. Serve immediately or reduce heat to low and keep at a simmer until ready to serve.

Description: 
I grew up drinking this tea at my grandmother's house. I now fix it at my house on really cold days, when I am sick (lots of vitamin C!), and at Christmas. It is perfect to let simmer on the stove to make the house smell good and to serve to guests. I have no idea why its called 'Russian' tea; that is just what my grandmother always called it. Use any tea you like. I've used regular black tea, decaf, and cinnamon spice, and it's all great. If using spiced tea, you may want to adjust the amount of cinnamon, cloves, and allspice. This is also great reheated!
