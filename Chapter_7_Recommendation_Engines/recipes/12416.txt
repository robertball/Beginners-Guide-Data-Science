Ingredients:
20 milk chocolate candy kisses, unwrapped
2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
1 (5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1 3/4 cups milk
1 (9 inch) pie shell, baked

Directions:
Melt the chocolate with the whipping cream.  Stir until smooth, and spread evenly over the bottom of the pie shell.  Refrigerate until ready to fill; chocolate should be firm before filling.
Put the dry pudding mix and peanut butter in a heavy saucepan.  Over low heat, gradually stir in the milk using a wire whisk.  Stir constantly until mixture thickens and comes to a boil.  Cool for 15 minutes, stirring often.  Pour peanut butter filling into crust.  Chill several hours.
Top with whipped topping and chopped peanuts if desired.

Description: 
This recipe has a wonderful combination of a chocolate and peanut butter. It's simple and inexpensive. I make this pie for a restaurant owned by my mother, and we receive many compliments and even requests to purchase whole pies.  You can also use chocolate pudding; the pie tastes like peanut butter cup candy. For a really spectacular presentation, garnish with whipped cream, peanuts, and chopped peanut butter cups.
