Spelt Cinnamon Raisin Bread Recipe

Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups warm water (120 F)
4 tablespoons sugar
1 packet active dry yeast
1/4 cup melted butter
1 Chia Seed egg
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon cinnamon
5 to 6 cups spelt flour
Filling
4 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon cinnamon
1/2 cup raisins (or more, if you really like raisins)

Directions:
Proof the yeast by mixing the sugar and warm water together and sprinkling in yeast.  Let sit for 5-10 minutes, you will see the mixture start to bubble up.  Mix in the butter and egg.  Mix in 1 cup of flour, salt and cinnamon.  Slowly keep adding flour, a little bit at a time, until the dough sticks together.  If you are using a stand mixer, switch to your dough hook, and knead the dough on a low speed for around 5 minutes, adding the remaining flour until the dough stops sticking to the bowl (you may not need to use all the flour).
Let the dough rest for about 5 minutes, then knead another 5 minutes on low speed.  Place the dough in a greased bowl (I usually use a glass bowl or the stainless steel mixing bowl that comes with my mixer) and turn to coat the dough lightly in oil so that it wonâ€™t stick when rising.  Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and a damp tea towel.  Set in a warm place (I put mine in front of the fireplace  ) until doubled, about 1-2 hours.  Punch down the dough and let rise again until doubled, it should take half as long as the first rise.
