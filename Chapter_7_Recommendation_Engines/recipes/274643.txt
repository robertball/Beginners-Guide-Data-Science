Ingredients:
5 yellow squash, grated
3 tablespoons grated onion
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 egg, beaten
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter, or more as needed
Toppings:
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste
1/4 cup chopped onion, or to taste
1/4 cup sour cream, or to taste

Directions:
Place grated squash in a colander and squeeze out all excess water; you should have about 1 cup grated squash. Transfer squash to a bowl. Add onion, flour, egg, baking powder, and salt and stir batter together.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drop batter into the hot pan and use the back of a large spoon to flatten fritters to 3 to 4 inches in diameter and to 1/4- to 1/8-inch thickness. Cook until edges are deep brown, about 1 minute. Flip over and cook 30 seconds more. Transfer fritters to a plate lined with a paper towel and sprinkle lightly with salt. Repeat with remaining batter, melting more butter in the pan as needed.
Serve warm topped with Cheddar cheese, onion, and sour cream.

Description: 
This is a fast and easy snack or lunch idea. These summer squash fritters are so delicious it's hard to believe how good they are for you. It only takes a few minutes to make, and they are so crispy they're addictive. This is a great way to use the abundance of squash at the end of the season. There are so many vitamins in this, but the kids will only know how good they are.
