Ingredients:
1 lb. button mushrooms
1 pint heavy table cream
A few dashes of thyme
Salt to taste
Bacon crisps (can be substituted with sliced French Baguette)

Directions:
Wash mushrooms and remove stems, slice caps. Heat heavy table cream, sliced mushrooms, thyme and salt in a skillet over medium heat till cream thickens, taking care to stir constantly. Cream will foam a little, and will thicken suddenly, so watch closely!
Serve mushroom sauce in a chaffing dish or fondue pot with small serving spoons. Spoon sauce on bacon crisps or toasted baguette slices. Enjoy!

Description: 
This makes a very elegant but filling appetizer with minimal ingredients. I never have any leftover, and my guests always rave about how they just can’t stop eating! The flavor is very unique with the bacon crisps, and if you can find these crackers I highly recommend. I have noticed there are areas of the country where you can’t find them very easily, but the baguette works very nicely in their place.
