Ingredients:
3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cooked, cubed to about 1/2"
1 roasted red bell pepper, finely chopped or minced
1 can sweet corn, drained
1 can black beans, rinsed
1 can white kidney beans (cannelini)
4oz can green chilis, chopped
1/3 cup finely chopped red onion
8 cups chicken stock, more if needed to thin
1/3 cup corn flour
4 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 bunch fresh cilantro
salt and pepper

Directions:
In a dutch oven or large pot, melt the butter and add the corn flour to make a roux.  Cook about 3 minutes over medium heat, stirring frequently.
Add chicken stock slowly, whisking to blend and keep smooth.
Add all other prepared ingredients, stirring gently to combine.  Taste and add salt and pepper as needed.
Simmer, covered, about 40 minutes over low heat, stirring occasionally.
Taste again and adjust seasoning and liquid as needed.  Add a little fresh cilantro just before serving.
