Ingredients:
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into thin strips
3/4 cup sliced almonds
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 (16 ounce) package frozen broccoli stir-fry vegetable blend
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/3 cup unsweetened pineapple juice
1/3 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
In a large nonstick skillet or wok, stir-fry chicken and almonds in hot oil for 2 minutes. Add vegetables. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook for 4 minutes or until vegetables are tender and chicken is no longer pink.
In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch, brown sugar and ginger. Stir in pineapple juice and soy sauce until smooth. Stir into chicken mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve with rice if desired.

Description: 
Margaret Wilson of Hemet, California shared the recipe for this yummy mainstay. Pineapple juice, ginger and soy sauce lend a slightly tangy flavor to the chicken strips and veggies in this pretty blend. A package of frozen vegetables speeds along the prep time, making this a quick meal for busy weeknights.
