Ingredients:
1/3 cup apple pie filling
1 (6 inch) flour tortilla
1 teaspoon butter, melted
1 teaspoon cinnamon sugar, or to taste
1 scoop vanilla ice cream
2 tablespoons whipped cream, or to taste
1 pinch ground cinnamon (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pour apple pie filling into a bowl. Dice the apple slices.
Place tortilla inside a small oven-proof bowl so that it forms a cup. Brush the inside of the tortilla with melted butter; liberally sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Carefully remove from the bowl and cool on a wire rack.
Scoop ice cream into the taco cup and top with the apple pie filling. Garnish with a dollop of whipped cream and cinnamon.
