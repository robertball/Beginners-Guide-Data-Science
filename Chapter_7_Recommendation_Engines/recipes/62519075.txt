Ingredients:
1 jalapeno, seeded and chopped
1/3 cup cilantro, chopped
1/4 cup onion, chopped
1/2 tsp salt
2 avocados, ripe
1 roma tomato

Directions:
Place jalapeno, cilantro, onion and salt in mortar; with pestle, grind until mixture becomes juicy and thick (onion can still be slightly chunky).
Cut each avocado lengthwise in half around the seed. Twist halves in opposite directions to separate.  Slip spoon between seed and fruit and work seed out.  With spoon, scoop fruit from peel onto cutting board.
Cut tomato crosswise in half.  Squeeze halves to remove seeds and juice.  Coarsely chop tomato.
Add avocado and chopped tomato to onion mixture in mortar or bowl.  Mash slightly until mixture is blended with some avocado chunks remaining.
