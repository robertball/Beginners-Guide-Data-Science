Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil
1 large garlic clove, minced (about 1.5 tsp)
1/2 cup diced white onions
1 pinch red pepper flakes
1/2 cup cubed pancetta
1 large (350g+) sweet potato, peeled, Blade C
1/4 cup chicken broth
4 large basil leaves, chopped
3-4 packed cups of spinach

Directions:
1. Place a large skillet over medium heat and add in the olive oil. Once the oil heats, add in the garlic, red pepper flakes and onions and cook for about 2 minutes or until onions are translucent.
2. Add in the sweet potato noodles and pancetta and season with salt and pepper. Toss to combine and let cook for a few minutes (about 2) and then add in the chicken broth and basil. Let fully reduce and then cook for 2-3 minutes or until sweet potato noodles are cooked through (taste to test.) Towards the end, add in the baby spinach and let cook for about 2 minutes or until spinach is wilted.
3. When done, divide evenly into bowls.
