Ingredients:
1 sweet potato, thinly sliced
2 teaspoons olive oil, or as needed
coarse sea salt

Directions:
Combine sweet potato slices and and olive oil in a large bowl; toss to coat. Arrange sweet potato slices in a single layer on a large microwave-safe plate; season with salt.
Cook in microwave until chips are dry, crisp, and slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Cool chips on plate before transferring to a bowl. Repeat with remaining sweet potato slices.
