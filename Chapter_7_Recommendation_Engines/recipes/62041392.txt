Ingredients:
4 shots of freshly brewed, hot espresso
1/2 gallon premium real vanilla ice cream
3/4 cup of Hershey's chocolate syrup

Directions:
While your espresso is brewing, place ice cream and chocolate syrup in blender container.  Pour hot espresso over the ice cream.  Immediately blend using pulse, until ingredients are incorporated.  For a thicker shake, add hot espresso to the blender first, then add chocolate and ice cream and blend.
*We also suggest this recipe using Irish Cream flavored espresso beans and a premium-quality chocolate ice cream.
