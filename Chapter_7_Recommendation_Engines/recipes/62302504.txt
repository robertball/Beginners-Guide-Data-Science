Ingredients:
This is a basic pizza dough recipe.
Ingredients:
* 1 envelope active dry yeast
* 1 cup warm water, 110° F.
* 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
* 2 1/4 tp 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preparation:
Put warm water in a cup; sprinkle yeast over water and stir in sugar; let stand for about 10 minutes, or until it begins to bubble.
Combine 2 1/4 cups flour and salt in a large bowl; pour in oil and yeast mixture and stir until a stiff dough is formed. Turn dough out onto a floured surface; knead about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Add extra flour as needed to keep from sticking to hands and board.
Place in a large bowl greased with shortening or butter; turn dough over to coat the dough well. Cover with towel and let rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes. Dough should double in bulk. Punch down the dough and shape to fit a lightly greased pizza pan which as been sprinkled lightly with cornmeal. Keep dough slightly thick around the edges. Fill with favorite filling and toppings and bake for about 15 to 20 minutes at 425°.
