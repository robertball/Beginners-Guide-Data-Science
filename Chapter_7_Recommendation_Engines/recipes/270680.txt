Description: 
I created this in a moment of desperation to make something tasty and fast. This ended up being one of the favorites! I like to serve this dish over coconut rice. It adds a nice subtle flavor to the dish. This dish also tastes better the next day after the flavors have come together more, making great leftovers!
