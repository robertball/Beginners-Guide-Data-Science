Ingredients:
1/3 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup canola oil
2 cups quick-cooking oats
3/4 cup sugar
1/3 cup whole-wheat flour
1/4 cup low-fat milk or low-fat plain soymilk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup toasted almonds or walnuts (see Tip), finely chopped
1/2 cup semisweet or dark chocolate chips
1/2 cup apricot preserves

Directions:
1.Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with foil or nonstick baking mats.
2.Melt butter in a medium saucepan. Remove from the heat. Add oil, oats, sugar, flour, milk (or soymilk), vanilla, salt and nuts and mix well. Drop level teaspoons of dough 3 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Spread or press each cookie into a thin, 2-inch circle with a fork or damp fingertips.
3.Bake the cookies, in batches, until set, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool completely before removing from the foil or mats. (The cookies will appear somewhat lacy.)
4.When the cookies are cool, melt chocolate chips in a double boiler over hot, not boiling, water (or microwave in 15-second intervals, stirring in between). Gently spread the chocolate on the flat side of half (about 36) of the cookies. Gently spread a little jam on the flat side of the remaining cookies. Press the apricot and chocolate halves together to make sandwich cookies.
