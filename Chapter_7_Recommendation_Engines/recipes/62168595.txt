Ingredients:
-Butter 1/2 cup
-Sugar 1 cup
-Salt 1/2 teaspoon
-2 eggs
-2 cups frozen mixed berries
-Sour Cream 1/2 cup
-Buttermilk 1/2 cup
-Baking soda 1 teaspoon
-Flour 2 cups

Directions:
First off preheat your oven at 350 degrees f. Soften butter. Drop everything thing in the bowl and mix. Scoop out and fill two loaf pans. In the oven for 1 hour. I like to make a little glaze sometimes to brush on top, just mix icing sugar, a little vanilla extract, and then pour in milk until drizzle consistency. Brush it on top and then refrigerate for 30 mins till it hardens.
