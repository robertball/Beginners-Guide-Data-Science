Ingredients:
1/2 cup smoked paprika
2 teaspoons dry mustard
2 teaspoons ground chipotle chile powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3 tbs veg oil
1 large onion grated
3 cloves garlic grated or put through garlic press
4 stalks celery grated
1 bell pepper grated
1 15 oz can tomato sauce
1 15 oz can crushed tomatoes
1 64 oz bottle of ketchup
1 cup of yellow mustard
2 cups cider vinegar
1 12 oz jar of molasses
2 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup honey
juice of 2 limes
1 tbs Worcestershire sauce
3 tbs liquid hickory smoke
2 tsp black pepper
Salt to taste

Directions:
Saute onions, garlic, celery and bell pepper: sweat well. Add tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, ketchup and all the other ingredients. Bring to a simmer and allow to simmer for 2-3 hours. If you want to have a smoother sauce put the sauteed vegetables into a blender with the crushed tomatoes and blend well, and the put back into the pot and add the other ingredients. Or pass through a wire mesh strainer when you put it into jars.
To store sauce for long term, use canning jars and follow the directions. I usually put them into the sterile jars and boil for 1 hour with the lids on allow to cool and store in a place with moderate temperature.
