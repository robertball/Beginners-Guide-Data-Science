Ingredients:
1 pound chicken livers
1  egg
Â½ cup milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 quart vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Place the chicken livers in a colander, and rinse with water. Drain the livers well. Whisk together the egg and milk in a shallow bowl until well blended. Place the flour, garlic powder, and salt and pepper in a resealable plastic zipper bag, and shake to combine.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place the chicken livers in the bowl of egg and milk mixture, and coat each liver. Place the livers, one at a time, into the plastic bag of flour mixture, and shake the bag to coat the each liver completely.
Gently place the coated livers, a few at a time, into the hot oil. Cover the pan of oil with a frying screen to avoid getting burned by spatters of oil that will pop out as the livers fry. Deep fry the livers until crisp and golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.

Description: 
Mom made them because they are cheap, and now the convenience stores sell them in the South! You must have a fry screen -- these darn things pop and will burn you! Serve with pepper gravy or a packet of chicken gravy.
