Ingredients:
1 rotisserie chicken
1 bag of slider buns
1 cup of bbq sauce
1 large onion (sliced)

Directions:
Take the rotisserie chicken and pull apart the meat from the bones. Shred the chicken pieces.
Slice the onion and saute them in a large skillet with a splash of olive oil.
Once the onion starts to cook, add the chicken and the bbq sauce. Make sure that all of the shredded chicken has been covered by the bbq sauce. If needed, add more bbq sauce.
Optional: add about a tablespoon of red pepper flakes or a tablespoon of hot sauce to give the chicken a little kick.
