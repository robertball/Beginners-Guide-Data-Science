Ingredients:
1 ½ - 2 cups plain bread crumbs
6 Tbsp. butter/margarine
¾ tsp. pepper
8 oz. cream cheese, softened
1 chicken, boiled and de-boned (I buy rotisserie chicken in deli, de-skin, and shred)
1 stick butter/margarine
3 cans Pillsbury crescent rolls

Directions:
Combine cream cheese, butter, pepper and chicken. Pour bread crumbs into a separate bowl.
Open rolls and stretch. Put ¼ cup chicken mixture in center of roll and fold like a croissant. Fold edges up and pinch to close.
Melt 1 stick of butter. Dip rolls in butter and then in bread crumbs.
Put on lightly greased cookie sheet and bake at 375 for 15-20 minutes.
