Description: 
My style of cooking is totally out of the box. This recipe is the sweet culinary equivalent of regular hummus. I'm a perfectionist with fibromyalgia and did everything from scratch. If you don't have a blender you can use a mortar and pestle to make the poppy seed paste, which takes the place of tahini.
