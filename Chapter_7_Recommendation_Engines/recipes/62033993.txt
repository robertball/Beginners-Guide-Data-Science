Rouladen Recipe

Ingredients:
4 cube steaks
low salt beef broth
l chopped onion (plus more for gravy)
4 garlic cloves minced or pressed
l slice bacon (uncooked)
garlic powder
onion powder
salt/pepper
bayleaf

Directions:
If cube steaks seem too large cut in half.  Cut bacon into 2 inch pieces and place on top of meat.  Divide chopped onion and garlic evenly among steaks and place on top of bacon.  Season with powders and salt and pepper.  Roll steaks jellyroll style and secure with toothpicks.  In a soup pot, heat oil and brown each roll well. (careful not to burn) When almost browned add more chopped onion and about a clove of garlic.  Add enough beef broth to just cover meat, along with a bay leaf. Season as you wish.  Simmer for about two hours checking on liquid level. You may add more if needed.  Remove meat from pot and thicken gravy.  I prefer to make a roux with the fat from the gravy.  You can skim or use a fat separater.  Once my roux is made I slowly add the gravy and simmer for about l0 minutes.  Serve over egg noodles or with mashed potatoes or dumplings.  Wonderful!

Description: 
Some Rouladen recipes call for relish in the filling depending on the region.  This recipe was passed down to my german/austrian parents and is absolutely delicious!
