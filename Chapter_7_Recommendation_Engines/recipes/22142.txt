Ingredients:
1/2 cup red or green lentils
1 cup chopped onion
1 stalk celery, chopped
2 cups shredded cabbage

1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

Directions:
Place the lentils into a stockpot or a Dutch oven and add water to twice the depth of the lentils. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and let simmer for about 15 minutes. Drain and rinse lentils; return them to the pot.
Add onion, celery, cabbage, tomatoes, chicken broth, carrots and garlic to the pot and season with salt, pepper, sugar, basil, thyme and curry. Cook, simmering for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until desired tenderness is achieved.

Description: 
This soup has very little fat, is cheap and easy to make and delicious. Our family practically lives on it in the winter and I usually double the recipe.  Sprinkle grated cheddar on top if you wish. If you can't hang around long enough for this to cook, put it in a slow cooker.
