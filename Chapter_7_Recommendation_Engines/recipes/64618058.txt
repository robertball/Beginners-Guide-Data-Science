Ingredients:
3-pound pork butt or pork shoulder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon fresh thyme, finely chopped
2 teaspoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped
1½ cup powdered parmesan cheese
¼ cup honey
2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
2½ teaspoons salt
pepper to taste

Directions:
In a bowl mix oregano, thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper, and set aside.
In a small bowl, mix honey and red wine vinegar and slather all over roast.
Sprinkle the herb mixture evenly over entire roast, pressing into the meat. Optional: For best flavor in meat, now allow to marinate for 20-30 minutes.
Gently place roast into a 6-quart slow cooker and pour over any juices that released from the meat. Sprinkle parmesan evenly over entire roast, massaging into meat and mixing with herbs to make a crust.
Cook on low for 5 hours.
Remove pot from base and set aside to rest for 20 minutes without lid. For best flavor, this step shouldn't be skipped. It is important to allow the meat to properly rest, so it stays moist.
Slice and serve with au jus from drippings!
