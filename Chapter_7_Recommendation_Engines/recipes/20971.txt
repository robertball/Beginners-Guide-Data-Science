Ingredients:
1 cup chili powder
1 tablespoon dried minced garlic
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons seasoning salt
2 pounds rib roast
4 cups canned tomato sauce
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup chopped fresh tomato
1/4 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons dried onion flakes
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup water

Directions:
In a small bowl or jar, mix together chile powder, dried minced garlic, onion powder, cumin, salt and seasoning salt.
Place rib roast on a medium baking sheet. Rub vigorously with 1/2 the chile powder mixture. Cover and refrigerate 4 to 6 hours.
In a medium saucepan, mix together 1/2 the chile powder mixture, tomato sauce, brown sugar, tomato, Worcestershire sauce, dried onion flakes, soy sauce and water. Cook 3 to 5 hours, stirring occasionally, over low heat.
Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect heat. Lightly oil grate.
Cook ribs covered on the prepared grill 3 to 5 hours, or to desired doneness. Brush with the sauce mixture from the medium saucepan during the last minutes of cooking. Serve with remaining sauce mixture.
