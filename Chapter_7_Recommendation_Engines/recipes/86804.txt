Ingredients:
4 zucchini, cubed
3 tablespoons chopped fresh dill weed
ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon margarine, melted
2 large tomatoes, sliced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves
3/4 cup grated Romano cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2-quart casserole dish.
Place zucchini in a pot fitted with a steamer basket over boiling water. Steam 5 minutes, or until tender but firm. Transfer to the casserole dish. Mix the dill, pepper, and margarine, and stir into the casserole dish, evenly coating zucchini. Layer tomato slices over zucchini, and sprinkle with basil and Romano cheese.
Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and golden brown.

Description: 
A light, yummer summer dish with zucchini, tomato, and Romano cheese. Depending on your tastes and dietary restrictions, you can play with this recipe a lot. One of my favorite ways is to sprinkle cheese on the zucchini before adding the tomatoes.
