Ingredients:
1 pound bacon
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 (10 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
1/4 cup mayonnaise

Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, about 12 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Cool; chop coarsely.
