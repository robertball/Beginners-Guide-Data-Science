Ingredients:
2 smoked turkey legs
1 large red onion, cut in half
1 large Spanish onion, cut in half
1 large carrot, cut in thirds
1 large red bell pepper, seeded (optional)
1 tablespoon olive oil
7 quarts cold water
5 cloves garlic, lightly smashed
10 whole black peppercorns
salt to taste
1 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Brush the turkey legs, red onion, Spanish onion, carrot, and red bell pepper with olive oil; place into a roasting pan.
Roast in the preheated oven until the turkey and vegetables turn brown, about 15 minutes.
Pour 7 quarts water into a large stockpot over medium heat. Add the roasted turkey and vegetables, the garlic, and black peppercorns to the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer.
Place the roasting pan over a stove burner (two burners, if it will fit) and heat until the drippings sizzle. Pour in 1 cup of water and scrape up and dissolve all the browned flavor bits from the roasting pan into the water. Pour the drippings mixture into the stock.
Simmer for 6 hours, periodically skimming and discarding the foamy scum that forms on the top of the broth. Pour the stock through a strainer, discarding the turkey and vegetables (they have given up all their flavor). Cool and store in airtight containers. Can be frozen.
