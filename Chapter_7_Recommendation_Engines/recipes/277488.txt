Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package fudge brownie mix (such as Betty Crocker™)
2  eggs
⅔ cup vegetable oil
¼ cup rum
½ cup chocolate chips (optional)
1 ½ cups white rum, or more as needed
1 (8 ounce) container chocolate shell topping (such as Magic Shell®)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.
Combine brownie mix, eggs, vegetable oil, and water in a large bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon until well blended. Stir in chocolate chips. Spread batter into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted 2 inches from the side of the pan comes out clean, 38 to 40 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cool completely. Cut brownies into 20 squares and roll into balls about the size of a golf ball.
Pour rum into a bowl. Pour entire contents of chocolate shell topping into a separate bowl. Line a cookie sheet with waxed paper.
Submerge each brownie ball in rum for about 2 seconds, dip into shell topping to coat, and place on the prepared cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining balls. Place in the refrigerator until chocolate coating is hard, 10 to 15 minutes.
