Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 1/2 cups sugar
4 egg whites
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups cake flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
FILLING/TOPPING:
2 (1.3 ounce) envelopes whipped topping mix
2/3 cup milk
1 cup vanilla or white chips, melted
1/4 cup strawberry jam
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, well drained
1 cup sliced fresh strawberries

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add egg whites, two at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk.
Pour into two greased and floured 9-in. baking pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
In a mixing bowl, beat topping mix and milk on high speed for 4 minutes or until thickened. Combine melted chips and jam; gradually beat into topping. Set aside 1 cup for filling. Cover and chill remaining mixture for 20 minutes or until it reaches spreading consistency.
Add pineapple and strawberries to reserved filling. Place one cake layer on a serving plate; spread with fruit mixture. Top with remaining cake layer. Frost top and sides of cake with chilled topping. Store in the refrigerator.
