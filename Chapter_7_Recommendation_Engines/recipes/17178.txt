Ingredients:
3 pounds bone-in chicken breast halves, with skin
1 cup water
1 cup dry white wine
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 onion, sliced
1 cup chopped celery
2 (6 ounce) packages long grain and wild rice mix
1 (16 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1 cup sour cream
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup

Directions:
Place chicken breasts in a large pot with water, wine, salt, curry powder, onion, and celery. Cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour. Remove from heat, strain (reserving broth), and refrigerate to cool. Remove chicken meat from bone, and cut into bite size pieces.
Prepare the rice mix according to package directions. Replace the specified amount of liquid with the same amount of the reserved broth.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a large bowl combine the chicken, rice, and mushrooms. Blend in the sour cream and soup. Spoon into the prepared baking dish.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour.
