Ingredients:
1 8 oz. package cream cheese (softened)*
1 16 oz. container sour cream *
1 package taco seasoning mix
1 cup shredded mexican cheese
1 cup shredded lettuce
1 cup diced tomatoes
1/4 cup sliced black olives
1/4 cup finely chopped onion (optional)
* May use light versions, but I do not recommend fat free versions.

Directions:
Mix sour cream, cream cheese and taco seasoning mix with a blender until it is mixed well, then spread onto a large round platter.
Top with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, black olives and onions (optional).
Chill in fridge for 30 minutes to set. (If you can wait that long!)
Serve with tortilla chips and enjoy!
