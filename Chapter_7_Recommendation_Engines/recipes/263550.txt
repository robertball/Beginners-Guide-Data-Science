Ingredients:
3 quarts fat-free chicken broth
1 onion, sliced into rings
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon ginger powder
1/2 teaspoon curry powder
1 pinch ground cinnamon
1 (16 ounce) package dried rice noodles
1 roasted chicken

Directions:
Combine broth, onion, hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, garlic, ginger, curry, and cinnamon in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until onions are tender, about 5 minutes.
Place noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Set aside until noodles are softened, about 15 minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly.
Pull meat from roasted chicken and thickly shred. Add to broth. Spoon broth and chicken over noodles.

Description: 
Based off of recipe for Vietnamese pho, with a twist. Easy enough to make at home and good enough to forego takeout. Garnish with generous helpings of cilantro, bean sprouts, fresh basil, additional hoisin sauce, and sriracha hot sauce.
