Description: 
This is a recipe I ALWAYS make in our family! :) I was just ITCHING for a good pie, and I came up with this! This is the most Chocolatey pie Ive ever had! Serve at Christmas or  Easter!  This reminds of Baskin Robins, or Braum's Ice cream cakes! Expect THIS, is a ice cream pie! This is WONDERFUL for Birthdays, and I assure you, it is friendly to everyone! My friend who is allergic to chocolate, ate this pie because she said: This pie is to good to pass up, so chocolatey... YUM! And I promise you, you will enjoy! ;)
