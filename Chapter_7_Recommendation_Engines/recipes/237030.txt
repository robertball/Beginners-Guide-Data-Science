Ingredients:
1 pound dried chickpeas (garbanzo beans)
2 tablespoons olive oil
kosher salt to taste

Directions:
Place chickpeas into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain chickpeas and pat dry.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Toss chickpeas, olive oil, and salt together in a bowl until evenly coated; spread in single layer on a baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven, stirring every 8 minutes, until chickpeas are browned and crisp, about 40 minutes. Toss chickpeas with more salt and cool completely.
