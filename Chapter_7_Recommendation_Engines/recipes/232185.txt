Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 cup instant rice
1 white onion, chopped
1 egg
1 (28 ounce) can tomato sauce
28 fluid ounces water

Directions:
Mix ground beef, rice, onion, and egg together in a bowl with your hands; shape into tennis-ball sized balls.
Stir tomato sauce and water together in a large pot; bring too a boil. Gently lie meatballs into the sauce, place cover on the pot, and reduce heat to medium-low.
Cook until meatballs are no longer pink in the center, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Put meatballs on a plate, cut each into halves, and ladle sauce over the meatballs to serve.

Description: 
My dad created this recipe in college. And has been a family favorite ever since! For added flavor, add seasoning salt to beef, or use bison.
