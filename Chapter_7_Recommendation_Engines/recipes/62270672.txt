Ingredients:
2 cups leftover cooked white rice
3 cups milk (any kind)
1/2 cup sugar
small pinch salt
1/2 cup raisins
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
Combine cooked rice, milk, sugar and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and stir in the vanilla, cinnamon and raisins. Cook until just about all of the milk is absorbed (30-45 minutes, depending on how absorbent your rice is).
Divide rice pudding into individual serving dishes serve warm or chilled.
