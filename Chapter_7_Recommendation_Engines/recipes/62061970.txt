Meanwhile, melt the 1/3 stick of butter in a frying pan.  Add thawed chicken to the pan.  Continue sauteeing chicken until it is white on both sides, then add 1 cup white cooking wine, 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, 1 tsp. paprika, 2 tsp. onion powder (or minced), 1 bullion cube/packet.  Finish cooking the chicken in this sauce until it is lightly browned and tender throughout.  Drain the pasta and pour chicken with sauce over it to serve.
