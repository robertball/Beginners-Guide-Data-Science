Ingredients:
2 tbsp flour
2 tbsp sugar
2 tbsp (heaping) cocoa powder
2 tbsp unsweetened applesauce
2 tbsp Greek Yogurt
Pinch salt
Pinch baking soda
Pinch cinnamon
1 tsp Nutella (optional)

Directions:
Put all ingredients in a microwavable coffee mug. Mix well. Microwave on high for 1 to 1.5 minutes. Do not over cook, you will see a molten center in your brownie. Let cool a couple minutes then enjoy!

Description: 
I have seen many recipes that call for cooking oil, which I think ruins the flavor of the brownie! This brownie weighs in at about 250 calories (about 400 less than others that I have seen) and it is a chocolatey, cakey treat!
