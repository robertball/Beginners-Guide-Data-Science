Total time
3 hours 10 mins
Serves: 6 servings
Ingredients
1 refrigerated pie crust
3 eggs
1 cup sugar
? cup dark corn syrup
? cup melted butter
? teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1½ cups chopped pecans (or a combination of chopped and whole pecan halves)
Vanilla ice cream for serving
Instructions

Directions:
Spray the inside of a crock pot with cooking spray.
Place pie crust in crock pot and mold it to fit the shape of the crock pit. (This is easier if you have a round crock pot instead of an oval one, but you can make do with an oval.)
Stir remaining ingredients together, except pecans, until mixed well.
Stir in pecans. I like to leave about half the pecans to arrange on top of the filling to make it look prettier.
Pour filling into pie crust. If you reserved some pecans, gently place them on top of the filling.
Cover crock pot and cook on HIGH for 2½ to 3 hours.

Description: 
Now that I’ve made Pecan Pie in a crock pot, I’m thoroughly convinced that anything can be made in a crock pot. The super-sweet filling that is so characteristic of a pecan pie sets up perfectly and the pecans turn beautifully golden in color.

For my family, fall and especially Thanksgiving is all about the pecan pie. Since I get a little tired (ok, a lot tired) of always cooking things the same way, I was really excited to try a Crock Pot Pecan Pie.
