Ingredients:
Sugar cookie dough ~ can be home made,
a store bought tube, or from a package
2  8oz packages of cream cheese softened
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 T vanilla
1/2 cup cinnamon chips
2 large apples sliced ~ I like green or yellow
cinnamon & sugar mixture
nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Press sugar cookie dough into a pan. If you want thicker bars use 13x9, if you want them a little thinner use a small or medium cookie sheet or 13x9 and 8x8. Bake until light golden on edges.
In medium bowl mix cream cheese, brown sugar and vanilla, add cinnamon chips. Set aside until cookie is cooled. While cooling you can cut apples into thin slices.
When cookie is cooled spread cream cheese mixture over cookie. Place apple slices across the top in a single layer.
Sprinkle cinnamon & sugar over apple bars, then sprinkle lightly with nutmeg. This not only tastes great but keeps the apples from browning!
Cut into squares & serve immidiately or refrigerate for later.
