Ingredients:
2 lbs. stew meat
1 large bag frozen vegetables
1 46 oz. can tomato juice
1 12 oz. can V-8
2 cans cut up tomatos
3 chopped new potatos
2 chicken bouillion cubes
2 soup bones

Directions:
cook meat till tender. add all other ingredients. bring to a boil then reduce heat, cover, and simmer two hours.  add water as needed.
Sometimes, I omit the frozen package of vegetables and add just the canned vegetables I really like - extra corn and less lima beans. :-) Also, if you want more liquid, I have added a full 46 oz. can of V-8 and the recipe is just fine.  Just remember to use the soup bones.

Description: 
This soup is so delicious and healthy.  My husband and 13 year old son hate tomatoes and they love this soup and I feel good giving it to them.  If you never made soup, the soup bones are critical - don't omit them - it will not be the same.
