Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
3/4 pound lean ground beef
1 1/2 tablespoons reduced-sodium taco seasoning mix
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 (14.5 ounce) can no-salt-added fire-roasted tomatoes with juices
1 (14 ounce) can reduced-sodium black beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup fresh corn kernels
1/2 cup water
3 cups spiralized zucchini
1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup chopped green onion

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add beef; cook for 4 minutes, stirring to break up lumps. Increase heat to medium-high. Add taco seasoning and salt; cook, stirring often, until meat is browned, about 2 minutes more. Stir in tomatoes, beans, corn, and water; bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
Stir in zucchini. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, covered, until zucchini is just tender, about 3 minutes. Divide among 4 bowls. Top servings with cheese and green onion.
