Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite size pieces
1/2 cup lemon juice
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
2 garlic cloves
1/2 onion chopped
1 bay leaf
1 (12 ounce) package corn tortillas
1 head lettuce, shredded
2 large tomatoes, chopped
1 (8 ounce) package shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 (8 ounce) jar salsa
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream

Directions:
Make marinade out of ingredients and marinate overnight.
In a large skillet over medium heat, simmer until chicken is no longer pink, and juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, warm the tortillas in the oven or microwave until soft.  When chicken is fully cooked, transfer to serving bowl. Place lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, salsa, and sour cream in serving dishes. Each person can create their own wrap, using their preferred ingredients.
