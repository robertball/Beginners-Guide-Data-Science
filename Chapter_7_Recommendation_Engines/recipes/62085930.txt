Description: 
During my vegetarian kick, I discovered fake ground beef and found it to be quite delicious!  I had a craving for beefy mac and cheese and this is the recipe I came up with.  You may use ground beef or turkey instead of the vegetarian ground beef.  The vegetarian version has the same great taste without the fat and the greasy aftertaste.
