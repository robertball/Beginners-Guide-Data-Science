Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter
5 tablespoons white sugar, divided
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons water
3 eggs, separated
4 cups chopped rhubarb
1 1/2 cups white sugar, or more to taste
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Mix together flour, butter, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a medium-sized bowl. Pat crust into a 8-inch square pan, bringing up the sides.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool completely.
While crust is cooling, make a slurry of cornstarch and water in a small bowl. Set aside. Beat separated egg yolks in a small bowl. Pour yolks into a large saucepan; add rhubarb and 1 1/2 cups sugar, adjusting to tartness of rhubarb. Bring to a boil over medium heat, about 5 minutes. Add cornstarch slurry to boiling rhubarb as needed to thicken mixture. Pour into the cooled crust.
Beat egg whites, 3 tablespoons sugar, vanilla extract, and salt together in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form. Spread completely over rhubarb filling.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
When my husband and I were first married, we lived in a house with a huge rhubarb patch. I experimented with many recipes and came up with this dessert. It has been a family favorite for many years now.
