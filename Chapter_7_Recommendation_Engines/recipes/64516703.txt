Ingredients:
3 slices thick cut bacon, diced
1 T olive oil
1 large head cauliflower, cut into small bite sized pieces
1 t. kosher salt
½ t. freshly ground pepper
1 large clove garlic, minced
½ cup white wine
½ cup Swanson chicken broth
¾ t. fresh thyme, minced

Directions:
1. Add diced bacon to cold sauté pan and turn on heat to medium high heat. Cook bacon until fat is rendered and bacon is crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon from pan to paper towel to drain.
2. Add olive oil, cauliflower, salt and pepper to the pan and sauté over medium high heat until cauliflower begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
3. Stir in wine, broth and thyme and bring mixture to a boil. Reduce the temperature to medium and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until cauliflower begins to soften and liquid has almost completely evaporated, about 12 minutes.
4. Stir in the reserved bacon and adjust seasoning to taste. Serve immediately!
