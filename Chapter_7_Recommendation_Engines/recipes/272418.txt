https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon sea salt
3/4 cup cold butter
1/4 cup shortening
1/2 cup ice water
8 cups fresh blackberries
1 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons potato starch

Directions:
Mix flour and salt together in a medium mixing bowl. Cut in butter and shortening using a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse oatmeal. Stir in ice water until dough comes together into a ball. Divide into 2 pieces.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and roll out into 10-inch crusts. Place 1 crust into a 9-inch pie pan.
Combine blackberries, sugar, and potato starch in a large mixing bowl. Pour the berry mixture into the pie crust. Lay the second crust over the berries. Press edges together to seal; crimp with a fork. Make 4 small slits in the top crust.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until top is golden brown, about 45 minutes.
Let cool completely until set, about 2 hours.

In late July, blackberries grow everywhere in my hometown. I came up with this pie recipe after coming home with a big basket full of fresh, ripe berries.
