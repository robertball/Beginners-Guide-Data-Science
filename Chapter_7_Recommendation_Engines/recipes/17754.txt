In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar. Beat in the egg and mashed bananas. Mix in flour, baking soda and salt just until combined. Pour into prepared loaf pan.

Description: 
Every time there is a party or any type of gathering, I'm asked to bring a loaf of my homemade banana bread. It's always the first to go and I'm always jotting down the recipe afterwards for friends. It's simple, quick and delicious!
