Ingredients:
Reynolds® Bakeware Bacon Pan
4 slices bacon
5 tablespoons maple syrup, divided, plus additional for serving (optional)
1 cup yellow cornmeal
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
2 eggs
1/4 cup butter, melted
Reynolds® Bakeware Pan

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Arrange bacon in a Reynolds(R) Bakeware Bacon Pan.
Bake for 8 minutes, until almost crisp. Drizzle the bacon with 1 tablespoon maple syrup and bake 4 to 6 minutes more or until glazed. Cook longer for crispier bacon. Cool and chop.
Stir together the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, butter and remaining 4 tablespoons maple syrup. Add the milk mixture all at once to the cornmeal mixture. Add the chopped bacon. Stir just until moistened. Pour the batter into an 8x8-inch Reynolds(R) Bakeware Pan.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Let cool slightly before serving.
Drizzle with additional maple syrup, if desired.
