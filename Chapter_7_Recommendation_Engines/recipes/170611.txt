Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa
2 cups water
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup golden raisins
1/3 cup sliced almonds
1/4 cup mint leaves, chopped
3/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring the quinoa and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, and the water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Scrape the quinoa into a large bowl, and refrigerate until cold.
Stir the garbanzo beans, cranberries, raisins, almonds, mint, coriander, cumin, and olive oil into the quinoa. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
