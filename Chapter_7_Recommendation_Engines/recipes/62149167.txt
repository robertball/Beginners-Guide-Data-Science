Ingredients:
2 boneless chicken breasts
1/2 pound bacon
1/2-3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 tsp. Chipotle Chili powder (adjust to taste)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Cut chicken into 1 inch cubes. Count your cubes.
Cut bacon into half or thirds, depending on the amount of chicken cubes you made.
Wrap each chicken cube with bacon and use a toothpick to secure the bacon.
Mix your brown sugar and chipotle powder together.  I know my Chipotle powder is HOT.  If you are buying this new like I did...taste it first.
Cover your cookie sheet with foil.  Place a cooling rack on the foil and spray with non-stick spray.
Place bacon wraps on the rack and bake 30 minutes.
