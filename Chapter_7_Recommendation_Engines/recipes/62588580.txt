Ingredients:
3/4 cup raspberry vinaigrette
2 tablespoons chopped green onion
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons dried rosemary, crushed
1/2 to 1 teaspoon pepper
4 bone-in pork loin chops (6 ozs each)
1 tablespoon canola oil
2 cups sliced fresh strawberries (1/4-inch sliced)

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the vinaigrette, onion, brown sugar, paprika, and Worcestershire sauce; set aside.  Combine rosemary and pepper; rub over both sides of all pork chops.
In a large skillet, cook chops in oil over medium heat for 5-6 minutes on each side or until browned.  Pour vinaigrette mixture over meat; cook 3-4 minutes longer or until pork juices run clear.
Remove pork chops and keep warm.  Add strawberries to the cooking juices and toss to coat; serve with pork chops.
