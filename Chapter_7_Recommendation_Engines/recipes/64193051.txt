Ingredients:
A 9? spring form pan, sprayed with non-stick spray
Approx. 2 cups crushed pretzels
6 cups cooked mac & cheese
3 eggs

Directions:
Crush up your pretzels in a food processor and mix one egg into the crumbs. Process egg and crumbs well until it's the consistancy of wet sand.
Add all crumbs to the sprayed pan.  Genty press down the mixture to the bottom of the pan.  Form the crust so it travels slightly up the sides of the pan.
Mix two eggs into your cooked macaroni and cheese and pour evenly on top of your pretzel crust.
Bake it at 350 degrees for approx. 45 minutes to an hour, or until itâ€™s golden, and firm all the way through.
Let it cool almost completely before slicing into it.
