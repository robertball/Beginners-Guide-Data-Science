Ingredients:
3 cups all purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons honey
1 bottle beer
4 tablespoons butter (can be doubled if desired)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x5x5 inch loaf pan with butter.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Using a wooden spoon, stir the beer and honey into the dry ingredients until just mixed.
Pour half the melted butter into the loaf pan. Then spoon the batter into the pan, and pour the rest of the butter on top.
Bake for 50-60 minutes until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
