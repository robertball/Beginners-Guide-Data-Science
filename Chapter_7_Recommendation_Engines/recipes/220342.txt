Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 cup dried shiitake mushrooms
5 cups beef broth
16 ounces barley
1 sweet onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon celery seed
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 cup heavy cream (optional)
1 cup frozen green beans (optional)

Directions:
Cook and stir ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease, and transfer beef to a slow cooker.
Place shiitake mushrooms into a food processor and pulse several times to cut the mushrooms into small pieces.
Stir shiitake mushrooms, beef broth, barley, sweet onion, garlic, black pepper, salt, celery seed, and parsley with the ground beef in the slow cooker.
Cook on Low for 5 hours.
Stir heavy cream and green beans into the soup and cook 1 hour more.

Description: 
A wintertime comfort food at its best. I cook for 8 people with big appetites, so halve this recipe for a smaller group. If you like green bean casserole, try adding green beans and some fried onions on top for a tasty twist. Remember, homemade broth has the best flavor, but you can substitute store-bought or chicken or turkey broth.
