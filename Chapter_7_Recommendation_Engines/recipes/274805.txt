Ingredients:
1 teaspoon instant espresso powder
1 tablespoon water
1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
4 ounces dark bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1 pint cold heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Dissolve espresso powder into water in a bowl.
Combine espresso mixture, condensed milk, chocolate, vanilla extract, and salt in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Beat heavy whipping cream using an electric mixer in a mixing bowl until soft peaks form and cream is fluffy but not firm, 1 to 3 minutes. Fold 1/3 of the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold in remaining cream until thoroughly combined.
Pour entire mixture into a 1-quart container. Place plastic wrap directly on top of the ice cream to keep it from getting icy. Cover the container and freeze 8 hours to overnight.
