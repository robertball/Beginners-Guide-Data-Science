Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
6  onions, thinly sliced
½ teaspoon salt
1 ½ cups white wine
3 ½ cups chicken broth
¼ teaspoon ground white pepper
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 cups shredded Gruyere cheese

Directions:
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, cook butter until foamy.  Stir in onions and cook a couple of minutes, then reduce heat, stir in salt, cover and cook very slowly until very tender, 60 minutes.
Transfer onions and their caramel to a larger pot and place it over medium heat.  Pour in the wine and bring to a boil.  Stir in chicken broth, pepper and nutmeg and simmer gently, uncovered, 15 minutes.
Stir in shredded cheese until melted (cheese will remain a little stringy).  Serve.
