Ingredients:
3/4 cup water, warm
2 T butter
1 egg
3 1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/4 t salt
scant 1 T yeast

Directions:
Mix and knead all of the dough ingredients by hand, mixer, or bread machine to make a soft, smooth dough.
Cover the dough, and let it rise for 1 hour, or until it's doubled in bulk.
Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into 8 pieces. Shape each piece into a round 1" thick (more or less); flatten to about 3" across. Place the buns on a lightly greased baking sheet, cover, and let rise for about an hour, until very puffy.
If desired, brush buns with melted butter (soft crust), or brush lightly with egg wash (1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water), and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
Bake the buns in a preheated 375F oven for 12 to 15 minutes, till golden. Cool on a rack.

Description: 
By King Arthur website:  as I recall, these were really good, but you want to keep as much air in dough as possible when shaping ... try gently rolling out and using biscuit cutter for shaping slider buns.
