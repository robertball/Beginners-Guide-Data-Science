Sprinkle remaining 1 t. oregano, salt and fresh ground black pepper evenly over chicken and potatoes.
It is important to follow steps in order so you have a beautiful presentation.
Cover with foil and bake at 350 for 30 min

Covering with foil will prevent the potatoes from getting too dark and crispy.  You may need to adjust time depending on your oven.

Description: 
This is a delicious EASY recipe that I learned from my Greek mother-in-law.  Of course, it is my own version, but we won't tell her that.  Chicken is marinated in fresh lemon, olive oil and oregano, then baked with potatoes that soak up all of the lemon flavor and cook up to a beautiful golden presentation. MUST serve with tzatziki  - to die for dinner!
