Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup whole or 2% milk
4 tablespoons apple-cider vinegar
2 cup all-purpose flour
4 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons vanilla
1 tablespoon cinnamon
2 egg
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup water
cooking spray

Directions:
Combine milk with vinegar in a medium bowl and set aside for 8-10 minutes to "sour".
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in a large mixing bowl.  Blend well.
Whisk egg, vanilla and into "soured" milk.
Pour the flour mixture into the wet ingredients and whisk until lumps are gone.
Add in water.  Whisk until smooth.
Slowly drizzle in melted butter, folding in by hand.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side.  For a nice, crisp pancake, flip back one more time for about 20 seconds.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
Tall, fluffy pancakes are delicious served with butter and syrup or top with strawberries and whipped cream for a real treat.

My modification: Our family likes these but slightly thinner and a tad sweeter.  I also moved the step where you add the butter to allow pockets of butter to spread throughout the pancakes evenly.Modified from: Fluffy Pancakes - Modified
