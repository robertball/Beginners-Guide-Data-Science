Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups spelt flour
1 cup rolled oats
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 very ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 cup sunflower seed oil
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Whisk together spelt flour, oats, baking soda, and cinnamon in a bowl. Stir together bananas, oil, and sugar in a separate bowl. Stir banana mixture into spelt mixture just until dry ingredients are moistened; divide mixture evenly into 12 muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Cool in pan for 10 minutes; remove to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
A delicious vegan muffin that is crisp and golden on top, dense and hearty inside, and totally addictive. This recipe is a recreation of my favourite muffins from a terrific vegan cafe in Toronto. 

Tasty flavour additions to this basic muffin batter include: chopped sweet potato and dates, pear and walnuts, apple and cranberries, or whatever else may tickle your fancy.
