Ingredients:
6 corn dogs
1/2 cup leftover mashed potatoes
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake the corn dogs according to package directions.
When corn dogs are cool enough to handle, remove the sticks, and split in half lengthwise. Remove the hot dog part, leaving the cornbread shell intact. Chop the hot dogs into small pieces, and place in a medium bowl. Mix in the mashed potatoes. Fill each corn shell with an equal amount of the potato mixture. Sprinkle cheese over the top.
Return to the oven, and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
We discovered these treats when my 6-year-old wanted to take the hot dog part out of his corn dogs. Now everyone loves them, and they are a different twist on the regular old corn dog. You can add other fixings to these---be creative! Kids love these!
