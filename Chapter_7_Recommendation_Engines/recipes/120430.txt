Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 pounds fresh asparagus, trimmed
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1/2 cup whipping cream, whipped

Directions:
Broil chicken 6 in. from the heat until juices run clear. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, bring 1/2 in. of water to a boil. Add asparagus.  Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 3-5 minutes or until crisp-tender.  Drain and place in a greased shallow 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. Cut chicken into thin slices.
In a bowl, combine the soup, Worcestershire sauce and nutmeg. Spread half over asparagus. Sprinkle with 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Top with chicken. Spread remaining soup mixture over chicken; sprinkle with 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese.
Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes. Fold whipped cream into mayonnaise; spread over top. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese. Broil 4-6 in. from the heat for about 2 minutes or until golden brown.

I first came across this recipe at a restaurant while living in New York City many years ago. This makes a delectable dish for lunch or dinner served with a simple tossed salad.                --Jeanne Koelsch, San Rafael, California
