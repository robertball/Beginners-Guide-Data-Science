Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/2 pound bacon
1 cup chopped broccoli
1 1/2 tablespoons water
10 eggs
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble when cool enough to handle.
Meanwhile, place broccoli and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover and cook on high until tender, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Carefully remove cover and drain any liquid.
Crack eggs into a bowl and beat with a whisk. Season with salt and pepper.
Layer bacon and broccoli into each muffin cup, filling about 1/3 full. Pour egg mixture into each cup, leaving a bit of space at the top. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted at the center comes out clean or nearly clean, 15 to 20 minutes.
