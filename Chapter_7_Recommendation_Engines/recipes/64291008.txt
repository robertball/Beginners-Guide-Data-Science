Ingredients:
3 Tbsp Olive Oil
3 medium tomatoes
5 cloves of garlic, pressed
1 Lb Mushrooms
1 medium onion, finely diced
1 tsp salt
1 Tbsp sweet chili sauce
½ cup sour cream (not low fat)
1 Lb large shrimp, peeled and deveined (I left the tail on for effect)
1 1/2 cups reduced sodium chicken broth
1 tsp sea salt

Directions:
1.In a large heavy bottom skillet or a WOK, combine your diced tomatoes and pressed garlic with 3 Tbsp olive oil and simmer uncovered over medium heat until tomatoes are soft and release their juices (10-12 min). Remove your tomatoes and set aside.
2.In the same skillet over med/high heat, caramelize your diced onions and sliced mushrooms then add the tomato mixture back into the same pan.
3.Add 1 tsp salt, ½ cup sour cream and 1 Tbsp chili sauce. Stir to combine. Add in 1½ cups chicken broth and stir to combine.
4.Bring your sauce to a simmer over med/high heat and add in the shrimp. Turn the shrimp a couple times in the sauce while cooking and simmer until shrimp is cooked through. Don't overcook or your shrimp will turn rubbery.
5.Let the sauce cool down a little bit (it will thicken a little as it cools) then serve over your favorite plain rice, pasta or mashed potatoes.
