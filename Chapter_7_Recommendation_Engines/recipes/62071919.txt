Description: 
I have been making this recipe for over 13 years now.  My kids loved this from when they were 10 months on.  I came up with it when I saw that the pre-packaged oats were costlier than making from scratch.  With having 4 boys now we always go for the meals that go a little bit longer and are least expensive.  I am usually making this to serve 12 because the boys love it so much they want 2 servings and I enjoy it as well.
