Ingredients:
1 box lemon cake mix
1 small box instant lemon pudding mix
3/4 cup water
3/4 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
1/2 cup lemon juice
2 cups powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees and grease a 13" x 9" pan. In a large bowl, combine the cake mix, the instant pudding mix, water, oil, and eggs. Beat with an electric mixer according to the manufacturers directions on the box of cake mix.
Pour into the greased 13" x 9" pan. Bake in the oven at 325 degrees for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick in the center comes out clean. While the cake is in the oven, mix together the powdered sugar and lemon juice.
When the cake is done baking but still warm, poke holes in the top with a fork. Pour the powdered sugar and lemon juice mixture over the top. Let it soak in, then refrigerate. Cake is best when eaten cold.

Description: 
This is a lemon poke cake my grandma used to make. Because she lived at a high altitude, the cake would always sink in the middle, hence the name Grand Canyon Cake.
