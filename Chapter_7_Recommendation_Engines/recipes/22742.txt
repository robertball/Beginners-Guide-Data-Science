Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons egg replacer (dry)
2 tablespoons water
1 cup yellow cornmeal
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup water
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease six muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
In a small bowl, beat together egg replacer and water. In a separate bowl, combine cornmeal, flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Add egg mixture, oil and water; stir until smooth. Spoon batter into prepared muffin tins, filling each about halfway.
Bake in pre-heated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
