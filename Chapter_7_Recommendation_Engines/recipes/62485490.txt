Tandoori Harvest Sandwich Recipe

Ingredients:
1 apple (chopped)
1/3 of a bunch of kale (chopped)
1 tbsp tandoori seasoning, or other curry-type spice mix, to taste
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1/4 cup apple cider
1 tbsp olive oil
4 slices of bacon
3 cracked wheat rolls about the size of a large dinner roll, cut lengthwise as for sandwiches
3 tbsp shredded asiago cheese, separated into 1 tbsp each

Directions:
In a frying pan or skillet on medium heat, place the apple, kale, spices, and apple cider.  Drizzle the oil on top to coat the kale, then slowly mix as the kale begins to wilt.  When kale has reduced but is not fully wilted, remove from heat.  It will continue to wilt even after the heat is off.
In a separate pan, fry the bacon.  For extra flavor, fry the bacon as step one, and do the kale mixture second, cooking in the bacon grease and omitting the olive oil.  Place bacon slices on a paper towel to drain.
Spoon the kale mixture onto the rolls.  There may be some left over, depending on the size of your rolls.  Top with bacon, either crumbled, or remaining in strips, as you prefer.  Top with asiago cheese, close sandwich, and enjoy!

Description: 
This sandwich happened when I had a bacon craving and not much else in the house.  I found a few things that didn't seem to match up, but I put them together anyway and the result was much better than I could have imagined.
