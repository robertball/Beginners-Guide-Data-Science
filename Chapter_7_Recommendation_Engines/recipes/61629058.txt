Ingredients:
36 oz refrigerated plain or whole wheat pizza dough
1/3 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
6 tablespoons butter
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/2 cup raisins (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9 or 10 inch tube/Bundt pan.
Mix white sugar and cinnamon in a plastic bag. Cut dough into 11/2-inch pieces. Shake 6 to 8 pieces in the sugar cinnamon mix. Arrange pieces in the bottom of the prepared pan. Continue until all dough pieces are coated and placed in pan. If using nuts and raisins, arrange them in and among the dough pieces as you go along.
In a small saucepan, melt the butter with the brown sugar over medium heat. Boil for 1 minute. Pour over the dough. Let rise 30 minutes.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 minutes. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a plate. Do not cut! The bread just pulls apart.
