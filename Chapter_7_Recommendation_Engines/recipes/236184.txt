Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen sweetened strawberries
1 (6 ounce) can frozen limeade concentrate, thawed
3/4 cup water
3/4 cup rum
ice cubes, or as needed
4 wedges lime, for garnish

Directions:
Blend strawberries, water, rum, and limeade concentrate together in a blender until the berries are mostly pureed.
Pour about half the strawberry mixture into another container.
Add ice 1/4 cup at a time to the blender and blend until the ice is completely crushed. Continue adding ice and blending until the consistency is that of a milkshake. Pour finished daiquiri into 2 glasses and repeat blending ice with the reserved strawberry mixture. Garnish glasses with lime wedges.
