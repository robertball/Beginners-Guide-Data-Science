Ingredients:
7 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
2/3 cup shortening
1/2 cup water
1 cup mashed potatoes (without added milk and butter)
2 eggs

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups flour, sugar, yeast and salt.  In a saucepan, heat milk, shortening and water to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F.  Add to dry ingredients; beat until moistened. Add mashed potatoes and eggs; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a stiff dough. Do not knead. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and refrigerate for several hours or overnight.
Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and punch down. Divide in half. With greased hands, shape each portion into 12 balls. Roll each ball into an 8-in. rope; tie into a knot. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets; tuck ends under. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 2 hours. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks.

Description: 
'This is my favorite recipe for dinner rolls since they rise nice and high and brake up fluffy and golden brown,' says Loraine Meyer of Bend, Oregon. 'I won a ribbon at the county fair with these rolls two years in a row.'
