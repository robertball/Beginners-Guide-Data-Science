Description: 
My mom made this cake for every gathering that I can remember. It's an older recipe and is a sweet pound-like cake made without butter thus the poor man's title. The top gets a crisp crackled golden brown crust and the inside is tender soft. When she baked this cake she always gave the first slice to me.
