Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup diced onion
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 (8 ounce) jar roasted red bell peppers, drained and chopped
3 tablespoons Hunt's® Tomato Paste
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground ancho chile powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon Spanish paprika
2 (14.5 ounce) cans Hunt's® Diced Tomatoes, undrained
1/2 cup water
salt and pepper to taste
6 eggs, or more as needed

Directions:
Heat oil in skillet over medium heat. Saute onions until translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Add chopped roasted pepper and garlic; saute until garlic releases its fragrance, 1 or 2 minutes longer. Stir in tomato paste, chili powder and ancho chili powder, cumin, and paprika. Saute for another minute or so until well combined.
Stir in Hunt's(R) Diced Tomatoes and water. Season with salt and pepper. Raise heat to medium-high and bring mixture to a boil. Immediately reduce heat to medium and cook about 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Make a well for each egg and pour 1 egg into each well. Cover; poach until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 5 minutes.
