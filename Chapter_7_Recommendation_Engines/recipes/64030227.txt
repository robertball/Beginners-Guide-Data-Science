Ingredients:
Crust:
2/3 cup whole wheat pastry or white flour (90g)
1/4 cup powdered sugar or Sugar-Free Powdered Sugar (28g)
1/4 tsp salt
2 tbsp plus 2 tsp coconut oil (40g)
1 tbsp water or more coconut oil
Filling:
1/2 tbsp arrowroot or cornstarch
1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp lemon juice (90g)
1/4 cup powdered sugar or sf powdered sugar (linked above) (28g)
2 Nunaturals stevia packs or 1/16 tsp uncut, or 2 more tablespoons powdered sugar or sugar-free powdered sugar
1 cup MoriNu silken-firm or lite tofu (This is not the same as the tofu in a grocery store’s refrigerator section. See “nutrition facts” link below for where to find this.) (240g)
zest of one lemon (you can omit this)
optional: a few drops yellow food coloring or tiny pinch tumeric, only if desired for color

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F. Combine crust ingredients, either in a food processor or by hand. (Make sure the oil is melted if combining by hand.) Press evenly into a well-greased 8×8 pan. (I used a piece of wax paper over the top, so it was easier to press down.)
Cook 10 minutes, while simultaneously combining filling ingredients in a food processor or blender. After crust cooks, pour filling evenly on top and cook another 26 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes, then fridge uncovered for at least 2 hours (important, as this lets the custard set) before cutting with a sharp knife. If you’re having trouble cutting, leave out just a few minutes so the coconut oil softens.
(Note: If you want fatter squares than what are pictured, you can times the filling by 1.5, cook 10 minutes longer, and fridge 2 extra hours.) Makes 12-16 squares. These are best stored in the fridge.
