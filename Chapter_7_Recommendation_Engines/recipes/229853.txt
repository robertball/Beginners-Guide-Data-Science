Ingredients:
Coleslaw:
1 (16 ounce) package shredded coleslaw mix
1/4 cup pickled pepperoncini peppers, chopped
1/4 cup diced red onion
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon granulated garlic
1/2 teaspoon granulated onion
1/4 teaspoon lemon pepper
Catfish:
8 (3 ounce) fillets catfish
2 tablespoons hot sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)
1/2 cup Cajun seasoning
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups cornmeal
2 cups bread crumbs
1 tablespoon granulated garlic
1 tablespoon granulated onion
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 cup olive oil for frying
Assembly:
4 Italian-style hoagie buns, split lengthwise
1 cup remoulade-style sandwich spread (see footnote for recipe link)
1 lemon, cut into wedges
1 cup cherry tomato halves
1/2 cup banana pepper rings

Directions:
Combine coleslaw mix, pepperoncini peppers, red onion, mayonnaise, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, sugar, salt, 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic, 1/2 teaspoon granulated onion, and lemon pepper in a large bowl. Toss until well combined. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
Place catfish fillets in a large shallow baking dish. Sprinkle hot sauce over the top and turn the fillets to coat.
Combine Cajun seasoning, flour, cornmeal, bread crumbs, 1 tablespoon granulated garlic, 1 tablespoon granulated onion, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large brown paper bag. Add catfish fillets and shake gently to coat fillets thoroughly.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry breaded catfish fillets until browned and crisp, about 3 minutes per side. Place on paper towel-lined paper plates to drain.
Spread each hoagie bun with 1/4 cup remoulade-style spread. Place 2 catfish fillets on top and top with 1 to 2 cups coleslaw. Garnish with lemon wedge, cherry tomato halves, and banana pepper rings.
