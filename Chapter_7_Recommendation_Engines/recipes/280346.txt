Ingredients:
½ cup gluten-free sourdough starter discard
1 cup gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
½ teaspoon fine sea salt
10 tablespoons non-chlorinated water, or more if needed
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon water
2 teaspoons sesame seeds

Directions:







Submitter: 
Buckwheat Queen
Description: 
True sourdough flavor in a hearty, gluten-free bread ready for your sandwich fixings. I love the taste of this bread with butter and jam or toasted and served with soup, even though it is delicious on its own. It will hold up to spreading peanut butter or avocado.
