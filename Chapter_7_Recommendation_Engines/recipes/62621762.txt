Ingredients:
2 Cups Whole wheat flour
1 cup of Chunky peanut Butter
1 cup of skim milk
1 Tbsp of Baking Powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease two large baking trays (I use my Pampered Chef Large size stoneware bar pans)
Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl and mix until well combined.
Kneed on a lightly floured surface for 1 minute.
Roll the dough to Â¼ inch thickness and cut using a mini cookie cutter.
Place the biscuits onto the baking trays and cook in the hot oven for 20 minutes or until lightly brown.  For a more crunchy biscuit, after the 20 minutes are over, turn off the oven but leave the biscuits in the warm oven for a further 20 minutes.
Cool on a wire rack and store in an airtight container.
