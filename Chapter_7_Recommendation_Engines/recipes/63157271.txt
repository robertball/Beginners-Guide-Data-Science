Ingredients:
3/4 cup AP flour
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
2/3 cup sugar
1/2 tsp each, lemon and orange zest
1 cup whole milk cottage cheese
1 cup whole milk plain yogurt
1 tsp vanilla extract
3 eggs
1 1/3 cups blueberries, fresh or frozen
powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly grease a 2" deep 8" round pan.
Mix flour, salt and baking powder together in a small bowl. Set aside.
In a food processor, pulse together sugar and citrus zest. Add yogurt and cottage cheese and process until smooth. Add vanilla and eggs, and mix thoroughly. Add flour mixture to cheese mixture and stir in.
Pour batter into cake pan. Sprinkle on a single layer of blueberries to cover. Bake approximately 75 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with only wet crumbs. Cool at least 20 minutes before slicing. Dust with powdered sugar. Serve warm.

Description: 
Adapted from a King Arthur Flour recipe. I tried it first with ricotta and sour cream and didn't like the texture. Surprise, surprise, I tweaked! ;) It's a cross between a dense cake and a cheesecake, but makes a great breakfast. Serve warm with a cup of coffee.
