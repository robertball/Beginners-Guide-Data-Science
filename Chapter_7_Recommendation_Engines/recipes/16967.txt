Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 pound extra-lean ground beef
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
2/3 cup water
1/2 cup salsa
1/4 cup chopped jalapeno pepper
2 cups shredded Mexican-style cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9 inch pie plate with vegetable oil spray.
Press cream cheese evenly onto the bottom of the pie plate.
In a large skillet, brown the hamburger. Drain excess fat. Mix in the taco seasoning and water. Cook and stir 2 to 4 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat before mixing in salsa and jalapenos. Pour the beef mixture over the cream cheese in the pie plate. Sprinkle the Mexican-style cheese over the entire dish.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until the cheese has melted.
