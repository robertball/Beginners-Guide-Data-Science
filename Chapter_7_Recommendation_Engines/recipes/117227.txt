Ingredients:
3 pounds pork baby back ribs, cut into serving size pieces
1 (15 ounce) can peach halves, drained
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon sesame seeds, toasted
1 clove garlic, peeled
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Prepare grill for indirect heat, using a drip pan. Place ribs over drip pan. Grill, covered, over indirect medium heat for 60 minutes, turning occasionally.
Meanwhile, in a blender or food processor, combine the remaining ingredients; cover and process until smooth. Baste ribs with some of the sauce. Grill 15-20 minutes longer or until meat is tender and juices run clear, basting occasionally with remaining sauce.

Description: 
For a mouth-watering alternative to the usual barbecue sauce for ribs, try this slightly spicy recipe from Sharon Taylor of Columbia, South Carolina at your next picnic. 'The peaches add just the right touch of sweetness and a lovely color to this special sauce,' Sharon notes.
