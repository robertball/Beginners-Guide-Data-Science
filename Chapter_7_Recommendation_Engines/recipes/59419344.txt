Ingredients:
2 cans of jumbo flaky biscuts
1 pound ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon pepper
1 small head cabbage, chopped
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons caraway seeds, ground
1/2 cup melted butter

Directions:
Saute beef, onion and garlic, salt and lemon pepper  in a large skillet over medium high heat, until beef is browned. Add cabbage, Worcestershire sauce and caraway seeds. Cook until cabbage is limp; drain liquid from mixture.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
On a lightly floured board, roll each biscut into a 6 inch circle per biscuit, put filling on, folded and crimped them.  Brush dough with melted butter or egg wash (1 egg white with 2 tablespoons water).  Bake them in the oven for about 15 min., when the tops start to get golden brown.
Serve hot, or wrap and freeze for heating later.
