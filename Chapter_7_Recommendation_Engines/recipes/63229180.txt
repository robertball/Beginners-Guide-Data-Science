In a shallow baking dish, combine the olive oil, orange zest, orange juice, salt, pepper and chili flakes. Rinse the fish fillets and pat them dry. Place them into the baking dish and turn to coat with the seasonings.  Marinate for 30 minutes or more.
Combine the salsa ingredients in a glass bowl. Stir to blend and chill until ready to serve.

My son's girlfriend, Nicole, named this 'mango-licous' . The mango salsa is great over the tilapia, as a dip or on cottage cheese.Modified from: Mango-licious Tilapia
