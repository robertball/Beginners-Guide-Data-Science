Ingredients:
* 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
* 1 stick and 2 tbsp. Unsalted Butter
* 1 1/2 pint Heavy Whipping Cream
* 2 cups Shredded Parmesan Cheese
* 1/2-1 can Cream of Broccoli Soup
* 1/2-1 can Cream of Chicken Soup
* 2-4 tbsp. Basil
* 2-4 tbsp. Parsley
* 2-4 tbsp. Oregano* slightly more than other spices
* Garlic Powder to taste (I add quite a bit)
* Salt & Pepper to taste
* 1 (10 ounce) package spinach, drained
* 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the chicken breast halves on a baking sheet; bake 20 to 15 minutes, should be only lightly pink. Remove from heat, and set aside.
Preheat oven temperature to 400 degrees F.
In a saucepan melt butter over medium heat
Stir in shredded Parmesan cheese until melted
Add Heavy Cream and soup when cheese is melted (I use either a whole can of cream of broccoli or 1/2 cream of broccoli and 1/2 cream of chicken)
Add spices to taste
Set aside to thicken, keep heat low
Arrange the spinach over the bottom of a 9x9 inch baking dish.
Pour about 10-12 oz. the mixture from the saucepan over spinach
Arrange chicken breasts in the dish, and cover with 5-7 oz. of sauce mixture
Top with mozzarella cheese
Bake 20 to 25 minutes in the 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) oven, until bubbly and lightly browned.

Description: 
My boyfriend prefers to boil and shred the chicken, but I think the consistency is better when you get to cut into a piece of chicken, surrounded by cheese and a creamy spinach sauce. One of my absolute favorite meals.
