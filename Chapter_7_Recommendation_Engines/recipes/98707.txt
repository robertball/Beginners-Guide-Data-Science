Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
1 (4 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1 cup process cheese sauce
2 (13.5 ounce) packages corn tortilla chips

Directions:
Place the ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until no longer pink.  Add onion and cook until tender. Drain off grease. Stir in the contents of the seasoning packet and any water if needed in order to prepare according to package directions.
When the meat is done cooking, add the bell pepper, jalapeno pepper and sliced mushrooms to the skillet, and lower heat to medium. Cook and stir until vegetables are about halfway cooked, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the cheese sauce until everything is evenly coated.
Serve tortilla chips topped with the meat and cheese sauce, or serve buffet style where each person can top their own nachos.

Description: 
This is a recipe from my early days of cooking.  The first time I made these was for the Grey Cup (Canadian Football Championship) of 1992 and they've been yummy ever since.  Enjoy. This is a great base for nachos. Top with grated cheese, sour cream, salsa, green onions--whatever you like.
