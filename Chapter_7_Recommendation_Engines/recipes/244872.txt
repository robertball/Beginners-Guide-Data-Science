Ingredients:
1 ½ cups water
¾ cup millet
4  zucchini, ends trimmed
3 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
1  onion, chopped
1  red bell pepper, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon sea salt
¼ cup water

Directions:
Bring 1 1/2 cups water and millet to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat, cover saucepan, and simmer until water is absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes. Fluff millet with a fork.
Bring a pot of water to a boil; cook zucchini until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Drain water. Cut zucchini in half lengthwise. Spoon meat out of center, leaving a 1/8- to 1/4-inch border in zucchini. Reserve zucchini meat.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat ghee in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, red bell pepper, and garlic until slightly soft, about 5 minutes. Stir millet, zucchini meat, and salt into onion mixture. Slowly pour 1/4 cup water into mixture while constantly stirring; cook until desired consistency is reached, 3 to 5 minutes.
Spoon millet mixture into hollowed zucchini and place in a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned on top, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
Millet has a great thick consistency when cooked up (kind of like mashed potatoes) which makes everything work well for this. I am on a pretty strict diet since I have candida, so this recipe is perfect for early stage candida diet and provides doing something a little different with millet.
