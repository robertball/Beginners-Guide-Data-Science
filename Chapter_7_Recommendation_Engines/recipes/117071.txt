Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
3/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

1 1/2 cups water
2 (6 ounce) salmon fillets
1/2 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning
4 slices lemon

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the spinach, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice and garlic salt; cover and refrigerate until serving.

Bring cooker to full pressure over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook for 2 minutes. (Pressure regulator should maintain a slow steady rocking motion; adjust heat if needed.)
Remove from the heat. Immediately cool according to manufacturers directions until pressure is completely reduced. Discard lemon slices. Serve salmon with spinach sauce.

Description: 
You won't have to fish for compliments with this tasty recipe developed by Country Woman's Test Kitchen. Poaching is a quick and healthy way to prepare an entree as delicate as fish, keeping it moist and tender while cooking. And the  flavorful spinach sauce adds a pretty green accent to the pink salmon.
