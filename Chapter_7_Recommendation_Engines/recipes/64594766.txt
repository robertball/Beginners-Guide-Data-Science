Ingredients:
2 lbs ground beef
2 cups chopped celery
1 cup chopped onions
2 cans chicken broth
1 1/2 cups cold water
1/2 cup corn starch
1/2 cup uncooked rice
2 Tbsp. gluten free soy sauce
1 Tbsp. worcester sauce
12 oz. chow mein noodles (optional)

Directions:
Saute the beef, celery and onions in a large heavy skillet.
Make the gravy:
In a separate bowl, mix cold water and corn starch.
In another pot heat the chicken broth, add the corn starch and water mix once broth is hot and cook 2 more minutes, stirring often.
If you want a faster gravy option (although not gluten free) mix 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup, 1 can of Cream of Chicken Soup and 2 cans of water.
Add the beef mix, gravy mix and the rest of the ingredients except for chow mein noodles to a 9x13 pan and bake for 1 1/2 hours at 325 degrees .  Mix in and sprinkle on top chow mein noodles during the last half hour of baking time.
