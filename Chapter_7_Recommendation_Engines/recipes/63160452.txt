8 oz mushrooms, chopped

Thaw and drain spinach in colander.
Saute mushrooms and onions in butter until slightly carmelized and quite dry.

Whisk eggs with half-and-half, cheese, and ham.
Prepare pie plate with cooking oil spray.
Quickly stir cooled vegetables into egg mixture and transfer to pie plate.
Bake at 350F for 25-35 minutes until set in center.
