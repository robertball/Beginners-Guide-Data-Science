Ingredients:
1 tablespoon coconut oil
1 cup chopped red onion
8 cloves garlic, minced
2 green onions, white parts chopped and green parts thinly bias-sliced
4 Thai chile peppers, seeded and minced
1 pound fresh shiitake mushrooms, coarsely chopped
1 pound fresh oyster mushrooms, stemmed and sliced
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup calamansi (Philippine lime) juice
3 tablespoons avocado oil mayonnaise

Directions:
Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, and white parts of green onions; cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in chiles and mushrooms; cook, stirring, until tender and excess liquid evaporates, 5 to 8 minutes. Add soy sauce and calamansi juice; cook, stirring, until reduced to a glaze consistency, 5 to 7 minutes. Taste and add more soy sauce or calamansi juice to reach desired tanginess and saltiness.
Serve hot with a dollop of avocado oil mayonnaise and a sprinkle of the green parts of green onions.

Description: 
Sisig (SEE-sig) is traditionally made with chopped pig's face and served on a sizzling hot platter. The mushrooms here mimic the chewy-meaty quality of pork and don't take nearly as long to prepare. You still get all the salty, tangy, and spicy flavors. And no face gets chopped!
