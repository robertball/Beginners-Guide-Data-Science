Ingredients:
-One whole beef loin tenderloin (any size you want)
-Montreal steak seasoning
-Lea and Perrins Worcestershire

Directions:
-Trim any extra fat and the silver skin off of the loin
-I use twine and tie loops around meat to try to get it to be a more uniform shape so it cooks evenly. If one end is very thin I'll fold it under to double the thickness of it and tie it up tightly
-Coat with Worcestershire
-Put a layer of Montreal seasoning over entire loin
-Place loin in smoker once at 250-300F
-Smoke until internal temp reaches 125F
-Remove  and let rest for 30 min covered in foil
