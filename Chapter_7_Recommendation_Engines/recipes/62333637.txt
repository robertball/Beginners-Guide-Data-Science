Description: 
In the '60's, this reccipe was making the rounds of family kitchens in Southern California. The roast was covered with a can of cream of mushroom soup, sprinkled with an envelope of onion soup mix, wrapped in heavy duty foil, placed in a roasting pan and baked for hours at a slow temperature.  It was great on days we were going to be away from home for hours.  Nowadays I use my heirloom dutch oven and tweak the recipe a little.Modified from: Mom's Easy Roast
