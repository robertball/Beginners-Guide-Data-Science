Ingredients:
Veggies:
2 tablespoons olive oil or sesame oil
2 green peppers, chopped
3 cloves garlic, diced
1 pound green beans
1/2 pound chopped carrots
1 cup chopped celery, green onion, napa cabbage, or other favorite veggies (optional)
Sauce:
1/3 cup low-sodium wheat-free tamari sauce
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar, or to taste
3 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice
1 tablespoon red Thai curry paste
1/3 cup fresh natural tahini
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1 tablespoon agave nectar or sugar
1/2 cup So Delicious® Dairy Free Original Coconut Milk
Thai basil (optional)
Noodles:
1 (12 ounce) package Thai-style large or small rice noodles

Directions:
Heat oil in a large frying pan or wok over medium heat. Saute the chopped 1garlic and veggies in oil for 5-7 minutes until they soften just a bit. Then add the ingredients for the sauce to the veggies and stir to combine.
After adding the sauce ingredients, lower the heat, and continue cooking until you the sauce has reached a creamy consistency and the veggies are perfectly crunchy and cooked to your liking. You may need to add more tahini or coconut milk to get a more saucy texture if you added more veggies or if the tahini you used was somewhat less oily. Play with the amounts to get the consistency you desire.
While veggies are cooking, soak the rice noodles in a separate pot of boiling water for 3-5 minutes to soften.
Drain and then add the softened rice noodles to the wok to soak in the sauce and veggies for just a minute to mix up the flavors and sauce. Just before removing from heat, add a handful of chopped fresh Thai basil, if desired. Then toss and serve immediately.
