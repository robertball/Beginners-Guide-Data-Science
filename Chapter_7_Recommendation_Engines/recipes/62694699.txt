Ingredients:
For the Cookie Base - 2 cups Peanut Butter.
Smooth or Creamy is fine. Supermarket brands work great.
2 cups Sugar
2 Eggs (Large)
Toppings:
1 (14 ounce) can Sweetened Condensed Milk
3/4 cup Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
3/4 cup Dark Chocolate Chips
1 cup Flaked Coconut
1 cup chopped nuts (I use 1/2 cup raw Pecans and 1/2 cup raw Almonds.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Line a 13 X 9 glass pan with Parchment Paper.
Mix the Sugar and Eggs until smooth. Add in Peanut Butter and blend well. Put in pan and bake for 8 minutes to start the cookie bottom baking.
Remove from oven and layer chips, nuts, coconut on top of the peanut butter cookie layer until you have used all the ingredients.
Slowly pour the Sweetened Condensed Milk all over the top of all the layers.
Bake at 350 for 30 minutes or until coconut begins to slightly brown.
Cool completely and remove from pan. Peel away the Parchment Paper and cut on a cutting board with a sharp knife! Slice in very small squares - like fudge! Amazing and very rich!
