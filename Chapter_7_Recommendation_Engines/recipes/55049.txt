Ingredients:
1 pound bacon
1 1/2 cups diced cooked ham
2 cups shredded Swiss cheese
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 onion, chopped
4 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup baking mix
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Place bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat, and cook until crisp and evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
Mix the bacon, ham, Swiss cheese, Cheddar cheese, and onion in the baking dish. In a bowl, mix the eggs, baking mix, salt, and pepper. Pour over the ingredients in the baking dish.
Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until top is golden brown and a knife inserted in the center of the casserole comes out clean.
