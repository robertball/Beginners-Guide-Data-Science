Instructions
Boil macaroni noodles according to directions to make them very al dente. (I cook them for at least 1 minute less than directed on the bag. Mine boiled for 5 minutes). Drain and rinse under cold water.
Combine all ingredients in the slow cooker and cook on high for 2 hours or low for 3 hours, stirring once or twice.
Serve hot.
Notes
Be sure that your macaroni is cooked al dente before you put it in the slow cooker so it doesn't become mushy.
If you prefer or if you are short on time, you can bake this in the oven (and I have many many times!) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake 30 minutes covered and 30 minutes uncovered.
