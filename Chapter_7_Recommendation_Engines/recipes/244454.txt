Chef John's Teriyaki Burgers Recipe

Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef (85% lean)
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon sake
1 tablespoon mirin
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon sriracha hot pepper sauce
1 teaspoon brown sugar
4 slider-size burger buns
4 leaves lettuce
4 slices tomato

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Break up ground beef with the tip of a fork in a bowl. Drizzle in the soy sauce, sake, mirin, Worcestershire sauce, and sriracha sauce; crumble in brown sugar. Use tines of a fork to evenly distribute ingredients. Finish mixing with your hands (ideally your hands should be very cold for this). Shape into 4 equal-sized patties.
Grill until browned and cooked through turning once, 3 or 4 minutes per side. When burgers develop a slight dome shape and juices begin to come through the top surface, they are done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Serve burgers on slider buns with lettuce and tomato slices.

Description: 
Instead of using a sauce on the outside, I'm putting key teriyaki flavorings into the ground meat for these teriyaki burgers. Ideally these burgers should be cooked on a medium-hot charcoal grill, weather permitting.
