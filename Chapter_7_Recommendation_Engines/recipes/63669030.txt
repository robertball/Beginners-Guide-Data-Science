Vanilla Almond Cocoroons Recipe

Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups unsweetened coconut
3/4 cup almond flour
4 1/2 Tablespoons coconut oil
9 Tablespoons maple syrup
1 teaspoon pure almond extract
3 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 tsp. sea salt

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 200 degrees F
Put all of the ingredients into a food processor or blender like a Vitamix and pulse and scrape down sides until thoroughly combined. Donâ€™t overdo it or the coconut will start to liquify.
Portion the mixture into 15 cookies onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. I use a small cookie scoop or teaspoon to make little mounds.
Place cookie sheet in warm oven. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off but leave the cookie sheet inside until it is completely cool(several hours or overnight.) This will allow the cookies to dry out a bit so they are easier to handle. Store finished cookies in the refrigerator.
***If you don't want to wait to dry them out a bit, you may place them in the refrigerator right after they are done in the oven & they will be set enough to eat after 30 minutes cooling in the refrigerator.
