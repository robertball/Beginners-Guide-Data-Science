2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg whites and melted butter; mix until smooth.

Description: 
I loved this pancake recipe. Way better than a mix at the store but I wanted to cut a little of the fat. I make them with less butter, egg whites instead of a whole egg, and non-fat milk. They are so fluffy and tasty plus I feel great about giving them to my family.Modified from: Good Old Fashioned Pancakes
