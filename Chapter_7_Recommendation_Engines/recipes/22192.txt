Ingredients:
1/4 cup plum jam
1 cup pitted and sliced plums
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1/2 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
1/3 cup hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root
3 tablespoons dry white wine
1 teaspoon white sugar
3 cups shredded savoy cabbage
3 small carrots, shredded
8 (8 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
To Make Plum Sauce: Combine the plum jam, plums and vinegar in 1-quart saucepan. Mix together and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until plums are tender. Set aside and keep warm.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high  heat. Cook chicken in oil for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink in center.
Stir in remaining ingredients except tortillas. Cook 4 to 6 minutes, stirring constantly, until cabbage is crisp-tender.
Warm tortillas. Place 1/3 cup of the chicken mixture on each tortilla; roll tortilla around filling. Serve wraps with Plum Sauce.
