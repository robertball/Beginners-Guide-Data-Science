1 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. ground black pepper (optional)

Put the water up to a boil and add the chicken soup, if using.
In a bowl, combine 1 TBsp. of butter, egg, milk, salt and pepper, if using.
Add flour, a little at a time, until the mixture is similar to that of cookie dough. If the dough is too stiff, add a little milk or water (about 1 TBsp. or so).
Dip a teaspoon in hot water and scoop small pieces of dough (about 1/4 tsp.) and drop carefully into boiling water. Continue to dip spoon in hot water if the dough starts to stick.
Boil noodles for about 5 minutes, or until they rise to the surface. Drain in a colander.
Melt 1 TBsp. in a saucepan and add noodles. Stir gently until all are coated.
