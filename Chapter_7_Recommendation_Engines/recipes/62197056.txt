Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
6 Green onions, sliced
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon paprika
1 (49.5 oz) can of chicken broth
1 (14 1/2 oz) can diced tomatoes in juice
4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cooked and chopped. (I like to season mine with chili powder and cumin, then toss them in the turbo broiler.)
Hot sauce to taste
1 (29 oz) can hominy in juice
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 Lime

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add cumin and paprika, stir spices constantly for about a minute. Add broth, hominy with juice, green onions, tomatoes with juice, 1 tomato can filled with water and chicken. Add lime juice and hot sauce to taste; bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer 15 minutes. Garnish with cilantro just before serving. Enjoy.
