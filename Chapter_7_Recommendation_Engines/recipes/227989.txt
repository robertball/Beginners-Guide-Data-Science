Ingredients:
10 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
2 (16 ounce) cans whole berry cranberry sauce
2 teaspoons curry powder, or more to taste
1 McIntosh apple - peeled, cored, and cubed
1 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Arrange chicken thighs in an 8x8-inch glass baking dish. Stir cranberry sauce, curry powder, apple, and raisins together in a bowl; spread over the chicken.
Bake uncovered until sauce is bubbling and thickened, about 35 minutes. Cover dish with foil, reduce oven heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and return to oven for 30 more minutes. Reduce temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) and bake until chicken juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink inside, about 30 more minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
