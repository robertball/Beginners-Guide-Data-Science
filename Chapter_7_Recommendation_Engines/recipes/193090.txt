Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds skirt steak
1 1/2 cups Newman's Own速 Herb & Roasted Garlic Marinade
1 1/2 cups plain non-fat yogurt
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon paprika
2 tablespoons Newman's Own速 Lighten Up速 Light Lime Vinaigrette
1 large seedless cucumber, 1/2 grated for dressing, 1/2 cubed for salad
Pita breads or pockets, quartered
2 heads romaine lettuce, chopped
1/2 cup jarred roasted red peppers, chopped
1/2 cup halved Kalamata olives
1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
2 tomatoes, seeded and diced
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Marinate steak with marinade for 30 minutes or longer. Heat indoor grill pan or outdoor grill over high heat.
Cucumber Lime Tzatziki dressing: In a bowl, stir together yogurt, garlic, paprika, lime vinaigrette and grated cucumber. Cover and chill.
Remove steak from marinade and discard marinade. Grill steak on one side until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Turn steak over and cook to medium-rare, about 3 to 4 minutes more. Let stand for 5 minutes then slice thinly against the grain. Brush pita triangles with olive oil then place on grill, watching closely, until golden brown.
In a large salad bowl toss lettuce, chopped cucumber, red peppers, olives, onion, tomatoes and feta. Divide salad evenly among plates, top with steak and pitas. Drizzle with dressing. Enjoy!
