Ingredients:
1 box Betty Crocker Pound Cake
1 tin coconut milk
2 eggs
1/2 stick of butter
2/3 cup sweetened coconut flake
2/3 cup pinapple juice
3 tablespoons of dark (unspiced) rum or 1 teaspoon of rum or vanilla extract
1 - 1 1/2 cup powdered icing sugar

Directions:
Blend cake mix as directed (substituting coconut milk for water).
Before baking (as directed on the box) fold in 2/3 cup sweetened coconut flake.)
Bake as directed on the cake mix box.
In a glass bowl combine, powdered sugar with the remainder of coconut milk from the tin, 3/4 cup pinapple juice and 3 tablespoons of dark rum or 1 teaspoon rum or vanilla extract.  The glaze should be the consistency of honey.  Set aside.
Once the cake is done, remove from the oven and immediately poke holes in the cake with a chop stick (approximately 40 deep holes per cake).
Pour over 1 cup of the glaze while the cake is still hot.
Allow the cake to sit for 20 minutes then remove and allow to cool completely out of the pan.
This is delicious served with ice cream with a drizzle of the remaining glaze or serve the remaining glaze on the side.

Description: 
While having tea in a sea side resort in Barbados, we had a version of this; but made with oranges.

We took it one step further in our version of a pina colada cake; adding flavors of this favorite Caribbean cocktail.
