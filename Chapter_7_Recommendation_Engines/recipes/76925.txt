Ingredients:
1/4 cup low-sodium canned chicken broth
1/4 cup dry vermouth or dry white wine
4 canned tomatoes, chopped
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Combine broth, vermouth, tomatoes and rosemary in a measuring cup.  Pour contents of the measuring cup into a heated skillet; boil until liquid is reduced by about half. Tilt skillet so that the liquid is at one side of the pan, then whisk in butter until sauce is smooth. Spoon sauce over cooked steaks and serve immediately.

Description: 
This sauce can be made in minutes as the cooked steaks rest. To make the sauce ahead, leave out the butter. Reheat just before serving, adding water if the sauce has reduced too much, then whisk in the butter. This amount is enough for four steaks.
