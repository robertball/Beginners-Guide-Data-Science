Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup unsalted butter
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
1/4 cup molasses
3 tablespoons natural sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift together the flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt. Set aside.
Sift together both the flours, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and 1 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, then stir in the water and molasses. Gradually stir the sifted dry ingredients into the molasses mixture. Shape dough into walnut-sized balls, and roll them in the natural sugar.  Place the cookie balls 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet, and flatten slightly.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.
