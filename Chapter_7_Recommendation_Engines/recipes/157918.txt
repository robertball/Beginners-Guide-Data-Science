Ingredients:
3 quarts vegetable broth
2 cups water
2 cups fresh green beans - rinsed, trimmed, and snapped into bite-size pieces
4 zucchini, cut into small cubes
3 carrots, cut into bite size pieces
4 potatoes, cut into bite sized pieces
1 bunch basil, leaves picked from stems
10 cloves garlic, minced
3 tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15.5 ounce) can white beans, drained and rinsed
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti, broken into 2-inch pieces
1/2 cup shredded Gruyere cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring the vegetable broth and water to a boil in a large pot. Stir in the green beans, zucchini, carrots, and potatoes. Return to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the pistou by processing the basil leaves, garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, and salt together in a food processor until finely chopped; set aside.
Stir the kidney beans, white beans, canned diced tomatoes, and spaghetti into the soup and return to a simmer. Cook until the spaghetti is tender, about 10 minutes. Remove the soup from the heat and stir in the pistou. Sprinkle with Gruyere cheese and Parmesan cheese to serve.

Description: 
My mom brought this recipe back from a cooking class in Provence. Pistou is the French word for pesto. This is a wonderful tasting fresh vegetable soup. We've made it 3 times in just one month! It is so easy, healthy, filling, and delicious (better the next day). Can be served as a dinner meal with some crusty bread and wine.
