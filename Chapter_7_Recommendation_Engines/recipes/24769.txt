Ingredients:
1 head broccoli, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, diced

Directions:
In a large bowl combine broccoli, garlic, onion and eggs; mix well.  Stir in Parmesan and cornmeal; mix well.  Form into patties.  If mixture is too dry, add another egg; if too wet, add more cornmeal.  Season with pepper to taste.
Heat 1 inch of oil in a large, deep skillet.  Place patties in hot oil; cook, turning once, until well browned on each side.
