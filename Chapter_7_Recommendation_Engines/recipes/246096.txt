Ingredients:
1/4 cup canola oil
3 cups quick-cooking oats
3 cups rolled spelt flakes
1 cup honey
1/2 cup canola oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup water
1 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped almonds
1/2 cup flax seed meal
1/2 cup hemp seed hearts
1/4 cup hemp seeds
1/4 cup sunflower seeds

Directions:
Heat 1/4 cup canola oil in large skillet over medium-high heat; add oats and spelt flakes. Cook, stirring frequently, until toasted, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer oats mixture to a bowl and remove skillet from heat.
Mix honey, 1/2 cup canola oil, and salt together in the skillet; return to heat. Gently pour water into honey mixture and stir; cook until mixture is bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir oats mixture into honey mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix raisins, almonds, flax meal, hemp hearts, hemp seeds, and sunflower seeds into oats mixture; spread onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Turn off heat and leave granola in the oven 5 minutes more. Remove baking sheet from oven and cool granola completely before transferring to an airtight container.
