Ingredients:
2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into cubes
½ cup all-purpose flour, or more as needed
¼ cup butter
¼ cup olive oil
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1  onion, chopped
8 cups beef broth, divided
6 cups sliced carrots
6 cups diced potatoes
3 cups chopped celery
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried basil
½ teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Combine beef stew meat and flour in a resealable plastic bag; seal bag and shake to coat beef.
Melt butter with olive oil in a large pot over high heat; add beef and season with seasoned salt. Cook and stir beef until seared on all sides 5 to 7 minutes. Stir onion into the beef; cook and stir until the onion is browned, about 5 minutes more.
Pour enough of the beef broth into the pot to cover the bottom; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add remainder of the beef broth; bring to a simmer before adding carrots, potatoes, celery, balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, basil, paprika, and garlic powder.
Bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook stew at a simmer until the meat and vegetables are very tender, 3 to 4 hours.

Description: 
This is the best beef stew I've ever tasted. My husband ate 4 bowls the first time I made it and my 9-month-old ate two bowls mashed up! I like to brown my beef for stew, and I hate to dirty both a pot and the slow cooker, so I prefer to cook the stew exclusively on the stove.
