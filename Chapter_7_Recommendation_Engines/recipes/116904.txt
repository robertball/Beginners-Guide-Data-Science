Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 cup milk
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
SYRUP:
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup water
2 teaspoons butter
1/2 teaspoon rum extract

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Combine the egg, milk and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until combined. Pour batter by 1/3 cupfuls onto a lightly greased hot griddle. Turn when bubbles form on top of the pancake; cook until second side is golden brown.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine syrup ingredients. Cook until sugar is dissolved. Serve with pancakes.
