Ingredients:
Bottom Layer:
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup white sugar
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup shredded coconut
1/3 cup finely chopped walnuts
Middle Layer:
1/4 cup butter, softened
2 cups confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons maraschino cherry juice
1 teaspoon almond extract
1/3 cup chopped maraschino cherries, well drained
Top Layer:
1 tablespoon butter
1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Heat 1/2 cup butter, white sugar, and cocoa powder in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir just until butter melts, about 2 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat; stir in beaten egg. Return pan to stove; cook and stir until cocoa mixture thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat.
Stir graham cracker crumbs, coconut, and walnuts into cocoa mixture. Press mixture firmly into an ungreased 9x9-inch baking pan.
Beat 1/4 cup butter, confectioners' sugar, cherry juice, and almond extract in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth; stir in cherries. Drop cherry mixture by spoonfuls over base layer, then spread evenly. Let cherry mixture layer stand until slightly firm, about 10 minutes. Using your hand, pat cherry mixture layer to smooth.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a small saucepan over low heat; stir in chocolate chips. Cook and stir mixture until melted and smooth, about 3 minutes. Pour chocolate mixture over middle layer. Working quickly, smooth chocolate with the back of a spoon. Chill before cutting into bars, about 30 minutes.
