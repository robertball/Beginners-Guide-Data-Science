Ingredients:
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a large resealable plastic storage bag; mix well. Seal and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Heat a grill pan over medium heat until hot. Place the chicken on the pan, discarding excess marinade, and cook for 6 to 10 minutes per side, or until no pink remains and the juices run clear.
