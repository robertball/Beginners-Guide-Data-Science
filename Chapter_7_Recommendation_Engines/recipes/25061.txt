Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 egg
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 eggs
3 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan.
In a large bowl, mix together the cake mix, melted butter and 1 egg until smooth. Batter will be thick. Spread evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan. Next, sprinkle the chocolate chips over the layer of dough. Finally, beat the cream cheese, 2 eggs and confectioners' sugar together in a medium bowl until smooth. Pour as evenly as you can over the chocolate chips.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is set. Let cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting into bars.
