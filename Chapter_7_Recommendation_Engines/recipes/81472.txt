Description: 
This splendid mixture of liquors that everyone has in the back of their liquor cabinet collecting dust looks like chocolate milk, but is far from it. My friends and I came up with it one night when we did not have the right ingredients for another drink. All of our ladies said that it should be a regular drink at all our parties.
