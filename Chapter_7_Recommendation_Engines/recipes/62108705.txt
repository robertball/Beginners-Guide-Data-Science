Ingredients:
2 rolls of refrigerated, chocolate chip cookie dough (20 ounces each)
2 packages cream cheese (8 ounces each), softened
2/3 cup sugar
3 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons lemon juice
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a medium bowl, mix combine cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, lemon juice, and eggs until creamy and well blended.
Press one roll of the cookie dough onto the bottom of an ungreased 9x13 inch baking pan.
Pour the filling over the dough.
Break the second roll of cookie dough up into small pieces and place on top of the filling like a crumb topping.  It does not have to be completely covered.
Bake for 30-35 minutes, until golden brown.
Let cool completely on counter then refrigerate for at least 1 hour before cutting.
ENJOY!
