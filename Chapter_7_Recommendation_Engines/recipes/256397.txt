Ingredients:
2 tablespoons corn oil
1 (6 ounce) ham steak, cut into small pieces
1 large onion, diced
1/2 green bell pepper, cut into small pieces
1 (15 ounce) can gandules (pigeon peas), drained and rinsed
1/2 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce (such as GoyaÂ®)
5 tablespoons sofrito
3 tablespoons adobo seasoning
2 tablespoons olive brine
5 pitted green olives
1 (1.41 ounce) package sazon seasoning
2 cups water
1 cup white rice

Directions:
Heat corn oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add ham, onion, and green bell pepper; cook and stir until onion and green bell pepper are soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in gandules, tomato sauce, sofrito, adobo seasoning, olive brine, green olives, and sazon seasoning until warmed through.
Pour water and rice into the pot; bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Cook, stirring frequently to prevent rice from sticking, until water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cover; cook until rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove lid and stir rice; cover and cook until rice is very soft, about 30 minutes more.
