Description: 
I hope I had you at Bourbon-soaked peaches.  Sometimes ingredients come together so perfectly all you need to do is assemble and enjoy.
These juicy, ripe peaches soaked in bourbon combined with rich, salty prosciutto, creamy burrata, and peppery arugula hit all the right flavor notes making this the most amazing harmonious dish I’ve had in a long time.  Plus grilling fruit deepens its flavor which enhances everything. I’m not kidding about this one. Time to hit the patio and put this dish on heavy summer rotation.
