1 (12 inch) pre-baked pizza crust

1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste
1 egg yolk
1 cup bean sprouts
1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place crust on baking sheet.
Spread Thai chile sauce over crust; top with chicken, baby corn, bamboo shoots, red bell pepper, and mozzarella cheese. Brush exposed pizza dough with egg yolk.
Bake in preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and crust is shiny golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and top with bean sprouts, cilantro, and green onions.

Description: 
I was inspired to create my own fusion-cuisine pizza after a local pizza place appreciated my concepts and added it to their menu! Tried these ideas on my family/friends and they LOVE it!
