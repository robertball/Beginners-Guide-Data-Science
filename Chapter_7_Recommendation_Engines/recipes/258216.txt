Ingredients:
16 ounces ground meatloaf mix (beef, veal, pork)
1 large egg, beaten
1/2 cup grated BelGioioso Romano cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/2 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 cup fresh breadcrumbs
1/2 cup lukewarm water
4 BelGioioso Mild Provolone cheese slices
1 baguette, cut into 8 slices, split
1/2 cup onion slices, pan-grilled
1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, very thinly sliced

Directions:
Combine ground meats with egg, BelGioioso Romano, parsley, garlic, salt and pepper in mixing bowl. Blend in breadcrumbs. Slowly add water, mixing until moist. Shape meatball mixture into 2-ounce patties. Refrigerate patties until ready to cook.
Grill or pan-grill meatball burgers over medium heat on lightly oiled grill. Cook thoroughly on each side. Add 1 slice of cheese, halved to fit, atop each burger. Cook 1 minute longer to melt cheese.
