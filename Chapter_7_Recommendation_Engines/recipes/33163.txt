Ingredients:
9 slices bacon
1/2 onion, chopped
1 fresh jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
1 fresh tomato, finely chopped
1/2 cup canned tomato sauce

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown.  Remove from pan; drain on paper towels. Pour grease from pan, leaving a thin coating.
Saute the onions, tomato and pepper in the pan until the onion is soft, about 3 minutes. Crumble the cooked bacon into the pan and then stir in the tomato sauce. Cook, stirring constantly, until heated through.
