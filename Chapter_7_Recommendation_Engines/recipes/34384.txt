Ingredients:
2 pounds deer chops (venison)
1 cup ketchup
1/2 cup water
1 medium onion, chopped

1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix

Directions:
Thinly slice the deer chops and brown them in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Transfer the meat to a slow cooker. Mix in the ketchup, water, onion, brown sugar, and dry onion soup mix. Cook on LOW for 6 hours or until tender. If you want to cook it in a roaster, bake at 350 degrees F, for 1 hour.

Description: 
I personally am not a big fan on wild meat BUT my husband is!  With this recipe it doesn't taste 'gamey' at all. It's very tender as well.  I even go back for seconds!
