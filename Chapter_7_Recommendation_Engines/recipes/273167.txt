Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
8 ounces prepared zhoug sauce, divided
1 (12 ounce) jar fire-roasted red and yellow bell peppers, cut into 1-inch pieces

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish with olive oil.
Measure 1/2 cup of prepared zhoug and spread over the bottom of the oiled baking dish. Place chicken thighs, cut side down, on top of the zhoug. Sprinkle fire-roasted bell peppers over chicken thighs. Using a spoon, drop remaining zhoug sauce in between the bell pepper pieces, covering as much of the chicken thighs as possible.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
Zhoug is a spicy, Middle Eastern cilantro sauce that is often used as a condiment or dip.  I decided to use it as a way to perk up plain chicken! If you purchase prepared zhoug, this recipe has only 4 ingredients.  Yes, it's spicy, but one bite just leads to another!
