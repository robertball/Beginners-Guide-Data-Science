Description: 
Redbud Blossom Muffins welcome in spring festively perhaps serve with Redbud Lavender Jelly.
Native Americans ate redbud flowers raw or cooked as well as the young pods and seeds raw or cooked. 
They have a sweet slightly sour taste and are high in Vitamin C .
Redbud blossoms when the petals are still unopened, they taste bitter, and the more open they become, the better tasting they are.
