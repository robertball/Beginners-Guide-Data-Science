Ingredients:
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup vanilla yogurt
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4 eggs
1/2 cup orange juice
1 egg
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 (16 ounce) package small curd cottage cheese
5 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
2 tablespoons unsalted butter

Directions:
Mix 2 tablespoons of sugar, 1 teaspoon of orange zest, salt, and flour in a small bowl. Combine milk and yogurt in a separate bowl. Stir in olive oil and mix until smooth. Beat 4 eggs in a large bowl, then add orange juice. Stir in the yogurt mixture followed by the flour mixture. Beat until smooth. Allow batter to rest at room temperature for 1 hour.
Beat 1 egg with 3 tablespoons of sugar, then add butter and cottage cheese, mixing until smooth. Stir in the bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon of orange zest. Refrigerate until the batter is ready.
Lightly butter a 6 inch skillet, and heat over medium heat.  For each crepe, pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the skillet, and immediately rotate the skillet until the batter evenly coats the bottom in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crepe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen; flip the crepe, and cook until the other side has turned light brown. Stack the crepes in a clean kitchen towel, placing waxed paper between each.
Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of the filling onto the golden side of the crepe. Roll the crepe up and repeat until all the blintzes are made. Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet and fry 4 to 5 blintzes at a time until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side.

Description: 
Delicious, subtle orange flavor highlights this old world favorite. Whether for holidays or if I need a ticket out of the doghouse, my wife loves these and eats 'em about as fast as I can make 'em. Don't be scared, blintzes are actually very easy to make. They fill the house with a unique baking/frying smell which shouts, Comfort food is on the way! I hope you enjoy these as much as we do.
