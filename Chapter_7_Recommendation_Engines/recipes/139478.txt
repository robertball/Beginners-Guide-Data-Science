Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can jumbo pitted black olives, drained
4 ounces soft Gorgonzola cheese
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup milk
1 cup Italian-style dry bread crumbs
oil for deep frying

Directions:
Drain olives well on paper towels. Place Gorgonzola cheese in a pastry bag, or a heavy plastic bag, and squirt into each olive.
Whisk together the eggs and milk; place the bread crumbs in a shallow bowl. Dip olives in the egg mixture, shake off the excess, and roll in bread crumbs to coat; set aside.
Heat at least 4 inches of oil in a large pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Fry olives in hot oil until golden brown and drain on paper towels. Allow to cool slightly before serving.
