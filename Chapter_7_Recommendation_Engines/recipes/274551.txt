Ingredients:
5 medium poblano peppers. stemmed and seeded
1 shallot, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1 small red chile pepper, stemmed and seeded
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon turbinado sugar
1 slice processed cheese food (such as VelveetaÂ® Queso Blanco)

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place peppers onto the prepared baking sheet.
Cook under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Place blackened peppers into a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins.
Heat a saucepan over medium heat. Add shallot and garlic to the hot pan and cook until golden, about 5 minutes. Add cumin and coriander and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in poblano peppers, red chile pepper, chicken broth, water, butter, and sugar. Cook until heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Add cheese and let melt, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer mixture to a blender or use an immersion blender to blend to a sauce consistency.
