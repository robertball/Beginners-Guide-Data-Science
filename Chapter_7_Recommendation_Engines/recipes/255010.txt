Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups water
6 large cold eggs

Directions:
Place water into a 3-quart saucepan with a lid. Place over high heat and bring to a low boil. Carefully place the eggs in the water. Cover pan immediately, reduce heat to medium-high, and cook for 9 1/2 minutes. Remove pan from heat and cool eggs down with cold running water, tipping out the water, and continuing to run cold water over the eggs until they are cool.

Description: 
Here's my foolproof method for making hard-boiled eggs when we want softer, creamier yolks such as in salads. The steaming method is very precise, so you may need to experiment with different times, depending on the size of the eggs and the temperature of your fridge.
