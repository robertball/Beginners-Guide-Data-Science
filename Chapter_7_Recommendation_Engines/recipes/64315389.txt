Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts (fresh or frozen - thawed), ends trimmed and yellow leaves removed
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F .
Place trimmed Brussels sprouts, olive oil, kosher salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal tightly, and shake to coat. Pour onto a baking sheet, and place on center oven rack.
Roast in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, shaking pan every 5 to 7 minutes for even browning. Reduce heat when necessary to prevent burning. Brussels sprouts should be darkest brown, almost black, when done. Use additional kosher salt, if necessary. Serve immediately.
