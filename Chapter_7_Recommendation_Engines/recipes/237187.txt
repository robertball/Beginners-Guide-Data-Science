Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground beef
1 small onion, diced
1 quart beef broth
1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce
1/2 cup diced pepperoni
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 1/2 tablespoons granulated garlic
1 1/2 tablespoons dried minced onion
1 1/2 tablespoons dried oregano
4 ounces dried cheese ravioli
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Stir beef-onion mixture, beef broth, marinara sauce, pepperoni, Parmesan cheese, garlic, minced onion, and oregano together in a large pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until flavors blend, about 20 minutes.
While soup is simmering, bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 14 minutes; drain.
Stir ravioli into soup and cook until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Ladle soup into bowls and top with mozzarella cheese.

Description: 
This recipe is inspired by my son. When he had his wisdom teeth taken out he desperately wanted pizza and I refused to put some in the blender. I searched and combined a few other recipes to come up with this. I think it would be good with green pepper and mushrooms but my family is picky!
