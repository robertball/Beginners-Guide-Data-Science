Ingredients:
2 packages Beefy Onion Dry Soup Mix
1 package Garlic/Herb Dry Soup Mix
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
1/2 teaspoon jalepeno salt
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons worchestershire sauce
1/8 cup olive oil
6 Steaks of your choice

Directions:
Combine the first seven dry ingredients in a mixing bowl.  Whisk in balsamic vinegar, lime juice, worchestershire sauce and olive oil (marinade will be thick). Put steaks in a zip-lock bag and add the marinade, making sure all pieces of meat have marinade on them.  Refrigerate and marinade overnight, turning bag over periodically.  Grill steaks to desired doneness and discard left over marinade. (*Note: If you can not find jalepeno salt in your market, substitute regular salt and 1/4 a jalepeno finely diced.)

Description: 
The Triple S is for Savory, Sweet and Spicy.  My husband and I love to grill steaks, but aren't much on steak sauces.  I developed this marinade to infuse the steaks with tons of savory spicy flavor.  You will not need to add steak sauce to your steak any longer but, be warned this marinade does have a kick.
