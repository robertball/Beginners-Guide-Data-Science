Peel the shell off the eggs and smash them up with a fork in a bowl. Add everything else except the lettuce, bread and butter. Mix the egg mixture well. Brush the bread with butter if desired and place filling between the two layers of bread. Insert lettuce or cheese in between the top layer of bread and the filling if desired. Cut diagonally and serve. Yum!
