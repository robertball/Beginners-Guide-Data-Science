Ingredients:
2 3/4 c. whole wheat flour
1/2 c. powdered milk
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1 egg
6 tbsp vegetable oil
8-10 tbsp water
2 jars of strained baby food (beef, chicken or lamb)

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
In a mixing bowl, mix all of the ingredients.
Knead the dough for about 3 minutes.
Roll it out until it’s about an inch thick.
Here’s the part where you break out the cute bone shaped cookie cutters! Or you can use a pizza cutter to cut the dough into the desired size.
Bake the biscuits for 20-25 min. on an ungreased cookie sheet.
