Description: 
I'm originally from Minnesota, where wild rice grows in abundance ans is very popular in recipes. This soup has been part of our Christmas Eve menu for years. To save time, I cook the chicken and wild rice and cut up the vegetables the day before.                --Virginia Montmarquet, Riverside, California
