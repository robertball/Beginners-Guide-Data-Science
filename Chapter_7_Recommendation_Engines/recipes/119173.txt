Ingredients:
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1/2 cup sour cream
2 eggs
3 tablespoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 cups all-purpose flour
FILLING:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup sugar
2 egg yolks
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
TOPPINGS:
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
1 (12 ounce) jar cherry jam

Directions:
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In a mixing bowl, combine the butter, sour cream, eggs, sugar and salt. Add yeast mixture and flour; beat until smooth (do not knead). Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
For filling, in a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, egg yolk and vanilla until blended. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divided in half. Roll out each portion into a 16-in. x 10-in. rectangle on a greased baking sheet. Spread filling down center of each rectangle. On each long side, cut 1-1/2-in.-wide strips about 3 in. into center. Starting at one end, fold alternating strips at an angle across filling. Pinch ends to seal. Curve one end, forming a candy cane. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Carefully remove from pans to wire racks to cool. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Stir jam, then spoon over top of leaves, creating candy cane stripes. Refrigerate leftovers.
