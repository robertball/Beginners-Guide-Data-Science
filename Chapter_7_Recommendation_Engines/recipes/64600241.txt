Ingredients:
2 (15.5 oz.) cans black beans, drained and rinsed
1 small onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 cups veggie broth
2/3 cup water
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp Italian seasoning
1/2 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp garlic powder
2/3 cup  corn
cayenne pepper to taste
2 cups uncooked  brown rice
Juice of 2-3 limes
Fresh organic cilantro
lime wedges

Directions:
Cook the rice according to the package or your rice cooker. Once the rice has fully cooked, squeeze in 2-3 limes and mix.
In a large saucepan, simmer the broth, water, diced onion, minced garlic and seasonings for about 8 minutes. Now add the beans and corn. Continue simmering for another 15 min. If needed, adjust seasonings to taste.
Add 1 cup of cooked rice to your bowl. With a slotted spoon, scoop about a cup of the beans to your bowl of rice. Mix in.  Serve with extra lime wedges, plenty of cilantro and a side of organic tortilla chips.

Quick and easy, 30 minute Black Beans and Lime Rice! With a few simple ingredients you’ve got a great week night dinner, and leftovers make for an ideal lunch! Using canned beans sometimes leads to one of my biggest pet peeves, “hollow bean pits”. This happens when the black beans are over cooked.  The skin breaks and the bean inside becomes a mush leaving hollow bean skins.  To avoid this, allow the onion to cook a bit before adding the canned beans.
