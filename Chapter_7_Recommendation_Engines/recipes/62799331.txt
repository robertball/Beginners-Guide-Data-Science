Ingredients:
1 pound flank steak (hanger steak or skirt steak), thinly sliced (across the grain-very important!)
1/3 cup soy sauce
2 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 cup chopped green onion
1 tablespoons crushed garlic
1 tablespoons sesame seeds
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Place the beef in a shallow dish.  Combine soy sauce, sugar, green onion, garlic, sesame seeds, sesame oil, and ground black pepper in a small bowl.  Pour over sliced beef.  Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.  Using skewers, fold beef slices back and forth onto (8-10) skewers. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Grill beef on HOT grill until slightly charred and cooked through, 5-7 minutes per side.
