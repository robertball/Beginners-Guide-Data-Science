Ingredients:
1 tablespoon peanut oil
3 green onions, minced
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup diced red bell pepper
4 eggs
8 egg whites
2 tablespoons light soy sauce
1 cup fresh bean sprouts
1 cup trimmed and halved snow peas
1 tablespoon sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large nonstick, oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil. Add the scallions, ginger, and garlic and saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the red pepper and saute for 3 minutes.
In a medium-size mixing bowl, mix together the eggs and soy sauce. Add to the skillet. Cook over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes until eggs are set on bottom.
Place the bean sprouts and snow peas over the eggs. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Place in the oven at 350 degrees  F (175 degrees C) and bake just until top is set, about 8 to 10 minutes. Watch carefully that eggs are just cooked and do not become tough. Set oven to broil. Broil the frittata for 30 seconds just to give it a nice browned color. Serve in wedges.
