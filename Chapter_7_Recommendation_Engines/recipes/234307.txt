Description: 
I found directions online for cooking and freezing pumpkin after Halloween one year. I collected several pumpkins that did not get carved and cooked and froze a ton, hence the need for pumpkin recipes. I put this recipe together myself while in a creative mood one night. I am surprised I do not see more recipes using French vanilla coffee flavoring; it adds a nice touch.
