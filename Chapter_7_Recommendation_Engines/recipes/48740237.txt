Ingredients:
1 +  pounds ultra lean ground beef
1/4 cup lemon juice
(MAY add some Worcestershire sauce next time)
1/4 cup water (or less)
1 egg, beaten
2 slices day-old bread, torn into small pieces (or use crumbled saltines)
1/4 cup chopped onion  (1/2 better?)
2 teaspoons seasoning salt
1/2 cup ketchup (may add part barbecue sauce)
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon mustard powder (or substitute)
1/4 dash ground allspice
1 TBS minced garlic
5 slices  lemon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish or a dish of similar size.  (May use muffin pans - ADJUST cooking time!)
Mix the ground beef, lemon juice, water, egg, bread, onion and seasoning salt until well blended. Shape into 5 individual loaves -  Place in baking dish.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven while you prepare the topping. In a small bowl, stir together the ketchup, brown sugar, mustard powder, allspice and cloves. Spoon the sauce over the loaves, then top each with a slice of lemon. Return to the oven, and bake for an additional 30 minutes, or until done.
