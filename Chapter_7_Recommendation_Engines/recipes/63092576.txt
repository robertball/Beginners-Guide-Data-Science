This recipe makes a large dutch oven or crock pot full of meatballs. It can be cut in half or thirds for smaller families.

Description: 
I have experimented over the past 40 yrs until I came up with a recipe that my family, friends and I all love. Everyone asks for this recipe. I use this same sauce when I make sweet & sour chicken, pork, etc. Another version I make is porcupine meatballs by adding cooked rice to the meatball mixture. I serve this over steamed white or brown rice. Enjoy!
