Description: 
This was a favorite among our guests at the bed and breakfast where I cooked for many years. If you wish, add saut√©ed onions or diced tomatoes to the mix. I sometimes serve this dish with pinto or black beans and a warmed flour tortilla. This dish also lends itself well to be served with a side of chorizo sausage or any other breakfast meat of your liking.
