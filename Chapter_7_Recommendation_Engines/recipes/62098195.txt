Ingredients:
3 cups whole milk
3/4 cup Grape-Nuts cereal
3 eggs
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/8 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/8 tsp nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Butter or grease a 1 1/2 to 2 quart baking dish.
In saucepan over medium-high heat, simmer milk until hot, but do not boil. (about 5 minutes)
Stir in cereal and remove fom heat.
Let sit for about 5 minutes, allowing cereal to soften up a bit.
In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, maple syrup, salt and vanilla.
Whisk about half of the warm milk mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, into the egg mixture.
Whisk in remaining milk.
Pour into prepared baking dish.
Sprinkle with nutmeg.
Bake for about 50 minutes in a waterbath (place baking dish in a larger pan with about 1 inch of hot water in it - it helps cook the custard more evenly)
Check to see if done by inserting a knife into it - knife should come out clean and you should be able to see if custard is set.
Remove from oven.
Cool for at least 30 minutes before serving, or chill and serve cold.

Description: 
This is an old-fashioned custard dessert, that was very popular in the New England area.  This recipe is a combination of my friend's grandmother's version and that of a family friend, Hilda, who was like a grandmother to me.  Sadly, both ladies are gone, but this dish brings back many warm and wonderful memories!
