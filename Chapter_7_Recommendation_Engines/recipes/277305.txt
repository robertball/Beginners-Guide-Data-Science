Ingredients:
3 mild Italian sausage links, casings removed
2 hot Italian sausage links, casings removed
3 (14 ounce) cans low-sodium chicken broth
4 small sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
3 tablespoons Carribbean jerk marinade, or to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground thyme
1 pinch ground cinnamon
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained

Directions:
Slice sausage links into 1/2-inch chunks. Cook sausages in a skillet over high heat until browned but not cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove and pat dry with paper towels to remove excess fat. Transfer to a slow cooker and add chicken broth, sweet potatoes, jerk marinade, garlic, thyme, and cinnamon.
Cook on High for 3 hours. Add black beans, reduce heat to Low, and cook for an additional 2 hours.

Description: 
This spicy sweet potato soup is a result of one of my slow cooker experiments, and my husband loves it. Great on a cool winter day with some homemade bread on the side.
