Ingredients:
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, mustard and sugar until well blended. I like to stir 50 times clockwise, and 50 times counter clockwise to get the sauce nice and thick.

Description: 
This sauce is great on just about anything. It can be used as a dressing, dipping sauce, and it can also be used for cheeseburgers.
