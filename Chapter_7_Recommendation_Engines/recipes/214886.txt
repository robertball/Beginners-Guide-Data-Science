Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup water
1 cup molasses
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups raisins
1 3/4 cups dates, pitted and chopped
2 cups pecans, chopped
1 1/2 cups chopped candied fruit
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Combine the butter, brown sugar, water, molasses, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and black pepper in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then remove from the heat, and allow to cool. Once warm to the touch, stir in the vanilla extract, and pour into a mixing bowl. Cover, and let stand at room temperature at least 8 hours.
Stir in the raisins, dates, pecans, and candied fruit. Whisk together the salt, baking soda, and flour; stir into the fruit mixture until no dry lumps remain. Refrigerate 3 to 4 hours until firm.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Form the mixture into golf ball-sized balls. Place onto ungreased baking sheets 1 1/2-inches apart, and flatten with your palm to 1/4-inch thick. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
If you live in Canada you may be familiar with President's Choice Lassy Mog cookies. It is claimed that these cookies originated in Newfoundland, Canada.  I hope you enjoy them as much as my friends and family do.
