Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
3/4 cup water
1 package taco seasoning mix
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
8 ounces sour cream, divided
2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix water and taco seasoning mix into ground beef; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until water is evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix ground beef mixture, 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, and 1/2 of the sour cream together in a bowl.
Roll crescent roll dough out onto a baking stone in the shape of a sunflower, with the triangle points pointing outward. Spread ground beef mixture onto dough in a circular shape. Wrap pointed end of dough around the beef mixture, sealing to the other end of dough making a ring-shape.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Serve alongside the remaining Cheddar cheese and sour cream.
