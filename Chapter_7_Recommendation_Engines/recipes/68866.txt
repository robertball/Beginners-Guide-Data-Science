Ingredients:
1 pound dry pinto beans
1/2 pound bacon
4 serrano peppers

Directions:
Place the beans in a large pot with enough water to cover by 3 to 4 inches, and bring to a boil. Remove from heat, and let sit 1 hour. Drain water. Pour in enough fresh water to cover beans by 3 to 4 inches, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 1 hour.
Place bacon in a skillet, and cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Crumble bacon, and transfer, along with grease, to the pot with the beans. Continue to cook beans on low heat for 30 minutes.
Place the whole chile peppers into the pot, and continue cooking beans 1 hour, or until tender.
