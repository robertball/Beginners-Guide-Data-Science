2 slices bread, torn into small pieces
1/4 cup yogurt
1/4 cup raisins

1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix lamb, bread, yogurt, raisins, cilantro, garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Shape into 1-inch balls and place on a greased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are browned on the outsides and only slightly pink in the centers, about 20 minutes.

I made these as part of a New Year's dinner. Had the lamb and peeked around the kitchen for interesting and delicious things to throw in. I love successful experiments!
