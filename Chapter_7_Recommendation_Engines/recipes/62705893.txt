Ingredients:
Note to Evan from Mommy:  Put all of your ingredients, blender and measuring cups and measuring spoons out on the counter before you begin  :)
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup mashed ripe bananas
1 (16 ounce) container cream cheese frosting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 345 degrees F on Convection/Bake setting.
Grease with butter a 13"x9" glass pan (sprinkle with flour on the bottom and sides too).
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth.
Beat in the eggs, one at a time.
Stir in the sour cream and vanilla
Add the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the batter.
Finally, mix in the mashed banana.
Spread evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven (set timer on oven for 25 minutes).  When the buzzer rings, insert a toothpick inserted into the center to make sure it comes out clean.
Allow bars to cool COMPLETELY before frosting with the cream cheese frosting - otherwise the frosting will melt on the cake and that tastes yucky.
Happy Cooking, Evan!  Love, Mommy
