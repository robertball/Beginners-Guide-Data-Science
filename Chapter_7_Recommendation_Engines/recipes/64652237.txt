Â½ cup flour
1 teaspoon salt

1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

3. Wash, dry, and dip the wings into the flour mixture until coated.

5. Place the wings in a single layer on the cookie sheet, and place in the oven.
6. Cook for 35-40 minutes, depending on the size of the wings, turning once.
