Heat oven to 350F.  Grease cookie sheets.
Mix the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and soda.  Set aside.
Cream the coconut oil with the sugars.  Blend in the eggs and vanilla.
By hand mix the flour mixture into the creamed mixture.  Stir in the oats, corn flakes, chocolate chips, coconut, and raisins by hand.
Drop by rounded Tablespoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheets.  Bake in preheated oven 10-12 minutes, or until no longer wet-looking in the center.  Allow to cool on pan for a few minutes after removing from oven to set, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
I tweaked this recipe so much that it's now my own.  Also known as (at least by me) Everything but the kitchen sink cookies, these cookies have a fun variety of ingredients in them for a ton of texture and flavor.
