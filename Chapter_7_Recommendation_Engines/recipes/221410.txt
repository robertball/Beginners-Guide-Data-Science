Ingredients:
5 potatoes, chopped
1 head cabbage, chopped
1 (27 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained
4 pork chops
1/2 cup barley
water to cover
salt to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl; mash with a potato masher.
Place cabbage, sauerkraut, pork, and barley in the same pot; cover with water. Season with salt and stir well. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cover; simmer, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is wilted and pork is no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the pork should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Divide mashed potatoes among 8 serving bowls; ladle the stew on top.

Description: 
A cabbage, barley, and sauerkraut soup/stew that is easy to prepare, low in fat, and intensely flavorful. My mother makes this without measurements (a handful of barley, some pork) so I've learned to approximate! Serve with crusty Italian or rye bread.
