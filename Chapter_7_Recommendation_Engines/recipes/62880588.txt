Ingredients:
1 package (12 ounces) Hawaiian sweet rolls
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
8 teaspoons minced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, divided
1-1/2 pounds ground beef
10 slices pepper Jack cheese
1/2 cup mayonnaise

Directions:
Place 2 rolls in a food processor; process until crumbly. Transfer to a large bowl; add the salt, pepper and 6 teaspoons chipotle peppers. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into 10 patties.
Grill burgers, covered, over medium heat for 3-4 minutes on each side or until a meat thermometer reads 160Â° and juices run clear. Top with cheese. Grill 1 minute longer or until cheese is melted.
Split remaining rolls and grill, cut side down, over medium heat for 30-60 seconds or until toasted. Combine mayonnaise and remaining chipotle peppers; spread over roll bottoms. Top each with a burger. Replace roll tops.
