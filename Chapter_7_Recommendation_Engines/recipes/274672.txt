Ingredients:
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup whole milk
1/4 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
4 1/2 cups defrosted frozen corn, drained on paper towels
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
10 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
kosher salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons chives for garnish

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish.
Whisk together cream cheese, milk, cream, flour, paprika, and garlic powder in a large bowl until combined. Fold in corn, 2 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese, and crumbled bacon. Season with salt and pepper. Pour into the prepared casserole dish and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and cool for 5 minutes. Sprinkle with chives before serving.
