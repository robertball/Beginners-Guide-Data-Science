Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons steak seasoning
1 tablespoon ancho chile powder
4 (1/2 pound) venison steaks

Directions:
Whip together the butter, lime juice, and cilantro in a small bowl until well combined. Transfer the butter mixture onto a large piece of plastic wrap, gently wrap and form the butter into a log. Freeze until ready to use.
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat.
Mix together the steak seasoning and ancho chile powder in a small bowl. Rub the seasoning blend onto both sides of the venison steaks.
Grill the steaks to preferred doneness, 5 to 8 minutes per side for medium. Top each steak with a slice of the lemon-cilantro butter to serve.

Description: 
This was originally for T-bone steaks but it works just as nicely with deer.  The rub helps minimize the 'gamey' taste and the butter just makes them delicious.
