Ingredients:
2 cans of regular chicken broth
2 cans of cream of chicken
1 can of water
2 chicken bouillon cubes
1 can of shredded chicken meat (drain the water)
1 teaspoon of black pepper
2 tubes of buttermilk biscuits

Directions:
In a large pot, combine the chicken broth, cream of chicken, water, bouillon cubes, shredded chicken meat and black pepper. Boil until the cream of chicken is dissolved. Turn the heat down to medium.
Take a buttermilk biscuit dough round and divide it into 3 balls. Repeat this with the rest of the dough rounds. Drop them into the broth, cook until the insides of the dumplings are fluffy or about 7 mins. Don't overcook or the dumplings will be tough.
