Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups vegetable broth
1 cup long grain rice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 (15 ounce) cans black-eyed peas, rinsed and drained
1/2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning

Directions:
Bring broth and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot oil until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir rice, black-eyed peas, and Cajun seasoning into onion, cover the pot with a lid, and cook until flavors blend, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Both of my daughters are vegetarians. I developed this simple recipe for them to let them enjoy Hoppin' John. It can be used as a base for additional ingredients according to personal preference. This recipe was submitted to the Harvard College Dining Services and was selected as a vegetarian option for the student dining halls.
