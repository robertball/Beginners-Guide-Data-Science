Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 (1 ounce) packet ranch dressing mix, divided
1 whole bone-in turkey breast, rinsed and patted dry
6 slices thick-cut bacon
1 cup light-colored beer

Directions:
Spray the inside of a large slow cooker with cooking spray.
Stir butter and 1/2 the ranch dressing mix together in a bowl until completely combined.
Carefully loosen each side of the skin of the turkey breast and spread the butter-ranch mixture under the skin. Transfer turkey, skin-side up, to the slow cooker.
Sprinkle remaining 1/2 ranch dressing mix over turkey breast. Lay bacon strips evenly across turkey. Pour beer around turkey breast.
Cook in the slow cooker set to High for 1 hour. Reduce heat to Low and cook until turkey is tender, 6 to 8 hours.
