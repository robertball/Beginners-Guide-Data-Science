Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup basmati rice
1 pound ground beef
1 cup chopped onion
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 teaspoon curry powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup white sugar
1 cup chopped carrots
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 cup chopped cauliflower
1 (16 ounce) can English peas, drained and rinsed
2 tablespoons water, or as needed

Directions:
Bring 2 cups water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
While rice is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and onion in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, curry powder, salt, and pepper. Simmer until liquid is almost absorbed, 5 to 7 minutes.
Whisk vinegar and sugar together in a medium bowl. Add carrots, bell pepper, and cauliflower and toss until vegetables are coated with vinegar mixture.
Puree peas with 2 tablespoons water in the bowl of a food processor until thick and smooth.
Layer plates with rice, peas, beef, and vegetables.
