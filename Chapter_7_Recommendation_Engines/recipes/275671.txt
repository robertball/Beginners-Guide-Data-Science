Ingredients:
CRUST:
1 1/2 cups gingersnap cookie crumbs
1/4 cup Sugar In The Raw®
1/4 cup Stevia In The Raw®
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
4 tablespoons butter, melted
CRANBERRY CURD:
1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries
1/2 cup Sugar In The Raw®
1/2 cup Stevia In The Raw®
1 orange, zested
1/2 cup fresh orange juice
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
3 large eggs, beaten
GARNISH
3/4 cup Sugar In The Raw®, divided
1/2 cup fresh cranberries
Thin strips orange zest

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch two-piece tart pan with cooking spray.
In a medium bowl, stir together cookie crumbs, sugar, stevia, salt, and butter. Press mixture evenly in bottom and up sides of tart pan. Bake until set, about 15 minutes.
In a medium saucepan, combine cranberries, sugar, stevia, and orange zest and juice. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook until cranberries burst, about 8 minutes.
Strain cranberry mixture through a sieve over a medium saucepan, pressing on berries to extract all the juice and pulp. Discard anything left in the sieve. Stir butter and eggs into cranberry puree. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium-low heat until mixture is steaming and thickened (about 170 degrees F), then scrape into crust.
Bake tart for 10 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.
In a small saucepan, combine 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a simmer, then take off heat, add cranberries, and let steep 10 minutes. Strain cranberries and transfer them to a rack to dry for 10 minutes.
In a food processor, pulse remaining 1/4 cup sugar until finely ground. Roll strained cranberries in sugar to coat and place back on rack to dry for 10 more minutes.
Before serving, garnish tart with cranberries and orange zest.
