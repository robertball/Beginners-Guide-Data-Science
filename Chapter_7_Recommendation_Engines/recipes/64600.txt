Ingredients:
16 wonton wrappers
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons HERB-OX® Chicken Flavored Bouillon Granules
1 (6 ounce) bag baby fresh spinach, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can quartered artichokes, drained and chopped
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup sour cream
cooking spray

Directions:
Coat a mini-muffin tin with cooking spray and press the wontons into each tin to form a cup. Lightly coat with cooking spray and bake for 7 minutes in a 350 degree oven or until lightly brown. Remove from the oven and cool. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the onion, garlic and chicken granules.  Cook until onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the spinach, artichokes, and cheese and continue to cook until spinach is wilted. Cool slightly and add the sour cream. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of the mixture into the wonton cups.
