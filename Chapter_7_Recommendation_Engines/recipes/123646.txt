Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 medium green pepper, diced
1 medium onion, diced
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
1/4 teaspoon dill weed
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 (1 pound) loaves sliced Italian bread
grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a large skillet, brown beef, green pepper, onion and garlic; drain. Stir in tomato sauce, water and seasonings. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, cut 2-1/2-in circles from bread slices using a biscuit cutter. Press the circles into greased miniature muffin cups. Bake at 400 degrees F for 5-6 minutes or until lightly toasted. Remove from tins and cool on wire racks. Fill each bread cup with about 1 tablespoon chili mixture; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Broil for 2-3 minutes or until cheese is golden brown.

Description: 
Nothing tickles appetites quicker than these spicy tidbits. It's like eating chili in a muffin. I like assembling and freezing them ahead of time to beat the Christmas rush in my kitchen.
