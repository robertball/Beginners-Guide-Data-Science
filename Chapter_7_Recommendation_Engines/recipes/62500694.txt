Description: 
This is the perfect dish to bring to potlucks and you better bring a copy of the recipe with you because I guarentee you will be asked for it (I brought this to a funeral once and it was gone in about 5 mins and everyone kept asking the hosts who brought it and where they could get the recipe).  The dressing sounds high in fat but remember, its just a marinade and you use a slotted spoon to serve it. I Guarentee you will love it and so will your family & guests!
