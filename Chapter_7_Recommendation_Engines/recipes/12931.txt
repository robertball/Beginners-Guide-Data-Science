Description: 
This is a favorite among us Texans, and there are so many diverse ways to prepare it. I have experimented with more entailed recipes, and came up with this one which is just as delicious as the labor intensive ones. Pass around chopped cilantro, cubed avocados, and crumbled Jack cheese for garnish.
