Ingredients:
1 lb. thinly sliced sole fish fillet (or any white fish)
1/4 - 1/2 lb. small shrimp boiled
1 cup of fresh squeezed lime juice
1 small purple onion, julienned
1/2 small green bell pepper, julienned super thin
Cilantro to taste coarsely chopped
Pineapple chopped in tiny squares

Directions:
Wash fish and pat dry.  Then cut into short, medium-thick strips (long, bite size) and place in flat dish.  Completely cover with lime juice and store in fridge overnight until fish become white. Drain lime juice and add all other ingredients, sprinkle with a little salt and toss thoroughly. Refrigerate for an hour before serving.  Can be served on a bed of wild field greens or you can serve it like the restaurant does in a half-cored pineapple.
