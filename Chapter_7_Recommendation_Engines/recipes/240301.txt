Ingredients:
3/4 cup shortening
3/4 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup white sugar, or to taste
2 eggs
4 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped pecans (optional)
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat shortening, butter, and white sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add eggs and vanilla extract and beat until smooth. Sift flour and salt into creamed butter mixture and stir just until dough is combined; fold in pecans. Shape dough into 1-inch balls and arrange on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Cool cookies slightly and roll in confectioners' sugar. Cool cookies completely and roll again in confectioners' sugar.
