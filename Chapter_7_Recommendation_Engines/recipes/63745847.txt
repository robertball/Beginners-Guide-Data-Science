Ingredients:
8-chicken thighs (skin or no skin your preference)
8-hard boiled eggs
8-boiled potatoes
8-10 large dried chilie guajillo's ( cut ends off and take seeds out)
1/2 Tsp ground oregano
1-cap full vinegar
1-large sliced onion
1-Adobo seasoning to taste
3-cups rice of your preference (usually best with white rice or jasmine)
3-garlic cloves

Directions:
Set aside the eggs and potatoes, those will be used after your done cooking. First off fry the chicken thighs (of course you can use any parts of the chicken I just find it best with thighs) till they are crispy outside but not fully cooked and set aside.
Boil the de-seeded guajillo chilies in a pot of water with about 4 cups of water till they are soggy and the water is dark red, let cool off then put in blender with capful of vinegar, garlic, adobo and oregano and blend it up. Strain over the chicken, should be enough sauce to boil the chicken in, add in the onions and taste the sauce to see if you need more adobo, if you do not have adobo salt with work just fine. Boil the chicken till the crispy outside gets soggy and is cook all the way thru. serve over steamed rice with egg and potato (and in my house with some Inca Cola on the side ;)
