Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
8 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
2 tablespoons sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning
1 egg
1 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first eight ingredients. In a another bowl, beat the egg, milk and oil. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill greased muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
The first time I made these muffins, my husband thought he'd gone to heaven! I found the recipe in an old cookbook and added more spices for a little extra zip.
