Ingredients:
24 uncooked large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 cup finely diced red onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons freshly grated gingerroot
1 lime, juiced
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 (14.5 ounce) can Hunt'sÂ® Diced Tomatoes, drained
1 cup chicken broth
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 tablespoon fish sauce
8 leaves Thai basil, chopped

Directions:
Sprinkle shrimp with salt and cayenne pepper.
Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the red onion and cook for 1 minute. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds. Add the lime juice and shrimp and cook until shrimp turn pink, about 1 minute per side. Transfer shrimp to a small bowl.
Pour diced tomatoes, mushrooms, chicken broth, and crushed red pepper into the pan. Cook until mushrooms begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the coconut milk, curry powder, fish sauce, and Thai basil. Cook until mixture has heated through. Transfer shrimp back to the pan, and cook for 1 minute more.

Description: 
Shrimp, mushrooms and tomatoes simmered in a coconut-curry broth, with a bit of a 'kick.' I like to serve this with Jasmine rice, but any rice will do!
