Ingredients:
1 cup brown rice
2 tablespoons olive oil
½  onion, chopped
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1  Hatch chile pepper, seeded and chopped
1  Roma tomato, chopped
1 ½ tablespoons tomato paste
1 cup chicken broth
½ cup white wine
2  bay leaves
1 tablespoon butter
2  salmon fillets
salt and ground black pepper to taste
¼ cup sour cream
1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste
1 bunch green onions, chopped

Directions:
Bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes.
Heat oil in a deep skillet over high heat. Add onion, celery, and garlic; cook and stir until edges of the onion are browned, about 5 minutes. Mix in chile pepper, tomato, and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until softened, about 1 minute.
Stir chicken broth, white wine, and bay leaves into the skillet; simmer until stew is evenly warmed, about 5 minutes.
Melt butter in a pot over medium heat. Add salmon; season with salt and pepper. Cook, flipping once, until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Separate into small pieces.
Stir sour cream and lemon juice into the stew; pour stew over salmon. Remove bay leaves. Add green onions.
Divide brown rice evenly between 4 bowls; ladle stew over rice.
