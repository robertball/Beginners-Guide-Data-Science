Ingredients:
Meat Braise
4 lbs Chuck Roast
1 Green Bell Pepper, coarse chop
1 Onion, coarse chop
6 Cloves Garlic, smashed
12 oz Dry Red Wine
Chicken Stock (for braise)
Sauce
2 White Onions, chopped 1"
6 Cloves Garlic, macerate with 1 teaspoon salt
1 Cup Celery greens/tops, chopped
1 Green Bell Peppers, chopped 1"
1 Yellow Bell Peppers, chopped 1"
1 Red Bell Peppers, chopped 1"
EVOO (for sauté)
4 oz Tomato Paste

8 oz Green Olives, rough chop
2 oz Capers
1/4 Cup Mole
1/4 Cup Sofrito
2 Tbsp Whole Cumin, toasted and ground
1 bay leaf
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Split and seed Roma Tomatoes.  Place on baking sheet and cook down in 300 degree over until mostly dry.  Avoid browning.  Remove and set aside.
Lightly salt and pepper the chuck roast and dust with flour.  In dutch oven over high heat, brown the meat in oil. Add Red Wine and enough stock to come 2/3 up the roast.  Add braise ingredients and simmer, covered, ~2 hours until meat is fork tender.(Add additional stock if needed)
Cool, and shred the meat, discarding vegetables.  Retain the braising liquid and reduce to ~1 Cup.  Set aside meat and reduced brasing liquid.
Sauté onions, garlic, bell pepper, and celery in EVOO in the same dutch oven until just beginning to sweat. Add remaining sauce ingredients, Roma tomatoes and reserved braise liquid. Salt and pepper to taste.
Cook to heat through and serve with rice.
