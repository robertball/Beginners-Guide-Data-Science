Ingredients:
1 cup blanched slivered almonds
1 cup butter
1 1/4 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
2 tablespoons water
2 cups milk chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet. Toast in the preheated oven until lightly browned, approximately 5 minutes.
Line a jelly roll pan with foil.
In a heavy saucepan, combine butter, sugar, corn syrup, and water. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils. Boil, without stirring, to hard crack stage, 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Remove from heat.
Working quickly, stir in almonds, and pour mixture into foil lined jelly roll pan; tip pan from side to side to spread candy evenly in pan. Sprinkle chocolate chips over candy brittle. Let stand about 5 minutes, or until shiny and soft. Spread chocolate evenly over candy. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for 1 hour. Break into bite-size pieces.

Description: 
I am begged for this recipe whenever I serve it.  My advice: Invest in a good candy thermometer and always, always, always use good ingredients. Do not use margarine as a substitute for the butter; the water content is too high.
