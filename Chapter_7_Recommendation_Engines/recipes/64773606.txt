Preheat oven to 400.
Line a baking sheet with parchment. In a microwave safe bowl place cream cheese and shredded cheese.  Microwave on high in 30 seconds increments until cheeses are melted.
Mix well.
Add eggs, onion powder and almond flour - mix well
Shape dough into desired shape.  (These buns will not rise, so make sure to shape into desired height.)
You may have to add a bit of oil to your hands to make sure the buns are smooth.
Place a dime sized amount of butter on top of each bun.

Description: 
I’ve scoured the web and made a lot of keto buns. These are a meld of my favorites.  You can shape them into “bagels” and toast them,  add seasme seeds for hamburger buns and I’ve even shaped them into hot dog rolls. Now the texture is heavy- not like bread but they hold up great as a sandwich bun and taste great toasted with your favorite toppings. 
Mozzarella or Cheddar cheeses work- I think cheddar adds a better flavor. 
You need the parchment or the buns will burn too much.  
You will get 6 -3 inch hamburger buns.
