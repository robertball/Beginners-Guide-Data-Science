Ingredients:
1 (10 pound) bone-in shank ham
4 cups water, or as needed
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 Tbsp liquid smoke
2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1/4 tsp ground cloves
1 Tbsp cornstarch
1 Tbsp dry mustard powder
2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 1/2 cups  whiskey
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple in juice
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Score with sharp knife making a diamond pattern in the sides of the ham. Place ham in a roasting pan, flat side down.. Pour in water to a 2 inch depth. Cover with a tight fitting lid or wrap with foil.
Bake for 6 to 8 hours in the preheated oven (all day or all night). Remove from the oven, pour off drippings and reserve. Bone ham, removing any excess fat as well, and return to the roasting pan.
Skim fat from the top of the drippings, and discard. In a small bowl, mix one cup of the drippings with remaining ingredients. Pour this over the ham, cover and return to the oven. Remaining drippings may be discarded or reserved for other uses.
Bake for another 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
