Ingredients:
3/4 cup Butter
1/2 cup White Sugar
1/4 teaspoon Salt
1 Egg
1 tsp. Vanilla
1 3/4 cups Flour
1 cup Powdered Sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Line a baking tray with foil.
In the large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar using and electric mixer. Add the salt, egg, and vanilla, mixing constantly.
Slowly add the flour and continue mixing until the ingredients are well combined.
When the dough is completely mixed, use your hands to shape it into round, 1-inch balls.  Place each ball 2 inches apart on the baking tray.
Bake the cookies for about 15 minutes, or until the bottoms are golden.  Let cool for 5 minutes on wire rack.
While the cookies are baking, Sift the powdered sugar into a large plastic bag.
After the cookies have cooled, place them in the bag full of powdered sugar and gently shake the bag until the cookies are coated with sugar.  They will look just like little snowballs!  If you want, you can even coat the cookies with sugar twice to make them look really snowy.
