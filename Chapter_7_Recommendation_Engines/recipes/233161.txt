Description: 
This recipe was inspired by a visit to a restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona. I loved it so much I ran back to my hotel room and wrote down everything I could remember was in it. It's a beautiful salad with a light dressing and has lots of texture and color. The dressing took some experimenting, but I think it turned out just right.
