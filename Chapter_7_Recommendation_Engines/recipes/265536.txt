Description: 
Traditional ratatouille vegetables, such as zucchini, are mixed with Italian herbs then air-fried to create a quick and easy side dish that is nutritious and delicious. Using an air fryer keeps the vegetables from getting soggy without using too much oil. You will need the baking accessory or an adaptable baking dish to use inside the air fryer basket.
