Description: 
This is a very quick appetizer recipe and a good way to use up the crumbs from your tortilla chips. Flavored chips work well with this recipe. Also try using the spicier taco seasoning mix if you want a hotter chicken. Recipe can he multiplied as many times as needed. Serve with hot pepper sauce, if desired.
