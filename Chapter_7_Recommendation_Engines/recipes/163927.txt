Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2 cups diced white potatoes
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons minced red onion
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

1/2 teaspoon curry powder

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the potatoes in the butter until browned, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Add the onion and cook until the potatoes are tender, another 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Stir in the cilantro, green onion, and curry powder; mix and cook another 2 to 3 minutes.

Description: 
This American-South Asian breakfast fusion is surprisingly good with ketchup. I ate mine with fried eggs, bacon, toast, and candied tamarind.
