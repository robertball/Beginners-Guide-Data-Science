Ingredients:
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups sour cream
1 1/4 cups white sugar
2 eggs
2/3 cup milk
2/3 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup slivered almonds (optional)
2 tablespoons poppy seeds, or more to taste
1 tablespoon almond extract
2 1/2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 14 muffin cups with liners.
Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat sour cream, sugar, eggs, milk, vegetable oil, butter, almonds, poppy seeds, almond extract, apple cider vinegar, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until smooth; gradually stir flour mixture into the sour cream mixture until just incorporated into a batter. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
