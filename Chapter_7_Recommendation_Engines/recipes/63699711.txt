4 medium unpeeled baking potatoes (about 1 1/2 lbs),
cut into 1/2-inch slices
1/2 cup plain fat-free yogurt
1 TBSP prepared horseradish
1/2 tsp salt
2-4 TBSP fat free (skim) milk
Chopped fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Heat 1 inch water to boiling in 3 quart saucepan.  Add potatoes.  Heat to boiling; reduce heat to low.  Simmer uncovered about 15 minutes or until tender; drain.  Return potatoes to pan.  Shake pan with potatoes over low heat to dry; remove from heat.
mash potatoes until no lumps remain.  Beat in yogurt horseradish, and salt.  Add milk in small amounts, beating after each addition (amount of milk needed to make potatoes smooth and fluffy depends on the kind of potatoes used).  Beat vigorously until potatoes are light and fluffy.  Sprinkle with parsley.
