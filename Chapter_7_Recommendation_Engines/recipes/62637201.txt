Old-Time Coconut Cakes Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
2 cups brown sugar
2 cups grated unsweetened coconut
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon ginger (or more to taste)
2 tablespoons goslings black seal rum (opt., you can substitute with water if wanted.)
food coloring (the amount depends on you) (optional)

Directions:
In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat together the sugars and the water until sugar has dissolved and thickened.
Add the remaining ingredients.
Cook slowly, stirring for about 20 minutes, or until quite thick.
Add food coloring if using, before it gets too thick to stir properly.
Test for doneness by dropping a rounded tablespoon's worth on a damp cutting board.
If it hardens as it cools, it's done.
Most people just plop rounded tablespoons of this mixture onto a damp cutting board and let it spread and cool. They're usually about 3 or so inches wide. So, experiment until you get the size you desire.
Store them in a glass jar or you can wrap them individually in waxed paper.
Beware! This is very sweet!

Description: 
More candy than cake really! When I was young, and way before that, this was seen pretty frequently around Bermuda in small shops. Nowadays, you may see it at a charity bake sale or the occasional corner shop run by Bermudians that still keep in touch with the good ol' days!
