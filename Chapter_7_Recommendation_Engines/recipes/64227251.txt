Share This
Serves: Yields 6 to 8 servings
Ingredients:
3 medium Russet potatoes, ribbon cut
3 medium leeks, white and light green parts only; rinsed and cut into ½-inch dice
3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 cup low-sodium chicken or vegetable stock
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Procedures:
Preheat the oven to 350°F and position an oven rack in the center.
Place a large skillet on the stove over medium heat and add the oil. Once shimmering, add the leeks. Cook until the leeks are soft and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
While the leeks are cooking wash and peel potatoes and feed through the large ribbon blade of the spiral slicer.
In a large saucepan combine the cream and chicken stock and place on the stove over a medium heat to simmer. Add the ribbonized potatoes and cook for 5 minutes, then season with salt and pepper.
Transfer half of the potato mixture to a 9 x 13-inch gratin dish, top with half of the leek mixture. Repeat with remaining potatoes and leeks. Ladle any remaining cream mixture over the gratin and top with Parmesan cheese.
Transfer to the oven to cook until the potatoes are tender and the mixture golden brown and bubbly, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen
