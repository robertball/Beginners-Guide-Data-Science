Description: 
Believe it or not, I'm not a fan of cheese and try to avoid it whenever possible. So dishes that are stuffed with things like Ricotta turn me off. I created this dish as a compromise to my cheese avoidance and my husband's love of Italian food.
Serve this with garlic bread and a salad for a wonderful family dinner.
