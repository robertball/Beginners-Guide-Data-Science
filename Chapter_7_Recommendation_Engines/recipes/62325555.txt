Ingredients:
- Courgettes (Zucchini); 4, medium, sliced but NOT peeled (please also read the Footnotes)
- Olive Oil; 2 Tablespoons
- Garlic; 1 large clove, peeled and crushed
- Italian Mozzarella; 110gms (4 ounces), sliced thinly (Cheddar can be subbed)
- Tomatoes; 4, large, peeled and sliced
- Parmesan; grated, 4 level Tablespoons
- Fresh Basil; chopped, 1 Tablespoon (can be subbed by 1 teaspoon dried oregano)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 190°C (375°F)
Cook the courgettes by heating the oil in a skillet large enough to hold all the courgette slices in one layer (or do two or more batches), scatter the garlic over the slices, and sauté to a rich golden colour on each side.
In a gratin dish, arrange layers of courgettes, cheese slices and tomatoes, so that they overlap each other like slates on a roof.
Sprinkle the parmesan over the top of the "slates" and top off with the basil (oregano) and salt and pepper.
Bake in the oven (on a high shelf) for 30 minutes or so, until melted, brown, bubbling and delicious.
If serving as a main, then crusty bread, torn off the loaf by hand, and a green salad with a lemon and/or lime vinaigrettey dressing cannot be bettered.

A quick and easy vegetarian dish for two, or a starter for 4, or even a side. A rustic Italian favourite, taught me by my Roman friends.
