Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, trimmed
1/2 cup crumbled fat-free pepper Jack cheese
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
12 ounces artichoke hearts in water
12 ounces canned mushroom pieces
1/2 cup white wine, divided
1/4 cup capers
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 (10.75 ounce) can reduced-fat cream of chicken soup
1/2 cup melba toast stuffing mix
olive oil cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
Slice chicken breasts open, making a pocket. Stuff cheese crumbles into the chicken breasts and place in a square baking dish. Sprinkle with salt and white pepper.
Combine artichokes, mushrooms, 1/4 cup white wine, and capers in a small skillet over high heat. Stir in basil and rosemary and cook until all liquid has evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes. Set aside.
Mix cream of chicken soup and remaining 1/4 cup wine together in a bowl.
Pour artichoke mixture into baking dish. Pour cream of chicken soup mixture into baking dish.
Mix stuffing mix and olive oil cooking spray in a bowl. Spread mixture into the baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly in the middle and chicken is no longer pink in the centers, about 35 minutes.
