Ingredients:
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
7 cups thinly sliced pared apples
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 Pastry for double-crust pie (9 inches)
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 egg white
Additional sugar

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine sugar, flour and spices; set aside. In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice. Add sugar mixture; toss well to coat. Line a 9-in. pie pan with half the pastry. Place apple filling into crust; dot with butter. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie. Cut a few slits in top. beat egg white until foamy; brush over pastry. Sprinkle sugar on top. Bake at 375 degrees F for 35 minutes. Increase temperature to 400 degrees F and bake 10-15 minutes more or until golden.

Description: 
I remember coming home sullen one day because we'd lost a softball game. Grandma, in her wisdom, suggested, 'Maybe a slice of hot apple pie will make you feel better.' One bite...and Grandma was right.
