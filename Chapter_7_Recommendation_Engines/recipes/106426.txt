Ingredients:
4 Granny Smith apples, peeled and chopped
1/3 cup water
1/4 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (15 ounce) container refrigerated pie crusts
1 egg white, lightly beaten

Directions:
Cook apples and water in a medium saucepan over medium heat, covered, stirring occasionally and breaking up apples with the back of a spoon, 10 to 12 minutes or until apples form a coarse puree. Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and flour; cook 2 to 3 additional minutes, stirring constantly until SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener dissolves and mixture is thickened. Stir in cinnamon. Spoon apple mixture into a bowl to cool slightly.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray; set aside.
Unroll piecrusts; cut each one into four wedges. Roll each wedge into a 6-inch circle. Place 3 level tablespoons apple mixture on each circle; moisten edges of dough with water and fold dough over to form a half-moon shape. Crimp to seal, and cut vents to release steam. Place on prepared pan; brush tops with egg white.
Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until turnovers are browned. Cool turnovers on a wire rack 10 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.
