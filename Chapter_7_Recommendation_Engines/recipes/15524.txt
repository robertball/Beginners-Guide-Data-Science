Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
2 cups pastry flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 cups peanut butter
1 1/2 cups honey
3 tablespoons plain yogurt
1/2 cup peanut butter

Directions:
Sift together the whole wheat flour, pastry flour, baking powder and salt, set aside. In a medium bowl, stir together the vegetable oil, 2 cups of peanut butter, honey and yogurt until smooth. Add the dry ingredients and mix by hand until well blended. Shape into a roll that is 2 inches in diameter, wrap and chill until firm.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Unwrap the roll of dough, and slice into 1/4 inch slices. Place half of the cookies onto unprepared baking sheets. Spread 1/2 teaspoon of peanut butter onto the center of each cookie on the sheets, cover with the remaining cookie rounds, and seal edges tightly with a fork.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove cookies from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
