Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups butter, softened
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 1/3 cups white sugar
1 1/3 cups brown sugar
6 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 tablespoons instant espresso powder
1 1/2 cups chopped dark chocolate
1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan. Whisk the flour and baking soda together until blended.
In a large bowl, mash the butter, cream cheese, white sugar and brown sugar with a spoon until the mixture is creamy and thoroughly combined. Beat in 1 egg at a time, mixing it in completely before adding the next one. Stir the vanilla extract with the instant espresso powder in a small bowl, and add it to the butter mixture. Stir in until well combined.
Stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture in 1/2-cup quantities until the flour has been thoroughly incorporated. Stir in the chopped dark chocolate. Spoon the batter into the prepared cake pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 1/2 hours. Start checking for doneness after about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan for about 10 minutes, then turn out onto a cake dish and allow to finish cooling. Dust with confectioners' sugar.

Description: 
A variation of the classic cream cheese pound cake with mocha flavoring and chips of dark chocolate floating throughout the cake.  Serves a crowd and always well received! Keep in an airtight cake safe -- it tastes best if made at least 24 hours prior to serving, and can actually be made 2 to 3 days in advance!
