Ingredients:
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 cups pearl (Israeli) couscous
2 1/2 cups water
1/2 cup French lentils
water to cover
2 Roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
1 small cucumber, seeded and diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup golden raisins
1/3 cup diced red onion
1/4 cup 1/2-inch slices of fresh chives (optional)
2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley, or more to taste
1 green onion, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon ground sumac (optional)
Dressing:
1/4 cup olive oil
2 lemons, juiced
2 tablespoons honey, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir couscous in the hot oil until toasted and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 2 1/2 cups water to couscous and bring to a boil; cover skillet and cook until couscous is tender, about 10 minutes. Rinse couscous in a colander with cold water and transfer to a bowl. Mix 1/4 cup olive oil into couscous and stir to coat.
Place lentils in a small pan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until lentils are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and rinse lentils under cold water in a colander; add to couscous.
Mix tomatoes, cucumber, red bell pepper, cranberries, raisins, red onion, chives, parsley, green onion, and sumac into couscous-lentil mixture.
Beat 1/4 cup olive oil, lemon juice, honey, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; pour over couscous-lentil mixture and stir until coated. Refrigerate salad for flavors to blend, 8 hours to overnight.

Description: 
This is a take-off of a pricey deli salad that my family loves. Using ingredients at home, it is much more affordable so we can enjoy it more often. Store salad in the fridge, covered, for up to a week.
