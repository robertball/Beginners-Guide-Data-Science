Ingredients:
2 tablespoons cooking oil
3 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch pieces
sea salt to taste
1 tablespoon chili powder, or to taste
1/2 tablespoon ground cumin, or to taste
1 dried chipotle chili pepper, ground into powder
ground black pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 small yellow onion, diced
1 medium green bell pepper, diced
1 medium yellow bell pepper, diced
5 cups water
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, undrained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, undrained
1 (11 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 teaspoon green pepper sauce (e.g., Tabasco®)
1 (6 ounce) can roasted garlic tomato paste
1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Place chicken in the pot; brown on all sides. Season with sea salt, chili powder, cumin, ground chipotle, black pepper,  and cayenne pepper. Mix in onion, green bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper. Pour in about 3 cups water, and continue cooking 10 minutes, until about 1/2 the water has evaporated.
Mix the kidney beans, black beans, and corn into the pot. Season with green pepper sauce. Reduce heat to low, and mix in remaining 2 cups water and tomato paste. Simmer, stirring occasionally 30 minutes, or until thickened. Top with cilantro to serve.
