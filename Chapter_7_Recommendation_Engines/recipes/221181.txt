Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can refried beans
6 (7 inch) corn tortillas
cooking spray
1 3/4 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend
3 roma (plum) tomatoes, seeded and diced
2 green onions, sliced
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives, well drained

Directions:
Heat refried beans in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave on high until warmed through, about 2 minutes, stirring after 1 minute.
Spray both sides of each corn tortilla with cooking spray and arrange them on a wire rack.
Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Pan-fry one side of each tortilla until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Return tortillas to wire rack, browned sides up.
Spread a thin layer of refried beans onto the tortillas, stopping about 1/2 inch from the edge.
Sprinkle Mexican cheese blend over refried beans.
Carefully transfer a tortilla pizza back to the skillet, bean side up.
Lightly fry until cheese begins to melt, about 1 minute more; return tortilla pizza to wire rack. Repeat with remaining pizzas.
Scatter tomatoes, green onions, cilantro, and olives over melted cheese.
Slice pizzas to serve.

Description: 
I devised this simple snack for my Cinco de Mayo Fiesta party years ago.  An instant hit, they get gobbled up so fast that I enlist guests and form an assembly line at the grill, no skillet needed. Guests love being involved in the action.
