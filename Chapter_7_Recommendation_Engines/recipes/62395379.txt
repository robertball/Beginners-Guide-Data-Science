Ingredients:
1 pound large shrimp
1/3 cup cornstarch
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground red pepper
3 egg whites
2 cups flaked sweetened coconut
Orange marmalade for dipping (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Peel and devein shrimp. Rinse shrimp in cold water and dry on paper towels.
Combine cornstarch, salt, and red pepper in a small, shallow bowl. In a second bowl, add egg whites and whisk until frothy. Pour the coconut flakes into a third shallow bowl.
One at a time, dredge the shrimp in the cornstarch mixture, then in the egg white, then in the coconut, making sure to coat the shrimp well. Place the shrimp on a baking sheet coated well with cooking spray. Repeat with all the remaining shrimp. Lightly coat the shrimp with cooking spray so they don't stick when you flip them. Bake at 400 degrees for 15- 20 minutes, turning the shrimp halfway through.

This crunchy coconut shrimp is baked instead of fried, and so easy! Great for dinner or as an appetizer. I serve with orange marmalade for dipping.
