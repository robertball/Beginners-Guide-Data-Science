Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix with pudding included
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 cup low-fat vanilla yogurt
1/2 cup applesauce
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1 teaspoon maple flavoring
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, plus more for dusting
1 1/2 cups blueberries
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).
Mix cake mix and brown sugar together in a bowl; add yogurt, applesauce, water, vegetable oil, eggs, maple flavoring, and cinnamon. Beat on low speed with an electric hand mixer until blended. Scrape bowl and beat on medium speed for 4 more minutes.
Toss blueberries with enough cinnamon to evenly dust each berry in a bowl. Fold blueberries into the batter. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
