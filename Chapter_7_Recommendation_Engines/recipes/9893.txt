Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1 cup white sugar
1 cup dark molasses
1/2 cup water
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream shortening and sugar together. Mix in molasses and water. Sift together flour, salt, baking soda, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and allspice in a bowl; blend into the shortening mixture. Cover and chill overnight.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets. Roll out cookie dough 1/4 inch thick on floured surface. Cut with 3-inch cookie cutter and arrange on prepared cookie sheets. Sprinkle cookies with additional sugar (optional).
Bake until cookies are set up and very lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. You need to leave cookies on cookie sheet for 2 minutes after baking to keep them from breaking.
