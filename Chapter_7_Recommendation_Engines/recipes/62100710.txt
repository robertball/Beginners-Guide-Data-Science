Ingredients:
1 Tablespoon canola oil
1 medium yellow onion, finely diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1-1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1 15-ounce can black beans, drained but not rinsed
1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes with liquid
1 4-ounce can diced green chiles
1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and finely diced
1 chipotle pepper (packed in adobo), finely diced (or 1 teaspoon bottled chipotle sauce)
1 Tablespoon New Mexico chili powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon lime juice
1 Tablespoon all purpose flour
Garnish (see step 3)

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until softened and becoming opaque, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and stir continuously for 30 seconds. Add the ground beef, and cook (stirring occasionally) until the beef is browned. Add the black beans, diced tomatoes, diced green chiles, jalapeños, chili powder, salt, pepper, lime juice, and chipotle pepper (or sauce) and stir well to combine. Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.
Sprinkle the flour over the chili and stir in well. Increase to heat to bring it back to a boil, stirring often, until the sauce has thickened, about 2 minutes.
Serve over rice, noodles, toast points, or in a bowl with a slice of fresh homemade cornbread. Garnish with grated cheese, diced green onions, a dollop of sour cream, a few jalapeño slices or whatever suits your fancy.
