Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 cup buttermilk
3/4 cup molasses
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 pear - peeled, cored, and diced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt together in a large bowl. Beat eggs in a separate bowl; stir in buttermilk, molasses, and vegetable oil until smooth. Mix buttermilk mixture into flour mixture until batter is just moistened; fold in pears. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
