Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir broccoli in the hot oil until tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in onion; cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir cubed potatoes into broccoli mixture; cook and mash until potatoes begin to soften and resemble mashed potatoes, about 5 minutes. Season with cumin, salt, and black pepper. Spread mashed potato-broccoli mixture atop French bread slices.

Description: 
This is a good recipe for people who are trying to improve their diet! Delicious and super! I got this recipe from an empanada recipe. This was supposed to be a filling for the empanada, but when I was making it one day I messed up the dough and ended up not knowing what to do with the filling, so I just took a piece of bread and slapped some of the filling on bread; and I was like 'This isn't so bad.' Ever since then, it's one of my favorite recipes. Hope you guys like it! Garnish with kale leaves if desired.
