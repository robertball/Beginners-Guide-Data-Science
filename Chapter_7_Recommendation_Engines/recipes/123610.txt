1/2 cup ground almonds
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate
1/2 teaspoon shortening

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter, almonds, sugar and vanilla; add flour and cornstarch.  Roll into 1-in. balls; shape into crescents and place on greased baking sheets.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool completely on wire racks.
Melt chocolate and shortening in a microwave or double boiler; stir until smooth.  Dip one end of each crescent into chocolate; cool on waxed paper.  Refrigerate for about 30 minutes to firm the chocolate.
