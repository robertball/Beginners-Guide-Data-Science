Ingredients:
2 slices bacon, chopped
1 onion, chopped
3 tbsp. flour
1 lb. Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and chopped
6 cups reduced-sodium or homemade chicken broth
4 cups shredded cooked chicken (from a approx 3-lb. roasted chicken)
Kernels cut from 3 ears corn (about 3 cups)
1/4 to 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
2 med. tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1 avocado, pitted, peeled, and chopped
1 cup loosely packed cilantro leaves
2 limes, cut into wedges
Freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
1. In a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat, cook bacon until fat renders and meat starts to brown. Add onion, reduce heat to medium, and cook until soft, about 3 min.  Sprinkle with flour and cook stirring, until flour smells cooked(you should get a whiff of baked pie crust) but hasn't started to brown, about 3 min.
2. Add potatoes and broth. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to keep mixture simmering and cook until potatoes are barely tender, about 5 min. Add chicken and corn and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and stir in cream to taste. Heat through, about 2 min.  Serve in soup bowls, garnished with tomatoes, avocado, cilantro, a squirt or two of lime juice, and pepper to taste.
