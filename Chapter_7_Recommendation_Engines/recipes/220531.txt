Ingredients:
1 cup hot brewed tea
3/4 cup dried currants
3/4 cup golden raisins
3/4 cup demerara sugar
1 1/4 cups self-rising flour
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Pour hot tea over currants and raisins in a bowl; soak 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease a sheet of parchment paper and use it to line a 2-pound loaf pan.
Stir demerara sugar into tea and fruit mixture until dissolved completely.
Mix flour and egg into the tea and fruit mixture until completely integrated into a batter.
Spread batter evenly into the prepared bread pan.
Bake in preheated oven until golden-brown, about 40 minutes. Cool in the bread pan 5 minutes before transferring to a rack to cool completely.

Description: 
A sweet, yeast-less Welsh bread studded with dried fruit. I generally soak my raisins in Irish breakfast tea, but feel free to experiment with flavors.
