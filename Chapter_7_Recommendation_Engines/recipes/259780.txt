Ingredients:
1 cup milk
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
3 tablespoons buckwheat flour
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed

Directions:
Whisk milk, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a bowl. Sift in all-purpose flour and buckwheat flour gradually, stirring constantly, until batter is quite runny.
Melt butter in an 8-inch skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup batter into the skillet. Rotate the skillet until batter coats the bottom in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crepe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen crepe; flip crepe and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Transfer to a cooling rack. Repeat with the remaining batter, whisking gently before using.
