Ingredients:
1 pound Johnsonville HOT Italian Sausage
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1/2 large onion, chopped
2 tablespoons butter
1 (16 ounce) package uncooked elbow macaroni(I used Corn Elbows to make it Gluten Free)
1 tsp. garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup French's Fried Onion topping

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until evenly browned. Drain.
While the ground beef is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain, and stir in butter. Transfer to a large casserole dish, and mix in the ground beef, tomato sauce, onions,and Cheddar cheese. Sprinkle a little salt, pepper and garlic powder over the top and mix again.
Bake uncovered for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until heated through and bubbly.  Add French's onion topping during the last 5 minutes of cooking
