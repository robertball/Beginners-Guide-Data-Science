Ingredients:
24 corn husks
1/3 to 1/2 cup cornmeal
2 cups frozen corn (defrosted)
2 tbsp milk
2 tbsp butter
2 tsp sugar
Salt to taste
For the pork filling:
1 habanero pepper cut in small pieces (optional)
8 garlic cloves, chopped
1 tbsp olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
10oz chopped pork meat
1 tomato, peeled and chopped
1/4 cup raisins, soaked in sherry
1 tbsp capers
1/2 tsp ground cumin
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
To prepare the masa, blend the corn with the milk and butter in a food processor until smooth.
Add the sugar and 1/3 cup of cornmeal and mix for 5 seconds. Add more cornmeal if it looks too wet, should have the consistency of mud. Transfer to a bowl.
For the filling, heat the olive oil in a skillet. Add the onions and cook until soft, then take out of the skillet.
Add the pork meat and saute until brown. Add the garlic, the habanero and saute for 1 minute.
Add the tomato, raisins and capers. Season with teh cumin, salt and pepper. Turn heat off and let rest.
To assemble the tamales: soak the husks in hot water for 1 hour.
With the back of a big spoon, spread about 1/3 cup of the masa in the center of a husk very carefully.
Then add a spoonful of the pork filling. Wrap the husk around the masa and tie the ends of the tamal with string or husk strips.
Repeat the process until the ingredients are gone.
Steam the tamales over boiling water for 1 hr.
Check the water level constantly and add more if needed.

Description: 
Cuban tamales are similar to their Mexican counterparts, however they don't use 'masa mix' nor lard or shortening, and are very flavorful.
