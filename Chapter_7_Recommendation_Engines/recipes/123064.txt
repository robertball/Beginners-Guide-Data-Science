Ingredients:
4 medium tart apples, cored
1/3 cup raisins
1/3 cup flaked coconut
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Place each apple on a piece of heavy-duty foil (about 12 in. square). Combine the remaining ingredients; spoon into center of apples. Fold foil over the apples and seal tightly. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 20-25 minutes or until apples are tender. Open foil carefully to allow steam to escape.
