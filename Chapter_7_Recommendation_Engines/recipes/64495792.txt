3 tbsp flour
3 large eggs beaten and seasoned with salt & pepper
2 cups panko breadcrumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400
Heat medium to large (cast iron) skillet on medium high heat (5-6 on turn dial) until very hot. Add canola oil.
Season chicken with salt and pepper on both sides.
Mix together panko and italian seasoned breadcrumbs and garlic powder in bowl.
Sprinkle chicken with flour till lightly coated, tap off excess. Dip floured chicken into egg mixture then into breadcrumb mixture and press to coat well on both sides until completely covered.
Place chicken in oil and cook each side for 2 minutes or until golden brown. Remove chicken from pan and place on baking sheet. Place 1/4 cup of tomato sauce on top of chicken. Sprinkle 1 tsp of Parmesan over sauce, and top with sliced mozzarella, and sprinkle with basil.
Bake in preheated oven for 13-14 min
