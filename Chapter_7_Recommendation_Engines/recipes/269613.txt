Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
6 (1.75 ounce) packages nacho cheese-flavored corn chips (such as DoritosÂ®)
1 (8 ounce) package taco cheese blend
2 tomatoes, diced
1 cup shredded lettuce
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Mix taco seasoning into the beef.
Crush chips without opening the bags. Open bags and spoon in seasoned beef. Cover with cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and sour cream. Stir to blend. Eat with forks right out of the bags.

Description: 
This has been a family favorite ever since our life got crazy chasing kids around. Quick and easy to make, kids love it, and there is no cleanup.
 The meat can be made up in advance, so when it's time to eat, just heat up the meat and you are ready to go. Easy enough to eat in the car on the way to soccer practice on a busy night!
