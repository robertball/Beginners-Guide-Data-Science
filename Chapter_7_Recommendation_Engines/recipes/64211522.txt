Chanterelle Pizza Recipe

Ingredients:
1/2 recipe no-knead pizza dough*
olive oil
3/4 lb. chanterelle mushrooms, halved if they are very large
1/2. c. very good quality sundried tomatoes (not packed in oil--they should be slightly moist and chewy without the oil if they're good ones)
2 small heads garlic or one large
2 c. grated whole milk mozzarella
1/2 c. grated parmesan
1/4 c. finely chopped parsley

Directions:
To roast garlic:
Cut off the pointy end of each garlic head--about 1/2" so all the cloves inside are exposed.  Don't cut the stem end--this is the flat part the garlic head will sit on as it roasts.  Put in an ovenproof dish and drizzle a good amount of olive oil over them. Cover tightly with foil and roast for about 60 minutes, until cloves are soft, golden, and starting to pop out of their skins.  Cool. When they're cool enough, squeeze the whole bulb from the stem end over a bowl, and the cloves should pop right out.  Don't worry if their shape gets mangled a little bit.
To roast chanterelles:
Brush the dirt off with a small brush or coarse, clean towel.  In a small bowl, toss with 1 Tb. olive oil and a bit of coarse salt. Roast at 375 for 10-12 minutes, until mushrooms are browned and have lost most of their moisture.  Set aside.
To assemble pizza:
Preheat oven to 500.
Press dough into baking sheet according to instructions. (see "pizza dough in recipe box) Drizzle a bit of olive oil and distribute with a basting brush.  Add mozzarella, chanterelles, roasted garlic cloves, and sundried tomatoes.  Scatter parmesan over the top and bake until crust is crispy and toppings are bubbling, about 15 minutes.  Top with chopped parsley.
