Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour or wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 to 4 bananas, mashed
1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar
2 egg, lightly beaten
1/3 cup butter or coconut oil, melted
1/2 cup packed brown sugar for topping
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 10 muffin cups, or line with muffin papers.
In a large bowl, mix together 1 1/2 cups flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, beat together bananas, sugar, egg and melted butter. Stir the banana mixture into the flour mixture just until moistened. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour and cinnamon. Cut in 1 tablespoon butter until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Sprinkle topping over muffins.
Bake in preheated oven for 18 to 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean.
