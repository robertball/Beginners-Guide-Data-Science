Ingredients:
1 can chicken broth
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, diced
handful of fresh ginger slivers. (about a tablespoon or so)
3 small potatoes, cubed
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon ground pepper
1.5 pounds fresh pumpkin (about 1 cup pumpkin puree)
Greek Yogurt (optional)
Croutons (optional)

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400 F. Cut the pumpkin into small chunks. Place it on a roasting pan skin side up. Pour enough water into the pan so the bottom of the pan is full of water (about 1cm high). Bake the pumpkin for 40 minutes or until the pumpkin flesh is soft enough to tear off with a fork.
2. When pumpkin is ready, remove from oven and take a fork and remove the skin form the pumpkin. Smash it a bit in a bowl and set aside.
3. In a pan, brown the onions and garlic with 2 tablespoons butter or margarine on low heat.
4. Take the potatoes and cut it into small cubes. This will help them cook faster when boiling them. Boil them in a pot with some salt and water until they are tender enough to make mash potatoes.
5. In a food processor or blender, puree the pumpkin, onions, ginger and potatoes. Do not blend it till it is fully smooth, you want some chunks for texture.
6. In a pot, combine the puree with 1 can chicken broth, and add the bay leaves and pepper. Simmer on medium heat until the soup is hot and well mixed.
7. Serve with croutons or a dollop of greek yogurt.
