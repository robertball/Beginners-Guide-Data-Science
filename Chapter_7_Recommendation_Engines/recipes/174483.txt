Ingredients:
3 1/4 cups dry bow-tie pasta
3 cups water
2 MAGGI Chicken Flavor or Vegetarian Vegetable Flavor Bouillon Cubes

1 (15 ounce) can cannellini (white kidney beans) or small white beans, rinsed and drained
1/3 cup BUITONI® Freshly Shredded Parmesan Cheese

Directions:
Combine pasta, water and bouillon in large saucepan. Bring to a boil. Cook, stirring frequently, for 8 to 10 minutes or until pasta is tender and broth has reduced to about 1/2 cup; do not drain. Reduce heat to low; add pesto.
Cook, stirring frequently, until sauce has reduced slightly. Stir in tomatoes and beans. Cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through. Sprinkle with cheese before serving. Season with ground black pepper, if desired.
