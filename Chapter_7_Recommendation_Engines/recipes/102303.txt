Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dry fettuccine pasta
1 1/4 cups low-fat milk
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1 1/4 teaspoons dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2/3 pound medium shrimp - peeled, deveined, and halved lengthwise
1/2 pound bay scallops
4 green onions, thinly sliced
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
salt and ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the liquid; return pasta to the pot.
Microwave milk, broth, thyme, and pepper flakes in a 1-quart heat resistant glass measuring cup until very hot.
Melt butter in a Dutch oven; whisk in flour, then hot milk mixture. Simmer until sauce thickens, stirring consistently. Stir in shrimp, scallops, green onions, parsley, and cheese. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until shrimp turn pink and scallops cook through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Pour sauce over pasta, and toss to coat. Add cooking liquid as needed to moisten dish.
