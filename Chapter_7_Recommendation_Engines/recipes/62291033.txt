Ingredients:
1 3# sugar pumpkin or butternut squash
2 T. oil
2 T. maple syrup
2 1/2 tsp. cider vinegar
1 tsp. kosher salt
1 tsp. ground black pepper.
pinch of cayenne
2 T. oil or butter
4 large leeks, cleaned and chopped (white and light green parts)
2 large garlic cloves, minced
2 tsp. chopped fresh rosemary
2 15-oz cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed (or 3 c. cooked white beans)
2 c. vegetable broth
3/4 # kale, center ribs removed, leaves thinly sliced
2 oz. parmesan cheese (optional)
1/3 c. dried cranberries, roughly chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425.  Peel pumpkin/squash, cut and scoop out seeds.  Cut flesh into 1-inch cubes.
Spread cubes out on a large rimmed baking sheet.  Combine oil, syrup, 1 tsp. vinegar, kosher salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, and cayenne.  Heat until butter melts; pour mixture over squash and toss to coat evenly.  Roast, tossing occasionally, until pumpkin or squash is very tender and caramelized at edges, about 30 minutes.
While squash cooks, in a large skillet, warm olive oil over medium heat.  Add leaks, garlic, rosemary and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks are very soft but not browned, about 15 minutes.  Add beans and broth and simmer for 10 minutes.
Stir in kale, and cheese if desired.   Simmer till kale is cooked down and tender, about 10 minutes.Stir in pumpkin/squash and chopped cranberries; season with remaining 1 1/2 tsp. vinegar and 1/2 tsp. black pepper.
