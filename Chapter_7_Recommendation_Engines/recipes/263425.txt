Ingredients:
2 medium leeks, chopped
1 tablespoon vegan margarine
3 cloves garlic, crushed
3 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano, divided
3 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary, divided
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
2 (5.6 ounce) cans coconut milk
1 1/2 cups almond milk, or as needed
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup shredded vegan cheese

Directions:
Combine leeks, margarine, garlic, 2 teaspoons oregano, 2 teaspoons rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook until leeks are soft, 7 to 8 minutes. Add potatoes, coconut milk, almond milk, and flour and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer until potatoes are almost cooked, 10 to 15 minutes. Add more liquid if mixture starts to stick.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish.
Spoon potato mixture into the prepared casserole dish and sprinkle with shredded cheese. Garnish with remaining oregano and rosemary.
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are fully cooked and the top is golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.

I've always loved these creamy, delicious dishes and find that it's difficult to recreate them without dairy. This creamy casserole style dish is perfect for anyone who is vegan or allergic to dairy.
