Ingredients:
12 oz. tri-color rotini pasta
1/2 lb. fresh broccoli florets
1/2 lb. fresh cauliflower florets
2 large carrots, sliced
1 small can sliced black or green olives
1 large jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained.
8 oz. mozzarella cheese, cut into 1" cubes
8 oz. cheddar cheese, cut into 1" cubes
1 8 oz. bottle Italian salad dressing
2 tbls. chopped fresh basil for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions, being careful not to overcook; pasta should be "al dente". Drain and rinse with cold water and put in a large bowl.
Add remaining ingredients to the pasta and drizzle with the salad dressing. Toss well and chill for a few hours or overnight. Garnish with chopped fresh basil before serving.
Before serving add cubed cheese and toss again. Sprinkle chopped fresh basil over all and serve.

Description: 
A colorful pasta and veggie salad great for potlucks. Easily adaptable; try different cheeses or veggies to suit your own tastes. However, the marinated artichoke hearts add great flavor and are well worth the extra expense. My family often asks for this dish during the hot summer months.
