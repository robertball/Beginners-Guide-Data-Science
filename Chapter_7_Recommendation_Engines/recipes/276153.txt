Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups fresh okra, ends trimmed
5 tablespoons chickpea flour (besan)
1 teaspoon ginger paste

1/2 teaspoon red chile powder
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 pinch asafoetida powder
1 pinch carom seeds
salt to taste
oil for frying
1 teaspoon chaat masala, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Cut each okra pod vertically into 4 long pieces. Place in a bowl with chickpea flour, ginger paste, lemon juice, chile powder, turmeric, asafetida, carom seeds, and salt; toss to coat.
Heat 2 inches oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Lower okra carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining okra.
