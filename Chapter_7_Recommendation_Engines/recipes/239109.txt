Ingredients:
12 (3 inch) unbaked tart shells
1 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons half-and-half

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place tart shells on a baking sheet.
Whisk brown sugar, butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; whisk in egg until smooth. Stir half-and-half into sugar mixture. Fill prepared tart shells 2/3-full with filling.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly and pastry is golden, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is super easy to prepare, especially if you are using prepared pastry tart shells. Even when I only have a few minutes I can still prepare something home-baked. It will be hard to keep these around for too long. My boys ask for them often.
