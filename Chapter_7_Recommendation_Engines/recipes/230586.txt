Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (3 pound) beef sirloin tip roast
1 onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups brewed coffee
1 1/2 cups water
2 cubes beef bouillon
6 basil leaves
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup water
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in stock pot over medium heat; sear roast in the hot oil until slightly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove roast from pot and place on a plate. Cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil until onion is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
Return seared roast to the stock pot; pour coffee and 1 1/2 cup water over roast. Add beef bouillon, basil leaves, 1 tablespoon salt, and pepper.
Bring broth to a boil; reduce heat to medium low, cover stock pot, and simmer until meat is falling apart, 2 to 3 hours. Remove and discard basil leaves. Transfer roast to a serving dish and cover with a lid or aluminum foil, keeping the broth in the stock pot over medium heat.
Whisk flour and 1/2 cup water together in a bowl until smooth. Slowly whisk flour mixture into broth until gravy is smooth and somewhat clear; season with salt. Pour about half the gravy over the roast and pour the rest into a gravy boat for serving.
