Ingredients:
1 Cup Orange Juice, With Extra Pulp
3 Honey Crisp Apples, Medium Sized
8 oz Canned Crushed Pineapple, In Juice
1/2 Cup Grated Coconut, Fresh (You can used thawed frozen if fresh is not available)
1/4 Cup Honey
1/4 Cup Chopped Pecans (optional)

Directions:
Pour the orange juice into a medium bowl.
Peel and core the apples, and then grate them with the large hole side of  a box grater over a cutting board
Add the grated apples into the orange juice after each apple is grated to prevent them from browning.
After all of the apples are grated, Add the pineapple, coconut and honey.
Toss all ingredients together.
Store in the refrigerator until ready to serve. The apples will continue to absorb the orange juice.
This can be served by itself or with Angel food cake.

Description: 
Ambrosia is a classic. This one forgoes the extra sugar and cream that fill up some recipes.  This is a good light and fresh dessert for hot summer days. I usually pair it with angel food cake.
