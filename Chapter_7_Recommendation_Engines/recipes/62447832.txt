Ingredients:
2 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon coarse salt
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 and 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees
Sift together flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl; set aside. Put butter and 1 and 1/2 cups sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Mix in the eggs. Reduce speed to low; gradually mix in flour mixture.
Stir together cinnamon and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in a small bowl. Shape dough into about twenty 1 3/4-inch balls; roll in cinnamon sugar. Space 3 inches apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.
Bake the cookies (rotating baking sheets halfway through), or until the edges are golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes. Place cookies on wire racks to cool. Cookies can be stored between layers of parchment paper in artight containers at room temperature for up to 3 days.

Description: 
The origin of the name of these homey, drop-style cookies is unclear, says Martha, but recipes for them appear in early-twentieth-century American cookbooks and newspapers. The name may be a tongue twister, but the recipe isn't as hard to master. Martha suggests, After rolling balls of dough in cinnamon sugar, give them ample room on baking sheets; they spread quite a bit.
