Ingredients:
1 tsp olive oil (opt)
1 pound ground white turkey breast (optional)
2 green bell peppers chopped
1 large onion chopped
1 teaspoon ground coriander
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon salt
1 bay leaf
1 jar of tomatillo salsa (the green kind)
1 can of diced green chiles, drained
1 small jalapeño, seeded and finely sliced
1 quart vegetable broth
1 can cannellini (or other white) beans (2 cans if not using turkey breast)
1 cup of chopped cilantro
1 lime cut into wedges
organic sour cream or tofu sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Heat ½ teaspoon of the oil in a large pot over medium high heat
Add ground turkey to pan and cook until browned
Transfer cooked turkey to a bowl and return pot to heat
Add remaining ½ teaspoon oil, bell pepper and onion and cook until softened and golden brown, adding 1T at a time water if needed to keep from sticking
Add turkey back to pot with spices and salt and mix well
Add bay leaf, tomatillos, chiles, jalapeños and broth, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 40 mins
If you like more broth and less chunky chili, add up to two additional cups water
Gently stir in beans and cook for 30 minutes more
Stir in cilantro at the very end, right before serving
Serve with a dollop of tofu sour cream and a lime wedge
