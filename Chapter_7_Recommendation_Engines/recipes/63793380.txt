Ingredients:
1 chuck roast - 4-6 pounds
1 jar of pepperocini with the juice
1 packet of italian dressing seasoning mix, the type usually mixed with oil and vinegar to make a salad dressing
1 cup of beef broth
garlic powder
black pepper
olive oil

Directions:
Heat about 2 tsp of olive oil in a heavy pan.  Season the roast on both sides with the garlic powder and pepper.  Sear the roast on each side until nice and brown (a few minutes per side).
Remove from the pan and place in a slow cooker.  Pour in the cup of beef broth, the entire jar of pepperocinis, and sprinkle the italian seasoning on top of the beef.   Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or until the meat falls apart.  This is SO.GOOD.  You will love it.
Sometimes, during the last 20 minutes or so, I add in sliced or quartered mushrooms.  Just adds something extra.  This is awesome served with mashed potatoes.

We LOVE this meal.  It seems like it would be spicy with the pepperocinis, but it is not.  It has a great flavor! Awesome with mashed potatoes!!!!!
