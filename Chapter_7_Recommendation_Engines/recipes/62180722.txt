Ingredients:
2 packages cream cheese (regular or light/reduced fat)
1/2 cup shredded havarti cheese
1/2 cup shredded parmesian cheese
2 tbsp. chopped fresh basil
2 tsp. grated lemon peel
1/2 tsp. garlic
1/4 chopped basil
1/4 chopped parsley

Directions:
Mix the cream cheese, havarti, parmesian, 2 tbsp. basil, the grated lemon peel, and garlic together in a mixing bowl.
Dispense the mixture onto plastic wrap and shape into a cone, resembling a Christmas tree.
Unwrap the tree (making sure to leave the cone standing on the plastic wrap) and cover the visible portion with the basil and parsley mixture.
Gently wrap the coated tree in the plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours or until firm.
After the tree has reached desired firmness, set it on your serving platter and top the tree with lemon peel cut into the shape of a star.
Serve with your choice of crackers (Triscuits or Wheat Thins work great!)
