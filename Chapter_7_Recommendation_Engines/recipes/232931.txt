Description: 
In this raw vegan pina colada smoothie, the bitterness of the dandelion greens comes in very handy, and seems to make this smoothie taste like it has alcohol in it. I promise all of the ingredients come together in exactly the right quantities that you would swear this little concoction had a nip of rum in it and you were laying at a beach resort! Trust me, this green smoothie puts the 'dandy' back in the lion. It is TO DIE FOR!
