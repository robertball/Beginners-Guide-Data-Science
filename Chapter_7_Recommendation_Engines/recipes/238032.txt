Ingredients:
6 cups popped popcorn
1 cup salted, roasted peanuts
1 (12 ounce) bag semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup honey

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Mix popcorn and peanuts together in a large bowl.
Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.
Pour honey into a microwave-safe bowl and heat in microwave until warmed and pourable, about 10 seconds; stir into melted chocolate.
Pour chocolate-honey mixture over popcorn mixture, stirring until evenly coated. Scoop chocolate-popcorn mixture using a small ice cream scoop, pressing mixture into scoop. Release mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate truffles until firm, about 1 hour.
