Blend flour, baking powder, ginger, and baking soda together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Mix brown sugar and butter in another bowl to form a smooth paste. Add eggs; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until creamy. Add flour mixture; beat until a smooth dough forms. Stir in granola, coconut, and chocolate chips.
Drop teaspoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto the cookie sheet.
