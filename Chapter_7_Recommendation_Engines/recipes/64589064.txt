Ingredients:
1 6-7 boneless pork shoulder roast
2 teaspoon sea salt and 1 teaspoon pepper
2-3 large onions, cut into quarters
3-4 cloves garlic, peeled and cut in half
5 bay leaves

Directions:
1.Either preheat your oven to 450 then immediately lower to 250 degrees. Season pork shoulder with salt and pepper and place in a large baking pan.
2.Add quartered onions, garlic and top with bay leaves.  Add some water to the bottom (about 1 cup).  For the oven I set the time at 1 hour per pound.
Check every 2 hours and baste with the drippings.
3.Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes then move to a bard then use two forks to shred apart.
Now you can add your favorite BBQ sauce on the pulled pork and keep warm until ready to serve or use in your favorite recipes!  Enjoy

I need to thank Vinny from the meat department at Shop Rite, E. Hartford for the perfect pieces of pork shoulder fort his recipe and for my segment on Better Connecticut.  You are the best Vinny!  

I love making a simple pork shoulder and using it for several recipes!  I created this recipe for my Cook Once Meals or Week cooking segment for Better Connecticut.  

We are cooking this in the oven but you can use this same recipe in your slow cooker for 7-8 hours on medium.
