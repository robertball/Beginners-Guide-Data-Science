Description: 
This is an easy yogurt cake that uses the yogurt container to measure all of the ingredients. It's ready in under an hour and the perfect not-too-sweet snack or breakfast treat. It's known in France as Gâteau au Yaourt and is typically the first cake that French children learn how to make. My son attends a French school and has made this with his classmates.
