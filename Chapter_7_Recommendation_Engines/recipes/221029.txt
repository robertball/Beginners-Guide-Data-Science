Ingredients:
3 (3 ounce) packages package ramen noodles (flavor packet saved for another use) broken into pieces
1/2 cup sunflower seeds
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 head bok choy, chopped
1/2 sweet onion, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place ramen noodles, sunflower seeds, and almonds on a baking sheet. Drizzle butter over the ramen noodle mixture and toss to coat.
Toast the ramen noodle mixture in the preheated oven until lightly browned and fragrant, stirring occasionally to avoid burning, about 8 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Whisk sugar, vegetable oil, vinegar, and soy sauce together in a small bowl for the dressing.
Place bok choy, onion, and toasted ramen noodle mixture in a large bowl. Toss with dressing until well coated.

Description: 
A nice alternative to the usual summer grill accompaniments of potato or macaroni salad with the added benefit of no mayo! Tasty with a surprising crunch. Very addictive.
