Halve the avocados lengthwise. Remove the pit and dice the flesh inside the shell. Squeeze the diced avocado into a bowl.
Next, sprinkle on some salt and mash away with a fork until you get the avocado to the consistency you want.
Now throw on a big pile of Pico de Gallo and stir together gently. Always test the guacamole with tortilla chips so you'll get a more accurate gauge of the salt content.
