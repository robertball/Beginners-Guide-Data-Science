Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 (4 pound) boneless pork loin roast
salt and pepper to taste
all-purpose flour for dredging
3/4 cup maple syrup
3/4 cup ketchup
1/3 cup water
1 tablespoon minced garlic

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until smoking. Meanwhile, season the pork roast with salt and pepper, then dredge in flour, and shake off excess. Sear in hot oil until browned on all sides, about 1 minute per side.
Place onto a large sheet of aluminum foil set on top of a baking sheet; set aside. Stir together the maple syrup, ketchup, water, and garlic. Pour 3/4 of this sauce over the pork. Fold the foil over the pork, and seal to form a packet.
Bake in preheated oven until the internal temperature reaches 170 degrees F (75 degrees C), about 2 hours. Carefully open up the foil packet, and broil for a few minutes until the sauce glazes the meat. Serve with remaining sauce.

Description: 
This is a GREAT recipe.  Do not let the ingredients scare you, they combine to make a really great taste.  The pork is so moist and tender that it will fall apart when you go to cut it.  I find it comes out best with the loin that has two sections.  If it is a single loin, it still comes out great, but does not fall apart quite so much. Everyone who tries this loves it so far. It's my husband's favorite and very easy to make. It cooks for 1 hr 45 min - 2 hrs.
