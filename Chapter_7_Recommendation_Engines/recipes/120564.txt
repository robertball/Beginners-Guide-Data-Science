Description: 
When I was a teacher, this recipe was recommended by one of my student's parents. I've made it so many times, I can't imagine hosting a brunch without it. Chocolate chips add sweet bursts of flavor to the rich and tender coffee cake.                                                  --Michelle Krzmarzick                                                        Redondo Beach, California
