1/2 cup Vital Wheat Gluten (If your not using a High gluten flour)

1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine flour and salt. In another bowl, combine water, yeast, sugar, and oil.   Let sit for five minutes, or until mixture becomes frothy. Next, pour the flour mixture into the water mixture. Knead until the dough does not stick to the side of the bowl.

Description: 
This is a recipe I have been trying to perfect since I started making pizza 15 years ago. This recipe requires Vital wheat gluten which is necessary for the texture of the dough. Vital wheat gluten is high in protien, and makes the dough stretchy (So, as not to get holes when tossing.)
