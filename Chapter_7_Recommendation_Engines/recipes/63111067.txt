Ingredients:
1 stick of salted butter, quite soft.
1 tablespoon of chopped garlic or 2 - 3 cloves
1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped
1 teaspoon fresh chives, chopped
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
plastic wrap

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients together until creamy and smooth.
Once well combined, scoop onto a piece of plastic wrap.
The mixture is soft so carefully roll the butter up in the plastic wrap forming a log about 5 inches long.
Twist the ends to hold the log shape tightly.
Place in refrigerator until firm.  About 30 minutes.
When steaks are ready slice the butter into 1/4 to 1/2 inch slices and place on top of the individual steaks.
If slicing a large steak, spread the butter on first.  Add any remaining butter over cut steak slices for added flavor.
Enjoy!
