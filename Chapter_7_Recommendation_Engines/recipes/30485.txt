Ingredients:
4  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons lemon pepper
2  Vidalia onions, thickly sliced
4 large mushroom caps, chopped
1 cup mayonnaise
hot sauce to taste (optional)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place chicken breast halves in a large resealable plastic bag with lemon juice, olive oil, and lemon pepper. Shake to coat, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
Preheat a grill for high heat.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Place the Vidalia onions and mushrooms on the grill, and cook until lightly charred on both sides; set aside. Place chicken onto the grill, and discard marinade. Cook for 15 minutes, turning once, or until juices run clear. Remove from heat, cool, and chop.
In a large bowl, thoroughly mix the onions, mushrooms, chicken, and mayonnaise. Season with hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Cover, and refrigerate until serving.

Description: 
Was expecting a few hungry friends to walk in as I started cooking, but they called and had an emergency.  Fortunately nothing bad, but there I was with too much food. Chopped everything up, added mayo, and a generous slurp of hot sauce (the way I like it). Not your run-of-the-mill chicken salad. Good way to finish up those leftovers! I put the onion slices and mushrooms in a grill basket so they could be turned without falling apart as they cooked. Hope you like it!
