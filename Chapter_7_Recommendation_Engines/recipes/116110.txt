Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1/2 cup dates, pitted and chopped
1/2 cup chopped dried apricots
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 tablespoon cornmeal
2 eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup orange juice
1/2 cup molasses
1/2 cup honey
1/3 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon orange-flavored liqueur, such as Cointreau Â® (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and orange zest in a bowl. Set aside. Combine dates, apricots, raisins, walnuts, and cornmeal in a separate bowl. Set aside. Beat eggs, vegetable oil, 1/3 cup of orange juice, and molasses in a large bowl. Gradually pour the flour mixture into the egg mixture, mixing until just incorporated. Fold in the dried fruit mixture; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
To prepare the syrup: Mix honey, 1/3 cup of orange juice, and butter in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl for 1 minute. Stir in the orange-flavored liqueur. Poke holes throughout the cake then pour syrup over the cake.

Description: 
For Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year) we traditionally prepare honey cakes. I mostly find them either too sweet or too dry. This is a moist cake that improves with age. Prepare it a day or two before serving.
