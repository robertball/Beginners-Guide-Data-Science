Ingredients:
2-4 pounds beef short ribs
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon powdered garlic
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, diced
2 clove garlic
8oz mushromms, sliced
2 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles beer (the stronger the better)
1 cup BBQ sauce
1/4c low sodium soy sauce

Directions:
Dredge the ribs in a mixture of the salt, pepper, garlic and flour until coated. Shake off the excess flour.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook the ribs until browned on each side, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and set in crockpot. Add the onion, mushrooms and garlic. Mix beer, bbq sauce, soy sauce, and leftover flour and seasonings. Pour over the ribs and vegetables, cover and simmer over medium heat until very tender, about 2 hours.
