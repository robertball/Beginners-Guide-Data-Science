Ingredients:
1 Large Bunch of Curly Kale (1 Head), washed with stems removed
1 Cup Raw Macadamia Nuts or Cashews, Unsalted (if using salted, omit salt from recipe)
1 Red, Orange or Yellow Bell Pepper (seeded and chopped)
1/4 - 1/2 Cup Nutritional Yeast
1 Tablespoon Fresh Lemon or Lime Juice
1 Teaspoon Himalayan Salt (or any other salt)
1 Cup Water

Directions:
Set kale leaves aside and combine the rest of the ingredients in a blender or food processor until well-combined and of a smooth consistency.  It should have the consistency of a thick, creamy cheese sauce.  Add more or less water to get desired consistency.
In a large bowl, combine a few kale leaves at a time with enough of the sauce to coat well.  Use hands to massage the sauce into every fold of the leaves until they are evenly covered.
Put coated leaves onto a Teflex (non-stick) sheet in a food dehydrator and set at 115 degrees.  Dehydrate for 24-48 hours until dry and cruchy and no moisture remains.
Remove from dehydrator and store in plastic resealable bag.

Description: 
I created this recipe after purchasing a small bag of these type of kale chips and deciding that I could probably make them myself and save lot of money.  I was right!  I think my Cheezy Kale Chips are not only more affordable than the commerically available ones, but they taste better too!
