Ingredients:
4 lobster tails
8 tablespoons butter, divided
4 top-sliced hot dog buns
1 pinch paprika
1 pinch kosher salt
4 leaves Bibb lettuce (optional)

Directions:
Bring 1 cup water to a boil in a steamer. Add lobster tails; steam for 3 minutes. Remove from steamer and rinse under cold water until cool enough to handle.
Remove the shells and dice lobster meat into bite-sized pieces.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a 12-inch frying pan. Add 2 buns and turn to coat with butter. Toast over low heat, turning once, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with 1 tablespoon butter and remaining buns.
Melt remaining 6 tablespoons butter in the same pan. Toss in lobster pieces. Cook over low heat, stirring almost constantly, for 3 minutes. Add paprika and salt; continue to stir until lobster is opaque, about 2 minutes more.
Line toasted buns with lettuce. Fill with lobster. Drizzle any remaining butter on top.
