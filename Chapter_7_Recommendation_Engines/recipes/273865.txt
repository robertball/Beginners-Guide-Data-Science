Ingredients:
2 yellow squash, sliced
2 zucchini, sliced
1 medium yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 medium red bell pepper, chopped
1 medium orange bell pepper, chopped
1 medium green bell pepper, chopped
1 cup sliced sweet onion
1 cup sliced portobello mushrooms
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. DashÂ®)
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper
1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
Combine yellow squash, zucchini, bell peppers, onion, and mushrooms in a large bowl. Toss with 3 tablespoons olive oil, garlic and herb seasoning blend, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper.
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a grill-safe pan on the preheated grill. Add veggies and grill, stirring continuously, until squash and zucchini are opaque and peppers are still slightly crunchy, 8 to 10 minutes.
