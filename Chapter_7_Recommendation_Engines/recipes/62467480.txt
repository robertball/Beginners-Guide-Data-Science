Ingredients:
* 2½ Cups Pork (Shoulder or Loin)
* ½ Onion
* 2 Green Onions
* 1 Green Chilly Pepper & 1 Red Chilly Pepper
Pork Ingredients:
* 1 Tbsp Cooking Wine
* ¼ tsp Salt
* ¼ tsp Black Pepper
Sauce Ingredients:
* 5 Tbsp Red Pepper Paste
* 1 Tbsp Red Pepper Powder
* 1 Tbsp Soy Sauce
* 1 Tbsp Minced Garlic
* ¼ Apple (4 Tbsp Apple Sauce)
* 2 Tbsp Sugar
* ½ Tbsp Sesame Oil

Directions:
Cut 2½ cups of pork (shoulder or loin) thinly.
To get rid of the bad meat flavor, and make the pork tender, add 1 Tbsp of cooking wine, ¼ tsp of salt, and ¼ tsp of black pepper. Set it aside for at least 10 minutes.
Cut ½ of an Onion into ½ inch pieces. Cut 2 green onions and 2 peppers into 1 inch pieces.
Grind ¼ of a sweet apple in a mixer. You can use 4 Tbsp of apple sauce instead. Depending on your taste, you can use other kinds of sweet fruit juice, such as pineapple, Asian pear, orange or tangerine. I like using an apple. Fruit juice not only gives good flavor, but it also makes your pork tender.
In a bowl, combine the pork, onion, 5 Tbsp of red pepper paste, 1 Tbsp of red pepper powder, 1 Tbsp of soy sauce, 1 Tbsp of minced garlic, 4 Tbsp juice from an apple (or apple sauce), 2 Tbsp of sugar, and ½ Tbsp of sesame oil.
Mix all of the ingredients.
Cover it with plastic wrap, and marinate it at least for 3 hours.
Pour the marinated pork in a slightly oiled pan. Fry it until the meat is completely cooked on medium-high.
Add the green onions and chilly peppers. Fry 1 or 2 more minutes, then turn off the heat.
