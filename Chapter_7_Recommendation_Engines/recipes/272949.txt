Ingredients:
6 cups water, or as needed
1/2 head napa cabbage, shredded
1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced
3 cloves garlic, crushed and peeled
6 medium tomatoes, quartered

1 large onion, quartered
2 carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks
4 dried red dates
2 tablespoons dried goji berries (wolfberries)
sea salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine water, napa cabbage, ginger, and garlic in a large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.
Add tomatoes, celery, onion, carrots, dates, and goji berries. Bring soup back to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors blend and soup is slightly darker in color, about 2 hours.

Add sea salt, pepper, and a spoonful of chopped green onion to each serving bowl. Ladle soup into the bowls and stir.
