Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter, divided
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast, trimmed and diced
2 teaspoons seasoning salt
2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1 cup diced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup uncooked orzo pasta
2 cups chicken broth, or more as needed
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (5.2 ounce) package garlic and herb cheese spread (such as Boursin®)
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with seasoning salt and add to skillet; saute until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate.
Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet. Add mushrooms and saute until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove mushrooms to a plate.
Place onion in the skillet and saute until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add uncooked orzo; cook and stir until toasted and fragrant, about 4 minutes. Add 2 cups chicken broth, salt, and pepper. Mix well, reduce heat to medium-low, and bring to a simmer. Cook until orzo is tender, 8 to 10 minutes, adding more chicken broth if needed.
Reduce heat to low and stir in garlic and herb cheese spread until completely melted. Add chicken and mushrooms and mix until well combined. Garnish with parsley.

Description: 
This is a fast one-pot meal with chicken, mushrooms, and Boursin® that my kids love. You could also omit the chicken or substitute other vegetables.
