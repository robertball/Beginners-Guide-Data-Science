Ingredients:
BASE:
1 tablespoon of vegetable oil
1 sweet red onion, chopped
1 bunch of swiss chard or spinach, washed and chopped with tough stems removed
1 cup of cooked ham, cubed (note 2)
fresh or dried herbs to taste (optional)
CUSTARD:
1 cup of  milk
4 large eggs
2 1/2 cups grated emanthel cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
BASE: Fry the onion in oil until it becomes soft. Add the swiss chard (or spinach) and continue to fry until it becomes soft. It may be helpful to put a lid over the pan to allow the greens to steam a bit. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Add the cubed ham and herbs (if using).
CUSTARD: Whisk together milk and eggs. Add the grated emanthel cheese.
QUICHE: Pour the custard mixture into the cooled base mixture and stir. Pour into an ungreased quiche pan. Bake at 375 for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a knife comes out clean when the quiche is poked.
