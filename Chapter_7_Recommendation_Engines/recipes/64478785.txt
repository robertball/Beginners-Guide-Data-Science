Ingredients:
3-4 cups of a variety of mushrooms, cleaned and thinly sliced
4 springs thyme
1/2-1 serrano pepper, thinly sliced (depends on how much spice you want)
For the brine:
1 cup white wine
1 tablespoon raw or granulated sugar
20 peppercorns
12 coriander seeds
4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
3-5 lemon rinds (~1 inch)
2 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Fill two sterilized 16 oz jars or four 8 oz jars with the mixed, sliced mushrooms to about 3/4 of the way up.
Put thyme sprigs and 1/2 of the sliced serrano peppers on the top.
Place the rest of the ingredients into a small pot.
Bring to a simmer until sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally.
Remove brine from the heat and pour the liquid over the mushroom mixture until each jar is almost full.
Put a lid on and tightly seal each jar and put in the refrigerator.
Pickled mushrooms should be ready in a day or two and keep for about two months.
