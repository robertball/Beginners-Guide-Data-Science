Ingredients:
Chicken
Buttermilk or 3 c. water and 1 TBS salt
1 cup flour
2 tsp onion powder
2 tsp garlic powder
1 ½ tsp dry instant chicken broth
2 tsp seasoned salt
½ tsp black pepper
3/4 tsp ground sage
¼ tsp ground thyme
dash ground marjoram
2 eggs
½ cup milk
oil (for frying)

Directions:
Marinate chicken in buttermilk (or salt water mixture) for several hours to overnight.
Mix dry ingredients in a 1 gallon zipper bag. Mix eggs and milk in a large bowl.
Preheat oven to 425°. Put 1/8-1/4 inch of oil in a cast iron skillet. (Cast iron works best but glass or metal pan will work too.) Heat oil in oven about 10 minutes. (Prepare chicken while oil is heating.)
Drain chicken. Dredge in seasoned flour. Dip dredged chicken in egg/milk mixture. Dredge chicken in flour mixture a second time. Let rest a few minutes.
Bake chicken for 30 minutes (15 for boneless breasts). Turn then bake an additional 20 minutes (15 for boneless breasts) until golden. Remove from oil and drain on a metal rack.
