Description: 
This recipe has been passed on for years and years of tailgating at East Carolina University down in Greenville, NC. My friend was the originator of this recipe and there is never a time we go out tailgating for the football games and a person does not ask for this recipe. If you are a wing lover than you will truly enjoy these! They bring out all the key things to make wings taste GREAT! It give you sweetness, zing, and as much kick as you desire. So give it a try and I promise you will enjoy!
