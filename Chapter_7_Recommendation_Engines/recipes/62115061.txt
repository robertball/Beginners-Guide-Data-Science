5 tilapia fillets

Directions:
Heat butter in non stick frying pan over medium heat
Sprinkle each fillet on both sides with lemon pepper (add more if needed)
Place fillets in frying pan and cook on 3-7 min. on each side depending on the thickness of fish
Tilapia is ready when it has slightly crusted on each side
