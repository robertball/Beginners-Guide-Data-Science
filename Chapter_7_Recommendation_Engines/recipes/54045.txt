Ingredients:
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 pounds pork tenderloin
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/4 cup minced shallots
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 cups seedless red grapes, halved
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
1/2 teaspoon Asian five-spice powder

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat.
Lightly oil grate. Season meat with salt and pepper, and place on grill. Cook for 15 to 25 minutes, or to desired doneness, turning meat as necessary to cook evenly. Remove from grill, and let stand 10 minutes before slicing.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook shallots and garlic in oil until tender. Stir in grapes, soy sauce, honey, ginger, and five-spice powder. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes.
Process cooled sauce until smooth in a blender or food processor. Serve over sliced tenderloin.
