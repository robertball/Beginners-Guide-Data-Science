Ingredients:
1 lb box filo dough
1  16 oz can crushed pineapple, drained
1 jar Smuckers Pineapple topping
1 cup melted butter
1 cup walnut pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Prepare 2 (24) mini muffin tins by painting with melted butter.  Mix topping and crushed pineapple together. You will only need 1/2 of the filo box.  Cut dough into 3 inch squares.  Paint with butter using a pastry brush.  Stack 4 filo squares and gently press into muffin tin.  Drop 1 teaspoon of pineapple mix in each dough cup.  Drop 3-4 walnut pieces in each.  Fold dough together at top.  It won't stay completely together s it bakes.  Bake 20 minutes.  Let cool 5 minutes, then, using a small knife, gently loosen each bite.  Let cool another 10 minutes.  If keeping more than one day, refrigerate any leftovers in a sealed container.
