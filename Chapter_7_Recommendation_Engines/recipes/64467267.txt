Ingredients:
1 can of crescent rolls of your choice
2  fresh jalapenos, stemmed, seeded and cut into 16 pieces
3-4 strips of your favorite bacon, cut into 16 pieces
1.5 oz cream Cheese of your choice  (8 tablespoons)
2 tbs melted butter
1 tsp minced garlic

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a pan over medium high heat, cook bacon.  Important - do not over cook bacon!  Bacon should be chewy as it still has to bake inside the crescent roll.  Drain and set aside to cool.
Roll out crescent roll dough. Cut each triangle in half making sixteen pieces with a pizza cutter or knife.
In each piece of dough dollop 1/2 tsp of cream cheese, one piece of jalapeno, and one piece of bacon.  Bring corners of the dough together and twist at the top.  Press all edges of the dough together sealing in the liquid magma the cream cheese will become.
Space evenly on a ungreased cookie sheet.  Mix melted butter and garlic together. Brush the tops of each bite with mixture.
Bake 10-15 minutes or until tops are Lucifer golden (brown) and bottoms are Dean (light) brown.  If you hit Castiel (dark) brown, you've gone to far!  Scratch and start over.
