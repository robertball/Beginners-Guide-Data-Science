Ingredients:
4 boneless butterflied pork chops (about 1/2 inch thick)
1 teaspoon lemon pepper seasoning
1 teaspoon ground mustard powder
4 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons dijon mustard

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350°F.  Start with two aluminum foil pouches (or use two large pieces of heavy duty foil set in baking dishes).  Spray with non-stick coking spray.  Place 2 pork chops in each.  Sprinkle chops with lemon-pepper seasoning and mustard powder.  Top each chop with dijon mustard and add lemon juice to pouches.  Seal pouches well (or fold over foil to form a pouch).  Bake at 350°F for 25- 30 minutes until chops are cooked through.  Remove from pouch and serve with juices.

Description: 
This unique flavor combination has become a family favorite (even with kids who don't like lemon, pepper or mustard).  It can easily be done with chicken as well.  I've done it on the grill in the summer too.
