Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 bananas
1 small apple cored, pealed and chopped
3/4 cups sugar
1/2 cups butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Handful of chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat muffin pans with non-stick spray, or use paper liners. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; set aside.
Combine bananas, sugar, egg and vanilla. Process until smooth using hand-held blender. Add melted butter.
Add liquid ingredients to the flour mixture, and mix until smooth. Add chocolate chips if using. Scoop into muffin pans.
Bake in preheated oven. Bake mini muffins for 10 to 15 minutes, and large muffins for 25 to 30 minutes. Muffins will spring back when lightly tapped.
