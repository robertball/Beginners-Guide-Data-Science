Ingredients:
2 tablespoons pine nuts
2 tablespoons LAND O LAKESÂ® Salted Butter
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 large zucchini, cut with a spiralizer
2 tablespoons shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Heat a non-stick skillet or wok over medium. Toast the pine nuts stirring constantly to keep from burning, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
Return the skillet to medium heat; add butter and crushed red pepper; stir until butter melts. Stir in spiralized zucchini. Saute, flipping lightly throughout the cooking process. When the zoodles are al dente (about 5 minutes), transfer them to a serving dish or plate. Top with shaved cheese and reserved pine nuts.
