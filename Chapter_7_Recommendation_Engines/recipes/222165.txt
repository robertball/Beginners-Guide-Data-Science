Description: 
Much lower salt than pre-made. Salt can be omitted. Great with half ground buffalo and half ground turkey breast or whatever you prefer. Buy bulk spices and you can make 5-plus batches for under $1.00!! Increasing black pepper and adding optional ingredients will increase heat. Using mild or regular chili powder and omitting optional ingredients will reduce heat. To keep salt content low make sure chili powder does not contain salt.
