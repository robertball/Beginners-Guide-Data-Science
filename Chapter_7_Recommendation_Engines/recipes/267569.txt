Ingredients:
For Cookies:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup Stevia In The Raw® Bakers Bag
1/3 cup unsulfured molasses
1/4 cup applesauce
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated
1 large egg
For Frosting:
1 (4 ounce) package cold cream cheese, cubed
1/2 stick unsalted butter, softened
1/4 cup powdered sugar, sifted
1/4 cup Stevia In The Raw® Bakers Bag
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves.
In a large bowl, whisk together brown sugar, stevia, molasses, applesauce, ginger, and egg. Fold dry ingredients into wet ingredients just until combined. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Use a tablespoon to scoop out dough. Roll dough into balls. Place on the baking sheet 1 inch apart. Very slightly flatten cookies with your palm.
Bake until puffy and set, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool completely.
For frosting, in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat cream cheese on medium speed until very smooth. With mixer running, add butter a little at a time, beating constantly. Add powdered sugar, stevia, and vanilla and beat just until smooth.
Use a small offset spatula to spread frosting on top of cookies.
