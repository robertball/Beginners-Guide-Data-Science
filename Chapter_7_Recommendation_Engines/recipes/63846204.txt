Ingredients:
2 tbl spoons olive oil
1 tbl spoon of minced garlic
1 medium/large sweet onion chopped fine
12 pieces bacon cooked/drained/chopped
1/2 cup white wine (I used a pinot grigio)
1 tsp red pepper flakes or to taste
1 box linguine broken into fourths
1 pound of medium size shrimp uncooked
1 pound langostino lobster / or double the shrimp
1 and 1/2 cups of peas or snow peas
1 cup half and half
1 cup basil pesto (from Costco)
1 cup shredded Reggiano Parmesan cheese - don't cheap out, it's worth it!

Directions:
Boil water with a little olive oil and salt. Once boiling, break linguine into fourths and add to water. Cook pasta so it is "al dente" so the pasta is firm and not hard.
In a "large" sauce pan, saute over Med/High heat;  olive oil, sweet onions, garlic, chopped bacon and red pepper flakes. Cook until onions are carmelized to a nice golden brown.(this will take a bit of time 10-15min) Add white wine and mix into onions until absorbed.
Add shrimp, langostino lobster and cook until shrimp turns orange and white (about 2 minutes)
Add the strained linguine to the sauce pan continuing to cook on med heat. Add half and half,peas and pesto basil. Mix all together until all liquid is absorbed into pasta.
Plate up and generously sprinkle the Reggiano Parmesan cheese.
Pour yourself a glass of wine and Enjoy!
