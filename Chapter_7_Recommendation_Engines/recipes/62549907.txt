Ingredients:
1 (3 1/2 to 4 1/2 pound) boneless eye-of-round roast
2 teaspoons garlic salt
2 teaspoons plus 1 tablespoon canola oil
2 teaspoons fresh ground black pepper

Directions:
Sprinkle all sides of the roast evenly with the garlic salt. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 18 to 24 hours.
Adjust oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 225 degrees. Pat the roast dry with paper towels; rub with 2 teaspoons of the oil and sprinkle all sides evenly with the pepper. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a 12 inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Sear the roast until browned on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer the roast to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Roast until a meat probe thermometer (use the kind with a probe and a long wire that can lead out of your oven) inserted into the center of the roast registers 115 degrees for medium-rare, 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 hours, or 125 degrees for medium, 1 /34 to 2 1/4 hours.
Turn oven off; leave the roast in the oven, without opening the door, until the meat-probe thermometer registers 130 degrees for medium-rare, or 140 degrees for medium, 30 to 50 minutes longer. Transfer roast from oven and let rest for 15 minutes.
Slice thin using a meat slicer or carving knife.

Description: 
A fool proof method for making eye-of-round roast for dinner or sandwiches. Costco stopped selling a particular roast beef we liked for sandwiches so I turned to this slow cooked method to make our own.
