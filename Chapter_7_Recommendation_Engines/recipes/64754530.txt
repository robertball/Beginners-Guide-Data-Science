Ingredients:
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 Tbsp orange juice
1 tsp oregano
1 medium white onion, chopped plus more for serving
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, plus more for serving
1/4 cup EVOO
3 Tbsp fresh lime juice
1 lb tilapia, or other white fish
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Whisk garlic, orange juice, oregano, onion, cilantro, lime and  EVOO in small bowl to make marinade. Season fish with salt and pepper.  Place half marinade in glass rectangular dish.  Place fish on top of marinade and pour remaining marinade over fish.  cover and let rest for 30 minutes, turning once.
Heat a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat, adding 1 Tbsp EVOO.  It should be very hot, so a few drops of water immediately scatter and evaporate.  make sure the fish is well coated with marinade, leave the onions, and add to the pan cooking until just opaque in the center, 2 to 3 minutes on the first side then carefully turn and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on the second.  They should be just be ready to flake when touched with a fork.  Coarsely chop fish and serve on tortillas, remaining onions, coleslaw and avocado if you wish. garnish with lime lime wedges.

Description: 
Loving seafood as we do, I'm always on the lookout for new ways to prepare it  and pamper my wife with her favorite food.  This one was a hit with her and it's done on those days when you don't have a lot of time to prepare a meal and you can throw just about any side dish with it to make a full meal.
