Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter, or more as needed
1 large onion, finely chopped
1 (12 ounce) package pork sausage, or more to taste
1 (12 ounce) package spicy pork sausage, or more to taste
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 cups 2% milk, or more to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until softened, about 3 minutes. Crumble pork sausage and spicy pork sausage into onion; cook and stir until sausage is browned and cooked through and onions are tender, 7 to 10 minutes.
Stir flour, salt, and black pepper into sausage mixture, adding additional butter if mixture is too dry, and cook until flour begins to brown, about 5 minutes.
Pour milk into sausage mixture, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil, stirring constantly, adding more milk if mixture is too thick. Reduce heat to low, cover the pot with a lid, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Whether over hot biscuits, chicken fried steak, omelets or mashed potatoes, this country gravy is the best, or so I've been told many times by friends who ask for it when they come to our home.
