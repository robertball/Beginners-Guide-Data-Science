Description: 
I came up with this trying to dress-up canned frosting for chocolate chip cookie sandwiches and was very pleased with the results. There aren't nearly enough recipes that use chocolate hazelnut spread! It's great for frosting cookies or brownies, or frosting and filling cakes. No one will ever guess this started in a can.
