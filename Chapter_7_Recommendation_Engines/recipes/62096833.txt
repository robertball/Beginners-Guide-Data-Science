Ingredients:
3 green bell peppers
2 seedless cucumbers
4 oz pitted kalamata olives
2-3 oz feta cheese
olive oil
balsalmic vinegar
salt and pepper

Directions:
Chop the green pepper and cucumber into medium-size chunks.  (I like to leave the skin on the cucumber for added vitamins!)
Add the olives and crumble the feta cheese over the top.
Add oil and vinegar: once around the bowl with oil, twice with vinegar.  The olives should also provide some lovely nutty rich-flavored oil to bind the dressing.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Mix and serve!

Description: 
If you like your Greek salad flavorful and crunchy, try this!  It's also great for seasons when you just can't get good tomatoes.
