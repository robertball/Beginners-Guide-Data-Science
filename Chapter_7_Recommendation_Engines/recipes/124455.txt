Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)
1/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1/3 cup shortening, melted and cooled
1 egg, beaten
1 1/2 cups warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
7 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add sugar, salt, shortening, egg, milk and 3 cups flour. Stir until mixture has a spongy texture. Let rest for 10 minutes. Mix in enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and divide in thirds. Let rest for 5 minutes. Greased 36 muffin cups. Divide each third of dough into 36 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball, pulling edges under to make a smooth surface. Arrange three balls, smooth side up, in each muffin cup. Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.

Description: 
'THESE DINNER ROLLS were among the many different baked goods that Mother prepared for Thanksgiving. In addition, she would bake many pans full of pecan rolls and cinnamon rolls. It was really difficult to choose which to eat, so one of each seemed to be the only sensible solution to that dilemma!'
