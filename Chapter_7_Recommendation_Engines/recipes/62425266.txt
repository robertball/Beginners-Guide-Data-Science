Ingredients:
6 egg yolks
1 c. sugar
2/3 c. milk
1/2 t. vanilla extract
1 (8 oz) package of cream cheese (softened)
1/4 c. sour cream
1-1/2 c. heavy whipping cream (divided)
1-3/4 c. cold strong brewed coffee
4 T. brandy, rum or spiced rum
4 (3 oz) packages of ladyfingers
2 T. unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
In medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until well blended. Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until mixture boils. Boil gently for 1 minute, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Cover tightly and chill in refrigerator for one hour.
In a separate medium bowl, combine softened cream cheese, sour cream and 2 T. whipping cream. Beat 2 minutes with electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat 1-1/4 c. heavy cream with vanilla until stiff peaks form. Fold in cream cheese mixture and egg mixture until smooth.
In a shallow dish or bowl, combine coffee and liquor.
If using a springform pan, line ladyfingers around the edges (standing up) to form a complete circle.
Gently and very quickly, start dipping ladyfingers in coffee mixture to arrange a single layer on bottom of springform pan or glass dish. (Dip ladyfingers into mixture quickly, or they will absorb too much liquid and fall apart).
Spread one-half mascarpone(egg/cream cheese mixture) evenly over ladyfinger layer. Sift cocoa over mascarpone mixture.
Repeat steps 6 and 7.
Refrigerate 4 hours before serving.
