Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups extra-fine almond flour
5 tablespoons psyllium husk
1 tablespoon stevia sweetener (such as TruviaÂ®)
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
1 cup very hot water
3 egg whites
2 teaspoons cider vinegar
1 teaspoon active dry yeast

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine almond flour, psyllium husk, sweetener, nutritional yeast, salt, and gelatin in a large bowl. Mix completely. Add hot water and mix thoroughly into dry ingredients. Add egg whites and vinegar; mix. Add active yeast and mix dough.
Knead dough until all fluid is absorbed. Allow to sit 10 minutes.
Fill a small bowl with water and keep nearby to moisten fingers and prevent dough from sticking. Form dough into 6 equal parts and shape into desired bun shapes. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake until set, 50 to 60 minutes.
