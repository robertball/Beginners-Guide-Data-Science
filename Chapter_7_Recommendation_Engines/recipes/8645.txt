NA
Ingredients:
¼ cup lemon juice
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
⅓ cup milk
½ cup flaked coconut
⅛ teaspoon ground cardamom
6  very firm bananas, halved lengthwise
3 cups cornflakes cereal
6 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
¾ cup butter, melted
1  kiwi, peeled and sliced for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a food processor or blender blend the lemon juice, condensed milk, milk, coconut and cardamom until smooth. Pour into a large bowl. Put cornflakes in a shallow dish for rolling.
Dip bananas in milk mixture, roll in cornflakes and set aside. Dip chicken pieces in remaining milk mixture and roll in the remaining cornflakes. Place the bananas in one 9 x 13 inch dish. Place the chicken pieces in another 9 x 13 inch dish. Drizzle both the bananas and the chicken with 1/2 cup of the melted butter and bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, for 1 hour.
Remove both dishes from the oven and arrange the bananas over the chicken in one dish. Drizzle with the remaining butter and bake for 15 more minutes or until the chicken juices run clear. Garnish with kiwi and pineapple slices if desired, and serve.
