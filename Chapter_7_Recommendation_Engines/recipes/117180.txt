Ingredients:
1/2 cup sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 (14.5 ounce) cans red tart pitted cherries, drained
1 cup sour cream
1 egg, beaten
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1 (9 inch) unbaked pastry shell
TOPPING:
1/2 cup quick-cooking oats
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup cold butter
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cherries, sour cream, egg and extract; stir well. Spoon into the pastry shell. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes.
For topping, combine the oats, flour, brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in pecans. Sprinkle over filling. Cover edges of crust to prevent overbrowning. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until topping is lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour. Store in the refrigerator.

I created this yummy recipe for a cherry pie contest at the San Diego County Fair when i was first married in 1984. It won the blue ribbon. I love entering contests and am a six-time Pillsbury Bake-Off finalist.
