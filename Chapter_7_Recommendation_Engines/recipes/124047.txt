Ingredients:
2 cups shredded peeled potatoes
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 teaspoon salt, divided
4 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1 cup chopped fully cooked ham
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Combine potatoes, 1/2 cup cheese and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Press into the bottom and up the sides of a greased 9-in. pie plate. In a bowl, beat eggs and milk. Add ham, onion, pepper and remaining cheese and salt; pour over potato crust (dish will be very full). Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand 5 minutes before cutting.

Description: 
After a hectic day of teaching junior high, I often headed to the quiet of my kitchen for peace! Now that I'm retired, cooking has replaced teaching as my first love. I especially like to serve this hearty dish for a relaxing weekend brunch.
