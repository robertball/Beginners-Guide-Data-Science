Ingredients:
For the Creamy Harvest Dressing:
1 (15 ounce) can sweet potatoes or yams in light syrup, drained
1 slice yellow onion, 1/2-inch thick
3/4 cup apple juice
1/2 cup orange juice
1/4 cup red-wine vinegar
1/8 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons chopped, flat-leaf (Italian) parsley
For the salad:
3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, washed, cut in 1 1/2-inch chunks
1 small red onion, finely chopped
3 ribs celery, peeled and finely diced
2 bacon strips, cooked crisp, fat drained and crumbled

Directions:
To make the dressing, puree all of the dressing ingredients, except for the parsley, in a blender or food processor until smooth; stir in the parsley.
Boil the potatoes in a large pot of water until tender, about 15 minutes; drain.  While still hot toss the potatoes, onion, celery and bacon and the dressing prepared before; set aside to cool.

Description: 
Toss together a healthful low-fat potato salad with mouth-watering golden potatoes, onion, celery and bacon. The creamy, yet fat-free dressing is mostly nutrient-rich fruit and veggies, too. In fact, the dressing gets its non-fat creaminess from pureed, vitamin A-rich canned sweet potatoes.
