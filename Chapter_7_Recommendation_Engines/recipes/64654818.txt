Ingredients:
1 cup Arborio rice
1 cup orange juice
2 cups vanilla almond milk, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon orange extract
1/3 cup cream of coconut (like Coco Lopez®)
1 teaspoon orange zest
Garnish with optional toasted coconut and orange sections.

Directions:
Add the rice to the Instant Pot®, stir in orange juice, 1-3/4 cups milk, and salt.  Put the lid on the pot, lock in place, and turn the pressure valve to Sealing.  Select the Manual button, and set the timer for 4 minutes.
When cycle is complete, allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes, then  release any remaining pressure with a quick release; remove the lid.
While pressure is releasing, in a small bowl, whisk the egg, orange extract, and the remaining 1/4 cup of milk, and set aside
Remove the lid, and add 1/2 cup of the hot rice to the egg mixture, stirring constantly. Select Saute, return back to the pot, stir in the cream of coconut and orange zest, and stir briefly, just to be sure the egg is cooked.
Turn off the pressure cooker, stir, and serve warm.
FOOTNOTE:  If you don’t have vanilla almond milk, you may substitute other types of milk, but I’d recommend you then add a little vanilla extract (maybe 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon).  If you want your pudding a little thinner, just stir in a little milk at the end, or if you'd like it thicker, just cook down a bit using the Saute button.
