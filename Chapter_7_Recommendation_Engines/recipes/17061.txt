Ingredients:
4 ounces Camembert cheese
1 egg
1/2 cup fine bread crumbs
3/4 cup sesame seeds
3 cups vegetable oil for frying
2/3 cup raspberry preserves

Directions:
Cut chilled cheese in 6 equal wedges. In a shallow bowl, beat egg.  On a sheet of wax paper, mix bread crumbs and sesame seeds.
Dip each cheese wedge in egg and turn to coat.  Roll cheese in crumb mixture to coat. (If preparing ahead, cover and refrigerate now until ready to cook.)
In a heavy saucepan, heat about 2 inches of oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) or until a 1-inch bread cube turns golden brown on all sides.  Fry cheese until golden. Drain on paper towels.
Melt raspberry preserves for dipping sauce.
