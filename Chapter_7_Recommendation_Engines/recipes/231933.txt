Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups molasses
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
2/3 cup butter, softened
5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 eggs
4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Beat molasses, brown sugar, and butter together in a bowl until smooth. Mix flour, eggs, cinnamon, baking soda, ginger, and salt into molasses mixture until incorporated. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Heavily flour a cloth-covered work surface.
Roll dough on the floured cloth into 1/4-inch thick cookies; cut with cookie cutters if desired. Arrange cookies 1-inch apart on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are firm to the touch, about 8 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
I got this recipe out of one of my mother's cookbooks and tried it one Christmas Eve with her. They were amazing! My brother even loved them, and he is the pickiest person I know. When they were done I threw one to my dog. They are now his favorite treat of all. Hopefully, you will love this recipe as much as we do!
