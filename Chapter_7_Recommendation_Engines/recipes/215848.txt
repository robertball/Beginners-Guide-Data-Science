Ingredients:
1 eggplant, peeled and cut lengthwise into 1/4 inch slices
1 egg, beaten
1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup ricotta cheese
10 slices prosciutto
14 ounces Classico® Tomato and Basil Sauce
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 (8 ounce) package angel hair pasta

Directions:
Dip the eggplant slices in egg, then coat with bread crumbs. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the eggplant on each side until golden brown. Remove to a paper towel lined plate to drain.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese onto each slice of eggplant. Place a slice of prosciutto onto each one. Roll up tightly, and place seam side down in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour pasta sauce over the rolls, and top with shredded mozzarella cheese.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cheese is melted and lightly browned.
While the eggplant rolls are baking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the angel hair pasta, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until tender. Drain. Serve eggplant rolls and sauce over pasta.
