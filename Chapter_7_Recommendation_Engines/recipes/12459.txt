Ingredients:
4 eggs, beaten
2/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups scalded milk
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch single crust pie

Directions:
Combine eggs, sugar, cinnamon or nutmeg, vanilla, and salt. Add scalded milk a little at a time, so that you do not cook the eggs. When all is blended, pour into a 8 or 9 inch unbaked pie shell.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
