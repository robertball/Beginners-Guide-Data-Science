2 cups frozen shredded hash browns, thawed
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup milk

1 tablespoon sriracha sauce, or to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions; spray with cooking spray.
Mix hash browns, eggs, milk, flour, onion, sriracha sauce, garlic, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl to make batter.
Pour 1/4 of the mixture onto the preheated waffle iron; spread to the edges with a spatula. Cook until golden and warmed through, 5 to 7 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
As flavorful as you want to make it, this comes together easily and is wonderful for a lazy Sunday, or make them ahead and freeze them. Pop them in the toaster for a hot and tasty breakfast treat you can eat on the go. Easily scalable recipe, and you can sub cauliflower and/or broccoli for a healthier base ingredient. These freeze well and make for a great grab-and-go breakfast snack that you can eat with your hand--holds together well, and isn't greasy! Microwave will not give you the crispy exterior on reheating.
