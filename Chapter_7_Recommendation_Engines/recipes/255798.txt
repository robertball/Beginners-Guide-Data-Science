Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups rolled oats
1 cup almond butter
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup chia seeds
1/4 cup ground flax seeds
1/4 cup finely shredded unsweetened coconut

Directions:
Combine oats, almond butter, chocolate chips, honey, chia seeds, ground flax seeds, and coconut in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat together, gradually increasing speed, until mixture no longer sticks to the center of the paddle.
Shape mixture into 1-inch balls with your hands. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Freeze balls until firm, about 30 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator.

Description: 
Super healthy and deliciously soft high-fiber snack made with chia seeds, ground flax, unsweetened coconut, and oatmeal. 
Almond butter adds protein. I use raw honey in these.
