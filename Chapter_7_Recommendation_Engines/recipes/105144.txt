1 (6 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
12 ounces skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 3/4-inch cubes

1/4 cup pitted kalamata olives
3 cups hot cooked penne pasta

Directions:
Drain artichokes, reserving marinade. Set aside. In a large skillet heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken and garlic. Cook and stir until chicken is brown. Add the reserved artichoke marinade, broth, wine, and dried oregano.
Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Stir in artichokes, roasted peppers, olives, and fresh oregano. Heat through.
