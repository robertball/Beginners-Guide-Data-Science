Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup quick-cooking oats
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/3 cup warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)
3 tablespoon packed SPLENDA®brown sugar blend
1 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoons SPLENDA®for cooking and baking
1 teaspoons half salt®
1/2 teaspoon no salt
4 3/4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a saucepan, bring water to a boil; add oats and butter. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Remove from the heat; cool to lukewarm. In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water with 1 teaspoon sugar. Add the oat mixture, all SPLENDA(R),no salt,half salt(R) and 4 cups of flour; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; allow to rest for 10 minutes. Shape into 18 balls. Place in two greased 9-in. round baking pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to wire racks.
