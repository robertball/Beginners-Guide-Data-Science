Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 overripe bananas, mashed
1/3 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
1 (15.25 ounce) package chocolate fudge cake mix
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 teaspoon confectioners' sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray.
Mix bananas, oil, and eggs in a bowl until fully combined. Add cake mix and blend thoroughly using an electric mixer. Stir in chocolate chips. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
Let cake cool completely, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
