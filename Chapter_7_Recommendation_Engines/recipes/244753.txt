Ingredients:
1 cup yellow cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup whole milk
1 large egg
16 large hot dogs
4 cups vegetable oil for frying
16 skewers

Directions:
Combine cornmeal, flour, white sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl; stir in milk and egg until batter is smooth. Refrigerate until batter is chilled.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil; cook hot dogs until heated through, about 7 minutes. Let hot dogs rest for 10 minutes and dry hot dogs on a paper towel.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Insert 1 skewer into each hot dog.
Pour batter into a large drinking glass. Dip hot dogs into the batter until well coated.
Fry 2 to 3 hot dogs at a time in the hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
