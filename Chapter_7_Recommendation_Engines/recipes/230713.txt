1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1/4 cup applesauce
3/4 cup So Delicious® Dairy Free Unsweetened Coconutmilk Beverage
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a medium sized bowl mix together the flour, salt, and baking powder.
In a separate, larger bowl mix together the maple syrup, apple sauce, non-dairy milk, and vanilla.
Once the wet ingredients are well incorporated, add the dry ingredients and mix well until combined.
Cook according to your waffle iron's directions. We cooked ours on medium heat for about 5 minutes.
