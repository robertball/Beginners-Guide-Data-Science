Eggplant and Tomato Pizza Recipe

Ingredients:
1 teaspoon basil
Pizza dough (I make mine in the bread machine, add the teaspoon of basil in here.)
2 cups shredded mozzarella
1 eggplant (I will usually use about 1/2 to 3/4 of it and save the rest for something else)
1 tomato
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons olive oil.

Directions:
Skin and cut eggplant into small bite-sized pieces, place in a pan, then coat in one tablespoon of olive oil and the garlic powder. Broil for about 3 - 5 minutes (watch it closely). Take it out of the broiler.
Dice up your tomato and mix it with the eggplant. Put the dish back in the broiler for another 3 - 5 minutes, again being careful not to burn. You want the eggplant to be soft with a little bit of golden brown color. The time to achieve this will vary based on your broiler. Take out and set aside.
Get a pizza pan (you can even use a cookie sheet) and coat with the remaining olive oil. Spread your dough to fit this sheet, use more dough for thick crust, less for thin.
On top of the dough, sprinkle one cup of cheese, the eggplant/tomato mixture, and then top with the remaining cup of cheese.
Bake at 450 degrees for 15 - 20 minutes, until the cheese starts getting a nice golden brown tone.

Description: 
I would have never thought about putting eggplant on a pizza, but one day I had an extra one laying around and figured it wouldn't hurt to try! This is now a personal favorite. Great way to get your kids to eat some vegetables too.
