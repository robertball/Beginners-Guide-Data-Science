Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup cake flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
FROSTING:
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
2 tablespoons light cream
1 cup shredded coconut

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs, sugar and vanilla on high until thick and lemon-colored, about 4 minutes. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; add to egg mixture. Beat on low just until combined. Heat milk and butter in a small saucepan until butter melts. Add to batter; beat thoroughly (the batter will be thin). Pour into a greased 9-in. square baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until cake tests done. Cool slightly. For frosting, blend all ingredients well; spread over warm cake. Broil about 4 in. from the heat for 3-4 minutes or until the top is lightly browned.

Description: 
We always called this Mama's 'never fail' recipe. I guess the same holds true for me, since I've entered this cake in contests and won with it. This tasty dessert is popular in our family, and it always brings back fond memories of Mama.
