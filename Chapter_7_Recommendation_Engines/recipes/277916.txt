Ingredients:
Cake:
2 cups fresh blueberries
1 1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup almond flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
3 large eggs, at room temperature
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup lemon curd
2 teaspoons lemon zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Glaze:
2 1/2 cups powdered sugar
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon fresh blueberries, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).
Pat blueberries dry and place into a plastic bag. Toss with 1 1/2 teaspoons flour until all berries are dusted. Set aside.
Combine 2 1/2 cups flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl; stir with a fork until well blended.
Combine sugar and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer. Cream together on high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Reduce speed to low; add eggs, 1 at a time, beating after each addition and scraping the bowl as needed.
Mix in about 1/3 of the flour mixture, followed by 1/2 of the buttermilk, beating after each addition. Repeat, ending with the final 1/3 of the flour mixture. Add lemon curd, lemon zest, and vanilla extract; beat until just combined. Turn off the mixer and fold in blueberries.
Pour batter into the prepared pan, cleaning the mixer bowl and beater with a scraper. Tap the tube pan lightly to remove any pockets of air.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes. Allow the cake to cool completely in the pan on a wire rack, about 30 minutes. Turn out onto a decorative plate.
Stir powdered sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and salt together in a microwave-safe glass bowl for the glaze. Place butter on top of the glaze and microwave until the mixture bubbles and the butter is melted, about 1 minute. Whisk until smooth. Allow glaze to cool for about 15 minutes; pour over cake. Garnish with blueberries, if desired.
