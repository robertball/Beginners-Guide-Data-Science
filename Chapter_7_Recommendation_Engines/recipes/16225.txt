Description: 
After dining at a cafe in Michigan about 10 years ago, I tried duplicating this scrumptious twist on Chicken Salad at home.  The cherries can be ordered on-line these days, which makes it much easier for those of us living where cherries are not readily available.  Regular milk can be substituted for buttermilk, if necessary.
