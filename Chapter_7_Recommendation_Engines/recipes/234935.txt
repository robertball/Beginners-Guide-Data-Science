Ingredients:
1 (4 ounce) package IdahoanÂ® Bacon & Cheddar Chipotle Flavored Mashed Potatoes
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 pound ground turkey (or ground beef)
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with chiles
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies
1 cup corn, canned or frozen
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced olives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 9x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Prepare mashed potatoes following package directions. Set aside.
Heat oil in large saute pan over medium high heat. Add onions and cook until translucent, about 10 minutes.
Stir in garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper and cook until aromatic - about 1 minute.
Add ground turkey and cook until browned.
Stir in tomatoes with juice, green chiles, corn (drained if using canned), and olives. Heat through.
Place meat mixture into the prepared baking dish. Top with a layer of mashed potatoes.
Bake for 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
Great as it is, but also delicious served with a dollop of sour cream, salsa or hot sauce.
