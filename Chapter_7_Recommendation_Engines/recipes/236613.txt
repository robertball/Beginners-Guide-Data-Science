Description: 
I came up with this recipe one random day when I craving a light southwest meal. It is simple and healthy! Mix and match vegetables to optimize to your taste. It is quite easy to overfill the quesadillas, making them a disaster to flip.  Fill according to tortilla size and flip carefully or use a quesadilla maker.
