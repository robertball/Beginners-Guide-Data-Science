Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
2 (9 ounce) bags fresh spinach
1/4 cup sliced kalamata olives
2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese
1/2 teaspoon grated lemon rind
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
1 pound tilapia fillets
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 pinch paprika, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add spinach to skillet; cook and stir until spinach is wilted and cooked down, 5 more minutes. Stir olives, feta cheese, lemon rind, salt, oregano, and white pepper into spinach. Cook until feta cheese has melted and flavors have blended, about 5 more minutes.
Spread spinach mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange tilapia fillets over spinach mixture. Mix butter and lemon juice in a small bowl and drizzle over fish; sprinkle with paprika.
Bake fish in the preheated oven until the flesh is opaque and flakes easily, 20 to 25 minutes.
