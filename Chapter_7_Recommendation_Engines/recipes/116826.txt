Ingredients:
1 (8 pound) fully-cooked, bone-in ham
1 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons maple syrup
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1/2 cup sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup cold water
1 (16.5 ounce) can pitted dark sweet cherries
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Place ham in a roasting pan. Score surface of ham with shallow diagonal cuts, making diamond shapes. Combine the brown sugar, syrup and mustard; rub over ham and press into cuts. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F for 1-3/4 to 2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 140 degrees F and ham is heated through.
For cherry sauce, in a saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch and water until smooth. Add cherries. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat; stir in lemon juice and extract. Serve with ham.
