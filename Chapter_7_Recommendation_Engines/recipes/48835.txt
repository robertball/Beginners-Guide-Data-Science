Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped green pepper
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated flaky biscuits
3 tomatoes, thinly sliced
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup low-fat mayonnaise
1 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon salt-free garlic and herb seasoning blend

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.
Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Place celery, onion, and green pepper into the skillet, and saute until tender.
Press biscuits into the prepared baking dish to form a crust. Layer with the tomatoes. Top with the sauteed vegetables.
In a medium bowl, mix Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, and salt-free seasoning blend. Spread evenly over the vegetables.
Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly browned. Cool 15 to 20 minutes before serving.
