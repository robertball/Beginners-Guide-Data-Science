Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1/2 pound ground turkey breast
1 cup chopped cabbage
1/2 cup shredded carrots
2 green onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon chile paste
1 tablespoon white wine
1 teaspoon cornstarch
14 sheets phyllo dough
4 teaspoons vegetable oil
3/4 cup sweet and sour sauce

Directions:
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Cook turkey, cabbage, carrot and onions in oil about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until turkey is no longer pink and vegetables are crisp-tender.  Stir in chili paste.  Mix wine and cornstarch; stir into turkey mixture.  Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened.
Heat oven to 375 degreesF.  Cut stack of phyllo sheets crosswise in half.  Cover with waxed paper, then with damp towel to prevent them from drying out.  Place 1 half-sheet of phyllo on flat surface.  Brush with small amount of oil.  Top with second half-sheet of phyllo.  Place about 2 tablespoons turkey mixture on short end of phyllo; shape mixture into about 4-inch log.  Roll up phyllo and turkey mixture.  Twist phyllo 1 inch from each end to make firecracker shape.  Place on ungreased cookie sheet.  Repeat with remaining phyllo and turkey mixture.
Brush firecrackers with remaining oil.  Bake 18 to 22 minutes or until phyllo is crisp and golden brown.  Serve with sweet-and-sour sauce.
