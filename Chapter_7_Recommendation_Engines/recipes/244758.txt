Ingredients:
3 tablespoons canola oil
1 small onion, diced
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
3 cloves garlic, or to taste, minced
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
1 pound ground chicken
5 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 (8 ounce) can baby corn, drained and chopped
1 (4 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained and finely chopped
1 cup chopped sugar snap peas
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 heads Boston lettuce, leaves separated

Directions:
Heat canola oil in a large wok or skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, mushrooms, garlic, and ginger for 2 minutes. Add ground chicken; cook and stir, breaking chicken into smaller pieces, until chicken is no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
Pour soy sauce and vinegar over chicken mixture and stir. Add corn and water chestnuts to chicken mixture; cover and cook for 4 minutes. Add snap peas; cover and cook for 2 minutes. Stir sesame oil into chicken mixture.
Scoop about 1/4 cup chicken mixture into each lettuce leaf. Fold leaf around the filling.

Description: 
These are even better (and, I'm convinced, WAY healthier) than the popular restaurant chain best-known for their lettuce wraps. These wraps are gluten-free, as long as you use GF/wheat-free soy sauce/tamari.
