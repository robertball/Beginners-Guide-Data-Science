Ingredients:
2 large potatoes (approx. 3 cups)
1 Cup Rice Flour
2 Eggs
Â½ cup milk
1 tsp salt
2 tsp pepper
2 to 3 TBSP vegetable oil for pan frying
Chopped green onion for garnish

Directions:
Using a box grater, grate the potatoes into a large bowl. Add the eggs and milk and season with salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients until well blended. Add the rice flour in batches, blending after each addition until the mixture is the consistency of pancake batter. Let the mixture rest for a few minutes. Heat a cast iron skillet and add the oil. When hot, add the potato mixture by spoonfuls and spread it out to create the size latke you prefer. Let the latke fry in the hot oil for two to three minutes until set and browned, then carefully flip and continuing cooking until golden brown and cooked through. Garnish with chopped green onion.
