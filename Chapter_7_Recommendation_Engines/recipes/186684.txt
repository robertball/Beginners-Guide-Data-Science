Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups white whole wheat flour
1/4 cup wheat germ
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups skim milk
1/4 cup margarine, melted
2 eggs, beaten
3 tablespoons demerara sugar
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
cooking spray

Directions:
Combine flour, wheat germ, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Set bowl aside. In a separate bowl, whisk together the skim milk, melted margarine, eggs, and sugar. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients; stir in the wet ingredients, being careful not to over mix the batter. Gently fold in the chocolate chips.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until golden brown on the other side.

Description: 
I made these in my dorm on Friday mornings to kick off the weekend- most of them were eaten straight out of the pan by the line of friends drawn by the scent of melting chocolate! Serve with maple syrup or sliced strawberries.
