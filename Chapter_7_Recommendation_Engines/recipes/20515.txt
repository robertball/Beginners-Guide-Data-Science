Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon almond extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups finely chopped almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and 1/2 cup sugar until smooth. Stir in 1 egg and almond extract. Combine the salt and flour; stir into the sugar mixture with your hands until a smooth dough forms. Roll dough into log shaped pieces about 1/2 inch thick and 2 to 3 inches long. Dip each piece in the beaten eggs, then in remaining 1/2 cup sugar and then roll them in almonds. Place them 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
