Ingredients:
8 (4 ounce) Boneless pork loin chops
1 large clove of garlic, minced
1 tsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped
2 C sweet potato chips (any type of potato chips can be used)
2 egg whites
1/4 C heavy cream
1/2 C mango, chopped
1/2 C pineapple, chopped
2 shallots, diced
1/4 C cilantro, chopped
Juice of 1 lime
Pinch of salt

Directions:
Put potato chips in a food processor and grind them until they are coarsely ground, not too much. Add crumbs to a bowl and incorporate with minced garlic and chopped rosemary.
In a separate bowl, Use a fork to  whip egg whites and heavy cream until combined.
Dip each pork chop into the egg mixture, and then into the crumb mixture, fully coating the chop with a thick crust. Then, arrange them in an oiled glass baking dish and bake at 350 F for 35 minutes, turning chops halfway through.
In another bowl, combine mango, pineapple, shallots, cilantro, lime juice and salt to make a chunky salsa. Serve on top of finished pork chops.
