Ingredients:
12 oz.bag of fresh cranberries
2 large apples, peeled and diced (I used Shizukas)
1 cup water
1/2 cup lemonade concentrate (not diluted)
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place cranberries, apples, lemonade concentrate, water and sugar in a large saucepan. You will want to use a large as the mixture will boil up.
Bring to a boil on medium-high heat stirring every few minutes and then bring the heat down to medium-low while stirring occasionally.
Add salt and ginger and simmer for 20 minutes.
Chill in fridge and it will thicken as it cools.

Description: 
I wanted a brighter tasting cranberry sauce instead of one that had just a sweet note of sugar. Using lemonade concentrate made it easy and the ginger was perfect with the tart cranberries.
