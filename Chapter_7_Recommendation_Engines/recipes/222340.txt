Ingredients:
1 whole smoked goose
3 cups water
½ cup red wine
1  whole star anise
¼ cup aged balsamic vinegar
¼ cup blackberry jam
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste
2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:

Description: 
I used half the wings to make a basic reduction sauce and the subtle smokiness worked wonderfully with the red wine, balsamic vinegar, and blackberry notes. The sauce is certainly optional, as this could be served plain with just some cranberry sauce on the side. I hope you're able to give this very easy-to-prepare, gorgeous roast goose a try.
