Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce
2 (8 ounce) cans crushed pineapple, drained and squeezed dry
2 tablespoons brown sugar replacement (such as SplendaÂ® Brown Sugar Blend)
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
3 green onions, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, seeds and ribs removed, minced

Directions:
Stir cranberry sauce, pineapple, brown sugar replacement, ground ginger, and sea salt together in a small saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes.
Stir green onion and jalapeno pepper into the cranberry sauce mixture; transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
Chill sauce in refrigerator until cold, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
This goes together in minutes and is actually better if prepared the day before you serve. It is great with chicken, turkey, and pork. I use this with grilled herb pork tenderloin served on cornmeal biscuits for special appetizer occasions. Garnish with additional chopped green onions, if desired. If you want more heat in the chutney, keep some of the jalapeno seeds and ribs as you chop.
