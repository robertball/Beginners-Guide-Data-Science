Ingredients:
24 ozs cottage cheese
2/3 cup parmesan cheese
1 1/2-2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 tsp basil
1 tsp oregano
1/2 tsp parsley
1 tsp garlic powder
1 large egg
3 cups spinach (wilted)
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 cup sautéed mushrooms
Easy Pizza Sauce I   by: Frank Sweterlitsch
1 pkg cooked lasagna noodles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.   I made Frank Sweterlitsch‘s Easy Pizza Sauce recipe (from Allrecipes) the day before. Cook lasagna noodles as directed on the package. While noodles are cooking, mix the cottage cheese, parmesan cheese, 1-1 1/2 cups shredded cheese, basil, oregano, parsley, garlic powder, & egg. Wilt spinach in a skillet with 1Tbsp olive oil. Then sauté mushrooms in 1Tbsp olive oil. Chop spinach and mushrooms and add to cottage cheese mixture.  Drain and rinse noodles until cool enough to handle. Lay out noodles on a flat service. Spread a heaping tablespoon of the cottage cheese mixture onto each noodle. Drizzle a heaping teaspoon of the pizza sauce over the cottage cheese mixture and roll each noodle up. Place in casserole style baking dish. Drizzle the tops of each roll with left over pizza sauce and sprinkle approximately 1/2 cup shredded cheese on top. Bake in oven for 25 minutes.
