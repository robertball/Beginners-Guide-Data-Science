Ingredients:
1/2 cup uncooked quinoa
1 cup water
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
3/4 cup chopped broccoli
1 clove garlic, minced, or to taste
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
2 teaspoons coarse-grain mustard
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring the quinoa and water to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, and the water has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes.
Scrape the cooked quinoa into a mixing bowl. Add the garbanzo beans, broccoli, garlic, lemon juice, tarragon, mustard, and olive oil. Stir until evenly mixed. Season to taste with salt and black pepper before serving.

Description: 
This dish is a meal in itself-- it contains a good fat (olive oil), green vegetables (broccoli), a whole grain (quinoa), and a protein source (garbanzo beans)! It's also vegan. I usually have this for breakfast or lunch.
