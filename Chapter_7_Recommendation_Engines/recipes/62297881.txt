Ingredients:
2 cups of water
1 tsp minced garlic clove
2oz butter
1 1/2 tsp salt
3oz Quaker Cooked Grits, NOT INSTANT
1oz heavy cream
1 3oz asiago cheese, grated
4oz sauteed "wild" mushrooms in butter or olive oil

Directions:
Saute mushrooms in fry pan and set aside. Use a nonstick pot, you don't want the grits to stick. Bring water, garlic, butter and salt to a boil. Whisk in the grits stirring often. Allow the grits to come back to a boil then reduce heat to medium low, keep stirring. They will stick if not stirred. Stir in heavy cream and mushrooms the mixture will thicken. If too thick add water to your preference. Turn off stove and add cheese and stir.

Description: 
From Down South grits. It's just like old fashion grits BUT better! The mushrooms and cheese....aw the cheese. Guess you can use any kind of cheese but the asiago is the best.Goes great with eggs and homemade biscuits. Got this recipe from a friend and my hubby asks for it all the time.
