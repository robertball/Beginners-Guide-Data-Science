Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
2 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees), divided
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon butter or margarine, melted
1 tablespoon poppy seeds

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in 1 cup warm water. In a large bowl, combine flour, salt and sugar. Add the yeast mixture and remaining water; stir until combined. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Stir dough down. Divide in half. Place each half in a greased 1-qt. round casserole or ovenproof bowl. Brush tops with butter and sprinkle with poppy seeds. Let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. Remove from pans; serve warm if desired.
