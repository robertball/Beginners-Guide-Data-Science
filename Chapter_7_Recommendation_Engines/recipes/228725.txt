Ingredients:
4 cups cubed potatoes
6 slices bacon
1 cup diced celery
3 green onions, diced
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup vinegar
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring potatoes to a boil in a large pot of salted water. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain; transfer potatoes to a large baking dish.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels; crumble and sprinkle over potatoes.
Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir celery and green onion until celery is tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to baking dish.
Whisk mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, mustard, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until smooth. Pour mixture over potatoes and stir until well mixed. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted, 20 to 35 minutes.

Description: 
Passed down from my German/Dutch Grandmother. A hot potato salad with bacon, cheese and a creamy/vinegar sauce makes this a wonderful dish to serve with bratwurst on a cold fall day in Deutschland or wherever you might be. I usually double the bacon and sauce to make this extra flavorful.
