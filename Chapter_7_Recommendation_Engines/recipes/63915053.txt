Ingredients:
6 sweet potatoes
olive oil
2 large sweet onion, diced
1 tablespoon brown sugar (optional)
6 cups fresh spinach, chopped
button mushrooms chopped (a grocers small bin)
salt and pepper to taste
1 lb bacon bits cooked
6 slices havarti, swiss or cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Clean the sweet potatoes and bake them for 40 - 90 minutes, until tender.
While sweet potatoes are cooking, slice bacon into 1/4" slices and fry in a skillet over medium-high heat. Next slice the onions. When bacon is done, remove bacon and set aside. Turn heat down to medium or medium-low, drizzle 1 tsp olive oil into skillet and slowly caramelize the onions (20-30 minutes).
While onions are caramelizing, chop the spinach and the mushrooms. Once onions are done, put them in a dish and set aside. Sautee mushrooms then finally wilt spinach in skillet.
Remove sweet potatoes from the oven, allow to cool slightly, then slice in half. Scoop the center of each sweet potato out of the skin and place it in a large bowl and mash the sweet potato with a fork. Stir in the bacon, spinach, onions, & mushrooms. Spoon the sweet potato mixture into the center of each sweet potato boat. sprinkle with brown sugar if desired and salt and pepper to taste. Slice the cheese in half and place a half-slice of the cheese on top of each potato.
Turn oven up to broil. Slide the stuffed potatoes into the oven. Bake for 2 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
Serve with spoons, forks, or sporks and enjoy!
