Description: 
Starts out sweet, comes back with some heat. You will feel this one on your tongue, not your lips. This recipe started as a simple vinegar based BBQ sauce, but as I got into it I realized I wanted some heat and sweet too. Makes a good marinade with 1/2 the sugar and the addition of 1/3 cup oil.
