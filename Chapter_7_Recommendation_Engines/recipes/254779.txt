Ingredients:
2 pounds russet potatoes
8 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
1 sprig fresh rosemary
1 sprig fresh thyme
1/4 cup olive oil
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes, garlic, rosemary, and thyme in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Cook, covered, until potatoes are easily pierced with a knife, about 30 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking water.
Transfer boiled potatoes and garlic to a bowl; discard rosemary and thyme. Add olive oil, salt, and pepper. Mash with a potato masher, adding cooking water to reach desired consistency.
