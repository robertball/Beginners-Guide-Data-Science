Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 medium onion, chopped
3 tablespoons green curry paste
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 cup water
1 medium sweet potato, peeled and cubed
1 medium eggplant, sliced
2 red Thai chile peppers, diced
6 kaffir lime leaves
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons fish sauce
2 teaspoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons lime zest
1/2 cup chopped cilantro, or to taste
1/2 cup chopped Thai basil, or to taste

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in onion and curry paste until fragrant and onions begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Add coconut milk and water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until liquid begins to thicken, about 5 minutes.
Mix in sweet potato and cook until softened, about 6 minutes more. Add eggplant, Thai chile peppers, and kaffir lime leaves. Cook and stir until vegetables are very tender, about 10 minutes.
Stir in lime juice, fish sauce, brown sugar, and lime zest. Mix thoroughly to combine and heat through, about 5 minutes more. Sprinkle with cilantro and Thai basil.
