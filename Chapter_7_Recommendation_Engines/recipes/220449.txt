Ingredients:
2 cups half-and-half
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup Irish cream liqueur

Directions:
Beat together half-and-half, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until the sugars have dissolved.
Stir heavy cream and vanilla extract into the mixture until smooth.
Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.
About 2 minutes before the end of freezing time, pour Irish cream liqueur into the ice cream maker; allow the machine to finish freezing the ice cream.
Transfer ice cream into a freezer-proof container with a tight lid and place in freezer until ice cream is hardened, at least 4 hours.

Description: 
I LOVE Irish cream ice cream, so when I got my own ice cream maker I went looking for a recipe to duplicate it. To my horror after an extensive search of the internet I could only fine one, and it was WAY to large for my 2-quart maker. So I came up with one of my own. The result was a surprisingly good substitute for the expensive brand! Because of the liqueur it takes a bit longer to harden than the recipes without liqueur, but the wait is worth it!
