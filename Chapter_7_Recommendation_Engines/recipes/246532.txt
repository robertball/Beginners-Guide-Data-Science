Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups milk, divided
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3 tablespoons sour cream
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chiles (such as RotelÂ®), drained slightly
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin, or more to taste
1 teaspoon paprika, or more to taste
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in flour to form a thick paste. Whisk in 3/4 cup milk; cook and stir until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes.
Stir Cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream into milk mixture until smooth, about 1 minute. Add remaining milk, diced tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, and paprika; cook and stir until thickened to sauce consistency, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Not happy with any at-home recipes for nacho sauce, I made up my own! A thick, creamy nacho cheese sauce that you will swear came out of a jar. Cheesy, subtly spicy, and bursting with nacho flavor--it rivals any store-bought nacho cheese sauce. Just be sure to save some aside for yourself! Serve warm immediately over or with tortilla chips, on tacos or burritos, or as any other dip.
