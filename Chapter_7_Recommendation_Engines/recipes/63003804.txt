Ingredients:
3 cups beef broth
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon onion salt
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 bay leaf
3 (.7 ounce) package dry Italian-style salad dressing mix
1 (2.5 pound) chuck roast

Directions:
Combine water with salt, ground black pepper, oregano, basil, onion salt, parsley, garlic powder, bay leaf, and salad dressing mix in a saucepan.
Stir well, and bring to a boil.
Place roast in slow cooker, pour salad dressing mixture over meat.
Cover, cook on Low for 10-12 hours, or on High for 4 to 5 hours.
When done, remove bay leaf, and shred meat with a fork.
After I shredded the meat, I stuck the meat back in my crockpot, added another salad dressing packet and let it sit for another two hours.
