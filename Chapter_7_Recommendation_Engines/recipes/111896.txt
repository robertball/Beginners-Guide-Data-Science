Ingredients:
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon chile powder
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 pound venison, cut into 1/2-inch strips
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
Seasoned salt (or Cajun seasoning) and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Stir together the lime juice, soy sauce, minced chipotle, and 1 tablespoon olive oil; stir in chile powder, paprika, cumin, and garlic. Toss venison strips until well coated with marinade, set aside, and marinate for 20 minutes.
Drain venison strips in a colander, pressing out any excess liquid. Place the flour in a plastic bag, season to taste with seasoned salt and pepper. Toss venison strips with the flour until each piece is coated.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Shake excess flour from the venison strips, and cook until well browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.

Description: 
Thin strips of steak are marinated in a lime and chipotle chili sauce, breaded and then fried in oil.   I made this recipe to take the gamey flavor out of venison steaks, but it works great for any type of steaks or even for homemade chicken strips.
