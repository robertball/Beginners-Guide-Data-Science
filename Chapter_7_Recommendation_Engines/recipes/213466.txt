Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
4 boneless pork chops
5 calabaza squash, halved and sliced 1/2-inch thick
1 cup whole kernel corn, drained
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped tomatoes
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 cups chicken stock, or more as needed

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook pork chops until no longer pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. Cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Cut the pork into bite-sized cubes.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the saucepan. Add cubed pork, calabaza squash, corn, onion, tomatoes, and garlic and cook until onion is transparent, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, cumin, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Pour in chicken stock and simmer, covered, until flavors are combined, about 2 hours. Stir occasionally and check periodically to see if more chicken stock is needed.

Description: 
Calabacita is a classic Tex-Mex dish that is slightly different everywhere you find it. This is my grandmother's version, which I think is the best! Serve with hot corn tortillas.
