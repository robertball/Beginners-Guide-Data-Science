Description: 
One of Tricia Moore's favorite desserts comes together as quick as 1..2..3. It's made with only three ingredients that I always have on hand-ice cream, honey and nuts, she explains from her Somersworth, New Hampshire home.    Feel free to vary the measurements and use as much of each ingredient as you like. You could sprinkle on walnuts instead of almonds, she hints. And adding pecans will make you think you're eating pralines.    This is such a pretty way to dress up a scoop of ice cream, Tricia concludes. It's a refreshing finishing touch.
