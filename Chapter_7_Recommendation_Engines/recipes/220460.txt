Ingredients:
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 (3 pound) corned beef brisket (with spice packet), excess fat trimmed and meat cut into 1-inch cubes
1/3 cup olive oil
1 1/2 pounds red potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 cups peeled and cubed parsnips
2 cups peeled and cubed carrots
1 extra large onion, cut into chunks
1 1/2 cups water
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Irish stout beer
1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth
1 head cabbage, cored and coarsely chopped
1/4 cup distilled white vinegar

Directions:
Place flour into a large bowl; toss corned beef cubes in flour to coat.
Heat olive oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium heat and brown corned beef cubes on all sides, about 10 minutes.
Sprinkle the spice packet from the corned beef over the meat; mix in potatoes, parsnips, carrots, onion, water, stout beer, beef broth, and any unused flour; stir to combine. Bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to low and simmer until corned beef is very tender and the stew has thickened, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
Mix cabbage into the stew and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in vinegar.
