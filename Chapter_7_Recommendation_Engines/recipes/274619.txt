2 teaspoons Sriracha sauce, or more to taste
1 (4 ounce) beef top sirloin, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

Cook ramen in a saucepan according to package directions, adding mushrooms, edamame, soy sauce, and sriracha in the last 2 minutes of cooking. Add steak in the last minute of cooking. Top servings with cilantro and, if desired, additional Sriracha sauce.

Description: 
Partially freeze the steak to make it a breeze to slice thinly. It'll need just a minute or two in boiling water for medium-rare.
