Ingredients:
1 medium green pepper, julienned
1 medium sweet red pepper, julienned
2 medium zucchini, julienned
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
2 teaspoons soy sauce

Directions:
Place the vegetables on a double layer of heavy-duty foil (about 18 in. x 15 in.). Dot with butter; drizzle with soy sauce. Fold foil around vegetables and seal tightly. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 10-15 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender.

Description: 
'This versatile side dish is so simple and quick that I had to share it,' says Karen Anderson, Fair Oaks, California. Grilling the colorful veggies in a foil packet means one less dish to wash, but Karen often stir-fries the mixture on the stovetop instead.
