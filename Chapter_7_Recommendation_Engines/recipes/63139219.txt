Ingredients:
2 ½ lbs chicken breast tenderloins
1 T olive oil
2 T butter
½ cup unsalted chicken broth, water, or white wine
1 T flour
½ cup Half-n-Half, milk or broth
2 tsp Paprika
Dash of Salt and Pepper to taste
Onion and Garlic to taste
½ cup Sour Cream
Egg Noodles, Dumplings or Spaetzle

Directions:
Add the olive oil to skillet and load the bottom of your skillet pan with tenderloins.
Lightly brown the tenderloins in olive oil and add seasonings to taste. I like to use garlic, onions, seasoned salt, and freshly ground black pepper.
Add the broth to the pan while stirring. Simmer for a few minutes to reduce the broth and finish cooking the chicken. Remove chicken and any remaining broth from the pan and keep warm.
Whisk melted butter and flour together; add to the broth.
Slowly add Half-n-Half, milk or broth to make a nice gravy. Adjust the amount and thickness to your taste and the amount of chicken you made.
Add paprika and simmer on low heat until your gravy has a nice rich color. Adjust the amount of paprika to taste. You can choose sweet or Hungarian paprika, depending on your family's preference.
Remove from heat and slowly stir in sour cream, be careful avoid curdling. Return the chicken to the gravy and serve with egg noodles, dumplings, or spaetzle.
