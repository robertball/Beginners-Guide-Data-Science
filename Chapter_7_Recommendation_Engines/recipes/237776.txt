Description: 
A smoky update on the classic baked macaroni and cheese. This would also work with kielbasa as the meat and cooked peas or sauteed spinach (with garlic) as the vegetable. Don't substitute any other cheese for the smoked Gouda. You can sub Ementaller or imported Swiss (Jarlsberg would be great) for the Gruyere. Don't add salt to the sauce. Serve with garlic bread and a side salad.
