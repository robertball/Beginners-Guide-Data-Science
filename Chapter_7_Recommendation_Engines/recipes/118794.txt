Ingredients:
1 pound sweet onions
3 egg whites
1 cup dry bread crumbs
2 teaspoons dried thyme
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Cut onions into 1/2-in. slices; separate into rings and place in a bowl. Cover with ice water; soak for 30 minutes. Drain.
In a small mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy. In another bowl, combine the bread crumbs, thyme, salt, paprika and pepper. Divide the crumb mixture among three large resealable plastic bags. Dip a third of the onions in the egg whites; add a few rings at a time to crumb mixture and shake to coat. Place on a baking sheet coated with nonstick cooking spray.
Repeat with remaining onions and crumb mixture. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes or until lightly browned and crisp.
