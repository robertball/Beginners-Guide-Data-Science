Ingredients:
3/4 cup unsweetened pineapple juice
1/3 cup dry red wine or beef broth
1/4 cup reduced sodium teriyaki sauce
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 pounds boneless beef top round steak (1 1/2 inches thick)

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first seven ingredients; mix well. Pour 3/4 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add the steak. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade.
Before starting the grill, spray grill rack with nonstick cooking spray. Drain and discard marinade from steak. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 10-12 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Baste with reserved marinade during the last 5 minutes of cooking.

Description: 
I took over the cooking when I retired, much to my wife's delight. Here's a marinade that's foolproof--I just dump all the ingredients into a container...and the steak comes out great every time!                                  --Gordon Richardson of Spring Hill, Florida
