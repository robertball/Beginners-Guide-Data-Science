Description: 
I like to serve the pesto over butter gnocchi with an extra sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Gnocchi are light little Italian potato dumplings, which are available in Italian grocery stores and cook up in mere minutes. The pesto is also delicious tossed with penne or other types of pasta.  --Sue A. Jurack
