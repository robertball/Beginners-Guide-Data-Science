Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (12 ounce) bag fresh or frozen cranberries
1 1/2 cups cake flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup sour cream

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9 inch springform pan. Wrap aluminum foil around the outside of the bottom to prevent leaking.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in 1 1/2 cups of white sugar, water and cinnamon until sugar has dissolved. Bring to a boil and then add the cranberries. Stir to coat with the sauce, then pour into the prepared pan.
Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside. In a medium bowl, beat the remaining 6 tablespoons of butter with 1/2 cup white sugar and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Mix in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla and sour cream. Mix in the dry ingredients. Pour the batter over the cranberries in the pan.
Bake for about 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 10 minutes, then run a knife around the outer edge. Invert onto a serving plate and remove the springform pan.
