Description: 
These sauces can be made in minutes as the cooked steaks rest. To make the sauce ahead, leave out the butter or cream. Reheat just before serving, adding water if the sauce has reduced too much, then whisk in the butter or cream. This amount is enough for four steaks, but the formulas can be recalculated if you're serving more guests.
