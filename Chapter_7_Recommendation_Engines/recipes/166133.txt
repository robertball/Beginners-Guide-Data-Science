Ingredients:
1 gallon water
1 (15 ounce) package dried purple corn (maiz morado)
2 cinnamon sticks
1 tablespoon whole cloves
5 large lemons, juiced
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup fresh pineapple, chopped
1/2 apple, chopped

Directions:
Bring the water to a boil with the corn, cinnamon sticks, and cloves in a large pot. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 40 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain through a mesh strainer to remove the corn and spices. Stir the lemon juice and sugar into the chicha until the sugar has dissolved. Refrigerate until cold.
Stir in the chopped pineapple and apple before serving over ice.
