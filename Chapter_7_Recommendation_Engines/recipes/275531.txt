https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic, peeled and halved
18 plum tomatoes, or more to taste - cored, seeded, and chopped
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/8 cup chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and brown for 3 to 4 minutes. Add tomatoes, salt, and sugar; cook for 15 minutes.
Place a large bowl on a work surface. Insert a colander inside the bowl. Place cooked tomatoes in the colander to drain, saving excess liquid. Transfer tomatoes to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until blended to the desired consistency. Return tomatoes to the saucepan. Add basil and cook for 20 to 30 minutes more, adding some of the reserved tomato liquid if the sauce is too thick.

Description: 
This is the closest recipe I've found to the deliciously simple tomato sauces I've tried in Italy. Since in the States our tomatoes aren't sweetened by rich, volcanic soil, a little bit of sugar helps make the sauce more vibrant.
