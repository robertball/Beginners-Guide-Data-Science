Ingredients:
2 	packages of yeast
½ 	cup warm water
2 	cups cottage cheese
¼ 	cup sugar
2 	teaspoons salt (the salt helps activate your yeast)
½ 	teaspoon baking soda
2 	eggs
4 ½	cups sifted flour

Directions:
1.	Sprinkle yeast on warm water.  Stir to dissolve.  Heat cottage cheese until lukewarm.
2.	Combine cottage cheese, sugar, salt, baking soda, eggs, yeast and 1 cup flour in a bowl.  Beat at medium speed for about 2 minutes.  Gradually add enough flour to make a soft dough that leaves the sides of the bowl when mixing.
3.	Place dough in greased bowl, turn to grease all sides.  Cover and let rise about 1-1/2 hours.
4.	Turn dough on to lightly floured surface.  Divide dough in to 24 pieces.  Shape into a ball, or even size pieces.  Put into well greased baking pan, 13x9 if you have it.  Let rise 45 minutes. – should be doubled in size
5.	Bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.  They will turn a beautiful golden brown on top!   Cool on rack for a minute or two if you can wait that long!
