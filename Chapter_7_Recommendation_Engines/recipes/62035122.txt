Ingredients:
2 (10 oz) cream of mushroom soup (reduced fat is fine)
1 1/3 cups milk (skim is fine)
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon prepared mustard
2 (16 oz) cans of sauerkraut, rinsed and drained
1 8 oz pkg. medium uncooked egg noodles
1 1/2 lbs. polish sausage (kielbasa) cut into 1/2 inch pcs.
2 cups shredded swiss cheese
3/4 cup bread crumbs
2 tablespoons of butter melted (or no stick spray)

Directions:
Combine soup, milk, onion and mustard in bowl, blend well. Spread kraut in a greased 13x9 casserole. Top with uncooked noodles, spoon soup mixture over, place kielbasa slices and sprinkle with cheese. Combine bread crumbs and butter in bowl, sprinkle over top of casserole. (If you opt for the lower fat version, sprinkle bread crumbs and give a good coat of butter flavor no-stick spray). Cover with foil and bake for 1 hour or until noodles are tender.

Description: 
I am from Connecticut where they have some of what I consider the world's best kielbasa made from really old family recipes. You can use packaged store bought kielbasa, but use the real mcoy if possible!!! Easy to make. Reheats well. I have taken it to many get togethers and have never heard any complaints.
