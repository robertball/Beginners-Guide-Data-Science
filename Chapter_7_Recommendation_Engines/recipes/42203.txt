Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/2 cup reduced-fat plain yogurt
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 cup fresh or frozen raspberries
1 tablespoon slivered almonds
Glaze
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon fat free milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly coat an 8 inch round cake pan with nonstick cooking spray.
Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, yogurt, butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.  Stir the egg mixture into the flour until well moistened.  Toss the raspberries with the brown sugar in a small bowl.
Pour 2/3 of the batter into the cake pan and sprinkle with the raspberries and almonds.  Spoon the remaining batter over the raspberries.
Bake in preheated oven until cake springs back when lightly touched, 35 to 40 minutes.  Set aside to cool.
To make the glaze, stir together the sugar, milk, and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract until smooth.  Drizzle glaze over the cooled coffee cake.  Serve at room temperature.
