Ingredients:
2-3 medium potatoes, cut into bite size
1/2 c chopped onion
1-1/2 t dried parsley
1/3 c cooking oil
2 T butter
2 t beef bouillon granules
1 t garlic powder
1/4 t black pepper

Directions:
In measuring cup combine cooking oil, butter, beef bouillon granules, garlic powder, and pepper. Put into microwave and heat until butter has melted completely.
Meanwhile, in glass (preferred) 9x13 pan, place cut up potatoes and chopped onion. Once oil/butter mixture is melted, stir well and pour over potatoes. It helps to keep stirring right even as you pour - as the beef bouillon wants to sink to the bottom. Coat potatoes and onion with the oil/butter mixture, and sprinkle with dried parsley.
Bake for about 30 minutes at 450Â°F.

When I asked my husband to name the new potato recipe I made, he just said yummy. So they've been known as Yummy Potatoes ever since - and it's one of his favorites.
