Ingredients:
2 pounds salmon filet
1/4 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 teaspoons dried tarragon
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1/2 medium yellow onion, finely diced
1 cup light mayonnaise
1/2 cup sugar free sweet relish
3 jalapenos, seeds and stems removed, minced
1 tablespoon capers
1 tablespoon parsley
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Remove skin from salmon and cut into chunks. Put the salmon and shrimp in a food processor, pulse several times then process until coarsely ground.
In a bowl, combine salmon mixture, tarragon, mustard and onion. Mix until just combined. Form into 6 patties.
Spray a large skillet or griddle with nonstick and heat over medium-high heat. Add patties (you may need to do this in batches) and cook, turning once, until internal temperature reaches 160F, 3 to 4 minutes a side.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, relish, jalapeno, capers, parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper to make tartar.
Serve with lettuce and slice tomato.

Description: 
The recipe below follows on by Mark Scarbrough and Bruce Weinstein pretty closely, the difference being I added onion to ours and used dried instead of fresh tarragon. But I couldn't just leave it at that. I made up a jalapeno tartar sauce to go with it. The burgers are 240 calories (not including bun) with 10 grams of fat and no fiber. For my Weight Watchers friends, run it through the recipe builder, the points value is actually lower than you would get from just entering the nutrition information. One tablespoon of the tartar is only 31 calories with 2 grams of fat and no fiber.
