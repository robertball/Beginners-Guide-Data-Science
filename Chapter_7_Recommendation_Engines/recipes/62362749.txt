Phil's Old Mountain Crocks Recipe

Ingredients:
- Bread; 2 slices normal bread per person, 3 or 4 slices each if using Ciabatta or French bread or similar (if this is a starter, then 1 slice is more than enough)
- Garlic; 1 clove, peeled
- Dry white wine; just a drizzle, can be sherry or saki or similar but this ingredient is totally optional
- Mustard; 1 to 2 teaspoons, I prefer a grain mustard, but it's your taste
- Shallot (or onion); 1, finely sliced or finely chopped, after all it's your taste
- Ham; 1 thin slice, as it's used to cover the bread then it depends on how large your slice is as to whether you might need just a half slice or 2 slices or whatever
- Cheddar; grated, 1 cup (can be Pepperjack, can be Gruy√®re, can be whatever melty cheese you like - in Chamonix, they use local Reblochon and/or Tomme)

Directions:
Pre-heat the broiler.
Under the broiler, toast one side of the bread until rich golden brown.
Flip the bread over, and toast the other side, but only until crisp, NOT until well-coloured.
On the underdone sides, which you should from now on keep uppermost, rub the garlic clove over the surface, letting the crispy coating scrape the garlic clove down. (If you are a REAL garlic fan, finely slice the remnants of the clove and scatter them over the bread pieces too)
This step is optional! With your thumb across the neck of the white wine bottle, drizzle a little wine onto each piece of bread
Spread the mustard over the slices of bread as thickly or thinly as YOU like
Place the trimmed ham slice(s) on the toast, trying to protect the edges of the bread from the broiler later
Top off with the grated cheese, evenly distributed and again spread to the outside of the ham, to protect this from burning
Slide back under the broiler until golden brown and bubbly.
(Please see the footnotes for variations)

Description: 
A Croque Monsieur is French for cheese on toast, but these ones have a special French Mountains (Chamonix - Mont Blanc) slant, my favourite to accompany that first apres-ski cold beer. But also great as a starter, as a lunch or as a brunch offering.
