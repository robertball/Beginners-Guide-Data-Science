Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup soy sauce (low sodium if possible)
1/2 cup bottled teriyaki marinade
2 TBL red wine vinegar
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
4 cloves minced garlic
2 pounds flank steak

Directions:
Score the surface of the flank steak with 1/4 inch deep knife cuts, about an inch apart, across the grain of the meat.
In a bowl, mix the oil, soy sauce, teriyaki marinade, vinegar, pepper, and garlic.
Place meat and marinade in large freezer bag.  Seal the bag and coat the flank steak well.
Refrigerate the flank steak for at least 4 hours or up to overnight.
Preheat the grill for medium-high heat.
Oil the grill and then grill the flank steak for about 4 minutes on each side, or until desired doneness.

Description: 
Here's a marinade recipe my Mother and I came up with that our family just loves.  This marinade is especially good for flank steak on the BBQ, but you can use it on other cuts of beef as well.  **Enjoy**
