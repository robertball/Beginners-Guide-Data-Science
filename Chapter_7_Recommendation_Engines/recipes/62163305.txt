Ingredients:
1.5 cups flour
1.5 cups sugar
1.5 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
2 eggs
1.5 sticks butter/margarine
5 cups skinned, pitted sliced fresh (or frozen, what the heck?) peaches

Directions:
Mix the first five(5) ingredients until crumbly.  Put sliced peaches in a 13x9 baking dish.  Top with crumbly mixture.  Melt butter/margarine.  Pour over top.  Bake 50 minutes in a 350 degree oven, or until golden brown on top.
Allow to cool slightly, half-way or completely.  It does not matter!  Serve with french vanilla ice cream, vanilla or just whipped cream, and enjoy.

Description: 
Many of us have struggled with watery, or blah peach cobbler recipes.  Time to simplify.  This is great every time....and with french vanilla ice cream...they won't let me use those adjectives!  It's so simple, it's sinful.
