Ingredients:
1/2 1b. thin spaghetti, broken into fourths or fifths lengthwise
2 pints grape tomoates, diced
1/2 red onion, diced
1 can (6 oz) small pitted ripe black olives, cut lengthwise in half
1 pkg (12 oz) fresh mushrooms, sliced.
2 cloves garlic
2 Tbls dried sweet basil
salt
pepper
4 Tbls olive oil
Romaine Lettuce or other greens.

Directions:
Boil spaghetti, drain. While still hot add salt and pepper to taste, and half the garlic, basil and olive oil.
Mix together and place in the fridge to cool.
In another bowl mix the tomatoes, onion, olives, and mushrooms with the rest of of the garlic, basil and olive oil. Also salt and pepper to taste.
When the spaghetti is cool mix the pasta with the vegetables,(But do not add the lettuce yet).
While you can eat it now, for the best flavor let it sit in the fridge overnight. Just before serving tear up the lettuce or other greens and mix it in. Not too much! It is not a lettuce salad, its just part of the mix.

Description: 
A lovely and fresh pasta salad my dad threw together one night that became a favorite. It's also very flexible. As dad says, If you want to put something else in, go ahead, ain't no big deal. As long as no one starts poking it with a fork and mumbling,'had a failed science experiment look like this once, only it smelled better,' you're doin' just fine.
