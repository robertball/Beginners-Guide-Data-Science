Ingredients:
1/2 pound thin skirt steak, trimmed of excess fat
1 tablespoon Montreal steak seasoning
1/2 pound thin asparagus spears, trimmed
1 teaspoon olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 jarred roasted red pepper, cut into six 1/2-inch strips
6 toothpicks
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Butterfly or pound steak with a meat mallet to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut into 6 strips, approximately 2 inches wide by 5 inches long. Season both sides with Montreal steak seasoning and place in the refrigerator.
Preheat Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven to Medium-High on the "Grill" setting.
Place asparagus in a shallow dish; drizzle olive oil on top. Season with salt and pepper.
Grill asparagus for 2 minutes, turning after 1 minute. Transfer to a plate.
Reheat oven to Medium-High on "Grill" setting.
Line up steak strips next to each other in an assembly line. Cover evenly with 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Place 3 to 4 asparagus spears on top, perpendicular to each steak strip. Top asparagus with 1 red pepper strip.
Roll steak tightly around asparagus, angling it diagonally to avoid overlapping the steak. Secure with a toothpick.
Grill steak bundles for 8 minutes, turning every 2 minutes. Remove to a plate and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.
