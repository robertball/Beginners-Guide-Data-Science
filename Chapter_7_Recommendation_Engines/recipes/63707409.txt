Ingredients:
FOR DOUGH AND FILLING:
1 loaf frozen white bread dough, thawed, All-purpose flour, for dusting surface
1 cup packed golden brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2/3 stick butter, softened
FOR ICING:
1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, softened
1 cup powdered sugar,
1/3 cup cream cheese,
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
DOUGH AND FILLING PREPARATION
On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to a 15×7-inch rectangle. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar and cinnamon; set aside. Spread 2/3 stick softened butter over dough. Sprinkle evenly with cinnamon-sugar mixture. Starting at the long edge, roll up dough as for a jelly roll. Pinch seam to seal.
Cut rolled dough into 16 slices and divide slices between 2 lightly buttered 8-inch round baking pans. Set aside in a warm place and allow dough to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bake for 15 minutes or until golden on top. Promptly invert baking pan over a wire rack, and lift pan from buns. Scoop filling that has remained in the pan over buns. Allow buns to cool slightly, about 10 minutes.
ICING PREPARATION
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, beat the icing ingredients with an electric mixer until fluffy. Spread or pipe (with a pastry bag) icing over rolls. Serve warm.
*Note: Thaw frozen bread dough overnight in the refrigerator.

Description: 
When it comes to naughty food, Cinnabons® take the cake. My recipe is a ringer for the original, from the sugar-cinnamon dough to the deliciously drippy cream cheese icing. Make baby ones for a quick mini munchie or jumbo ones to share shamelessly, but be sure to get the centerit’s the best part!
