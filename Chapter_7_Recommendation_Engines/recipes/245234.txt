Herb and Pomegranate Pull-Apart Bread Recipe

Ingredients:
1 large, round loaf sourdough bread, unsliced
1/2 cup cold salted butter, cut into 16 slices
1 cup shredded white Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded Gouda cheese
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary leaves
1 tablespoon minced fresh sage leaves
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup pomegranate seeds
Cracked black pepper to taste
Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil and lightly coat with cooking spray. Set aside.
With a serrated knife, make diagonal cuts through the loaf of bread in opposite directions (leaving the bottom crust intact), so you have 1-inch pieces exposed all over the bread. Place loaf onto the foil-lined baking sheet and insert pats of butter in the slits throughout the loaf.
Add the remaining ingredients together in a mixing bowl and toss together until well combined. Stuff the cheese mixture evenly throughout the slits in the loaf until all of the mixture has been used and the entire loaf is filled.
Place the loaf in the oven and bake for 25 minutes. Transfer loaf to the broiler and broil for about 1 minute for an extra-toasted top. Remove and allow the bread to sit for 5-7 minutes before serving.
