Ingredients:
1 (13.5-ounce) can coconut milk
1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted
4 eggs
2 (12-ounce) jars macapuno coconut strings in heavy syrup
2 1/2 cup mochiko sweet rice flour
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Butter a 12" x 17" x 1" baking sheet.
In a large mixing bowl, beat coconut milk, condensed milk, and melted butter until combined. Add eggs, one at a time, and beat until combined. Do the same with both jars of macapuno strings. Gradually beat in mochiko flour. Follow that with the brown sugar and add vanilla extract and beat until combined.
Pour batter into the cookie sheet. Bake until golden brown and sides are slightly dark brown, about 45-50 minutes.  Optional topping:  mix condensed milk and egg yolk together and add on top of cake 20 min prior from being done.
Once cooled, loosen the sides, cut into squares.

Description: 
A very coconutty rice flour chewy dessert. Traditionally, this is baked in banana leaves but my family prefer the crispy edges which is why I use a sheet pan. I have been testing out several types of chewy desserts using rice flour and this seems to be the favorite.
