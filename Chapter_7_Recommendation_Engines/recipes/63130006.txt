Ingredients:
1/2 cup rolled oats
1 cup milk of choice (I used almond)
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 a ripe banana
1-2 T peanut butter (or other nut butter)
1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract
sweetener (the amount will vary, depending on your tastebuds and what milk you use)
optional: chocolate chips

Directions:
Cook the oats, salt, and milk (either on the stove or in the microwave). Meanwhile, blend the pb and banana. Then add your vanilla, sweetener, and 1/2 of the cooked oats to the blender (I used a Magic Bullet) and re-blend. Stir in the rest of the oats. You can blend all the oats if you prefer, but I like the chewiness of leaving some un-blended.

Description: 
This isn’t your average bowl of peanut butter oats. The cooking method makes this breakfast taste like you are eating a giant bowl of gooey peanut butter pudding. It’s life-changing… at least as far as breakfast is concerned!
Blend peanut butter, banana, cooked oatmeal, and milk for a creamy pudding-like breakfast that contains 11 grams of protein and just 330 calories. Add some sliced banana on top (and a few chocolate chips if you wish) for a meal that will definitely keep you full until lunch
