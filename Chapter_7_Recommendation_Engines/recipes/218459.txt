Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) loaf rectangular brioche bread
3 cups fresh strawberries, hulled, divided
2 tablespoons water
2 cups heavy cream, divided
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar (optional)
6 eggs
2 tablespoons unsalted butter

Directions:
Place a metal mixing bowl and beaters from an electric mixer into the freezer to chill. Trim the end crusts from the brioche bread, and slice the loaf in half; cut each half in half again (4 pieces), and cut each quarter in half to total 8 pieces of brioche.
Place 2 cups of strawberries and the water into a saucepan over medium-high heat; cover the pan, and bring to a simmer. Gently steam the berries until they release their juice, about 5 minutes.
Beat 1 cup of heavy cream, vanilla extract, and confectioners' sugar together with electric mixer in chilled metal bowl with the chilled beaters until the cream forms soft peaks; set aside.
Whisk the eggs and remaining 1 cup cream together in a large bowl, and place the bread pieces into the mixture, spooning the cream over the bread to coat. Allow to stand for 5 minutes.
Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat until fragrant, and lay the coated brioche pieces into the skillet. Cook until the French toast is golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.
To serve, place 2 pieces of French toast onto a plate, overlapping slightly. Ladle cooked strawberries and their juice over the French toast, and top with a generous dollop of whipped cream. Top the cream with several fresh strawberries.
