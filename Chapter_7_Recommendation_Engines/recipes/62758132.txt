Ingredients:
4	bone-in, skin-on split chicken breasts (about 3 pounds), halved crosswise
Salt and pepper
1	tablespoon  vegetable oil
1	(9-ounce) box  frozen artichoke hearts , thawed
1/2	cup  low-sodium chicken broth
2	tablespoons  honey
2	teaspoons  herbes de Provence  (see note)
4	tablespoons  unsalted butter , cut into 4 pieces
2	teaspoons  white wine vinegar (see note)

Directions:
1. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Cook chicken skin-side down until well browned, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook until meat registers 160 degrees, about 15 minutes. Transfer chicken to platter and tent with foil.
2. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet. Add artichokes and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes; transfer to platter with chicken. Add broth, honey, herbs, and any accumulated chicken juices to skillet and simmer, scraping up any browned bits, until reduced to Â¼ cup, about 3 minutes. Off heat, whisk in butter and vinegar. Pour sauce over chicken and artichokes. Serve.
