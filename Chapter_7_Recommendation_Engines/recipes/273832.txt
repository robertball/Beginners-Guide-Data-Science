Ingredients:
1 cup fiddleheads
2 slices bacon
6 eggs
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon milk
1 tablespoon water
2 teaspoons butter
2 slices Gruyere cheese (optional)
1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Carefully wash each fiddlehead, remove all of the brown papery cover, and trim the ends.
Add an inch of water to the bottom of a steamer basket and heat on high until the water is boiling. Place fiddleheads into the top of the steamer basket and cover with a lid. Steam for 10 minutes. Fill a medium bowl with ice chips and water and set aside.
Meanwhile, place bacon bits into a small nonstick skillet and add 2 teaspoons water. Cook on medium heat until crispy, about 5 minutes. Drain bacon on a paper towel-lined plate.
Plunge the steamed fiddleheads into the icy water to stop the cooking progress. Remove after 5 minutes and pat dry.
Break eggs into a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add milk and 1 tablespoon water; whisk until smooth.
Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour in 1/2 the egg mixture let partially set. Lift 1 section of the omelette with a spatula and tilt skillet, allowing liquid egg to run underneath. Add 1/2 the bacon and fiddleheads to the lower section and carefully fold the uncovered section over the bottom. Add 1 slice Gruyere cheese; let melt, about 2 minutes more. Repeat with the other half of the ingredients.
