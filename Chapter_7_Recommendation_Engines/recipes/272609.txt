Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup finely chopped mushrooms
1/2 teaspoon herbes de Provence
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup finely chopped scallions
1 1/2 cups thinly sliced Swiss chard
1 tablespoon water
4 large eggs
1/4 cup milk
1 tablespoon coarsely grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons drained and chopped sun-dried tomatoes

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 7 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until tender and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in scallions and cook until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chard and water; cook and stir until wilted, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes.
Whisk eggs, milk, Parmesan cheese, and Dijon mustard together in a large bowl. Fold in mushroom mixture and sun-dried tomatoes. Pour egg mixture into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool frittatas for 5 minutes before lifting out of the muffin cups.

Description: 
I was gifted some farm-fresh eggs and wanted to make something that would showcase them. I decided to use up some freshly picked greens to make these vegetarian frittatas! Try them with a green salad for a light brunch or even dinner.
