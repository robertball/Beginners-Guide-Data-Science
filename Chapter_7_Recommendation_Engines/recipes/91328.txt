Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup seasoned bread crumbs
2  eggs
1 tablespoon water
6 (6 ounce) center-cut pork loin chops, about 1 inch thick
½ cup vegetable oil
1 (7 ounce) jar roasted red bell peppers, drained and sliced
4 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
½ cup lemon juice
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking pan with foil or coat with nonstick spray. Combine flour and bread crumbs in a shallow bowl.  In a small bowl, beat eggs and water together.
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Dip chops in egg mixture, dredge in flour and crumb mixture, and arrange chops in hot skillet. Lightly brown chops until golden brown on both sides and cooked through. Remove from skillet, and place on prepared baking pan. Top chops with strips of roasted red peppers. Set aside.
In small saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Slowly add flour, stirring with whisk until light brown. Slowly whisk milk into flour, and continue whisking until sauce thickens. Remove from heat, and stir in mushrooms and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Evenly top each chop with mushroom white sauce.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
