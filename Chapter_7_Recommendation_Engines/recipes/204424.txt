Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained with juice reserved
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/3 cup apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 pound lean ground beef
1 egg
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup Italian dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons dried minced onion
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 green bell pepper, chopped

Directions:
Heat a slow cooker to Medium-High; stir the reserved liquid from the pineapple chunks, soy sauce, vinegar, and brown sugar together in the slow cooker. Whisk the cornstarch into the mixture until dissolved.
Mix the ground beef, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, bread crumbs, onion, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; form into 1-inch balls.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook the meatballs in the hot skillet until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Place the meatballs into the slow cooker. Add the reserved pineapple chunks and green bell pepper.
Cover and cook until the meatballs are no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.

Description: 
These meatballs are great! I came up with them on a whim one night while searching through my pantry trying to answer the age old question, 'What's for dinner?' My family LOVES these! I have also taken them to several BBQ's and they are ALWAYS a big hit! For dinner, I like to serve them with a side of steamed minute rice to go along with the meatballs. I hope you enjoy!
