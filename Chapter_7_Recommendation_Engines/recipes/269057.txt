Ingredients:
1 ½ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, diced
extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage
sea salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu
extra-virgin olive oil
2  garlic cloves, minced
¾ cup chopped mushrooms
½ cup chopped zucchini
sea salt to taste
2  scallions, white and green parts, chopped
1 tablespoon lemon-infused olive oil (such as F. Oliver's(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Meyer lemon)
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste
2 teaspoons pear-infused white balsamic vinegar
1 (1/8 inch thick) slice ginger, minced
1 teaspoon crushed fennel seeds
1 teaspoon Madras curry powder
½ teaspoon turmeric
sea salt to taste
1 pinch Chinese five-spice powder
freshly ground pink peppercorns to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until parboiled, about 5 minutes. Drain and transfer potatoes to a baking sheet. Coat liberally with olive oil and season with herbes de Provence, sage, sea salt, and black pepper.
Roast in the preheated oven until tender, turning once, about 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, place tofu onto a plate and place another plate on top. Set a 3- to 5-pound weight on top. Press tofu for 20 to 30 minutes; drain and discard the accumulated liquid. Cut tofu into small dice.
Heat olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and saute until golden, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms and cook until softened, 3 to 5 minutes more. Add zucchini and a sprinkling of sea salt; keep cooking for about 3 minutes more.
Add diced pressed tofu, scallions, lemon oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce, pear vinegar, and ginger to the pan with the vegetables. Stir in fennel seeds, curry powder, turmeric, sea salt, Chinese 5-spice powder, and ground pink pepper. Reduce heat to low and cook until flavors combine, 3 to 5 minutes more.

Description: 
You won't miss eggs with this breakfast dish bursting with intense, unique flavors and textures. I use F. Oliver's(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Meyer lemon olive oil, and honeyed ginger balsamic vinegar, with a dash of curry powder. Paired with roasted potatoes, this makes a memorable meal. Serve with sautéed spinach or a crisp leaf of romaine lettuce.
