Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
8 all-beef hot dogs
8 hot dog buns
8 slices Swiss cheese
1/2 cup barbeque sauce, or amount to taste
1 small red onion, diced

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Lightly oil grate, and set 4 inches from the heat.
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain on paper towels.
Place hot dogs on grill; cook until browned, 5 to 8 minutes, turning once, or until done to suit your taste. Lightly grill hot dog buns.
To assemble sandwiches, place a slice of cheese and bacon on each roll. Add a hot dog, top each with 1 tablespoon barbeque sauce, or desired amount, and red onion.
