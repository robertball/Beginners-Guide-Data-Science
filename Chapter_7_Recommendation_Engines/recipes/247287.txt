Ingredients:
½ cup panko bread crumbs
½ cup crushed cashews
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
2  eggs
2 tablespoons milk
2 (8 ounce) trout fillets
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed
2 teaspoons butter
2 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Heat a flat griddle pan over medium heat.
Mix panko, cashews, black pepper, salt, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Whisk eggs and milk together in a separate bowl.
Dust trout with flour until evenly coated. Dip floured trout in egg mixture, then press trout into cashew mixture until thoroughly coated.
Melt butter and oil together in the hot griddle pan. Place trout, flesh-side down, into the pan and cook for 3 minutes. Flip and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes more.
