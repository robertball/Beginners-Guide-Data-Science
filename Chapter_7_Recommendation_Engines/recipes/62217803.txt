Description: 
'My grandma kept two cookie jars in her pantry. One of the jars, which I now have, always had these crisp and chewy gingersnaps in it,' recalls Deb Handy of Pomona, Kansas. 'They're still my favorite. My 11-year-old daughter, Becky, used this recipe for a 4-H fair and won a blue ribbon.'Modified from: Cookie Jar Gingersnaps
