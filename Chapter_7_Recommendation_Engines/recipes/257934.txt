Ingredients:
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon cornstarch
9 ounces pork, cut into thin strips
2 teaspoons salt, divided
3 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/8 teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG)
3 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons sweet bean paste
2 spring onions (white parts only), cut into matchstick-size pieces

Directions:
Stir 2 tablespoons water and cornstarch together in a bowl.
Place pork in shallow bowl and add cornstarch mixture and 1 teaspoon salt; stir to coat and let sit for a few minutes.
Mix 3 tablespoons water, sugar, soy sauce, MSG, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a bowl until sauce is smooth.
Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat; saute pork until pork is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Push pork to a side; add sweet bean paste. Cook and stir bean paste until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in the sauce and stir until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.
Transfer pork mixture to a dish and top with spring onions.
