Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 cup Italian-style bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 egg
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix turkey, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, egg, parsley, and salt together in a large bowl. Form meat mixture with wet hands into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter without handling or packing too hard.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 20 minutes . An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
