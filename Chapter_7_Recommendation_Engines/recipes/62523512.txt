Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup light corn syrup
1 cup heavy cream, divided
1/2 cup butter
1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups 60% cacao dark chocolate chips
3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 tbs. shortening
1 tbs. sea salt

Directions:
For caramels, butter a 8" square baking pan. In a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup, 1/2 cup of cream, and the butter. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring often. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup of cream. Cook, without stirring, until mixture reaches 242 degrees, or until a small amount of the syrup forms a firm yet pliable ball when dropped in cold water. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla. Pour into prepared pan. Allow to cool slightly; cover and refrigerate overnight.
Take caramels out of the fridge, and allow them to warm up slightly. Cut into 1" squares. Meanwhile, combine both chocolate chips and the shortening; heat in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds. Stir until smooth. Dip caramel squares in chocolate, shaking off excess. Place on waxed paper to harden. Sprinkle with sea salt. Store in the refrigerator.
