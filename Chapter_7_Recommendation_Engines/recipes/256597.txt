Ingredients:
1/4 cup tahini
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground fennel seed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 dash hot sauce (such as CholulaÂ®)
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 1/2 cups water
3/4 cup chickpea flour

Directions:
Mix tahini, lemon juice, cumin, fennel, salt, pepper, and hot sauce together in a small bowl.
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook garlic powder in the hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in 1 1/2 cup water. Whisk in chickpea flour until smooth. Slowly whisk in remaining 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Reduce heat to low; cook and stir until mixture thickens, about 15 minutes.
Scrape chickpea mixture into a large bowl using a rubber spatula. Add tahini mixture; whisk until well incorporated.

Description: 
This is an adaptation of a recipe I found. I made adjustments to eliminate chopping and blending. It makes for an easy, tasty, creamy hummus. Garnish the top with some olive oil, ground paprika, or fresh minced basil if you like.
