Ingredients:
1 1/4 pound ground beef
1 1/4 pound pork sausage
1 1/4 cup chopped sweet onion
2 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 C + 2 T Italian seasoned dry bread crumbs
2T + 1/2t chopped fresh parsley
2 1/2t dried oregano
2 1/2 (16 ounce) jar pasta sauce
2 1/2 (8 ounce) package manicotti shells
2 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Cook the beef and pork in a skillet over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain grease, and transfer meat to a large bowl. Place onion and garlic in the skillet, and cook until onion is tender. Transfer to bowl with beef. Mix the bread crumbs, parsley, and oregano into the bowl.
Spread 1/2 the pasta sauce over the bottom of the baking dish. Stuff manicotti shells with the meat mixture, arrange in the baking dish, and cover with remaining sauce.
Cover pan with foil, and bake manicotti 40 minutes in the preheated oven. Uncover, sprinkle with cheese, and continue baking 20 minutes, until bubbly.
