Ingredients:
2 pounds round steak or skirt steak
1 C flour
Salt
Pepper
16 oz. can diced tomatoes
1 can condensed tomato soup
1/4 can water
1 onion, sliced into rings
1 bell pepper, cut into strips
4 carrots, cut into 1/2" coins

Directions:
Cut the meat into serving pieces about the size of a deck of cards. Cover the meat between doubled Saran wrap and pound each piece on both sides with a meat mallet.  Season each piece of meat with salt and pepper to taste and coat each piece well with the flour.  Set aside.
Spray a 9 x 13" glass baking dish with PAM nonstick spray.  Mix the remaining ingredients together in a large bowl.  Spread two ladles of the tomato mixture into the bottom of the baking dish.  Set aside
Next, heat three to four TBL. of oil in a large skillet.  When the oil is hot, carefully brown each piece of meat on both sides and then place the meat into the prepared baking dish; layering the meat as needed to make room for all of the pieces.
Next, pour the remaining tomato mixture evenly over the meat.  Seal with foil.  Bake @ 350 degrees for two hours.  Allow the meat to rest 20 minutes before removing the foil to serve.

This recipe is adapted from the first cookbook given to me as a new bride in 1981--How to Boil Water by Betty Jane Donahoe.  This is one of the first meals that I prepared as a newly wed and it is still the ultimate comfort food for us.
