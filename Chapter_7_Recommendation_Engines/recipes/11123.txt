Ingredients:
1/2 cup honey
2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup butter
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup wheat and barley nugget cereal (e.g. Grape-Nutsâ„¢)

Directions:
Microwave honey on high until bubbly (about 1 minute). Stir in the margarine. Add the egg and mix well. Stir in the flour, cocoa and vanilla. Mix well and chill dough for several hours in the refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll chunks of the chilled dough into cylindrical shapes in order to resemble cat poop. Roll cookies in cereal and place on ungreased baking sheet.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 15 minutes. Serve cookies in a new litter box on a bed of malted barley cereal. Use a new litter scoop to remove cookies.
