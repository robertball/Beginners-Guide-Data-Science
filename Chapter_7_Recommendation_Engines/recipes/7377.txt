Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1 cup prunes, cooked and chopped
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons butter
1 egg yolk
3 cups confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 tablespoons strong brewed coffee

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream the white sugar and shortening until light and fluffy.  Beat the eggs, and add to the sugar mixture.  Add the prunes.
In another bowl, sift the flour, soda, baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.  Add these dry ingredients alternately with the buttermilk to the sugar mixture.
Pour the batter into 2 greased and floured 9 inch layer pans.  Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 30 minutes.  Cool.
To Make the Mocha Icing:   Begin by creaming the butter.  Blend in the egg yolk.  Sift the confectioners' sugar, cocoa, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together.  Add this sugar mixture alternately with the hot coffee to the creamed butter.  Frost the cooled cake.
