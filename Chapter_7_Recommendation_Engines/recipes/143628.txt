Ingredients:
2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
1/4 cup water
1 cup orange juice
3/4 cup SPLENDAÂ® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1/4 cup cold water
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the blueberries, 1/4 cup of water, orange juice, and SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener. Stir gently, and bring to a boil.
In a cup or small bowl, mix together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup cold water. Gently stir the cornstarch mixture into the blueberries so as not to mash the berries. Simmer gently until thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the almond extract and cinnamon. Thin sauce with water if it is too thick for your liking.
