Ingredients:
1/2 cup Riesling wine
3 ounces butter, cut into small pieces
1 clove garlic, chopped
4 (4 ounce) fillets red snapper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
Pour Riesling wine into a large skillet over medium heat; cook until mostly evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir butter and garlic into remaining wine; cook and stir until the garlic softens and the butter melts completely, 3 to 5 minutes.
Season red snapper fillets with salt and black pepper. Increase heat under the skillet to high; gently lie snapper fillets into the butter and garlic mixture. Cook about 3 minutes, turn, add the almonds, and continue cooking until the flesh of the snapper flakes easily with a fork, 2 to 3 minutes more.

Clement
Description: 
The wine evaporated before cooking the fish gives it a very particular caramelized wine taste and doesn't need any sauce with it. Goes very well with any vegetable and will impress your guests by its subtlety (still being very fast and easy to prepare).
