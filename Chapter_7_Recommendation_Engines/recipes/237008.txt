Ingredients:
10  Mission(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Small/Fajita Flour Tortillas
2 cups diced cooked chicken breast meat
1 (10.75 ounce) can reduced fat and sodium cream of chicken soup
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chile peppers, undrained
1 teaspoon ground dried chili pepper
½ teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon ground coriander
2 tablespoons canola oil
½ teaspoon ground chipotle pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
⅓ cup reduced-fat sour cream
Prepared salsa

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
Mix together chicken, cream of chicken soup, diced green chile peppers, 1 tsp. chipotle powder, cumin, and coriander in a medium size saucepan. Heat over medium heat until hot. Remove from heat.
Place about 3 tablespoons of the chicken filling along the edge of a tortilla. Roll the tortilla up more tight than loose. Put a toothpick through the middle of the flauta to hold in place. Place on a sprayed large baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.
In a small bowl mix together the canola oil and remaining ground chipotle pepper.
Lightly brush the flautas with the oil mixture. Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool.
Remove toothpicks, slice each flautas on the diagonal. Transfer on your favorite fiesta platter, sprinkle with chopped fresh cilantro, serve with low fat sour cream and salsa.
