In a mixing bowl, combine cake and pudding mixes, milk, oil and eggs. Beat on low speed until moistened. Beat on medium for 2 minutes. Stir in chocolate chips and 3 tablespoons grated chocolate. Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan.

Description: 
I'm a teenager who loves to bake and have won several ribbons at the county fair. When we're asked to take a dish to a potluck, I often help my mom make it. This scrumptious cake is easy to transport and fun to serve because everyone likes it! -Abigail Crawford, Lake Butler, Florida
