Ingredients:
5 potatoes, peeled, and cubed
4 cups spinach or swiss chard, chopped
1 tomato, chopped
1 onion, diced
1 carrot, peeled, and diced
2 tbsp olive oil
1 cup cream
1 cup grated parmesan or cheddar cheese
juice of 1 lemon
1 tsp dijon mustard
1 handful of fresh parsley, chopped
1 lb (500 grams) mix of salmon, haddock, and shrimp

Directions:
Boil potatoes in salted water. While potatoes are cooking steam spinach right over the potato pot using a colander.  Once steamed, drain excess liquid and set aside. When you can stick a fork in potatoes remove from heat and set aside.
Cut of fish in cubes and place all seafood in the bottom of 9 x 13 inch baking dish.
Top fish with wilted spinach and chopped tomato
Now to prepare the sauce.  Add olive oil to pan and cook onions and carrots until onions are translucent. Add cream, bring to boil and let it simmer 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and add cheese, parsley, mustard, lemon juice, and salt and pepper.  Pour sauce over fish and vegetable mixture.
Top the dish with mashed potatoes. Drain and mash potatoes with 2 tbsp of butter and about 1/4 cup of milk. I added some cheese on the top before putting in oven.
Bake 350 degrees for about 30-35 minutes or until nice and golden on top.
