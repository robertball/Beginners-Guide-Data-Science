Ingredients:
3 cups crushed saltine crackers
2 cups grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon Italian-style seasoning
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup butter, melted
6 pork chops

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, combine the crushed saltines, Parmesan cheese, Italian-style seasoning and garlic powder and mix together well.
Dip the chops in the melted butter and then dredge each chop in the cracker mixture, coating all sides thoroughly. Place the chops in a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes, or until internal pork temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
When I make these chops, I always have to make extra. Everyone has to eat more than they need. Great with a salad. The chops are baked in a crispy, buttery coating in the oven.
