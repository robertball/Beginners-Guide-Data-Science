Ingredients:
2 16-oz cans whole tomatoes
Handful of parsley, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
1 carrot, whole
6 cloves, garlic, whole
Â¼ cup olive oil
Handful of basil, chopped
1 tbl sugar
1 tbl salt
Pepper to taste

Directions:
Chop the tomatoes. The sauce should be chunky, not pureed.
In a large heavy bottomed stock pot, add olive oil, and heat until it is hazy. Add chopped onion and garlic, and cook until slightly colored. Add tomatoes, carrot, sugar, and salt, and cook for about an hour. Be sure to add the salt in the beginning of the cooking process, otherwise it will be tasteless. Remove carrot,and discard, add parsley and basil. Cook for a few more minutes and serve.

Description: 
Everyone has a different way to make Marinara sauce.
I add sugar to make it slightly sweet.  
The best sauce is one that is made a day or two ahead of serving, so that the flavors can meld in the refrigerator.
