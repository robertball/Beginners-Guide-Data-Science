Ingredients:
2 zucchini, sliced lengthwise and cut into 1/4-inch-thick pieces
1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1-inch squares
2 cups bite-sized broccoli pieces
1 1/2 cups bite-sized baby carrot pieces
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, or more to taste (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
6 lasagna noodles, or more as needed
1 cup Alfredo sauce
2 tablespoons pesto, or more to taste
1 (16 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 (6 ounce) package fresh spinach
1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease or line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Arrange zucchini, bell pepper, broccoli, and carrots in a single layer on the baking sheet. Coat with olive oil, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; mix well.
Roast vegetables in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish with one layer of lasagna noodles.
Toss the roasted vegetables with Alfredo sauce and pesto until well coated. Spread mixture over the noodles in the dish. Place another layer of noodles over the vegetables.
Mix ricotta cheese, 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and spinach together and spread mixture over the noodle layer. Distribute mozzarella cheese evenly over the ricotta layer. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and oregano on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese is melted, 30 to 35 minutes. Broil for 1 to 2 minutes to lightly brown the top layer, if desired.

Description: 
Here's a new twist on lasagna made with vegetables and a creamy pesto base. It's a great option for entertaining when you need to satisfy a lot of different guests' tastes. The roasted vegetables also make a great side dish that goes with any meat. They can be made a day in advance. I often bake a double batch and set half aside to go with another meal.
