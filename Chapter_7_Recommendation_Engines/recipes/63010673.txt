Ingredients:
2 sticks of butter, softened
4 cups powdered sugar
2 cups shredded coconut
2 cups chopped pecans
1 teaspoon pure vanilla
1 14 ounce can eagle brand milk
2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon parafin wax

Directions:
Mix butter, sugar, eagle brand milk together in a large mixing bowl. Add coconut, pecans and vanilla, mix well. Chill about 1 hour.
Form into small, bite-sized balls and place on a wax paper lined cookie sheet. Continue till all candy mixture is gone. Chill again for about 30 minutes. This makes it easier to handle during dipping.
Melt chocolate chips and wax in a double boiler over simmering water.
Dip candy balls using a toothpick into chocolate and set on cookie sheet. Allow to cool and them place into candy dish or box.
