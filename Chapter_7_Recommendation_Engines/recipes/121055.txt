Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon dried tarragon
1/3 cup chopped green onions
1/3 cup minced sweet red pepper
1/4 cup minced green bell pepper
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley
2 eggs
2/3 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. In a skillet, saute onions and peppers in butter until tender. Stir in parsley; cook for 10 minutes. In a bowl, beat eggs, sour cream and mustard. Add onion mixture. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.
