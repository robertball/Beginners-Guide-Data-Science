Description: 
A quick, family favorite in our household. This dish was one of my husbands favorite meals as a kid (hence the name:) when we were married I begged my mother in law for the recipe. Over the years, I've tried to attach measurements to the ingredients,which were in dash, pinch and handful terms. Hope you enjoy this as much as we do!!
