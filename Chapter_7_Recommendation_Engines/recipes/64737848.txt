Ingredients:
2 (14-ounce) cans full fat coconut milk (chilled overnight)
*5 pitted dates, soaked 30 minutes in hot water and drained
¼ cup tahini
1 cup sliced strawberries (fresh or frozen)
1 teaspoon almond or vanilla extract
¼ cup sliced almonds or almond slivers
*If more sweetness is desired, substitute dates with ¼ cup raw honey.
Optional:
Additional sliced strawberries, for topping
1 tablespoon sesame seeds, for topping

Directions:
Freeze the base of your ice cream maker for at least 12 hours, preferably overnight.
In the container of a high speed blender, combine tahini, ½ cup strawberries, extract, and dates or honey.
Blend for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until strawberries are broken down and mixture is combined.
Pour the mixture into your ice cream maker and follow the directions of the manufacturer to churn.
As mixture starts to thicken slightly (after 5-10 minutes), add remaining ½ cup sliced strawberries and ¼ cup almonds and continue mixing in ice cream maker until thick.
If desired, place in freezer for an additional hour to firm up, or serve immediately for a soft-serve consistency.
Delicious topped with additional sliced strawberries and sesame seeds!
