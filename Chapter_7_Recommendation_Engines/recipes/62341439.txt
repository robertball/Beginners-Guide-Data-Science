2 teaspoons baking soda
1 cup sugar
5 Tablespoons cocoa
1 cup Miracle Whip
1 cup water
1 teaspoon vanilla

Measure first four ingredients into sifter and sift into a bowl.
Add the liquids.
Beat well.
Prepare pans - lightly grease and lightly flour.  Pour batter into one 9x13 or 2 8-inch round pans.
Bake in a pre-heated 350 oven for 30 to 35 minutes.
You can top with your favorite icing.  Or, you can serve with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  Or, you can serve plain with a glass of milk or a cup of coffee - it's that moist.
