Ingredients:
1 18.25 ounce box of white cake mix
1 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 cups powdered sugar
4 1/2 tablespoons milk

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and spray a 9 x 13 pan with no-stick spray.
Prepare cake batter according to instructions on box and spread half the batter in the pan with a rubber spatula.
In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle it evenly on the cake.
Spread the rest of the batter evenly over the brown sugar mix and run the rubber spatula through the layers to create swirls.
Bake according to cake mix's directions, about 30 to 35 minutes.
When cake is done, stir together the powdered sugar, milk and vanilla and pour over cake, spreading the glaze to the edges.
Serve hot.

Description: 
This inexpensive cake has the taste of a cinnamon roll, the fluffy texture of a cake and the icing of a glazed doughnut!  It's best eaten warm and reheats wonderfully in the microwave.
