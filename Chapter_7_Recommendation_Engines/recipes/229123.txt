Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1/4 onion, finely chopped
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon taco seasoning
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 1/2 cups enchilada sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
8 flour tortillas
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook and stir ground beef with onion in a skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain grease. Stir 1 cup Cheddar cheese, sour cream, parsley, taco seasoning, oregano, and black pepper into the ground beef until cheese has melted. Mix in enchilada sauce, chili powder, garlic, and salt; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
Lay a tortilla onto a work surface and spoon about 1/4 cup of meat sauce down the center of the tortilla. Top meat sauce with 1 tablespoon black beans and a sprinkling of black olives. Roll the tortilla up, enclosing the filling, and lay seam-side down into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Spoon any remaining meat sauce over the enchiladas and scatter any remaining black beans and black olives over the top. Sprinkle tortillas with 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese topping is melted and enchiladas and sauce are bubbling, 20 to 22 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
