Ingredients:
Cake
1 box chocolate cake mix
1 box fudge brownie mix
4 eggs
1 1/4 cups water
1 cup oil
Ganache
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 bag (12 oz) semi sweet chocolate morsels

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare a bundt pan with bakers spray or use the butter/flour method.
Combine first five ingredients in a large bowl and whisk for 2 minutes or until lumps are mostly gone.
Pour batter into prepared bundt pan and bake for 50-55 minutes.
When done baking, remove cake and allow to cool in pan for up to five minutes. Carefully turn cake out onto a cooling rack and cool for 30 minutes more.
Ganache
Place heavy whipping cream in a large microwave safe bowl and heat for about 2 minutes. You want the cream to be just boiling.
Carefully pour chocolate morsels into cream... it may rise up and bubble and this is ok.
Let sit for 5 minutes. Whisk the chocolate and cream until shiny and smooth, about 1 minute.
Pour over cooled cake and serve.
