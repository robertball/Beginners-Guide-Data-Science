Description: 
My husband is Chinese and this is one of our favorite dishes. My late father-in-law, who used to be a Chinese chef, said my version of this was better than his! Yellow curry paste can be found at an Asian market. You may have to add a little more or less curry paste, depending on your taste. I included a more moderate amount in this recipe. I suggest serving this over cooked jasmine rice. It has a little bit of heat, so probably do not serve to small children. Enjoy!
