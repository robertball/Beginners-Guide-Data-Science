Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, grated
1/4 lemon, juiced
2 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 packet zero-calorie sweetener
3 ounces cooked jumbo shrimp
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce

Directions:
Wring out excess moisture from cauliflower using a cheesecloth or towel to make 'rice.'
Combine lemon juice, olive oil, cream, parsley, salt, garlic powder, white pepper, black pepper, and sugar substitute in a small bowl.
Heat a large nonstick saucepan over medium heat. Add shrimp; cook for 1 minute. Add cream mixture; cook until shrimp are lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer to a bowl.
Combine cauliflower rice and soy sauce in the same saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until cauliflower is tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Serve shrimp on top of the cauliflower rice.

Description: 
This is a delicious spin on the carb-rich dish we all love, shrimp and rice. It's a great combination and I'm here to share my healthy keto-friendly spin on this dish. (Tastes exactly like Chinese food.) Garnish with lemon wedge and extra parsley if desired.
