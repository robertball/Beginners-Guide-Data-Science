Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) refrigerated pie crust
1 cup fresh strawberries, hulled
3/4 cup water
3/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
3 tablespoons orange liqueur (such as Grand MarnierÂ®)
3 cups fresh strawberries, hulled

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake the pie crust in the preheated oven until puffed and golden-brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove to a wire rack and cool completely.
Puree 1 cup of strawberries in a blender until smooth. Pour pureed strawberries into a saucepan. Stir in the water, sugar, and cornstarch. Bring to a boil over medium heat until thickened, stirring often. Remove from heat and stir in the orange liqueur. Set aside.
Arrange the remaining 3 cups of strawberries decoratively in the prepared pie crust. Pour the glaze over the berries. Refrigerate until glaze is set, about 4 hours.

Description: 
Through trial, error and what I had in the house, I developed this easy glaze to make a yummy fresh strawberry pie -- almost easier than opening a container. Serve with sweetened whipped cream.
