Ingredients:
1/2 cup canola oil
1/2 cup Spenda sweetner
1/4 cup white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 bad prepackaged cole slaw with carrots and red cabbage in the salad section
3 scallions-chopped finely
2 cups cooked chopped chicken
1 package Ramen noodles
1/4 cup sliced almond
1/4 cup sesame seeds
2 Tablespoons butter

Directions:
Whisk canola oil, Splenda, white vinegar, soy sauce and sesame oil.  Heat in microwave until sugar is melted, about 45 seconds to 1 minute,  and let cool.
In a pan on top of the stove on medium heat, melt butter and saute the Ramen noodles first for about 2 minutes or until they start to brown. Add the almonds and sesame seeds and stir until mixture is browned and toasted, about 2 more minutes.  Be careful not to burn these by constantly stirring.  Set aside to cool.
In a large bowl, combine the coleslaw mix with the green onions. Add the chicken.  Pour dressing over and toss well. Top with the crunchy mixture and serve.
++Also..I am single so I usually make up the dressing in a cruet jar to go into the fridge and put the crunchy mixture in a plastic bag.  That way I can make up the salad individually and have it throughout the week. Great with chopped chicken too!
