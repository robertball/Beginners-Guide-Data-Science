Ingredients:
12 ounces fresh rhubarb, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
Place rhubarb pieces into a medium pot and sprinkle with sugar. Stir well to make sure rhubarb is completely covered with sugar. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes, stirring once, so natural juices will be released.
Bring rhubarb mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring often. Turn down heat and simmer until soft, about 10 minutes. Serve compote warm.
