Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, melted and cooled
1/2 cup light corn syrup
3 cups confectioners' sugar, divided
3/4 cup powdered milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a medium mixing bowl, stir together butter and chocolate.  Beat in corn syrup,  2 cups of confectioner's sugar, powdered milk and vanilla.  Dough will be stiff.
Sprinkle a work surface with the remaining 1 cup confectioners' sugar.  Turn dough out onto work surface and knead until remaining sugar is incorporated.  Shape into small logs and wrap in waxed paper.

Description: 
Although these are not an exact replica of the famous candies, they are delicious just the same.  Letting the dough rest for a few minutes after kneading may make rolling easier.
