Ingredients:
1/2 pound bacon
1/2 cup chicken broth
2/3 cup pine nuts (optional)
2 pounds Brussels sprouts, cored and shredded
3 green onions, minced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
pepper to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until crisp. Drain, reserving 2 teaspoons grease, crumble 2 slices and set aside. (Reserve the other bacon for other dishes.)  In the same skillet, add pine nuts to the reserved bacon grease, and cook, stirring until browned over medium heat.  Stir in chicken broth and minced garlic and heat just until bubbling. Add Brussels sprouts and green onions to the pan stirring thoroughly to coat, and season with sea salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat, covered, until sprouts are wilted and tender, 7 minutes. Stir in crumbled bacon just before serving.

Description: 
Not too often do you hear 'fantastic' and 'Brussels sprouts' in the same sentence but this recipe is deserving of that. When I mentioned I was bringing Brussels sprouts to a holiday get together, my mom told me not to bother.  After eating this dish, my family now requests I bring it to every get together!Modified from: Shredded Brussels Sprouts
