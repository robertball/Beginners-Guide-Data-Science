Ingredients:
1 head iceberg lettuce, cored and quartered
1 tomato, chopped
2 green onions, chopped
8 slices bacon
1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Arrange lettuce wedges on serving plates and top each wedge with tomato and green onion pieces.
Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels; chop when cool enough to handle. Transfer bacon to a bowl.
Dissolve brown sugar with red wine vinegar, salt, and black pepper in the hot skillet over medium heat, whisking until brown sugar has dissolved. Stir bacon into dressing; adjust seasoning. Pour hot bacon dressing over lettuce wedges.
