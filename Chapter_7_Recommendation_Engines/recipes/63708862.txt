Ingredients:
4 tbs unsalted butter
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries
1 cup fresh or frozen blackberries
1 cup fresh or frozen strawberries, quartered
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup yellow cornmeal
1 tbsp baking powder
1 tbsp salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup vegetable shortening
4 eggs
2 tbsp vanilla extract
3/4 cup plain greek yogurt
1 cup sweet corn kernals, pureed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Melt 4 tbsp butter in a 10 in round cake pan.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup sugar over the entire surface of the pan, then scatter on all of the three types of berries.
Sift together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt.
Cream remaining butter and sugar and vegetable shortening on medium speed until fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time.  Mix in vanilla, yogurt, and corn until just combined.
Gradually add flour mixture until thoroughly combined.  Spread batter over berries in pan.
Bake until a toothpick inserted in center of cake comes away clean, about 50 minutes.  Transfer cake to a rack and cool for 15 minutes.  Run a knife around the edge of the cake and then turn out onto a serving platter.
