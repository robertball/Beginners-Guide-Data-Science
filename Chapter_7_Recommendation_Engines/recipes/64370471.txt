Ingredients:
The Bomb Paleo Chili Ingredients:
Two pounds of ground meat. We used turkey and pork.
2 cans tomato paste (JUST tomato pulp)
1 can diced tomato (JUST tomato, water and salt)
4 cups Broth (we used bone broth, but beef or chicken broth will work fine!)
About 2 pounds diced vegetables. You want about half meat, half vegetables. We used:
 celery
 zucchini
 carrot
 onion
 crushed garlic
1 tbs of dark cocoa powder. Just trust me on this… it gives your chili and amazing smokey flavor!
1/4 cup Chili powder (this is NOT cayenne and should not be spicy!)
Chipotle powder or cayenne pepper to taste. Remember as it sits it will get hotter.
Salt/pepper to taste.

Directions:
– Brown ground meat, set aside.
– Add all the veggies with the broth and boil until veggies are tender.
– Add ALL ingredients to the crockpot and cook on high for 6 hours.
The best way to get a thick and hearty chili is to boil the excess liquid out of it! I boil mine until it has very little liquid left! This recipe easy to cook thanks to my Ninja 3 in 1 Cooking System! I was able to brown the meat, boil the vegetables and slow-cook the chili all in one pot! If you don’t have one you should check them out!!
