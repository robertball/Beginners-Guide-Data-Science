Nutella Buttercream Frosting directions: In a large bowl, mix butter and Nutella with electric mixer. Add in vanilla. Gradually add powered sugar, one cup at a time, beating on medium speed. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl often. Add milk and beat at medium speed until light and fluffy. Right before using the frosting, hand stir in the hazelnut mix.
