Ingredients:
5 pounds sifted all-purpose flour
8 1/4 cups shortening
3 cups cold water
2 tablespoons salt

Directions:
Place flour in a very large mixing bowl. Add shortening and cut it into flour with a pastry blender until  the crumbs are the size of peas.
Dissolve salt in the water and add the water to the flour mixture a small amount at a time mixing it just until the water is absorbed and the dough holds together.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for four hours. Use 14 oz of dough for a two crust 9 inch pie or 11oz of dough for an 8inch pie.
