Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
2 tablespoons butter
2/3 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons milk
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly dust a baking sheet with flour.
Whisk the 2 cups flour, salt, baking soda, and cream of tartar together in a mixing bowl. Cut in the butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir the buttermilk into the flour mixture until moistened.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly, for five or six turns. Pat or roll the dough to about 1-inch thick. Cut into rounds with a floured 2-inch cutter and arrange rounds on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the tops of the scones with milk and sprinkle with cinnamon.
Bake in the preheated oven until the scones have risen and are golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
When I was on a cruise in the Bahamas, I discovered scones. From then on, I have loved scones. Also try with 1 to 2 tablespoons of chocolate chips in place of the cinnamon.
