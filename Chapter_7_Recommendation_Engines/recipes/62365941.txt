Ingredients:
4 T flour
4 T sugar
1 egg
3 T buttermilk*
3 T oil
1/2 t baking soda
~1 T poppy seeds (or more depending on taste)
1 t lemon extract

Directions:
Mix everything together until all flour lumps are gone and eggs are stirred into the proceeding goop.
Microwave on high for 3 minutes in a large bowl that's microwave save or a gigantic mug.  I put a plate under mine in case it rises too high, but that's not happened yet.
Test with a toothpick and make sure the toothpick comes out clean, although if my parents' twenty-seven year old microwave can handle this recipe I'm sure other microwaves will be peachy!

Description: 
I read a recipe a while back about a chocolate cake that was cooked in 3 minutes in the microwave.  I didn't really believe it, but I tried it out and then proceeded to alter it to suit my own tastes because I thought it was too heavy and the texture was a bit wonky--if decent for instant chocolate fix at 12:00 a.m in the morning.  Still, the unpleasant texture just became more pronounced as I experimented with vanilla variations.  At last, here is my 5-minute lemon-poppy seed cake that rises beautifully and is light and airy-- unlike the chocolate cake.
