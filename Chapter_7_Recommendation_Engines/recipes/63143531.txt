Ingredients:
3 cups grated potato
4 T grated onion
2 eggs
6-8 saltine crackers (crushed in a baggie)
1/4 t pepper
1 t salt

Directions:
Using hand grater or food processor, grate potatoes alternating with onion.  Beat eggs, potatoes/onion mixture, salt, pepper and crackers together.
Mix well.
Add vegetable oil to pan about 1/2 inch deep and heat over medium to medium high.
Drop by spoonfulls into hot oil (carefully) letting some of the liquid from the mixture stay in the bowl before placing in hot pan.
Slightly flatten out each spoonfull with back of your spoon or utensil.
Cook until browned on one side (your preference on how crispy you like them). Flip and finish cooking until both sides are browned.  (if oil is hot, takes about 3-5 min per side). If oil level gets low, add more as needed.
Place on paper towel to drain.
Serve hot with sour cream and/or applesauce.

Description: 
Latke's (Potato pancakes) are a must have at Hanukkah, but really are wonderful any time of year! This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best lakte I've had. I usually end up having to make a second batch because they disappear so quickly.   I've tried other recipes and always return to these.  Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.
