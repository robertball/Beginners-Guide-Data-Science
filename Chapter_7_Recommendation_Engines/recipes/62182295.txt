Ingredients:
1 pre-made sugar cookie dough
1 block cream cheese
2 tspn. vanilla extract
1/2 cup powdered sugar (or substitute marshmallow fluff or whipped cream instead of powdered sugar to make it fluffier)
Fresh Fruit, sliced (I like strawberries, kiwi, pineapple, bananas, & blueberries)

Directions:
Bake the sugar cookie dough for 8-10 min. at 350.  Let it cool.
Mix together cream cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla.  Beat until well mixed and creamy.  You can substitute marshmallow fluff or whipped cream instead of the powdered sugar if you want it fluffier!
Spread mixture on cooled cookieâ€¦and decorate with your favorite fruit!
