Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
4 cups vegetable stock, divided
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups peeled and diced sweet potatoes
1 cup chickpeas, drained
1 cup uncooked brown rice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup peanut butter
2 cups chopped kale, stems removed
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons vegetable stock, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add remaining stock, sweet potatoes, chickpeas, brown rice, and salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cover the stew. Simmer until sweet potatoes and rice are tender, about 45 minutes.
Combine peanut butter with 1/2 cup of the liquid from the stew. Stir into a smooth paste.
Add the peanut butter mixture and kale to the stew. Cook until kale is wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice, soy sauce, and hot pepper sauce.
