Ingredients:
3 full sized chicken breasts boneless cut into 1 inch cubes
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil for cooking later
2 tbsp lime juice (I also get 1 fresh lime as finishing garnish with cooked brocheta)
1 tsp salt
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp cumin
1 tbsp oregano
1 tbsp garlic powder
1 tbsp dried cilantro
2 packets sazon by Goya if you can get the one without achiote, Fake color no good LOL as my mother in law would say

Directions:
In a airtight bag combine all dry ingredients, lime juice and EVOO.
Put all chicken kabab/brocheta cubes into the airtight bag and allow marinade to distribute evenly.
Allow marinade from 15 minutes to overnight in refrigerator.
Once ready to cook. Remove from fridge and allow 15 minutes before cooking to allow the meat to get room temperature.
Grab skillet large enough to prepare all the meat.
Preheat medium high (7 on my oven) and distribute meat over the hot skillet.
Cook each side about 4 minutes.  (Now remember, 1 inch cubes should be able to turn 4 ways.)
Remove from skillet and garnish with your favorite side of rice and beans or roasted potatoes!
