Description: 
This melt-in-your mouth cookie recipe was given to me by college roommate in the 1970's. Original recipe came from the Villager Restaurant in Lincoln, NE which is no longer in business. 
These cookies are too tender to roll & cut out, but kids can help roll the dough into balls and smash them with a glass.
