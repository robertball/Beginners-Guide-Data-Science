Ingredients:
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup cold brewed coffee
1/2 cup butter, melted and cooled to lukewarm
4 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 1/8 cups light brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
cooking spray

Directions:
Whisk together the milk, coffee, butter, and eggs in a bowl until evenly blended; set aside. In a large bowl, stir together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves; pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture, and stir just until combined. Set aside for 10 to 15 minutes.
Coat the bottom of a large skillet with cooking spray, and place pan over medium heat. Scoop large spoonfuls of batter onto the hot pan, and fry until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Continue with remaining batter.
