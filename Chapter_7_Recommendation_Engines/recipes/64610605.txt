Ingredients:
3 carrots, chopped into 3" pieces
2 onions, cut into 8 wedges
2 leeks, cleaned and chopped into 1" slices
1 apple cut into 8 wedges
3 stalks celery, cut into 3" pieces
1Â½ cups mayonnaise
1 large handful mixed herbs, roughly chopped (parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme)
1 12-pound turkey (14 pounds is absolute maximum unless you split in in half and cook on two baking sheets)
Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper

Directions:
Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Spread the vegetables and apple pieces over a 13" x 18" half baker sheet. Set aside.
In a small mixing bowl combine mayonnaise and chopped herbs. Set aside.
Slip your hands under the turkey skin to separate the skin from the flesh. Rub one half of the mayonnaise and herb mixture under the skin. Massage the remaining mayonnaise herb mixture over the skin. Season aggressively with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper.
Roast the turkey at 450 for about 80 minutes, until the internal temperature is between 155 and 160 degrees. Keep an eye on the turkey and cover with foil if the skin begins to get too brown. Check internal temperature after 1 hour.
Remove from the oven and let the turkey rest for 30 minutes before carving. The turkey will continue to cook out of the oven and the internal temperature will rise to 165 degrees.
