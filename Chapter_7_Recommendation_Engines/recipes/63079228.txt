Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cut into bite-size pieces
3 tablespoons curry paste (Thai red too hot)
1 small jar mango chutney
1 can coconut milk
1 cup diced mango
(green peas)

Directions:
Cook the onion, pepper and garlic in the oil until the onions are translucent, 2 to 3 minutes; add the chicken and cook about 30 seconds while stirring. Stir in the curry paste until the chicken is evenly coated. Pour the chutney and coconut milk into the pan; continue to cook until the chicken breasts is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes.  Add peas and mango.
