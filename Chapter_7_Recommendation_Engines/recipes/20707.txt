Ingredients:
1 (9 ounce) can bean dip
1 (6 ounce) container guacamole
12 ounces sour cream
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
1 tomato, chopped

Directions:
In a clear pie pan, or similar dish, spread a layer of bean dip. Top the bean dip with a layer of guacamole. Allow the layers to thicken in the refrigerator for approximately 20 minutes.
In a mixing bowl, while the bean dip and guacamole chill, combine the sour cream and taco seasoning. When the chilled mixture is sufficiently thickened, spread a layer of the sour cream mixture over the layer of guacamole. Top the sour cream layer with the grated cheese. Garnish the layers with the jalapenos and tomatoes.
