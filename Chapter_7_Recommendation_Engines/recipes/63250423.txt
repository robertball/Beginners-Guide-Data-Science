Ingredients:
2 C. Flour
1 tsp salt
10 2/3 Tbsp Shortening (I use Crisco butter flavored)
7 Tbsp cool tap water.
6 to 8 apples, peeled, pared, cored, and thinly sliced. (6 Cups)
1 C. Sugar
2 Tbsp Flour
1 tsp Cinnamon
Dash of nutmeg
2 to 4 Tbsp Butter

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees.
Crust:
Use pastry cutter to combine the 2 C. Flour, 1 tsp salt, 10 2/3 Tbsp Shortening.  Then add 7 Tbsp cool tap water and mix by hand.  Split dough in half and roll flat into circle slightly larger in diameter of your pie plat.  Roll the dough onto your rolling pin to easily unroll into pie plate.  Do the same with the other half to put on top of the pie at the end.
Pie filling;
Boil the apple pieces for 10 minutes to soften, then drain them.  Mix together the sugar, 2 Tbsp Flour, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Add the apple pieces and hang stir with spoon until all the apples of evenly covered.  Pour into pie crust and spread evenly.  Distribute the butter along the top, then add your top crust.  Pinch together the edges of your 2 crusts.  Using a fork pork holes in the top crust to allow steam to exit during cooking.  Sprinkle sugar on the top crust.  Bake for 50 minutes.
