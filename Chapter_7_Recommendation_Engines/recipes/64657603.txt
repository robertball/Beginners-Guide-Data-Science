Ingredients:
12 oz white chocolate chips
3 tbsps vegetable shortening
1/2 Tsp vanilla extract
3 drops of your choice food coloring

Directions:
Combine white chocolate chips and shortening in a medium bowl. Microwave for 1 minute until melt. Be careful not to burn. Stir well.
Line a 9-inch cake pan or tart pan with parchment paper or wax paper. Pour chocolate mixture into it.
Drop 3 drops of red food coloring into the chocolate mixture. Use more drops for a pinky color. Stir roughly with a spoon.
Line a kitchen cloth on your kitchen counter. Lift the pan with both of your hands to about 3 inches high from the counter surface and drop it on the cloth. Repeat until the chocolate mixture surface is flattened. Set aside for about 10 minutes.
When the chocolate starts to set (it becomes less shiny), use a mini heart-shaped cookie cutter to cut as many candies as you can.
Once dry, break up the candies around the hearts. Enjoy!
