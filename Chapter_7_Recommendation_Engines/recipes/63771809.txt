Description: 
I suffer from PTSD and invented this on a day when I was feeling too sick to seriously cook for my husband. It ended up being a low-cost, healthy, & flavorful dish that I made again the next day. The Ramen has a firm texture that highlights the soft, colorful veggies and unexpected peppery-ness of the sauce. The chicken stays moist and develops a light golden crust of sauce that really unifies the dish. Whether you're sick, busy, or a college student, one bite will make you crave Chicken & Veggie Ramen on any day when you just want some easy-to-make comfort food.
