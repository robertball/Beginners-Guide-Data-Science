1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup sour cream
1 1/2 cups cubed cooked chicken thigh meat
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
6 (12 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking dish.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the cream of mushroom soup and garlic powder, then stir in the green chiles and sour cream. Mix well. Reserve 3/4 of this sauce and set aside. To the remaining 1/4 of the sauce in the saucepan, add the chicken and 1/2 cup of shredded Cheddar cheese. Stir together.
Fill each flour tortilla with the chicken mixture and roll up. Place seam side down in the prepared baking dish.
In a small bowl combine the reserved 3/4 of the sauce with the milk. Spoon this mixture over the rolled tortillas and top with the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly.
