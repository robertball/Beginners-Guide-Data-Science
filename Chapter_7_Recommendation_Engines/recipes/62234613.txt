Ingredients:
8 flour tortillas, 6"
1 cup refried beans
1 pound ground beef (use taco seasoned)
4 T enchillada sauce or Taco Bell sauce (see clone)
1 cup cheese, shredded (I use montery jack & cheddar)
1/2 cup tomato, diced
2 green onions, diced

Directions:
Heat oven to 350.
Place tortillas directly on oven rack and bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until crispy.  Remove from oven.
In the interim, heat refried beans until hot and reserve for the recipe build.
Warm seasoned beef.
To build 1 Mexican Pizza:
*Place 1 crisp Mission tortilla on work surface.
*Evenly spread tortilla with 1/4 cup hot refried beans.
*Evenly top refried beans with 1/4 (approximately 4 ounces) of the cooked ground beef.
*Top ground beef with second crisp tortilla and evenly spread 1 to 2 heaping tablespoon of sauce over the tortilla.
*Evenly top the pizza sauce with 1/4 cup grated cheese and 2 tablespoons chopped tomatoes.
Repeat steps 1 through 5 for remaining 3 servings.
Place all 4 pizzas, at one time, in 350 degrees F oven on a cookie pan/flat pan, and bake for 2 minutes to melt the cheese.
Remove from oven, let cool slightly, cut, and serve with sour cream and avocado.
