Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 large white onion, thinly sliced
1 large clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
3 McIntosh apples, peeled and sliced
1/4 cup chopped canned jalapeno peppers
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium-low heat; add butter and raise heat to medium. Cook and stir onion in the melted butter until transparent and lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Add garlic and sea salt to onion mixture; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir apples and jalapeno peppers into onion mixture; cover skillet with a lid. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until apples are softened and transparent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add honey and simmer for 2 more minutes.

Description: 
This is a sassy chutney that leaves the taste buds yearning for more. Serve over grilled chicken breast, fish, or pork tenderloin. Great over a sweet potato. Add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon for a nice twist. Omit jalapenos if you prefer a mild chutney.
