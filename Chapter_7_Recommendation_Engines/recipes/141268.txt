Ingredients:
5 pounds beef short ribs, cut flanken style
5 cloves garlic
1 onion, coarsely chopped
1 Asian pear, cored and cubed
1 cup soy sauce (such as KikkomanÂ®)
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup sesame oil
black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the ribs in a large stockpot and cover with cold water.  Soak ribs, refrigerated, for 1 hour to pull out any blood. Drain.
Combine garlic, onion, and Asian pear in a blender and puree. Pour into a large bowl and stir in the soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, sesame oil, and black pepper. Marinate ribs in the soy mixture, covered, overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Grill ribs until the meat is tender and the outside is crusty, 5 to 10 minutes per side.

Description: 
Best Korean BBQ.  Traditionally galbi is cooked over wood charcoal but can be cooked by grill, oven, or using a non-stick frying pan. Instead of Asian pears, you can use rice wine or kiwis. You can also add green onions, sesame seeds or fresh ginger.
