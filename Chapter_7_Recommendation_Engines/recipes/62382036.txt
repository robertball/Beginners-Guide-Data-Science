6 boneless skinless chicken breasts
2 large jars of Medium Salsa - I use Chi-Chi's

3 cans mexicali corn drained
2 tablespoons ground cumin
2 tablespoons onion powder
2 tablespoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon chili powder
2-3 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Put chicken breasts into crock pot and cover with salsa.  Let cook on low for 6 hours or until chicken is cooked through and easily shreds.
Remove chicken from crock pot onto a cutting board and shred with two forks.
Add shredded chicken back to crock pot with remaining ingredients.  Mix well to combine.
Cook on high for an additional hour.
Serve with crushed tortilla chips, shredded cheese, chopped green onion and sour cream.
