Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons poppy seeds
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
2 cups milk
2 ripe bananas, mashed
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup fresh blueberries (optional)

Directions:
Whisk whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, poppy seeds, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add milk, bananas, coconut oil, honey, and vanilla extract; whisk together. Pour in flour mixture and stir until just combined.
Preheat a lightly oiled griddle on medium-low heat. Ladle batter 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared griddle, sprinkling a few blueberries over each pancake. Cook until bubbles start to appear and edges are dry, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until other side is browned, about 2 minutes.
