Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1 Tbsp. Worchestershire Sauce
1/4 cup white vinegar
chunk (about a tbsp) of margerine or butter
2 pounds chipped (or fine sliced) baked or cooked ham
8 pack of hamburger buns

Directions:
Break up ham a bit, so that it can be served on a bun.  Place ham in medium size pot on stove or crock pot.  Mix together all ingredients except ham & hamburger buns.  Whisk so evenly blended.  Pour over ham, toss so it's evenly coated.  Slow cook in crockpot for about 1 hour or 2 (if prefered) or cook over medium heat on stove 20 minutes or until heated through.  Serve on bun.

Description: 
This is a favorite New Year's Eve sandwich with my family & has been for years.  I love BBQ and I love Ham, so I thought I would combine the two.  Making my own BBQ sauce made all the difference in taste.  I like to cook it slowly in a crockpot, but you can do it up quickly if you wish.  We serve it on a hamburger bun, it can be messy, but the kids like it this way.  Enjoy!
