Ingredients:
9 ounces ground chicken
1/4 cup cooked, diced ham
1 egg
1/2 cup bread crumbs
8 ounces Swiss cheese, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
canola oil for pan-frying

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine the chicken, ham, and egg in a large bowl until well blended. Gradually add bread crumbs until the mixture loses its stickiness and can be easily formed into balls.
Form the chicken mixture around the cheese cubes, forming 2 inch balls. Place on a plate.
Heat 1 1/2 inches of oil in a deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry the balls until the outsides are golden brown, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels, and place in baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until cooked through and cheese is soft, about 20 minutes. Cool briefly before serving.

Description: 
I created this recipe to try to duplicate some appetizers I had last summer from Stew Leonard's famous dairy retail store in Connecticut. They are great as appetizers or as a fun food for kids. I love to make them with bread crumbs seasoned with Parmesan cheese. Enjoy!
