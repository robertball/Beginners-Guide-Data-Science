1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef consomme (such as Campbell's Â®)
1/2 cup water
1 cup white rice
1 small white onion, chopped
1 stick butter, cut into 4 pieces
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir the mushrooms with juice, beef consomme, water, rice, and onion together in a glass baking dish with a lid. Arrange the butter atop the rice. Season with the garlic powder. Cover with lid.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the top and return to the oven until the cheese melts slightly, about 5 minutes.
