3 pounds cabbage, cored and chopped
1/2 pound thick-cut bacon, chopped
2 cups water, or more as needed

1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring cabbage, bacon, 2 cups water, and  vinegar to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until cabbage is very tender, about 3 hours, adding more water as needed.

Description: 
Very tender, very flavorful vegetable side. Based on this recipe, seems like Army cooks don't think much of cabbage.
