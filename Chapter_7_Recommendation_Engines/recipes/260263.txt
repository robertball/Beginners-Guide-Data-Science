Ingredients:
11 large eggs, divided
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups breakfast sausage

Directions:
Preheat oven to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C).
Beat 1 egg in a bowl using an electric mixer. Add flour, milk, baking powder, brown sugar, and salt. Mix until smooth like pancake batter.
Whisk the remaining eggs in a separate bowl until fluffy.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook sausage, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes.
Pour about 1/4 inch of pancake batter into each cup of a 12-cup muffin tin. Add 1/4 inch of beaten eggs to each cup.
Bake in the preheated oven, about 8 minutes. Top cupcakes with sausage and continue baking until set, about 8 minutes more. Let cool, about 5 minutes.
