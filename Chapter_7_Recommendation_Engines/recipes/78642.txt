Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 slices EARTH GRAINS® Buttermilk bread
24 fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons minced green onions
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 cup small shrimp
1 egg, beaten
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
3/4 cup reduced-fat Swiss cheese
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup dry white wine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray. In a food processor, process bread to make small crumbs; you should have 1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs.
Remove stems from mushrooms. Set aside caps. Finely chop stems.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the chopped stems, green onions, and garlic, and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Stir in lemon juice, shrimp, bread crumbs, egg, red pepper flakes and 1/4 cup Swiss cheese. Thoroughly blend the mixture. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
Stuff mushroom caps generously with the green onion and shrimp mixture. Brush the outside of the caps with remaining olive oil, and arrange in pan. Top with remaining cheese. Pour wine into the pan around the mushrooms.
Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 15 to 20 minutes, until cheese is melted and lightly browned. Serve warm.
