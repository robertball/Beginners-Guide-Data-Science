Ingredients:
1/4 cup margarine, softened
1 cup creamy style peanut butter
1/4 cup egg substitute
2 tablespoons honey
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Beat margarine and peanut butter in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, approximately 1 minute.
Add egg substitute, honey and vanilla.  Beat on high speed for approximately 1 1/2 minutes.
Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and beat on medium speed until well blended, approximately 30 seconds.
Combine flour, baking soda and salt in a small mixing bowl.  Slowly add flour mixture to peanut butter mixture, beating on low speed until well-blended, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Mixture may be crumbly.
Roll level tablespoons of dough into balls and drop onto a lightly oiled or parchment lined sheet pan, two inches apart.  Flatten each ball with a fork, pressing a crisscross pattern into each cookie.  Bake 7-9 minutes or until light brown around the edges.  Cool on wire rack.
