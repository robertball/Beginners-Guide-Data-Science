Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs ground beef
1 lb mild Italian pork sausage
1 large carrot, shredded
1 medium onion, diced
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon diced garlic
2 eggs
a few grinds of black pepper
50 lumpia wrappers (Keep covered with a damp paper towel, to prevent drying out.)

Directions:
In a big bowl, mix up everything except for the wrappers, like you were making meatloaf or meatballs.
Place a wrapper on your work surface. Grab a small handful of the meat mixture (2-3 tablespoons) and work it into a rope as long as your wrapper is wide. It should be about 1/2" thick. Lay this along the edge of the wrapper. Roll tightly, straight up; no fancy folding in the sides or anything. Use a bit of water on your finger or a pastry brush to seal up the edge. Repeat.
When you are done rolling, use a sharp knife to cut the lumpia in half.
Now you can either pop the lumpia into Ziplock bags, and into the freezer; or you can fry them up immediately, and eat until you pass out.
To prepare them, just deep fry over medium heat until golden brown.
You can serve them with sweet and sour sauce, sweet chili sauce, or soy sauce with a squeeze of lime and a dash of spicy vinegar.
Enjoy!
