Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup uncooked white rice
2 pounds boneless pork loin, cut into 1 inch cubes
1 onion, chopped
4 tomatoes, cut into bite size pieces
2 teaspoons fish sauce
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
Heat oil in a large skillet or wok. Add pork and onion and stir-fry until done and no pink is showing. Stir in tomatoes and steam until tomatoes are semi-soft. Remove from heat and stir in the cooked rice. Add the fish sauce and beaten egg and stir well; the egg will thicken the mixture. Then it is Kal Pot and ready to serve!

Description: 
Fish sauce, egg and rice stirred into a pork, onion and tomato stir-fry. Truly Thai; this recipe came over from Thailand when my cousin brought his wife and son home upon returning from the service! My cousin's wife taught me how to make this dish. To make it spicy, add hot pepper sauce or dried hot peppers!
