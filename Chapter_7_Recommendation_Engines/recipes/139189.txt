Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg yolk
1 egg
1/2 cup Irish cream liqueur
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon baking powder

Directions:
Cream together butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in vanilla and egg yolk until combined, then beat in egg; beat until smooth. Pour in Irish cream, and beat until incorporated.
Sift together flour, salt, and baking powder. Stir into butter mixture until evenly mixed. Form into a flattened ball, wrap well with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 2 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
Roll dough out to 1/4 inch thickness on a floured work surface. Cut into shapes using cookie cutters and place onto prepared baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown around the edges, 6 to 8 minutes. Cool on a wire rack until they reach room temperature.

Description: 
These are deliciously soft moist sugar cookies with the creamy richness of Bailey's Irish Cream! Wonderful as a St. Patrick's day treat or for any day you're craving a sugar cookie. I brought these to a party and within minutes, they disappeared. Feel free to omit the Bailey's and just cut down the flour by about half a cup.
