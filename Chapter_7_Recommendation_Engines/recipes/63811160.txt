Ingredients:
Ingredients:
1 medium onion, diced
1 lb. ground beef or turkey
1 tbsp. chili powder
1 tsp. ground cumin
1 tsp. dried oregano
¾ tsp. kosher salt
½ tsp. garlic powder
¼ tsp. cayenne pepper (optional)
28 oz. can diced tomatoes, drained
15 oz. can black beans, rinsed and drained
1¼ c. buttermilk (you can add 1½ tbsp. lemon or lime juice to regular milk and let stand for a few minutes as a substitute)
1 egg
2 tbsp. vegetable oil
1¼ c. cornmeal
¾ tsp. kosher salt
¾ tsp. baking soda
1 c. shredded Mexican cheese
1 jalapeno, thinly sliced, or ¼ c. pickled jalapeno slices (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a 9 x 13? pan with cooking spray.
Spray a large skillet with cooking spray, and heat over medium-high heat. Saute onion for 3-5 minutes, until translucent. Add meat, chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Stir together, and brown and crumble meat until almost cooked through.
Stir in tomatoes and beans, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer for about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together buttermilk, egg, and vegetable oil. Add cornmeal, salt, and baking soda, and stir together until combined.
Transfer meat mixture to prepared baking dish. Sprinkle cheese over the top. Pour cornbread batter evenly over meat, and arrange jalapeno slices over the top (if desired).
Bake in preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, until cornbread topping is evenly browned.
