Ingredients:
21/4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
Coarse salt
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
11/4 cups chicken stock
12 ounces baby fingerling potatoes or halved small potatoes
5 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
1/2 cup green olives, such as Cerignola, pitted if desired
1 small lemon, washed well, cut into wedges
6 thyme sprigs
1 teaspoon cornstarch

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450Â°. Season chicken with salt. Heat a large, heavy ovenproof skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat. Swirl in oil. Cook chicken, skin side down, until browned, about 5 minutes. Flip chicken, and push to side of skillet. Add 1 cup stock and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add potatoes to liquid. Bring to a boil. Add garlic, olives, lemon wedges, and thyme to liquid. Return to a boil.
Transfer skillet to oven. Roast, stirring potatoes halfway through, until potatoes are tender and chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes.
Return skillet to stove. Mix cornstarch with remaining 1/4 cup stock, and stir into pan. Bring to a boil to thicken sauce. Serve immediately.
