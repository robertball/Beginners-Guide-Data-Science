Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups old-fashioned oats
2 1/4 cups packed light brown sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 large egg, slightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix oats, brown sugar, flour, and salt together in a bowl. Stir in melted butter until well blended. Pour in egg and vanilla extract and mix until well blended.
Drop dough by 1/2 teaspoonfuls, at least 2 inches apart, on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cool slightly until firm, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool completely. Continue baking remainder of cookies, 1 cookie sheet at a time, according to instructions.

Description: 
These are delicate lace cookies with an amazing taste! A tradition in our family for Christmas since I was a little girl. These cookies spread to make a very thin wafer, almost transparent. Super easy to make, but be careful, as they can be quick to burn or cool too much on your cookie sheet - and then you'll be chipping the cookies off of your cookie sheet! I hope you enjoy these as much as my family does. Store in an airtight container until serving.
