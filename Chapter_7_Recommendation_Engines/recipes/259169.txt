Description: 
Al was my stepdad, who was a wonderful man and a great cook! One of his specialties was his Bloody Mary, and no matter how many pitchers he prepared for company, they always wanted more. My only modification has been to add a bit of horseradish. This is a great brunch beverage, but various friends always ask if I'll please make 'Al's Bloodys' when they come for dinner.
