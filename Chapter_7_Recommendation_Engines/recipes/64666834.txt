https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2(3-4) LBS OF CHICKEN
3/4 CUP PACKED LIGHT BROWN SUGAR
1/2 CUP OF PEANUT OIL
3/4 CUP GROUND ALLSPICE
3/4 CUP MINCED SCALLIONS
1/4 CUP MINCED GINGER
1/3 CUP GROUND BLACK PEPPER
1/4 CUP KOSHER SALT
1/4 CUP MINCED GARLIC
1/4 CUP FRESH LIME JUICE
2 TBS SOY SAUCE
1 TBS DRIED THYME
1 TEASPOON GROUND CINNAMON
1 TEASPOOM GRATED NUTMEG
1/2 TEASPOON GROUND CLOVES
8 CLOVES OF GARLIC
3 SCOTCH BONNET CHILE OR HABANERO CHILES, STEMMED AND MINCED

Directions:
COMBINE SUGAR, ALLSPICE, SCALLIONS, OIL, PEPPER, SALT, GINGER, LIME JUICE, SOY SAUCE, THYME, NUTMEG, CINNAMON, CLOVES, GARLIC, AND CHILI'S IN A BOWL.
OPTIONAL ADD:
1/2 YELLOW ONION
1 PACKET OF SAZON SEASONING
1/4 CUP OF SPICED RUM
(CHOPPED OR BLENDED WITH RECIPE ABOVE)
ADD CHICKEN, TOSS TO COAT CHICKEN IN JERK SEASONING. CHILL AT LEAST 6 HOURS OR OVERNIGHT.
HEAT GRILL TO MEDIUM. OR MEDIUM HOT- WHATEVER THAT MEANS (SHRUGS)
SERIOUSLY MAKE SURE GRILL IS NOT SCORCHING YOU DON'T WANT TO SEAR THE MEAT TOO QUICKLY, I SAY 350 DEGREES.  YOU WANT A NICE CRUST OF THE MARINADE ON THE CHICKEN. PLACE CHICKEN SKIN SIDE DOWN , TURNING ONCE UNTIL MARINADE CRUST FORMS ON THE OUTSIDE (ABOUT 8 MINUTES).
COVER GRILL, CONTINUE COOKING  UNTIL DONE. (USUALLY TAKING 40 MIN MAX DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE CHICKEN IF THERE IS BONE IN OR NOT).
(ALTERNATIVELY) IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GRILL TRANSFER CHICKEN TO A FOILED-LINED BAKING SHEET; PREHEAT OVEN 350 TO 375 AND BAKE FOR 30 MIN, COVERED IN ALUMINUM FOIL AND UNCOVER TO BROWN THE CHICKEN. MAKE SURE YOU TURN THE CHICKEN TO BROWN ON BOTH SIDES.
RECIPE IS BY SAVEUR / MATT TAYLOR- GROSS VIA YUMMLY RECIPES
OPTIONAL HABITS OF   -MIEKELL.
BLENDING THE RECIPES IN A BLENDER PRIOR TO ADDING THE CHICKEN IS MY PREFERENCE .  I ALSO PERSONALLY LIKE TO POKE A KNIFE THROUGH THE MEAT AFTER I COAT IT IN THE MARINADE AS ADDED INSURANCE THAT THE FLAVOR WILL GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
ALSO PRIOR TO ME BAKING OR GRILLING ANY MEAT, I WRAP IT IN ALUMINUM FOIL AND LET IT COOK FOR 20 MIN OR LONGER ON 350, LONG ENOUGH FOR THE JUICES TO RUN CLEAR. I HAVE A BOWL ON THE SIDE AND I POUR THE JUICES IN THAT BOWL AND THROW AWAY THE ALUMINUM FOIL.  I ADD A LITTLE OIL TO THE BOWL AND USE THAT AS A GLAZE TO BRUSH ON MY CHICKEN AS IT'S GRILLING. OMG SO TASTY.
FOR THIS RECIPE I MADE WINGS.
AFTER THE WINGS WERE NEARING TO A FINISH. I TURNED MY OVEN ON 170. PLACED THE WINGS ON A COOKIE SHEET AND COVERED THEM WITH THE REST OF THE GLAZE AND PLACED IN THE OVEN FOR 10 MINUTES.
VOILA!

I'M NOT JAMAICAN,  I WAS JUST RAISED WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE, SO I CAN'T TAKE FULL CREDIT AND I WON'T. THIS RECIPE MIGHT NOT BE EXACT OF WHAT YOU MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED BEFORE BUT IT'S CLOSE .
