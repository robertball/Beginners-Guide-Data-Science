Description: 
This is a simple recipe best suited for cold nights. The corn adds a nice crunchy contrast to the creamy boiled down rice and soft chicken. This can be made on the stove top as well but you would lose some of the creaminess. Drizzle some sesame oil and add a dash of white pepper on top and it's a meal on its own.
