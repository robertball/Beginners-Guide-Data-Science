Ingredients:
4 cups fresh blackberries, washed and drained well
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/3 cup white sugar
3/4 cup quick cooking oats
1/3 cup flour
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup softened butter
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly butter a 2-quart casserole dish.
Place berries in large bowl. Pour in lemon juice; sprinkle sugar evenly over berries. Gently stir to combine. Transfer to prepared casserole dish. Gently pat down berries with the back of a spoon and level the surface.
Place rolled oats, flour, brown sugar, butter, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Mix together with a fork until mixture is blended and crumbly, about 1 minute.
Distribute crisp mixture over the top of the berries and smooth out with a tip of a fork so all berries are covered.
Bake in preheated oven until dark and berries are bubbling, about 45 minutes. Allow crisp to cool somewhat and firm up. Serve warm.

Description: 
Actually any berry will work in this recipe (even frozen, if you must), but the dark, sweet blackberries are my favorite. Served barely warm, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, it just doesn't get much better than this.
