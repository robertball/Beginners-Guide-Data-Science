Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 red onion, finely chopped
1 green bell pepper, finely chopped
1/3 cup minced garlic
1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
1/2 cup barbeque sauce
1/2 cup bread crumbs
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Mix together the ground beef, red onion, green pepper, garlic, onion soup mix, barbeque sauce, bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper in a large mixing bowl. Divide the ground beef mixture into 8 equal balls and form each one into a patty. Place the patties on a baking sheet, cover, and refrigerate for at least one hour to allow all of the flavors to come together.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
Cook the patties to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), about 6 minutes per side for well done burgers.
