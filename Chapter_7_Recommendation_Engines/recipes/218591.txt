Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 clove garlic, crushed and chopped
1 (8 ounce) package portobello mushrooms, stemmed and cut into 1/2-inch wide by 2-inch long pieces
1 leek, chopped
1 cup chicken broth
1 bunch Swiss chard, trimmed and chopped
2 cups grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the red pepper, garlic, and portobello mushrooms. Cook and stir until the mushroom has softened and begun to release its liquid, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the leek, and continue cooking until the leek has softened, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the chicken broth and Swiss chard. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover, and simmer until the chard leaves have wilted, about 10 minutes. Remove the lid, and continue cooking until the chard is tender and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese; let stand until melted.

Absolutely delicious way to make Swiss chard. It has a comforting flavor and beautiful presentation. The colors are amazing and I often prepare this for family for Christmas dinner paired with standing rib roast and mashed potatoes and gravy. A huge hit in my family!
