Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/2 cup mesquite-lime marinade
1/2 head lettuce, torn into small pieces
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup large cheese and garlic croutons
1/2 cup creamy Caesar-style salad dressing

Directions:
In a shallow baking pan, arrange chicken and pour mesquite-lime marinade over all.  Cover and place in the refrigerator to marinate for 1/2 hour before grilling.
Grill chicken breasts for approximately 15 minutes on each side, or until no longer pink inside.  Remove from heat, cool and slice into strips.
In a large bowl, toss together the lettuce, cheese, croutons, dressing and chicken until evenly coated.  Serve immediately.
