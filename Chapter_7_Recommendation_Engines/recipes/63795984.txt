Description: 
In all seriousness, this has changed my level of “chef worthiness” in the eyes of friends and family.  My husband swears I could make millions off of just this Pesto recipe!  Of course I am still just a wanna-be cook…but this simple Pesto recipe could fool the best of them!  The simplicity and the quality of the ingredients is what makes it so fantastic.
