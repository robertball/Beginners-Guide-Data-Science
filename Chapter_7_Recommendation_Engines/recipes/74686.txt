Ingredients:
1/2 cup white wine vinegar
1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
4 sprigs fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 tablespoon capers, drained
1 tablespoon oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and sliced
1 1/2 pounds salmon fillets
freshly ground black pepper to taste
4 kalamata olives, pitted and sliced

Directions:
In a shallow baking dish, mix the white wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, Italian seasoning, rosemary, tarragon, capers, and sun-dried tomatoes. Place the salmon fillets into the dish, and turn to coat with the marinade. Season with pepper, and sprinkle with olives. Cover, and refrigerate 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake uncovered for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork.
