Ingredients:
Home made ground beef meat sauce
12 dry lasagna noodles
2 eggs, beaten
1 pint whole milk ricotta cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup mozzarella cheese shredded
1 pound mozzarella cheese sliced
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat the homemade meat sauce.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles, and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, or until al dente; drain. Lay noodles flat on towels, and blot dry.
In a medium bowl, mix together eggs, ricotta, 1 cup shredded mozzarella, Parmesan cheese, parsley and 1 teaspoon salt.
Laddle enough sauce in pan to cover the bottom.
Layer 1/3 of the lasagna noodles in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover noodles with 1/2 ricotta mixture, 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese and 1/3 of the sauce. Repeat. Top with remaining noodles and sauce. Sprinkle additional Parmesan cheese over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Lasagna appeals to the eye as well as to the taste buds. Here, ground beef meat sauce, with ricotta, Parmesan, mozzarella, eggs and parsley are the filling for this layered casserole. Prepare up to 2 days in advance, if desired, and chill covered in the refrigerator until ready to bake. Increase the baking time by about 15 minutes.Modified from: American Lasagna
