Description: 
I needed to make something for a pot luck lunch. In my refrigerator I had cream cheese, goat cheese, and half of a jar of roasted red peppers! After raiding the pantry and herb garden, I came up with this spread! It was a hit!  Definitely a quick and easy recipe that results in tons of flavor!
