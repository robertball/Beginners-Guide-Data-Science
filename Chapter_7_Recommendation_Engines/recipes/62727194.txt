Better Than Restaurant-Style Buffalo Chicken Wings Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon sea salt
2.5lbs chicken wings or 2.5lbs boneless chicken strips
oil for deep frying
1 cup butter
1 cup Franks hot buffalo sauce
4 dashes ground black pepper
4 dashes garlic powder

Directions:
In a small bowl mix together the flour, paprika, cayenne pepper and salt. Place chicken wings in a large nonporous glass dish or bowl and sprinkle flour mixture over them until they are evenly coated. Cover dish or bowl and refrigerate for 90 minutes.
Heat oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). The oil should be just enough to cover wings entirely, an inch or so deep. Combine the butter, hot sauce, pepper and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir together and heat until butter is melted and mixture is well blended. Remove from heat and set aside.
Fry coated wings in hot oil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until parts of wings begin to turn brown. Remove from heat,then place wings in a 9x13 cake pan. I like to spray the pan with butter spray before putting wings in. Pour sauce all over the wings and stir them around to get even coverage on the chicken. Bake @350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes. Serve with ranch! Look up my recipe for homemade ranch. I think it's the best with these wings.
