Ingredients:
8 vanilla sandwich cookies (Golden Oreos)
3.4 oz package instant cheesecake pudding mix
2 C milk
8 strawberries, rinsed and stems removed
2 T sugar
2 oz water

Directions:
Place cookies in blender and blend until they become crumbs.  You'll probably need to stir the cookies with a spoon a couple times to help break them up.
Make cheesecake pudding according to package directions, then stir in cookie crumbs.
Rinse out blender, then add strawberries, sugar and water.  Blend until smooth.
Fill popsicle molds 1/3 full with pudding mixture, then add strawberry puree until they're 2/3 full.  Top off with remaining pudding mixture.
Place sticks into the popsicle molds and freeze overnight.  If the popsicles are difficult to remove, just run the mold under hot water for about a minute and they should slide out.

Description: 
These ice pops are so good!  They're very reminiscent of the strawberry shortcake ice cream bars you can buy with the pink and white cookie bits on the outside.  Feel free to use sugar free pudding mix.  The number of popsicles you get will depend on the size of your molds.
