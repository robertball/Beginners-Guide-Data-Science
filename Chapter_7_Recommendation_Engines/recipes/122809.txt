Ingredients:
1 large navel orange
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg, beaten
1 cup milk
1/2 cup chopped nuts

Directions:
Peel orange (save fruit for another use).  Place the peel in a small saucepan and cover with water; cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes.  Drain.  Cover peel again with water and cook for 3 minutes; drain.  Finely chop peel; set aside.
In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.  Combine egg and milk; stir into dry ingredients just until combined.  Fold in nuts and orange peel.  Pour batter into three greased and floured 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.  Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to a wire rack.

Description: 
'This recipe from my grandma is an oldie but a goodie,' promises Sue Gronholz from Columbus, Wisconsin. 'The peel of an orange (not the juice) provides the sunny flavor in these nut-studded loaves. Slices are especially yummy spread with cream cheese.'
