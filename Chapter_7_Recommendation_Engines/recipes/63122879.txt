Ingredients:
1 large spaghetti squash
1/2 package bacon (natural preferred)
1 large onion, coarsely chopped
1 eggplant
2 cups fresh spinach leaves
1 can coconut milk
1 tsp italian herb blend
2-4 tablespoons nutritional yeast
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut squash in half lengthwise.  Scrape out seeds.  Place flesh side down in a glass baking dish with 1/4 cup water.  Microwave for 10-12 minutes on high or bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook bacon in a large, deep skillet or wide pot and set aside to drain.  Leave a small amount of bacon fat in pan (approximately 1 tablespoon), and saute onion and eggplant over medium heat.  Add garlic and herbs.  When onion is transluscent, add coconut milk and cook until warmed through (about2-4 minutes).  Remove from heat and use a stick blender to blend sauce.
Place pan back on heat just until warmed through.  Stir in crumbled bacon and spinach.
Use a fork to scrape squash from skin.  Top with warm sauce and sprinkle with nutritional yeast to taste.
