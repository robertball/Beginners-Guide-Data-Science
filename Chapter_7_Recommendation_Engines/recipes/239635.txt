Ingredients:
1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage
1 1/4 teaspoons red pepper flakes
4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1 large onion, diced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
8 3/4 cups chicken broth
6 potatoes, thinly sliced
6 cups chopped fresh kale
1 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Cook and stir Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until sausage is browned and crumbly, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer sausage mixture to a bowl.
Stir bacon into the same Dutch oven and cook over medium heat until bacon is crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain fat, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings in the Dutch oven.
Stir onion and garlic into bacon; cook and stir until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour chicken broth into bacon mixture; bring to a boil. Stir potatoes and kale into broth; cook until potatoes are tender and soup is flavorful, about 15 minutes.
Stir sausage and heavy whipping cream into soup, reduce heat to medium, and cook until soup is heated through, about 5 minutes more.
