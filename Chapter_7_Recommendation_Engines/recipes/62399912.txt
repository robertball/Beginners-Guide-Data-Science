Sparkling Fruit Fusion Recipe

Ingredients:
Equal parts of the following liquids:
Your base:
Sparkling soda or 7-Up or even flavoured sparkling water.
Equal parts of 2 complimentary juices (passion fruit and guava go well together -- apple and mango do not)
Equal parts of 2 varieties of complimentary fresh or frozen fruits.
1 750 ml bottle of mild white wine (Sauvignon Blanc, Pinto Grigio, Pinot Blanc - even the dreaded White Zin!)
Wedges of lime for garnish.

Directions:
Fill a pitcher with your liquid mix  (sparkling base, your two juices, and the wine)
Add your equal parts of 2 juices
Add the fresh or frozen fruit (I like the berry mix from Trader Joe's for a "red" drink and pineapple/mango for a "yellow")
Pour entire bottle of wine into the pitcher
Lots of ice - crushed is best in a large balloon glass
You cannot go wrong topping with a wedge of lime
Enjoy!
