Ingredients:
3/4 cup warm vegetable stock, divided
1/4 cup golden raisins
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 shallot, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons black sesame seeds
1/4 cup shredded carrots
1/3 cup chopped almonds
1 cup fonio grains
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/8 cup pomegranate seeds

Directions:
Combine 1/2 cup vegetable stock and raisins in a bowl and set aside.
Heat oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Cook shallot, garlic, black sesame seeds, carrots, and almonds until fragrant and softened, about 4 minutes. Add fonio and stir to absorb flavors, about 2 minutes. Pour in raisins and stock and stir until fonio has absorbed all the liquid, about 5 minutes. Add some remaining stock and cook until the fonio is soft. You may not need the entire amount, depending on the brand and quality of the fonio. Season with salt and pepper.
Remove from heat once all liquid is absorbed. Fluff with a fork and sprinkle with fresh pomegranate seeds before serving.

Description: 
Fonio grains are mixed with aromatic vegetables, sesame seeds, nuts, and raisins for a nutritious alternative to rice pilaf. Serve this with your favorite savory meat or fish dish. Fonio is one of the most forgiving grains out there. It reheats splendidly, too. This dish can be made ahead of time and simply reheated by adding a bit of stock and a turn or two in the microwave.
