Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 pinch salt (optional)

Directions:
Combine the butter, flour and confectioners' sugar together. At first it will have a pie crust consistency. Roll into one large log and wrap in wax paper or plastic wrap. Chill for at least one hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Slice chilled log into 1/4 inch thick slices. Place cookies on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until edges just begin to turn golden, about 10 minutes. Watch carefully so they don't burn.
