4 cups rolled oats
1 cup wheat germ
1/2 cup flax seed meal
1/2 cup sliced almonds
1/2 cup walnuts
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
5 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce
2 tablespoons agave nectar
3 tablespoons (blank) sugar-free pancake syrup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Mix oats, wheat germ, flax seed meal, almonds, walnuts, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Whisk applesauce, agave syrup, and pancake syrup together in a separate bowl; drizzle over the oats mixture and stir until evenly coated. Spread oats mixture onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake, stirring every 20 minutes, in preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes; cool completely before storing in an airtight container.
