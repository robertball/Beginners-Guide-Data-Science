Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup uncooked white rice
1 pound lean ground beef
1/4 cup soy sauce, divided
3 tablespoons teriyaki sauce (such as Golden DragonÂ® Thick Teriyaki Sauce), divided
2 tablespoons curry powder, divided
1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, 1 dash soy sauce, 1 tablespoon teriyaki sauce, and 1 tablespoon curry powder in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Stir mushrooms and frozen vegetables into beef; reduce heat to medium-low and cook and stir until heated through, about 2 minutes. Fold rice into beef mixture; stir in remaining soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, and curry powder. Add cumin; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.
