Description: 
I grew up just outside of a Mexican border town, and at least twice month my grandmother would take me across the border to do some shopping. I remember the food stands found at every corner street and almost all of them sold elotes. It was one of my favorite vendor foods. Every time I make it, I am reminded of my childhood.
