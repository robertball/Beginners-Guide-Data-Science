Ingredients:
2 cups cake flour, more as needed
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
3 tablespoons sugar
5 tablespoons cold butter, cut into pieces
1 egg
1/2 to 3/4 cup heavy cream, more for brushing

Directions:
Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Put the flour, salt, baking powder and 2 tablespoons of the sugar in a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles cornmeal.
Add the egg and just enough cream to form a slightly sticky dough. If itâ€™s too sticky, add a little flour, but very little; it should still stick a little to your hands.
Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead once or twice, then press it into a 3/4-inch-thick circle and cut into 2-inch rounds with a biscuit cutter or glass. Put the rounds on an ungreased baking sheet. Gently reshape the leftover dough and cut again. Brush the top of each scone with a bit of cream and sprinkle with a little of the remaining sugar.
Bake for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the scones are a beautiful golden brown. Serve immediately.
