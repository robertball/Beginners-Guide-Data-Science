Ingredients:
1/2 large onion, sliced
4 - 6 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced
1 - 1 1/2 lb lean ground beef
1/2 cup long grain rice
1 cup (or more) frozen mixed vegetables
10 oz condensed tomato soup

taco seasoning, to taste (usually 1/2 - 1 pkg)
1/2 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce (optional)

Directions:
Brown beef, stirring to break up lumps.
Add taco seasoning and Worcestershire sauce, to taste. Simmer a few minutes.
Meanwhile, place sliced onions over bottom of large (2 quart/2.5L) casserole or roaster.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Arrange potatoes evenly over onions; sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Layer browned beef over potatoes.
Sprinkle uncooked rice evenly over meat.
Spread frozen vegetables evenly over rice.
Mix soup and water together.

Bake, covered, in 350 oven x 2+ hours, until potatoes are tender.
Baking a bit longer gives this casserole a nice roasted flavor.
