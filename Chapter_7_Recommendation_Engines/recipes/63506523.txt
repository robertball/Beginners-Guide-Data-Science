Beat sugar, chocolate syrup, and cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth.  Add whipping cream; beat on medium speed until light and fluffy.  Spread over cake.  Sprinkle with chocolate-covered toffee candy.
Spread frosting over cake.  Sprinkle with toffee candy. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, but no longer than 24 hours to set dessert and blend flavors.
