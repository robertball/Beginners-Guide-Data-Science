Ingredients:
12 ounces ziti or other small tube pasta
2 pounds ground beef
1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
2 eggs
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
2 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions.  Meanwhile, in a skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain.  Stir in spaghetti sauce.  In a bowl, combine the eggs, ricotta cheese, 1-1/2 cups mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese.
Drain pasta; add to cheese mixture and toss to coat.  Spoon a third of the meat sauce into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; top with half of the pasta mixture.  Repeat layers.  Top with remaining meat sauce.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 40 minutes.  Uncover; sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese.  Bake 5-10 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.  Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I enjoy making this dish for family and friends.  It's easy to prepare, and I like to get creative with the sauce.  For example, sometimes I might add my home-canned tomatoes, mushrooms or vegetables. -Elaine Anderson Aliquippa, Pennsylvania
