1  egg
2 tablespoons orange juice

Cut chicken breasts into strips. Whisk egg and juice together in a medium bowl. Stir in molasses and honey. Dip chicken strips into egg mixture. Pour cracker crumbs into a resealable plastic bag. Put egg coated chicken pieces in bag, seal and shake to coat with crumbs.
