1 cup peeled and cubed sweet potato
1/2 teaspoon coconut oil, melted

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place sweet potato cubes in a bowl. Drizzle coconut oil over potatoes and toss, using your hands, until each cube is coated. Spread sweet potato cubes onto a baking sheet; season with rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are softened, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
We discovered this method looking for healthy alternatives to our usual Christmas/Thanksgiving side dishes. They are so good and filling! This is great as a breakfast hash brown substitute or a side dish to dinner. Mix with other root vegetables to create a more colorful (and delicious) plate, but it will change calorie count.
