Description: 
Simple and delicious. Came up with this recipe when trying to duplicate a local pizza restaurant's peppercorn ranch dressing that we love. This dressing goes great with Romaine lettuce, sliced cherry tomatoes, and red onion with fresh bacon crumbled on top. Refrigerate overnight for best taste.
