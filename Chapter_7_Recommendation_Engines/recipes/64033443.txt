Ingredients:
2 cups Panko bread crumbs
2 TBSP olive oil
1/4 cup parmesean cheese
1/2 cup flour
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
3 egg whites
1 TBSP water
1 TBSP dijon mustard
1/4 tsp dried thyme
cooking spray
1 1/2 lbs boneless chicken

Directions:
Heat oven to 475F.  In a shallow dish, mix together bread crumbs, oil and cheese.  In a second dish, whisk together the flour, garlic, salt and pepper.  In a bow, whisk together the egg whites, water, mustard and thyme.
Spray a wire rack lightly with cooking spray and place over a rimmed baking sheet.  Working in batches, dredge chicken in flour, then egg whites, then breadcrumbs to coat.  Shake off excess between each step.  Lay coated pieces on the rack.
Bake chicken  until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 18 minutes.
