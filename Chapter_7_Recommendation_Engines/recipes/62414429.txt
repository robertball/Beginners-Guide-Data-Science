Ingredients:
1lb. breakfast sausage, divided
9 eggs
3 tbs. flour
2 c. shredded cheese
6 flour tortillas
4 c. milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Brown 1/2 of the sausage in one skillet and 1/2 in another. Add the flour and salt and pepper to one skillet, stirring to coat flour with sausage drippings. Add milk and stir continuously until gravy thickens. Remove from heat and set the gravy aside. In the other skillet, add eggs and salt and pepper to the sausage, stirring constantly until eggs are fluffy.
Coat a 9X13 casserole dish with cooking spray. Warm tortillas and fill with scrambled egg mixture and cheese. Fold into burritos and place in baking dish. Cover burritos with gravy and bake for 20 minutes.
