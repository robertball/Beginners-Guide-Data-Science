Ingredients:
2 sticks softened butter (1 cup)
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 tsp. vanilla
2 cups flour
1/2 cups very finely chopped walnut

Directions:
1. Cream together butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla.
2. Add walnuts.
3. Add flour.
4. Roll into smallish balls and bake 1 inch apart on cookie sheet.  Balls basically retain their shape.  They are not meant to be flat.
5. Bake at 300*F for 30 minutes
6. While warm, roll in powdered sugar.
7. For a festive look, I add green or red food coloring to the dough before baking.  Great for Christmas!
