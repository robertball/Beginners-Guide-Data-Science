Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds carrots
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice or mace
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1 cup Filippo Berio Extra Light Olive Oil
1 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 whole eggs
4 egg whites
1 tablespoon vanilla or maple extract
1 cup raisins or currants
3/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
Powdered sugar (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease 15-1/2X10-1/2X1-inch jelly-roll pan with olive oil. Lightly dust with flour. Wash carrots; do not peel. Cut off ends; discard. Grate carrots in food processor or by hand using metal grater.
In medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and allspice.
In large bowl, beat granulated sugar, olive oil, applesauce, whole eggs, egg whites and vanilla with electric mixer at medium speed until well blended. Add flour mixture; beat 1 minute on low speed. Beat 2 minutes on medium speed. Stir in carrots, raisins and nuts. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool completely in pan on wire rack. Sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving, if desired.
