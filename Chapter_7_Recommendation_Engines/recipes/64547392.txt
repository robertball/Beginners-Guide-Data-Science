Ingredients:
1 pound sweet potatoes (about 2 medium)
2 medium apples
1 medium orange
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 cup orange juice
2 Tbsp brown sugar
2 tsp cornstarch
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground ginger
2 pork tenderloins (about 1 pound each)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°. Peel sweet potatoes; core apples. Cut potatoes, apples and orange crosswise into 1/4-in.-thick slices. Arrange on a foil-lined 15x10x1-in. baking pan coated with cooking spray; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a microwave-safe bowl, mix orange juice, brown sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon and ginger. Microwave, covered, on high for 1-2 minutes or until thickened, stirring every 30 seconds. Stir until smooth.
Place pork over sweet potato mixture; drizzle with orange juice mixture. Roast 45-55 minutes longer or until a thermometer inserted in pork reads 145° and sweet potatoes and apples are tender. Remove from oven; tent with foil. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
When it's chilly outside, I like to roast pork tenderloin with sweet potatoes, apples and an orange. The sweetness and spices make any evening cozy.
