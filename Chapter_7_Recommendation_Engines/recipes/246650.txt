Ingredients:
Apples:
3 apples, cored and diced
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Granola:
1/3 cup honey
1/4 cup applesauce
1/4 cup coconut oil
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup quinoa
2 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup coarsely ground almonds
1/2 cup flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Spread diced apples on baking sheet. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons cinnamon and 1 teaspoon nutmeg on top.
Bake apples in the preheated oven, stirring at 10-minute intervals, until tender but not over-crisp, about 40 minutes total.
Mix honey, applesauce, coconut oil, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, ginger, and cloves together in a large bowl. Stir in quinoa. Let sit, about 5 minutes.
Stir oats, almond, and coconut into the honey mixture. Spread evenly over baked apple pieces.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring at 10-minute-intervals, until granola is golden brown and crispy, about 40 minutes. Cool completely before storing, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
