Ingredients:
aluminum foil
6 chicken drumsticks
3 tablespoons butter, melted
Seasoning:
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon ground thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking pan with aluminum foil.
Pat drumsticks with paper towels until dry.
Combine baking powder, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, basil, thyme, oregano, cumin and cayenne pepper in a medium bowl. Add melted butter and stir until combined. Add drumsticks and toss until fully coated. Place drumsticks into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until drumsticks are no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
These chicken drumsticks are packed with flavor yet they are easy to prepare. The addition of baking powder will help crisp up the skin. I prefer to make my own Cajun spice mix but feel free to use store-bought Cajun mix.
