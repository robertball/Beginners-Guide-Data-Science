Ingredients:
4 slices Wonder® Classic White Sandwich Bread
4 tablespoons pizza sauce
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese or pizza blend cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Flatten the center of each slice of bread using the back of a large spoon; do not flatten the crusts. Arrange bread in a single layer on foil-lined baking sheet. Bake 5 to 6 minutes or until lightly toasted.
Spoon 1 tablespoon pizza sauce into the center of each slice of bread, spreading to cover the center area evenly.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon Parmesan over the sauce. Top with about 2 tablespoons shredded Mozzarella cheese. Bake 5 minutes or until cheese is melted.

Submitter: 
Wonder® bread
Description: 
Imagine what would happen if you added fresh mushrooms, peppers and artichokes to these wonderful pizzas. You'd create entirely new sensations. And, you'd add even more nutrition to a meal that already has the calcium of eight ounces of milk in just two slices of Wonder Classic White Sandwich Bread.
