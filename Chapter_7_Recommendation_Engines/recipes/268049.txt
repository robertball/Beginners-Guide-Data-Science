Description: 
This is a large, creme-caramel-like version of the classic Brazilian chocolate bonbon known as brigadeiro. This recipe is super easy and fast because it's made in the microwave. If you do not want to unmold the brigadeiro or don't have a glass tube cake pan, just use a glass pie dish.
