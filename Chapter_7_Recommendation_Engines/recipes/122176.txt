Description: 
'My family always smiles when I fix these chocolates,' writes Ginny Truwe of Mankato, Minnesota. 'They recall the winter when I put trays of the candy centers on top of my van in the garage to freeze before dipping. Later, I drove off and was horrified to see the little balls rolling on the highway!'
