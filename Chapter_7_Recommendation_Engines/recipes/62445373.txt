Ingredients:
Cupcakes
1	 box Betty Crocker® SuperMoist® chocolate fudge cake mix
Water, oil and eggs called for on cake mix box
3/4	 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
3	 tablespoons hazelnut or orange-flavored liqueur
Ganache
1/3	 cup whipping cream
1/2	 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Heat oven to 350°F for shiny metal pans (or 325°F. for dark or nonstick pans). Place paper baking cup in each of 24 regular-size muffin cups. Prepare cake mix according to package directions. Stir in miniature chocolate chips. Divide batter evenly among muffin cups.
Bake 17 to 22 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes; remove from pan to cooling rack. Immediately prick holes in tops of cupcakes with toothpick. Brush about 1/2 teaspoon liqueur over each cupcake. Cool completely, about 30 minutes.
In heavy 1-quart saucepan, heat whipping cream over medium-high heat until hot but not boiling; remove from heat. Stir in 1/2 cup chocolate chips until melted. Let stand 10 minutes. Dip tops of cupcakes in ganache. Top with miniature chocolate chips, grate orange peel or ground hazelnut, if desired.
