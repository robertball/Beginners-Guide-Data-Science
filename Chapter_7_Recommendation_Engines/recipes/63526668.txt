Ingredients:
1 Pkg Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice
2 c. cubed ham
1 c. vegetable of your choice (broccoli, asparagus, green beans)
1 T. Mrs. Dash
1 c. diced cheese (cheddar or colby)
1 can Progresso creamy mushroom soup
1/2 c. crushed potato chips

Directions:
Prepare the rice according to package directions except omit the spice packet. Let the rice cool, then preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl combine the rice with the rest of the ingredients except the potato chips and mix well. Spray an 8 X 8 casserole dish with cooking spray and spread the mixture evenly in the casserole. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes covered with foil until the mixture is bubbling, then cover with potato chip crumbles. Bake another ten minutes or so until topping is slightly browned and crispy.

Description: 
This is a great after holiday casserole since many of the ingredients (ham, cheese, green vegetables) are still in the fridge after Christmas and Easter.
