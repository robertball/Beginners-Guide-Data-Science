Description: 
My husband's mother taught me this recipe, an authentic Hyderabadi-style biryani that is a trademark of home-cooking in south India. For a more traditional version, substitute curd (homemade south Indian yogurt) for yogurt. If you cannot find ginger garlic paste, crush together ginger and garlic in equal portions.
