Ingredients:
2 (28 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
4 (8 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
6 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoon white sugar
4 tablespoons red wine vinegar
4 teaspoons dried oregano
2 pinches crushed red pepper flakes

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in crock pot and stir.  Cook on low for as long as you can (the longer it simmers, the more the flavors meld), at least 2-3 hours.  At the end, stir in a handful of parmesan cheese.

Description: 
A splendid marinara is just minutes away when you simmer crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce and tomato paste with garlic, sugar, red wine vinegar, dried oregano and as many red pepper flakes as suits your taste. It's really that simple, and so delicious!Modified from: Nanny's Spaghetti Sauce
