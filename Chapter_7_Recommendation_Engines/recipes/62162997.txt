Ingredients:
4 lbs. of peeled Large Raw Shrimp (we get ours from Costco), either frozen or fresh.
4 large Oranges (3 for chopping and 1 for juicing)
3lbs Limes (18-21 limes)
12 Roma Tomatoes
3 large Cucumbers
Cilantro to taste
1 Red Onion
Tortilla Chips of your choice (we like Missions Gluten Free Restaurant Style Chips)

Directions:
Defrost the Shrimp and chop into small pieces.
Place chopped Shrimp into a large 9 X 13 pan.
Cut Limes into halves.
To extract Lime Juice, use a twisting motion of the wrist while using a fork to drive juice out and over the bed of chopped Shrimp.
The Shrimp should be completely saturated with Lime Juice  and not one piece should be exposed.
Let the Shrimp stand in Lime Juice for a minimum of 4 hrs (lime juice naturally cooks the shrimp).  Overnight is good in the refrigerator.
After 4 hours: chop Onion, Cilantro, Cucumbers(peeled) and Tomatoes into small pieces and mix into the shrimp.
Then chop 3 Oranges (peeled) adding to the Shrimp.
Extract juice from 1 Orange and pour over Shrimp (to taste).
Add Â½ cup of Ketchup (or to taste).
Add Cholula Hot Sauce to taste (or your preferred hot sauce).
Mix everything together and test with a Tortilla Chip.
If needed, add salt to taste and mix again.  Repeat taste test.
Enjoy!!!
