Ingredients:
2 8oz bricks of low fat/fat free cream cheese (room temp)
1 15oz can of pumpkin puree
1/2 cup of sugar
2 egg whites
2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp ginger
1 tsp ground cloves
24 vanilla wafers

Directions:
Preheat over to 350.
Combine all ingredients in large mixing bowl.
Mix until everything is well blended and there are no lumps of cream cheese.
Line 2 muffin pans with liners (24 cups).
Place 1 vanilla wafer at the bottom of each lined cup.
Using an ice cream scooper (makes it a lot easier to fill these), fill each cup approximately 3/4 full.
Bake at 350 for 23-26 minutes.
Let cool for about an hour and enjoy!
