Ingredients:
2 pounds ground venison
1 (6 ounce) package dry stuffing mix (such as Stove TopÂ®)
1 cup water
1 onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup barbeque sauce
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup barbeque sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix venison, stuffing mix, water, onion, 1/4 cup barbeque sauce, eggs, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl until fully incorporated. Shape venison mixture into a loaf and place in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread 1/4 cup barbeque sauce over the top of loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
