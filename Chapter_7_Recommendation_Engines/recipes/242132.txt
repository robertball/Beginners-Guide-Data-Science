Ingredients:
1 cup oat bran
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/3 cup granola
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 apple, peeled and cored
1 banana
3/4 cup milk
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract, or to taste
1 cup fresh blueberries

Directions:
Combine oat bran, flour, granola, baking powder, and cinnamon in a bowl.
Blend apple, banana, milk, egg, and vanilla extract in a blender until smooth; mix into oat bran mixture until batter is well mixed. Gently fold blueberries into batter.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
My wife and I make these pancakes every Saturday morning. We created this recipe after many weeks of trial and error. We wanted a guilt-free way to enjoy a breakfast treat we both love! We often tweak the ingredients and add other fresh fruit and I encourage you to do the same!
