Ingredients:
1.5 cups whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
0.25 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1.25 cups soymilk (or milk)
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Optional:
2-3 carrots
or
2 bananas
or
1 cup blueberries

Directions:
Carrot version:
Peel 2 or 3 carrots depending on size.
Place in blender with the soymilk, a couple pinches of nutmeg and .5 tsp of cinnamon.
Blend thoroughly until there are no chunks.
Banana version:
Peel 2 bananas.
Place in blender with the soymilk and .5 tsp of cinnamon. Blend thoroughly until there are no chunks.
Heat up a large griddle.
Add enough oil to your griddle to lightly coat the surface and wait for the oil to heat.
Mix all ingredients in a big bowl.
Mix batter with a whisk until thoroughly blended.
(For the blueberry version, add berries last after the batter is mixed completely.
Fold them in with a large spoon so they do not get smashed.)
Once the griddle and oil are hot, spoon batter onto the griddle in the desired size.
Flip the pancake when batter starts to bubble on top.
It should be browned.
Knowing when the other side is done just takes practice.
You can peek a little by picking up a corner after a minute or so.
Enjoy!
