Description: 
My Dad grew up in Pennsylvania, in the middle of Amish country.  When he got married, his Mom gave this recipe to his new wife (my Mom) who then passed it down to me.  This is not your “light & fluffy” pancakes and you won’t be eating a stack of them, it’s one and done.  It’s a hearty breakfast that sticks to your ribs and lets you get a full morning worth of work done and guarantees you won’t be hungry until lunch.
