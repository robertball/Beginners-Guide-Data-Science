Ingredients:
5 - 7 Large Baking Potatoes
1 stick butter
2/3 cup flour
1 ½ quarts whole milk
4-5 green onions  chopped
1 cup sour cream
1 ½ cups bacon  cooked crispy
And crumbled
Salt and Pepper to taste
5  8 ounces cheddar cheese

Directions:
Cook potatoes in oven at 350 degrees until tender. Cut potatoes in half, and scoop out all of the “meat”. Set aside.
Dice half of the potato peels and set with reserved potatoes. Discard remaining peels.
In a large saucepan or stockpot, melt butter. Whisk in flour. Cook the butter/flour mixture for a few minutes (while stirring) to help remove the “raw” flour taste. Add milk in slowly. Whisk constantly until mixture begins to simmer.
Turn heat to low, and add the potatoes, peels, and onions. Next, add the sour cream and salt. Continue to stir until sour cream is melted. Next, add bacon and cheese and stir until cheese is melted.
This soup is fairly thick, but you can thin it down by adding more milk prior to adding the potatoes and remaining ingredients. This is great served in a bread bowl or alone.
