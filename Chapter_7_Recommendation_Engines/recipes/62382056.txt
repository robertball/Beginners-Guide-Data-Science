Ingredients:
1 egg
1/2 cup white sugar or substitute
1/2 cup milk (I use rice milk)
1/3 cup canola or vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 ripe bananas, mashed with fork
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Grease or line 12 muffin cups.
Place the egg, sugar, milk, canola oil, vanilla and mashed bananas into a mixing bowl or stand mixer. Mix with hand mixer or stand mixer for 2-3 minutes, or until smooth.
Add the flour, baking powder and salt into the bowl or stand mixer. Mix until batter is smooth, about 3 minutes. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer or set aside the hand mixer. Fold in the mini chocolate chips.
Fill the muffin cups about 2/3 full with the batter.
Bake at 350 for 16-18 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean.
Let cool a few minutes, then remove muffins from the muffin tin. Let cool another 5-10 minutes, then serve.
