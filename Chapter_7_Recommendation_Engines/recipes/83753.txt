Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup frozen pearl onions
3 cups fresh asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 cup fresh carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch coins
1 cup fresh snow peas, stemmed
1 cup frozen artichokes
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup frozen green peas
1/2 cup thinly sliced green scallion tops (snipping with scissors works well)
Black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Heat butter in a large, deep saute pan over medium-high heat. Carefully add pearl onions; saute until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat. (Can be prepared to this point a couple of hours ahead.)
Add asparagus, carrots, snow peas, artichokes, salt and 1/2 cup water to pan. Return to high heat; cover and cook until vegetables start to steam. Steam, covered, until almost tender, about 5 minutes. Add peas; continue to steam until vegetables are just tender, about 1 minute longer. Stir in scallion tops, and season with pepper and more salt, if necessary. Serve immediately.
