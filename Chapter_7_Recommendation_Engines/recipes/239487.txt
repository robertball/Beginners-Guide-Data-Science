4 teaspoons canola oil, divided
2 eggs, beaten
2 carrots, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste

1 cup frozen peas
4 scallions, minced
4 cups cooked rice

Mix 1 tablespoon canola oil, carrots, and salt in the hot wok; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add garlic to carrots; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant and browned, about 2 minutes. Stir peas and scallions into carrot mixture; cook and stir until peas are warmed, 1 to 2 minutes. Lower heat to medium.
Stir rice into carrot mixture; add scrambled eggs, soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir rice mixture until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
