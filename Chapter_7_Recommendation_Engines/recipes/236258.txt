Description: 
I love pancakes, but I hate everyone else eating fresh pancakes while I am still flipping them, especially if the ones left for me are the first ones i made. . .i.e cold. This recipe ensures that all the 'Puffins' are done at once. You can add a plethora of mix-ins like fresh fruit or a staple in our house Reese's Pieces®. These are really good with a side of maple syrup, or even melted butter; however, plain is good too. I really like them without the mix-ins and peanut butter on top.
