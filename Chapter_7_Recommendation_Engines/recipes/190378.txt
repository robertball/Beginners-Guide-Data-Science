Ingredients:
4 slices multigrain bread
2 eggs
3/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon orange juice
2 teaspoons grated orange zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 tablespoon ground nutmeg
2 teaspoons light butter

Directions:
Place bread in a flat bottomed dish. Whisk together the eggs, milk, orange juice, orange zest, vanilla, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a mixing bowl.  Pour egg mixture over bread, and refrigerate until bread absorbs the liquid, about 10 minutes.
Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat.  Place bread into skillet.  Cook until golden, about 3 minutes per side.

Description: 
This French toast is a great way to celebrate winter. The orange flavor stimulates the senses and adds comfort and warmth after a great morning of skiing. Serve with freshly squeezed or high calcium orange juice to get that extra boost, and top with pure maple syrup or a sprinkle of icing sugar.
