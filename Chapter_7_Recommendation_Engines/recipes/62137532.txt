Ingredients:
1 lb. of cooked spaghetti cooled (al dente)
1 dozen eggs or less if using extra large sized eggs
1/2 cup of milk
1 tsp. of freshly ground black pepper
1-1/2 cups total of grated cheese w/some shredded (Reggiano preferred)
1/2 tsp. salt
butter and olive oil for greasing pan

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.
Beat the eggs and then add the milk, salt and pepper and the grated/shredded cheese. Stir well. Mix in the drained spaghetti until well coated. Grease a casserole pan with butter and olive oil then pour the spaghetti mixture in pan and even it out. Sprinkle on a bit more of grated cheese. Bake in the oven for 30 minutes or until the spaghetti on top gets crisp and browns. Cut up in brownie sized squares. Serve warm.
Optional, halfway thru cooking I like to dab or smooth on some butter from the stick.)
