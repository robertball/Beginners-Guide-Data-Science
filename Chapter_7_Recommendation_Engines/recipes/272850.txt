Ingredients:
1 teaspoon chili-lime seasoning, such as Tajin®), or to taste
3 lime wedges, divided
2 cups ice cubes, or as needed, divided
4 ounces bottled Bloody Mary mix (such as Zing Zang®)

4 dashes Worcestershire sauce
2 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®), or to taste
2 lemon wedges, divided

1 dill pickle spear
1 lemon wedge

Directions:
Pour chili-lime seasoning onto a small plate. Rub the edge of a pint-sized jar with 1 lime wedge. Dip the edge of the jar into the seasoning. Fill jar with 1 cup ice and set aside.
Fill a cocktail shaker with remaining cup of ice, Bloody Mary mix, pickle juice, vodka, Worcestershire, and hot sauce. Squeeze in 1 lime wedge and 1 lemon wedge.
Roughly chop 1 fresh dill sprig and add to the shaker. Place lid on the shaker and shake for 10 seconds to combine. Strain into the prepared jar and garnish with pickle spear and remaining dill, lime, and lemon.

Description: 
Calling all pickle lovers! Kick up your Bloody Mary with loads of pickle flavor! Serve with your favorite garnishes - the possibilities are endless! I like to serve with a skewer of pickled onion, pickled jalapeno, olive, and a mini dill. The flavor of pickle brine varies depending on brand, so start with 1 ounce, and if a more pronounced pickle flavor is desired, add another ounce.
