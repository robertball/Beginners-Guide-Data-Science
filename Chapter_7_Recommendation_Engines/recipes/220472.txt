Ingredients:
8 (4 ounce) lamb shoulder blade chops
4 carrots, coarsely chopped
4 onions, coarsely chopped
6 potatoes, coarsely chopped
1 pinch salt
1/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper
4 cups vegetable broth
water, or amount to cover
3 bay leaves
1 (14 ounce) bag dry split yellow peas

Directions:
Place lamb shoulder chops, carrots, onions, and potatoes in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in salt and cracked black pepper.
Pour in vegetable broth and enough water to cover; drop in bay leaves. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
Stir in split peas and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until lamb is very tender and split peas have broken apart to create a thick stew, about 1 1/2 more hours. Stir occasionally to keep stew from burning on the bottom.
