Ingredients:
5 boneless chicken breasts
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Rinse chicken halves, and pat dry with paper towels. Place chicken cut side down in a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a medium mixing bowl, combine sugar, soy sauce, grated ginger and garlic. Mix well, and pour 1/2 mixture over chicken. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven for 35 minutes, basting with extra marinade frequently. Test for doneness, making sure there is no pink left in the meat. Let cool slightly, then cut into smaller pieces to serve.
