Ingredients:
1  lemon, thinly sliced
1  bay leaf
1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
¾ teaspoon dried thyme, divided
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
¾ teaspoon paprika
⅓ cup light mayonnaise
¼ cup sour cream
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 ½ cups fresh corn, cooked and cut from the cob
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
¾ cup diced orange bell pepper
1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced

Directions:
Fill a large skillet with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water.  Add lemon slices, bay leaf, peppercorns and 2/3 of the thyme, and bring to boiling over high heat.  Add chicken, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15-18 minutes, turning chicken once, until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink.  Remove chicken from liquid and set aside to cool.
In a small skillet, stir together the paprika and remaining thyme over medium-low heat for 2 minutes.  In a small bowl, whisk together the toasted paprika mixture, mayonnaise, sour cream, salt, ground pepper and nutmeg until evenly blended.
Cube cooled chicken and transfer to a medium bowl.  Add prepared dressing, corn, cilantro, orange pepper and jalapeno and toss until evenly coated.  Serve warm, or refrigerate until ready to serve.

Description: 
A wonderful blend of spices, herbs, and a bit of a bite from the jalapeno combine so well with the chicken and corn in this salad. One of my favorites! If you can't get fresh corn, you may substitute frozen corn.
