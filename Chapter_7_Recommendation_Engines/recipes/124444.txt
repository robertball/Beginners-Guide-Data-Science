Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
4 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)
6 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons salt
1/4 cup shortening, melted and cooled
12 cups all-purpose flour, divided

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add sugar, salt and shortening; stir until dissolved. Add half the flour; beat until smooth and the batter sheets with a spoon. Mix in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough that cleans the bowl. Turn onto a floured surface. Knead 8-10 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Punch dough down.  Cover and let rise again for 30 minutes.
Divide dough into four parts and shape into loaves. Place in four greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30-45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans and allow to cool on wire racks.

Description: 
'WE BAKED at least two batches of bread each week for our family of six. We also spent hours (or so it seemed) churning the butter to spread on it, which we especially loved to do while it was still warm. Fried chicken never tasted quite as good without homemade bread-and-butter sandwiches.'
