Ingredients:
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1 teaspoon dried savory
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
1 (3 pound) boneless chuck eye or top blade
SAUCE:
1 cup sour cream
3 tablespoons prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Rub over entire roast. Place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 1-1/2 to 2 hours or until meat is tender and reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Let stand 10 minutes before carving.
Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the sauce ingredients. Serve with the roast.

This recipe turns in inexpensive cut of beef into a delicious main dish. I go the recipe from a family member several years ago and have made it often.
