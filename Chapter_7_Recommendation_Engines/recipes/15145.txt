Description: 
'Cream cakes' are not a specific item, but a term that refers to a variety of goodies served at tea. Scones, cakes, buns, and biscuits may be spread with cream and/or jam. Here's a Lake District recipe for 'Upland's Biscuits'. When cool, sandwich in pairs with raspberry jam. A dollop of clotted cream on top, a pot of strong tea, aahhh!
