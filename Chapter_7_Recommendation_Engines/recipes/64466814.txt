Ingredients:
100 grams of whole fresh basil leaves, washed and dried thoroughly
2 Tbsp pine nuts, not toasted
1 tsp rock salt
50 grams of freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano Â®
10 grams of freshly grated aged Pecorino cheese
130 ml extra virgin olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
In a mortar, add the pine nuts and crush until a paste forms, about 2 minutes.
Add 1/4 of the basil leaves and begin to crush and grind the basil leaves until they have begun to release their oil and leaves begin to break apart. Add another fourth of the basil leaves and the salt. Crush and grind the added leaves and the salt. Continue this until all the basil leaves have been added and crushed; turning into a paste.
Add the cheese and mix with a wooden spoon. Once well-combined, add the oil little-by-little until a creamy paste has been achieved.
Add to cooked, drained pasta and mix adding a bit of oil if needed.

Description: 
I discovered this recipe when on vacation in Camogli, Liguria in Italy. Traditional pesto without garlic is made in a pestle and mortar. This raw sauce is tossed with fresh green beans cooked with fresh trofie pasta. If you can't find the twisty trofie pasta, use any fresh pasta-even linguine.
