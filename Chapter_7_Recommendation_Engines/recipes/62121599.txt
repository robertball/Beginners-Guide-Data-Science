Description: 
One night we were looking for a nice soup for a light supper.  My husband jokingly said, how about sweet potato soup.  So into the kitchen I went and came up with this wonderfully smooth, creamy soup.  It took a few mouthfuls to get used to eating sweet potatoes as soup but it was definitely worth it!
