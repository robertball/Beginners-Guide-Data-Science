Ingredients:
2/3 cup sliced green onions
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
2 pounds flounder or sole fillets
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons dry white wine or chicken broth
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/4 cup shredded reduced-fat Mexican cheese blend
1/4 cup soft whole wheat bread crumbs
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Sprinkle the green onions and mushrooms into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Arrange fish over vegetables, overlapping the thickest end of fillets over the thin end. Sprinkle with marjoram, salt and pepper.
Pour wine or broth and lemon juice over fish. Cover with cheese and bread crumbs; drizzle with butter. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
