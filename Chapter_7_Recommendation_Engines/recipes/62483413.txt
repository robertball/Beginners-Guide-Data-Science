Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose white flour
1.5 tsp baking powder
1.5 tsp bakin soda
1/2 tsp. salt
2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 large egg, lightly beaten
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup apple butter or fruit puree fat replacement
1/3 cup pure maple syrup
1/3 cup apple cider
1/3 cup nonfat plain yogurt
3 Tbsp canola oil
1.25 cups confectioners sugar
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
1/4 cup pure maple syrup, up to 1/3 cup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Thoroughly coat the mold of 2 mini-bundt pans with nonstick cooking spray or oil.  Sprinkle molds evenly with granulated sugar, tapping out the excess. (If you only have 1 pan, bake in two batches). In a mixing bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon; set aside.  In another bowl, whisk egg, brown sugar, apple butter or fruit puree fat replacement, maple syrup, cider, yogurt and oil.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir just until moistened.  Spoon about 2 generous Tbsp of batter into each prepared mold, smoothing the surface.  Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the tops spring back when touched lightly.  Loosen edges and turn the doughnuts out onto a wire rack to cool.
Maple Glaze: In a bowl, combine confectioners' sugar and vanilla.  gradually whisk in enough maple syrup to make a smooth, thick glaze.  When the doughnuts are completely cool, set them, fluted-side up, on a wire rack over wax paper.  Spoon some glaze over each doughnut, letting it drip down the side.  Alternatively, dip the doughnuts in glaze.
