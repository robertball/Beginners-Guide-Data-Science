Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1/3 cup loosely packed basil leaves, very thinly sliced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh savory
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 pounds roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil (optional)

Directions:
Mix 1/4 cup olive oil with basil, savory, thyme, garlic powder, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Stir tomatoes into the herb-seasoned oil. If desired, add 1 1/2 tablespoon more olive oil for richness. Let the topping stand for 1 hour to blend flavors before serving.

Description: 
My own recipe, a summertime tradition with all home-grown ingredients. No onions, but uses a couple of herbs not found in a traditional bruschetta. Dicing the tomatoes is the time-consuming part. It is a major hit with friends and family! Serve on toasted Tuscan bread slices or crackers.
