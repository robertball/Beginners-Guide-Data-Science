Ingredients:
1/4 cup lime juice
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons honey
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup olive oil
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 ripe mango, peeled, pitted and diced
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into thin strips
1/2 jicama, sliced into matchsticks
1/2 head green leaf lettuce, rinsed and torn

Directions:
Whisk together lime juice, red wine vinegar, garlic, honey, salt, and pepper until blended. Slowly whisk in olive oil until incorporated. Mix half of this dressing with the chicken breasts, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Refrigerate the remaining dressing for later use.
Heat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
Grill chicken breasts until no longer pink, about 6 minutes per side. Set aside and allow to cool while proceeding with recipe. Toss together mango, black beans, bell pepper, and jicama in a large bowl with reserved dressing. Slice chicken into bite-sized pieces and toss with salad.
To serve, line a serving bowl with the green leaf lettuce and mound the chicken salad into the middle.

Description: 
This is a great summer salad.  It's really easy to make, and kids love it. I like to stuff the salad into pitas and serve it like that, but it can stand alone as well.
