Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
1 (12 ounce) package Hillshire Farm® Rope Smoked Sausage, cut into coins
2 cups chopped sweet potato
2 cups chopped eggplant
1/2 cup thinly sliced shallots
2 cups chopped zucchini
1 pint cherry tomatoes
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook 2-3 minutes until beginning to brown; remove from pan using a slotted spoon.
Add sweet potato to pan; cook 5-6 minutes, stirring frequently, until lightly browned. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil, eggplant, and shallots; cook 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently until slightly softened. Stir in zucchini, tomatoes, salt, pepper, and browned sausage.
Transfer skillet to preheated oven and roast until tomatoes burst and vegetables are tender, 18 to 20 minutes.
