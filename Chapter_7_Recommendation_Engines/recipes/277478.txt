Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons butter, or as needed
2 cups white sugar
1 cup light corn syrup
3 cups unsalted cashews, a mixture of whole and chopped
2 teaspoons butter
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Spread 1 1/2 tablespoons butter all over a rimmed baking sheet until heavily coated.
Stir sugar and corn syrup together in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high, uncovered, for 4 1/2 minutes. Stir and microwave for 3 minutes longer.
Stir in cashews, 2 teaspoons butter, and salt. Microwave until mixture turns a light amber color, 1 minute to 1 minute 40 seconds; mixture will be very hot. Quickly stir in baking powder and vanilla extract until light and well mixed. Pour mixture onto the prepared baking sheet immediately and spread with a metal spatula.
Place in the refrigerator until chilled, at least 20 minutes. Break into small pieces.

Incredibly quick and easy, but absolutely delicious. I have a peanut allergy and absolutely loved this cashew brittle. You'll want to make it again and again.
