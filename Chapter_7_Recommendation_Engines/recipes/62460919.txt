Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes, unpeeled
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
salt and ground black pepper
1 tablespoon sea salt
1 1/2 teaspoons grated lime zest
1/8 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Place the sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until fork tender. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Allow to cool, then slice each sweet potato into wedges. Arrange wedges on a baking sheet.
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Brush the sweet potato wedges with olive oil, and lightly season with salt and pepper. Combine sea salt, lime zest, chili powder, paprika, and crushed red pepper flakes in a small bowl.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on all sides, about 20 minutes. Plate and sprinkle with the seasoning mixture and cilantro immediately.

Description: 
Sweet potatoes make a perfect summer treat, especially with a nice twist by using lime zest! Boiling the potatoes before hand allows them to cook perfectly once in the oven. This pairs well with seafood and burgers alike.Modified from: Tropical Sweet Potato Fries
