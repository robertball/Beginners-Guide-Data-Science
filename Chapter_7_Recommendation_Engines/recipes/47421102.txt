Ingredients:
28g (1/4 c) cornstarch
60g (1/4 c) water
***
2 Tbsp white wine vinegar - DIVIDED
4 Tbsp soy sauce - DIVIDED
3 Tbsp sesame oil - DIVIDED
***
1/2 boneless chicken breast, cut into small chunks
***
45g (3 Tbsp) white wine
20g red pepper paste
25g (2 Tbsp) brown sugar
***
15g (3 cloves) garlic, pressed
140g (5 oz) water chestnuts, drained
***
110g (4 oz) peanuts (or cashews), chopped
***
56g shitake mushrooms
2 handfuls carrots, julienne
4 green onions, chopped - DIVIDED

Directions:
In a 1 cup measuring glass, dissolve cornstarch in water.
In a pint size jar, combine 1 Tbsp cornstarch/water mixture, 1 Tbsp white wine vinegar, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp sesame oil.  Mix well.
Add chicken pieces to marinade, seal, and shake to coat. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
In a small skillet, sauté chicken on med/high heat until browned on both sides.  Chicken should reach at least 140 degrees.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine an additional 3 Tbsp cornstarch/water mixture with remaining 1 Tbsp vinegar, 3 Tbsp soy sauce and 2 Tbsp oil.  Add white wine, pepper paste and brown sugar.  Mix well and set aside.
In a medium saucepan, sauté garlic and water chestnuts in a little oil.  When fragrant, add prepared sauce and chopped peanuts.  Mix well and heat slowly until aromatic.
Add chicken to sauce and let simmer together until sauce thickens.  Add water 1/4 c at a time to maintain a creamy consistency.
When chicken reaches 180 degrees, add mushrooms, carrots and half of the green onions.  Mix together and cook for one minute.
Serve over fried rice and garnish with remaining green onions.

Description: 
Spicy chicken with peanuts, similar to what is served in Chinese restaurants. It is easy to make, and you can be as sloppy with the measurements as you want. They reduce to a nice, thick sauce. Substitute cashews for peanuts, or bamboo shoots for the water chestnuts. You can't go wrong! Enjoy!Modified from: Kung Pao Chicken
