Ingredients:
12 red potatoes, unpeeled
4 slices bacon
1 cup sour cream
1 cup plain yogurt
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or more to taste
1/3 cup chopped fresh chives
1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Cut into cubes and place in a large bowl.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble into small pieces.
Mix bacon, sour cream, yogurt, Cheddar cheese, chives, ranch dressing mix, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Pour over potatoes and toss gently to coat.
Refrigerate potato mixture until chilled, at least 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a new twist on ho-hum potato salad! I like to use red potatoes because there is no peeling necessary and it looks pretty!
