Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
6 frozen pot stickers
1 cup frozen shelled edamame (green soybeans)
1 cup water
4 cups chopped iceberg lettuce
2 tablespoons ginger-sesame salad dressing
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place the pot stickers into the hot oil flat-side-down. Cook until the bottom has turned golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the edamame and pour in the water. Cover, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook until the pot stickers have completely thawed and are hot on the inside, 8 to 10 minutes.
Scrape the pot stickers and edamame into a mixing bowl, and add the lettuce and salad dressing. Season to taste with salt, and toss to mix. Serve immediately.
