Ingredients:
1 sleeve (or more) Club Crackers  I used Multi-Grain
1 lb. Pepper Bacon  thin sliced is best
1 c Dark Brown Sugar (my personal favorite)
1 c Parmesan Cheese  grated (other grated cheese would be good, too)
1 c Peanut Butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees.
Cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil.
Place a cooling rack on top and spray the rack with cooking spray.
Cut the bacon in half.
Lay the crackers flat in rows on the cooling rack.
Place 1 t. cheese and brown sugar or peanut butter on each cracker.
Carefully wrap ½ slice of bacon around each cheese or sugar-covered cracker.
(Be careful not to let the cheese or sugar fall off.)
(If using thicker-cut bacon like I did, stick a toothpick through the bacon on the top side of the cracker just to hold it together. If using thin bacon, I don’t think this would be necessary. I loved the pepper-flavored bacon and could not find thin-cut pepper bacon. The pepper bacon added just the right touch of heat.)
Place the bacon-wrapped crackers on the rack over the cookie sheet.
Place the cookie sheet with the crackers in the oven.
Bake at 250 degrees for 2 hours.
If needed, broil the crackers for just 1-2 minutes at the very end to crisp and caramelize the bacon. Watch closely – the sugar will burn quickly.
Take out of the oven and cool long enough to eat.
Enjoy!!
These crackers freeze beautifully. Cool completely, then place in a freezer bag. When ready to eat, take out of the freezer and let thaw in the bag. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees and bake for 15-20 minutes or until the bacon is hot and sizzling.
