Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon chai tea mix
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves (optional)
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine flour, white sugar, powdered sugar, tea mix, and salt in a food processor or small chopper. Pulse until tea is pulverized and distributed throughout the dry ingredients. Mix in cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, allspice, and cloves. Add butter and vanilla extract. Pulse together just until a rough dough is formed.
Scrape out dough onto a piece of wax or parchment paper. Form dough into an 8-inch log. Cover with paper and roll the log until smooth. Chill for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.
Use a sharp knife to slice the chilled log of dough into 1/3-inch-thick pieces. Place on the baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are just beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
If you love chai tea, these cookies are for you! The word 'chai' or 'masala chai' is a catch-all for a spiced black tea drunk in great quantities throughout Southwest Asia and parts of Africa. Any bagged spiced black tea would be lovely in this recipe - cut them open and use the mix inside. Store cooled cookies in an airtight container.
