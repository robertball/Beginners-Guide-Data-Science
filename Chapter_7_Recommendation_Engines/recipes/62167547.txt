Ingredients:
PINK LIZZIES
24 OZ	        unsweetened frozen raspberries
12 OZ CAN	frozen pink lemonade
1/2 C	        Splenda or “regular” white sugar
2 CUPS	        vodka, chilled
small ice cubes

Directions:
Thaw the raspberries in the refrigerator.  When thawed, press the berries in batches through a fine sieve or strainer.  Get as much juice and pulp as possible, leaving the seeds in the sieve.  You should end up with about 12 to 15 ounces.
Put the lemonade in a large pitcher.  Fill the lemonade can with the raspberry juice and add to lemonade.  Pour the remaining juice into the can and fill to the top with water; add to lemonade.  Add an additional 2 1/3 cans of water to the lemonade.  Including the raspberry juice, you should end up adding 4 1/3 cans of liquid to the lemonade.  Taste for tartness and add Splenda to taste.
Add two cups of vodka to the lemonade; stir well and place the pitcher in the refrigerator.  When ready to serve, fill a decorative 2-quart pitcher halfway up with ice cubes; add lemonade to fill.
Including the ice, you should end up with two 2-quart pitchers of Pink Lizzies.
