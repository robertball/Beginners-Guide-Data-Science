Ingredients:
4 cups peeled and sliced fresh peaches
1 cup fresh blackberries, or more to taste
1/2 cup gluten-free flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup quick-cooking oats
3/4 cup gluten-free flour
3/4 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Mix peaches, blackberries, 1/2 cup gluten-free flour, white sugar, lemon juice, and cinnamon together in a bowl; spread evenly into the prepared baking dish.
Stir brown sugar, oats, and 3/4 gluten-free flour together in a separate bowl. Cut butter into oat mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs; sprinkle evenly over berry mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes.
