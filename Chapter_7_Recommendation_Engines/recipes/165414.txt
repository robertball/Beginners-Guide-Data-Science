Ingredients:
2 cups fresh green beans, trimmed and halved
1 cup broccoli florets
1 cup cauliflower florets
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup cherry tomatoes
1 (6 ounce) can black olives, drained
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon monosodium glutamate (MSG)
1 tablespoon garlic salt
1 tablespoon dried dill weed
1 1/2 cups extra virgin olive oil

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the green beans, and cook until tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain, and rinse under cold water until the green beans are cool. Place into a bowl along with the broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, tomatoes, and olives; set aside.
Whisk together the vinegar, salt, pepper, monosodium glutamate, garlic salt, and dill in a bowl. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while continuing to whisk to create a dressing. Pour the dressing over the vegetables and stir to combine. Cover, and refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.
