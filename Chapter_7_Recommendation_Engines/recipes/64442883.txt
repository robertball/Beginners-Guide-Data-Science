Ingredients:
1 pound diced cooked chicken breast
1 can of drained black beans
1 can of Rotel w/green chilis
1 cup of frozen corn
1 small block of velveeta, cut into small cubes
1 cup of crunched up tortilla chips
salt (to taste)
pepper (to taste)
chili powder (1 tsp, maybe 2)
1 tsp. cumin

Directions:
Cook chicken.  I diced and cooked in a large saucepan and covered for about 20 minutes.  I added seasonings and the then frozen corn and black beans.  Stir and let simmer for about five minutes.  I drained all of this to get rid of any extra juices so the mix will stick together better.  I put chicken mix in a 9x12 casserole dish.  I added cut up velveeta and stirred. The heat from the cooked chicken helps the cheese melt and stick the mix together.  I used what we had left of the Cantina chips and crunched and poured over chicken mix.  I cooked on 350 for 20 minutes.  I pulled out chicken dish and poured a little shredded cheddar on top to help stick the chips together. Let sit to cool off.
