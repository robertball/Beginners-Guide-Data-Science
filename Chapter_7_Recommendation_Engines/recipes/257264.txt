Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
5 very ripe bananas, mashed
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
3 drops almond extract
3 drops amaretto (almond-flavored liqueur)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a loaf pan with cooking spray.
Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl.
Mix bananas, brown sugar, butter, eggs, almond extract, and amaretto together in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture; mix just until flour is incorporated, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture to the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool before serving, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Banana bread at its best. Lots of bananas and a hint of almond and almond liqueur make a delicious banana bread--I love it served with butter.
