1 1/2 cups sour cream
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 small onion
1 cup cooked beets
1 cup crushed ice

Place sour cream, lemon juice, onion and beets into a food processor or blender and puree until mixture is smooth.

Submitter: 
Rosemary
Description: 
I have modified this soup from a recipe I got from a blender book.  Canned beets are great for this recipe.  You can save the juice from the canned beats, freeze it and add it in place of the chilled water or ice. Try serving with a dollop of sour cream.
