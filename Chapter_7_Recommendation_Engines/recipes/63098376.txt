Description: 
So many different chicken wild rice casseroles, most with a cream of your favorite soup. This experiment included creamed corn instead of soup. It came out pretty tasty, but as a base, you can tweak to add your favorite additional ingredients and make it your own. Great use for leftover rice and chicken. Quick single bowl mixing and in the over it goes.
