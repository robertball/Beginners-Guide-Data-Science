Ingredients:
2cups sugar
1cup soft margarine or butter,(two 1/2 cup sticks of butter)
5 eggs
2cups flour
6tbsp buttermilk,(reg milk will work too)
2tsps baking soda
1-1/2cups ripe bananas, about 5 small
1cup nuts, chopped(optional)

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together. Let mixture sit for 1 hour. (Note: Due to banana size, the mixture may not all fit into one loaf pan; do not overflow your pan. Use two loaf pans for the extra batter)
Pour into greased loaf pan. Bake 60-65* minutes at 350 degrees. If using a bundt pan, bake for 50-60* minutes at 300 degrees. Ten minutes before final cooking time, check doneness with toothpick. When toothpick comes out clean from middle of the loaf, it is done or when center of loaf is close to 195-200 degrees F. (Note: It’s okay to let the crust get very dark if cooked for longer, it won’t hinder the taste).
Let stand until almost cool. Loosen bread from sides with sharp knife and set aside. Enjoy!
Recipe Notes
Oven times may vary. If liquid is seen in the center of the loaf, continue cooking until center is firm.
It is okay to cook longer until center. Edges may turn very dark – that’s okay. It will taste the same!
