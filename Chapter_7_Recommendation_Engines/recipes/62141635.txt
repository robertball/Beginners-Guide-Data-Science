Ingredients:
2 large or 3 medium avocados
1 lime
1 onion
1 tomato
2 or 3 jalapeno peppers
1 tbsp ginger
1 tsp wasabi
10 leafs shiso (perillia)
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
2-3 drops Tabasco sauce
salt and pepper

Directions:
Peel and remove the pits from the avocados.  Save one of the seeds to be used as a humidifier later.
Mash the avocados with a potato masher.
Juice the Lime into the avocados and mix.
Dice the Onion, Mince shiso and the Jalapenos (remove the seeds first for a milder version), Grate the ginger, and stir them into the avocado mixture.
Add the White Pepper and the Wasabi and mix.
Last, dice the tomato and gently fold it in.
Now comes the important step, taste it.  Put some on a tortilla chip and try it.  You can add more wasabi, a pea-sized drop at a time (a little can go a very long way) until you reach a level you like.  Also, add salt pepper and a few drops of Tabasco to taste.

Description: 
A variation on the classic Mexican dip using some ingredients common in Japan.  I developed this recipe because i couldn't get cilantro.  The wasabi gives it a nice unexpected kick.
