Ingredients:
4 Chicken thighs with fat
1 red onion, chopped
3 stalks celery, chopped
4 carrot sticks, chopped
6 garlic cloves or 1 head of garlic, chopped
1 tsp curry powder
1/2 tsp turmeric powder
1/2 tsp cumin powder (or 1 tsp cumin seeds)
1/2 tsp cardamom powder
1 tsp black pepper
3 tomatoes, chopped with juices.
2 T oil

Directions:
In the bottom of a large, dry soup pot, place oil.
Heat to medium high, and add chicken thighs, fat side down, in two batches, turning over to lightly brown each side.  (Crowding chicken pieces will force them to poach, and will not brown and seal in juices)
Add all vegetables and spices and stir together in the pot.
Add enough water to cover chicken pieces
Bring to boil, and with lid partly on, simmer for 1 hour.
After 1 hour, turn off heat.
Remove chicken pieces to a medium bowl, cool, and pull chicken from the bones.
Return chicken pieces to pot.
Stir.
Adjust seasonings.

Description: 
Traditional chicken soup recipe doctored up with cumin, cardamom pods, turmeric and curry in the tomato based chicken broth.  It is wonderful, especially for those who do not like the heavy creaminess of chicken in curry sauce as a side dish.  This is light and healthy!
