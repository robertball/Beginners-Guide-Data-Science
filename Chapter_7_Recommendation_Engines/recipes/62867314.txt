Ingredients:
1 package chocolate candy coating
Cocktail peanuts
Dried Cranberries
Pretzel Sticks

Directions:
Melt chocolate in a large microwave safe bowl, being careful not to burn.  Dump remaining ingredients into melted chocolate & stir until coated.  Drop by tablespoons onto waxed paper and allow to harden.  Now either give them away or throw them in the garbage....no, don't do that, you'll just be digging them out :)  THEY ARE ADDICTIVE!
