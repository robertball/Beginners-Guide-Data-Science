Ingredients:
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 cup minced onion
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
1 medium garlic clove, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)
2 cups tomato juice
3/4 cup distilled white vinegar (divided use)
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons molasses or dark molasses (not black strap)
1/2 teaspoon powdered mustard mixed 1 tablespoon water
1 1/2 teaspoon minced chipotle chile in adobo sauce
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat the butter in a small nonreactive saucepan over medium heat until foaming; add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes.
Add the chili powder and garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 20 seconds.
Add the tomato juice, 1/2 cup of the vinegar, the Worcestershire sauce, molasses, mustard mixture, salt, and chipotles; increase the heat to high and bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is slightly thickened and reduced to 1 1/2 cups, 30 to 40 minutes.
Off the heat, stir in the pepper and remaining 1/4 cup vinegar.
Cool to room temperature before serving.
