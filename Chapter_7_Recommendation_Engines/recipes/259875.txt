Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chopped cooked turkey
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
3/4 cup leftover stuffing
1/2 cup gravy, divided
1/2 cup cooked green peas
1/4 cup chopped onion
2 cups mashed potatoes
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine turkey, cream cheese, stuffing, 1/4 cup gravy, peas, and onion in large microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until cream cheese softens, about 2 minutes.
Spread mashed potatoes over the bottom of a 9x11-inch casserole dish.
Cut crescent roll dough in half. Flatten both halves on a work surface. Spoon turkey mixture down the middle. Roll up edges and press to seal. Place over potatoes.
Combine remaining 1/4 cup gravy, cream of chicken soup, and milk in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour over stuffed dough.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and hot, about 30 minutes.
