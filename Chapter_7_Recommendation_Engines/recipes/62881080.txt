Ingredients:
1 can Bush's Best Black beans, rinsed and drained
1 can (11 oz) sweet whole kernel corn, drained
2 medium tomatoes, chopped (remove seeds)
(I like to use 4 roma tomatoes, less seeds)
1  small red bell pepper, diced
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 cup diced red onion
1 minced fresh jalapeno pepper, remove seeds
4 T. fresh lime juice
2 T. red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 avocado, diced
tortilla chips

Directions:
Combine black beans, corn, chopped tomatoes and next 7 ingredients in a bowl. Add avocado last and lightly toss so not to mush up. Cover using plastic wrap putting it right on top of salsa (this helps keep the avocados from turning brown) and chill at least 2 hours. Serve with tortilla chips.
