Ingredients:
6 T butter
6 T unbleached flour
1 c milk mixed with 1 cup water, warmed
6 large eggs, separated, at room temp
1 c graded cheese (cheddar, gouda, mahon,or monterey jack)
1 c grated Parmesan cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.
In a heavy saucepan, melt the buter over medium heat. Add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon until the butter turns light brown. Gradually add the milk and water mixture, beating with a wire whisk until the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat and stir in the egg yolks, one at a time, and then the cheeses. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Beat the egg whites with a pinch of cream of tartar until stiff.
Gently fold the egg yolks into the egg whites and pour the mixture into a buttered 2-quart souffle dish.
Place in the preheated oven, lower the heat to 350, and bake for 40 minutes. Serve immediately.
