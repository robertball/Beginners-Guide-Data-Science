Ingredients:
4 cups packed basil leaves
About 10 parsley sprigs, stems removed
2 cloves garlic (more to taste)
1/4 cup pine nuts, walnuts, or almonds—toasted by sautéing briefly over medium heat to release their flavor (watch carefully, so they don't burn)
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup (or more, if needed) extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup freshly grated Romano or Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Combine the basil, garlic, parsley, toasted nuts, and salt and pepper in a food processor or blender, and process until finely chopped.
Drizzle the olive oil into the mixture as the processor or blender is running, just until it makes a nice paste. Remember, you can always add more oil, but you can't remove it.
Put the mixture in a bowl. Add grated cheese to mixture and stir.
Refrigerate leftover pesto drizzled with a layer of olive oil to preserve it. Pesto can also be frozen. One method is to freeze it in ice cube containers and then transfer the frozen cubes to a plastic freezer bag. A couple of cubes thawed and served hot on fresh pasta make enough pesto to feed a few hungry people.
