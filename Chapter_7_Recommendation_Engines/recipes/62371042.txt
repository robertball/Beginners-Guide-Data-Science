Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds top round steak, cut 1-inch thick
6 tablespoons frozen margarita drink mix concentrate, defrosted
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 cloves garlic, crushed
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 large avocado, diced
1/2 cup chopped red onion

Directions:
In a small bowl, make marinade by combining margarita drink mix, cilantro, vegetable oil, garlic, cumin, salt and pepper. Put 2 tablespoons of the marinade in a small container, cover and refrigerate.
Place the beef steak and remaining marinade in a resealable plastic bag. Seal bag carefully and turn to coat steak. Refrigerate 6-8 hours, or overnight, turning occasionally.
Remove steak from marinade and discard marinade. Place steak on grill over medium ash-covered coals. Grill uncovered for 16-18 minutes for medium-rare doneness turning occasionally. Remove steaks and keep warm.
Just before serving, in a medium bowl, combine avocado, onion and reserved 2 tablespoons of marinade mixture. Toss gently to coat.
Carve steak crosswise into thin slices. Serve immediately with avocado mixture.
