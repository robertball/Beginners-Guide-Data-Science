Ingredients:
2 cups heavy cream
1 cup buttermilk (not low-fat)
2/3 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp vanilla extract
3 eggs
1/4 cup unsulphured molasses

Directions:
1. In a medium bowl, combine 3 large eggs and molasses; whisk until combined. Set aside.
2. In a medium sauce pan, combine heavy cream, buttermilk, dark brown sugar, salt, ground cinnamon, and vanilla extract. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until sugar is dissolved and mixture begins to bubble around the edges (about 5 minutes).
3. Very slowly, add half of the hot cream mixture to the egg molasses mixture, whisking constantly. Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the pan with the remaining hot cream mixture, and continue to cook over medium low heat for about 8 minutes, or until mixture is slightly thickened and coats the back of a spoon.
4. Strain custard through a fine mesh sieve into a medium bowl. Cover with plastic wrap touching the top of the custard to avoid forming a skin. Cool completely in refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.
6. Pour custard into ice cream maker, and make according to manufacturer's directions.
