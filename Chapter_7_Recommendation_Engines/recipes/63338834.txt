Ingredients:
3+ cups powdered sugar
1/2 (14oz) can sweetened condensed milk
1/2 tsp each of your favorite 3 extracts
food coloring (optional)
3 cubes chocolate bark
3 cubes white chocolate bark
2 T ground nuts (optional)

Directions:
In mixing bowl, beat together most of powdered sugar and the condensed milk until a ball starts forming.
When pressed in your palm, the mixture should stay together and form a ball.  If too wet or too dry, adjust sugar or milk accordingly.
Separate mixture into 3 bowls.  Add different extract flavor to each bowl along with optional food coloring accordingly.
Knead each mixture into a ball until well formed.  Break into 1 inch pieces and roll into individual balls.
Place on baking rack to dry for 1-2 hours.
Melt chocolate bark in double boiler*.
Drop in one ball and quickly coat with chocolate.
Remove with a fork, scraping bottom of fork on edge of boiler to remove excess.
Place bon bon on sheet of waxed paper to cool and dry.
Sprinkle wet bon bons with nuts if you like.
Repeat until chocolate is used
Repeat with white chocolate
You can also mix nuts into the melted chocolate in the double boiler before dipping.
Serve in mini cupcake wrappers for a nice presentation.
Be careful, these are very rich and should not be eaten in one bite!
