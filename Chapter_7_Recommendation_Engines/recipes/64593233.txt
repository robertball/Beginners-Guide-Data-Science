Ingredients:
• 1 pound ground beef
• 1 small onion, chopped
• 3-4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
• 2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano, or to taste
• 2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste
• Salt, to taste
• Black pepper, to taste
• 1 small potato, diced
• 1 package Sazon seasoning mix
• 1/2 cup tomato sauce
• 1/4 cup olives
• 3 large ripe plantains
• 5 tablespoons vegetable oil
• 5 eggs, beaten
• 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
In large skillet, brown ground beef, onion and garlic over medium heat. Add oregano, cilantro, salt, pepper, potato and Sazon seasoning. Mix well. Add tomato sauce and olives. Cook until well blended, about 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Mixture can be made ahead, the kept chilled until casserole is ready to assemble.
Peel plantains, then cut into halves. Slice halves lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. In large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. In batches, fry plantain slices until golden and caramelized, turning to brown both sides. Drain on paper towels.
To assemble casserole place single layer of plantain slices in bottom of an 8-by-8-inch glass baking pan. Pour half of beaten eggs over plaintains. Top with meat mixture, cheese and remaining plantains. Pour beaten eggs over the top.
Bake, uncovered at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes, or until eggs are set and casserole is puffy and golden. Cut into squares and serve.
Makes 6 to 8 servings.
