Ingredients:
1 Head of Cabbage
1 Cup Uncooked Rice
2 Cups Stock Beef or Vegetable
1 Large Can Tomato Sauce
3 Lbs Ground Beef
2 Tbsp Tomato Paste
1 Large Onion Diced
1 - 2 cloves Garlic minced
3 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar
1/8 Cup Sugar

Directions:
Cook rice till tender with stock and half the tomato sauce (I used a rice cooker)
Saute Onions, Tomato Paste and garlic together add beef to the same skillet salt and pepper liberally, brown - drain and combine with cooked rice, Taste to make sure it is seasoned well.
Core Cabbage place in a large pot cover with water, salt and bring to a boil, as the water boils the leaves will soften and remove themselves from the head, as they release remove them and put them in a colander to cool, Once cooled remove the center rib.
Add Vinegar, Sugar to remaining tomato sauce, add 1 cup water.
Spray Bunt pan with non stick spray then using a basting brush, brush some of the sauce on the
bottom and sides of bunt pan.
Line your bunt pan on all sides and bottom with cabbage draping over the top of the pan,
I did a double layer all around.  Baste with more tomato sauce.
Place the rice and meat mixture in the pan and pack down tightly till full.
Fold Cabbage over the mixture and place more cabbage on top to cover.
Cover with remainder of the tomato sauce.
Cover with foil and bake at 350 for 1 hour.
Remove from oven let rest for 20 minutes and invert onto a serving platter.
