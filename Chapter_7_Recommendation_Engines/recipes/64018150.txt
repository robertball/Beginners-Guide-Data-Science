Ingredients:
2 pounds cubed beef chuck roast
5 cups water
4 cubes beef bouillon, crumbled
1/2 onion, chopped
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
3/4 cup uncooked pearl barley
salt and pepper to taste
carrot thyme garlic bay leaf

Directions:
In a slow cooker, combine beef, water, bouillon, onion, tomato sauce, veges and herbs, salt and pepper.
Cover, and cook on Low for 5 hours.
I cooked my barley according to package directions, rinsed with water and added it to the soup an hour before serving. Cooking and rinsing takes the starch out and it won't over thicken soup.
