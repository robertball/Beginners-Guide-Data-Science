Description: 
This is an old family recipe for cookies only made at Easter. Just before Easter we use to make these cookies, plus a cookie (biscuit type) with black pepper. My grandmother would also use this cookie dough and place an uncooked egg (with shell) on top of the cookie and bake. They are a large cookie...similar in size to a donut. I make these cookies into smaller circles, just watch the baking time.
