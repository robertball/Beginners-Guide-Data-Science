Ingredients:
1 pound pasta
1 pound lean ground beef
1 (32 ounce) jar Classico® Tomato and Basil Sauce
8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 1/4 cups Italian-style stewed tomatoes
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and reserve.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large skillet, brown the beef until no longer pink; drain off grease. Add pasta sauce, mushrooms, and tomatoes to beef and simmer for 10 minutes or until warmed through.
In a 9x13 inch baking dish, pour in beef and tomato mixture and add pasta; mix well. Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the top.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes or until the cheese starts to bubble; serve immediately.
