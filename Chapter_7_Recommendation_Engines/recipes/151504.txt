Sprinkle 1 cup crumb topping in bottom of unbaked pie crust. Reserve remaining for on top of apples.
Apple Filling: Combine 1 cup flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in large saucepan. Stir in apple slices. Cook over medium heat for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until mixture starts to thicken. Remove from heat. Stir in caramel topping, yogurt and flour.
Spoon filling into prepared pie crust. Sprinkle top with remaining crumb topping. Place pie plate on cookie sheet to handle easier.
Bake 50 minutes or until browned and apples are tender. Cover crust with foil last 10 minutes if it browns too quickly. Cool.
