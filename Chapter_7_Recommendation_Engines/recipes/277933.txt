Ingredients:
2 cups chopped pecans (optional)
15 1/4 ounces chocolate cake mix (such as Betty CrockerÂ® Super Moist)
1 1/4 cups water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1 1/3 (16 ounce) packages fudge frosting mix
1 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the bottom of a deep 9x13-inch baking pan. Spread pecans over.
Combine cake mix, water, oil. and eggs in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on low speed until moistened. Increase speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Combine frosting mix, milk, and butter in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir until all ingredients are melted. Remove from heat; you do not want to bring this to a boil. Pour over the cake mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
Cut into pieces and flip them over into a bowl to serve; there will be a gooey fudge sauce that has accumulated on the bottom of the pan. If necessary, spoon this back onto the cake after it has been flipped into the bowl (this is the best part).
