Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 1/4 cups warm water
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon cornmeal, or more as needed
1/2 cup chopped dry-pack sun-dried tomatoes
1 tablespoon dried basil
2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Add warm water and olive oil; stir with a wooden spoon until well blended. Slowly mix in remaining 1 cup flour until dough holds together and isn't sticky.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until doubled in size, about 3 hours.
Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal.
Punch dough down and stir in sun-dried tomatoes, basil, and garlic using a wooden spoon or with your hands. Form dough into a loaf and place on the prepared baking sheet. Let dough rise in a warm area of the kitchen for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until loaf is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
