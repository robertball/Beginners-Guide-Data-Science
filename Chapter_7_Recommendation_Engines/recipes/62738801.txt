Ingredients:
1 bag of sweet butter lettuce
1 can of tiny field peas - drained
1 bag of Nacho Cheese Doritos
1 bottle Green Goddess salad dressing

Directions:
Put lettuce in a bowl. Add the drained field peas. Crunch up some Doritos and add to it. Pour enough dressing over this mixture to moisten--do not saturate it because the lettuce will go limp. Mix slowly until all ingredients are blended.....add doritos on top for topping. You will not use entire bag of Doritos for this recipe. Serve and enjoy!

Description: 
A good and unusual salad that is great with grilled meats or alone. I was suprised at what was in it but it was fantastic and everyone loves it.
