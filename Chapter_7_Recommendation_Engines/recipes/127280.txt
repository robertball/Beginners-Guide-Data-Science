Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1 1/2 teaspoons CALUMET Baking Powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/2 cups POST SELECTS CRANBERRY ALMOND CRUNCH Cereal
3 (1 ounce) squares BAKER'S Premium White Baking Chocolate, chopped
4 (1 ounce) squares BAKER'S Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Mix flour, baking powder and salt in small bowl. Beat butter and sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Blend in eggs and vanilla. Gradually add flour mixture, beating well after each addition. Stir in cereal and white chocolate. Divide dough in half. Shape each half into 14x2-inch log with lightly floured hands; place on greased baking sheet.
Bake 30 min. or until lightly browned. Remove from baking sheet. Place on cutting board; cool 5 min. Using a serrated knife, diagonally cut each log into 12 slices; place upright on baking sheet, 1/2 inch apart. Bake an additional 15 to 18 min. or until slightly dried. Remove from baking sheet. Cool on wire racks.
Dip biscotti in melted chocolate. (Or drizzle chocolate over biscotti.) Let stand until set. Store in tightly covered container at room temperature.
