Ingredients:
1 cup cold water
1 egg, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup dry potato flakes
1 tablespoon chopped chives
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup sour cream for garnish
1 tablespoon chopped chives, divided

Directions:
Whisk together water, egg and salt in a large bowl until salt has dissolved. Stir in dry potato flakes until incorporated. Stir in 1 tablespoon of chopped chives; season with black pepper and cayenne pepper.
Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Swirl the pan to combine.
Divide potato mixture into four equal portions and shape into pancakes. Place the pancakes in the pan and reduce heat to medium. Cook until a well-browned crust has formed onto the bottom of the pancakes, about 10 minutes. Flip each pancake and flatten slightly. Cook until other sides are browned, 7 to 8 more minutes.
Transfer to plate; top each pancake with a dollop of sour cream and sprinkle each with 3/4 teaspoon chives.
