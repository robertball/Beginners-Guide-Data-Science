2 medium baking potatoes
1 1/2 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese, cubed
1 tablespoon snipped chives
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
dash cayenne pepper
3 tablespoons fat-free milk
3 teaspoons butter, melted and divided
1 dash garlic powder
1 dash paprika

Directions:
Scrub and pierce potatoes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 1 hour or until tender. Cool for 10 minutes. Cut potatoes in half. Scoop out pulp, leaving a thin shell.
In a bowl, mash the pulp with cream cheese, chives, salt, basil and cayenne. Add milk and 1-1/2 teaspoons butter; mash. Spoon into potato shells. Drizzle with remaining butter; sprinkle with garlic powder and paprika. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until heated through.
