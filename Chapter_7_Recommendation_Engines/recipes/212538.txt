Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound beef for stew, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (10.5 ounce) can Campbell'sÂ® Condensed Beef Broth
1/2 cup water
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves, crushed
1 bay leaf
3 medium carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 medium potatoes, cut into quarters

Directions:
Stir the flour and black pepper on a plate. Coat the beef with the flour mixture.
Heat the oil in a 6-quart saucepot over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook until well browned, stirring often. Remove the beef from the saucepot. Pour off any fat.
Stir the broth, water, thyme, and bay leaf in the saucepot and heat to a boil. Return the beef to the saucepot. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 1 1/2 hours.
Add the carrots and potatoes to the saucepot. Cover and cook for 30 minutes or until the beef is fork-tender and the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. Remove and discard the bay leaf.
