Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, chopped
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
2 (8.75 ounce) cans whole kernel corn, drained
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
2 cups fresh salsa
5 cups crushed plain tortilla chips
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 large fresh tomato, finely chopped
3 green onions, chopped (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef with the garlic and onion; drain.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the meat mixture, chili powder, black beans, corn, sour cream and salsa. Stir until well blended.
Into a 9x13 inch baking dish, spoon enough of the beef mixture to cover the bottom. Arrange half of the crushed tortilla chips on top of the meat mixture and layer with 1 cup of Cheddar cheese. Spoon another layer of the meat mixture on top of the cheese layer, cover with remaining chips and layer with 1 cup of cheese. Spread final layer of meat mixture on top and sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of cheese on top. Top with diced tomato and green onions.
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
A delicious southwestern recipe that includes black beans. I use mild salsa, but if you like it spicy, use hot salsa. This is one of my favorite recipes.
