Ingredients:
20 tortilla chips
1/4 pound smoked beef sausage
1/2 cup Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup barbeque sauce

Directions:

Heat in the microwave until the cheese melts, 15 to 30 seconds.

Description: 
We make these for a quick snack while watching movies or for an easy kid pleaser. They are not the most fancy nachos, but they taste great.
