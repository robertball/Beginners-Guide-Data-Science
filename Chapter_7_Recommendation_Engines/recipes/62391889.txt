Ingredients:
TOPPING:
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 1/2 cups chopped plump tomatoes
1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced (or about 1 to 2 TBSP of dried)
1 TBSP olive oil
2 garlic cloves minced
1/2 tsp. minced fresh thyme or 1/8 tsp dried thyme (I used an 1/8 tsp of powdered thyme)
1/2 tsp. balsamic vinegar
1/4 tsp. salt
1/8 tsp pepper
PIZZA CRUST:
2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees)
1 cup bisquick
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1 TBSP sugar
2 TBSP olive oil
1 tsp Italian seasoning
1 to 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
TOPPING: Mix all of the topping ingredients together in a small bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve pizza.
CRUST: In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water.  In the same bowl mix together the bisquick, cheese, sugar, oil, Italian seasoning, and flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5-6 min.
Divide dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion into a 9 in circle, transfer to to pizza pans that are coated with cooking spray (or brushed with olive oil).
Put pizza into cold oven and turn it on to 450 degrees F and let cook for about 5 minutes or until crust is slightly golden (DO NOT OVER BAKE). Take pizza out and sprinkle mozzarella cheese on and return to oven until cheese begins to turn golden and bottom of crust is golden.
Serve pizza with the prepared topping and enjoy!
