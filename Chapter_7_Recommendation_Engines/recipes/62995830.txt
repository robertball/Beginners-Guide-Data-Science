Ingredients:
1 Small peeled and grated Apple
1 Teaspoons Baking powder
4 Cups Whole wheat Flour
½ Cup Cornmeal
1 Teaspoon Cinnamon
2 Tablespoons applesauce
1 Cup Water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease cookie sheets (I use my Pampered Chef large stoneware bar pans.
In a large bowl mix together all the ingredients except for the water. Add the water a bit at a time as required (Slightly more or less water may be required, depends on how juicy your apples are). The mixture should form a soft dough.
Kneed dough on a floured surface for a good minute. Roll the dough out until ¼ inch think. Cut with your favorite cookie cutter.
Bake in the hot oven for 30 minutes, once the initial 30 minutes is up. Turn off the oven but leave the biscuits in the warm but off over for a further 30 minutes to crisp.
