1 medium vidalia, cut to 1/4" thickness
2 ribs of celery, cut to 1/4" thickness

Directions:
Saute pepper, onion and celery in 1 tsp. olive oil, just long enough to make the vegetables flexible but still slightly crunchy (about 4 minutes). Season with salt and cool.
In a mixing bowl, add 2 1/2 tbsp. olive oil,  2 tbsp. red wine vinegar and basil.  Toss in tomatoes, cucumbers and cooled saute mixture.
Chill for about 1 hour to let flavors mix.  Serve chilled.
