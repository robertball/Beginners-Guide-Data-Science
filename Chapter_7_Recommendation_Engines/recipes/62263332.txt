Description: 
I started by coating chicken thighs (bone-in, skin removed) in Frank's Red Hot and refrigerating overnight. Next day I checked out Frank's Red Hot web-site for a recipe. I tweaked one a bit and came up with this.  Hot and spicy chicken with a  wonderful flavor. It was a big hit with our guests! Served with a curry rice.Modified from: Tandoori Grilled Chicken.
