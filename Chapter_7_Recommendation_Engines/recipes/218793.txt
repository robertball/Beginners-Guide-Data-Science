Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package wide egg noodles
½ cup butter, melted
2 cups small curd cottage cheese
1 teaspoon salt
1 ½ cups applesauce
1 ½ cups white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
6  eggs, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well.
Melt butter in the pot, and stir together the drained noodles, cottage cheese, salt, and applesauce. Mix in the sugar and cinnamon. Add the beaten eggs; stir to blend all ingredients. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish.
Bake until top is very brown, about 1 hour.
