Ingredients:
1 tsp sugar
1 package dry active yeast
1/4 cup tepid water (105-110 degrees)
1 cup warm milk
1/4 cup melted butter
1/4 cup sugar
1 egg, beaten (at room temperature)
1 tsp salt
4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Combine sugar and yeast in tepid water. Let stand 5-10 minutes until yeast begins to foam.
Thoroughly mix milk, butter, sugar, egg and salt in large bowl.
Stir in the yeast mixture and 3-1/2 cups of flour, adding a bit more if necessary to make a soft, pliable dough.
Turn dough out on floured board and let rest while you clean and butter a bowl.
Knead dough gently 4-5 minutes, adding flour if necessary, until dough is smooth and silky.
Return to bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Butter a 12-cup muffin tin.
Punch down dough. Pinch off pieces about 1-1/2 inches in diameter (enough to fill 1/2 of muffin cup).
Roll into smooth spheres.
Place 2 pieces in each prepared muffin cup.
Cover dough loosely with plastic wrap for 45 minutes.
Bake rolls 20-25 minutes or until light brown.
