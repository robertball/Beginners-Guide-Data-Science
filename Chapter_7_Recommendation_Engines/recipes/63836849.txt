Description: 
I'm told that this old world recipe dates back to the colonies and was a favorite of George Washingtons. While it was called pumpkin pie in the old days it's not what we would call pie now. Here the custard pie is found inside the pumpkin and the whole thing can be served up for a very different dessert.
