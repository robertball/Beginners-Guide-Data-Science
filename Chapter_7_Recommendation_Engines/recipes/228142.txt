Ingredients:
1 (13.8 ounce) can Pillsbury® refrigerated artisan pizza crust with whole grain
1/2 cup coarsely chopped bacon
6 eggs, beaten
4 ounces cream cheese, cut into small pieces
2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese with jalapeno peppers
1/2 cup sliced red bell pepper
1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion
Fresh chopped cilantro, if desired
Old El Paso® Salsa

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees F for dark or nonstick pan (425 degrees F for all other pans). Spray 14-inch round pizza pan with cooking spray.
Unroll dough; place on pan. Starting at center, press out dough to edge of pan. Bake about 8 minutes or until crust edge begins to set.
Meanwhile, in 10-inch skillet, cook bacon 4 to 6 minutes over medium-high heat or until just crispy, stirring frequently. Remove bacon; drain drippings, leaving 1 teaspoon in skillet.
In same skillet, add eggs; cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until firm but still moist.
Spoon and spread eggs over crust. Drop cream cheese over eggs. Top with Monterey Jack cheese, bell pepper, onion and bacon. Bake 9 to 13 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown and cheese is melted. To serve, cut into 6 wedges. Sprinkle with cilantro, and serve with salsa.
