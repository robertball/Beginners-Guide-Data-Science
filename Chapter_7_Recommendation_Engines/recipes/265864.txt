Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 tablespoon instant coffee, or as needed
1 teaspoon oil for greasing
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 pinch white sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
3/4 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup water
3 tablespoons pumpkin puree
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Boil 1 cup water and mix with instant coffee in a measuring cup or mug. Set aside to cool.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a rectangular 9x13-inch baking pan.
Combine flour, sugar, mixed spice, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger in a bowl and mix well. Add cooled coffee, oil, and 3/4 cup water and mix until well combined. Fold in pumpkin puree and vanilla extract; mix well. Pour batter evenly into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or almost clean, as this cake can be quite sticky, about 30 minutes.
Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert cake carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Cool at least 15 minutes more before cutting.

Description: 
This cake is beautifully moist and incredibly simple to make; it's also 100% vegan and nut free, so it's an all-around winner in my book. It can easily be cut into bars or squares, and you could even add icing on top for an extra something. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do!
