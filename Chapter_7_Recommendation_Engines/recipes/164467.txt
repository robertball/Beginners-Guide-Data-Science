Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons honey mustard
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 pound salmon fillet

Directions:
Combine the melted butter, vegetable oil, Worcestershire sauce, honey mustard sauce, brown sugar, and garlic powder in a large bowl.  Whisk to combine. Reserve 2 tablespoons marinade for basting. Place the salmon in a shallow dish and pour the remaining marinade over. Cover and chill for 45 minutes.
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 5 inches from the heat source.
Broil salmon for 12 minutes, brushing occasionally with the reserved marinade. Salmon is done when it is glazed from the marinade and flakes easily with a fork.
