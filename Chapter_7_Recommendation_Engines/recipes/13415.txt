Ingredients:
10 pounds peeled and cubed potatoes
4 cups non-dairy creamer
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes in a large pot, and cover with water.  The water level should stand about 2 inches above potatoes.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until very tender.
Remove soup from heat, and slowly stir in nondairy creamer.  Continue stirring until soup is creamy.
Mash slightly with a potato masher.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve hot or cold.

Submitter: 
Rosemary
Description: 
This is a base soup. You can eat it as is, or customize it by adding bacon, celery, onions, carrots, or whatever you like. Nondairy creamer is my choice, but you  can use light cream or canned milk. Do not use red potatoes to make this soup.
