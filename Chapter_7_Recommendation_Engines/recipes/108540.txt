Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped carrots
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 1/2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
3/4 cup strong brewed coffee
1/4 cup water
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
1/3 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Melt the butter in a stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and parsley; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce, coffee, water, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring the soup to a boil and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.
Pour the hot soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Stir in the cream and heat until warm. Do not boil.

Description: 
This creamy tomato soup is delicious and has a twist - the addition of strong, black coffee. This is the perfect summer dish for using freshly picked tomatoes from the garden. Remember - the better the quality of the tomatoes, the better the taste of the soup.
