Description: 
Just chop some fresh mango, add a few simple ingredients, and believe it or not, this spicy mango relish is done! Not only is this pretty, but it's versatile and delicious on so many things, from something as simple as tortilla chips to fancier things like seared prawns. You can't beat this sweet heat on spicy meat!
