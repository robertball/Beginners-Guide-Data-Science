Ingredients:
3 pounds red potatoes
2 TBS butter
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 tsp wasabi paste ( or to taste )

Directions:
Boil potatoes for 15 minutes or until a fork inserts into the potatoes easily.  Drain water and return potatoes back to the pan.  With a hand mixer ( or masher ) break up the potatoes.  Add the butter and mix for another minute until all the butter melts.  Add the heavy cream and wasabi paste and mix well.  Serve immediately.
