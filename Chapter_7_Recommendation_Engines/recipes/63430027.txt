Ingredients:
2 slices pancetta(or bacon)
1 sprig parsley
1/4 cup butter
1 and 1/3 cups fresh peas(you can use frozen)
1 chicken or beef cube, or your own broth.
1  heaping cup of Arborio rice(Italian rice)
salt(not to much,the pancetta or bacon is salty)
1/4 cup parmesan cheese(grated)
1 onion chopped fine(i like to put fresh garlic chopped fine in it also,personal choice)
freshly ground pepper.
pinch of sugar.

Directions:
Chop the pancetta,parsley,onion,and if using garlic,and fry gently in a sauce pan with half of the butter on medium heat.Add the peas and 1 cup water and a pinch of sugar,cook with the lid on for 5 minutes,15 if using large fresh peas Add the rice and cook until the rice is glossy. .Dissolve the chicken,or beef cube in 4 and 1/2 cups water,add to your saucepan,bring to a boil.Add the pepper,a bit of salt,turn heat down a little.Stir often to prevent sticking.When the rice is Al Dente,about 15-20 minutes,add the rest of the butter and grated cheese,mix thoroughly and serve.
For a true "risi bisi" the liquid should have reduced enough to have a thick,almost glutinous consistency to it,almost like a thick soup.** see notes
