Ingredients:
½ cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon hot sauce
1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
¼ cup all-purpose flour
⅓ cup tapioca flour
2 ½ teaspoons Cajun seasoning
½ teaspoon garlic salt
½ teaspoon honey powder (such as Savory Spice(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
¼ teaspoon ground paprika
⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 teaspoons honey

Directions:
Combine buttermilk and hot sauce in a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken thighs and marinate for 30 minutes
Combine flour, tapioca flour, Cajun seasoning, garlic salt, honey powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Remove thighs from buttermilk mixture and dredge through flour mixture. Shake off excess flour.
Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place chicken thighs into the air fryer basket and cook for about 15 minutes. Flip thighs over and cook until chicken thighs are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken thighs from air fryer and drizzle each thigh with 1 teaspoon honey.
