Ingredients:
6 beef short ribs, or more to taste
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup vegetable broth
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1/4 cup brown sugar
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon finely grated ginger
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon potato starch
2 tablespoons cold water
2 green onion tops, thinly sliced

Directions:
Season short ribs with salt and pepper on both sides.
Heat olive oil and sesame oil in a pot over medium-high heat and cook short ribs in batches until browned on all sides, 5 to 8 minutes. Place short ribs in a slow cooker.
Stir together soy sauce, vegetable broth, rice vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and crushed red pepper flakes in a bowl. Pour sauce over short ribs. Cover slow cooker.
Cook on High until ribs are cooked through, about 4 hours. Remove ribs from sauce and keep warm.
Pour sauce into a pot and cook on medium-low heat until reduced, about 5 minutes. Remove as much grease as possible. Mix cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until smooth. Pour into sauce and cook until thickened, 1 to 3 minutes.
Pour sauce over short ribs and sprinkle sliced green onions on top.
