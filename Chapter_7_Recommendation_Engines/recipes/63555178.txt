Ingredients:
Dressing:
1/2 tsp salt
dash pepper
2 Tbsp sugar
2 Tbsp vinegar
1/4 cup salad oil
dash Tabasco sauce
1 Tbsp snipped parsley
Greens:
1/4 head iceberg lettuce
1/4 head romaine lettuce
1 cup chopped celery
2 green onions with tops
1 small tin Mandarin oranges, drained
"Garnish:"
1/4 cup slivered almonds
1 Tbsp & 1 tsp sugar

Directions:
Combine the greens in a large bowl. In a separate smaller bowl, mix the dressing. Pour over greens once ready to serve.
Almonds: Put the slivered almonds in sauce pan. Add sugar on the almonds. Put on low heat and watch carefully until sugar melts over almonds (it takes a while but then happens very suddenly so be VERY careful or they'll burn). Add to salad.

Description: 
This salad is a favourite in my family. Although I have no idea where the recipe came from, whenever it's made at a gathering, people always want seconds. This recipe is very easy to modify to your taste, so feel free to change up the greens, leave some thing(s) out, or add others. Enjoy!
