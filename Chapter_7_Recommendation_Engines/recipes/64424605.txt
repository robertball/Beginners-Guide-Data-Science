Ingredients:
2-3 peaches, thinly sliced
1 package frozen puff pastry (2 sheets), thawed
3/4 cup apricot preserves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Cut each sheet of puff pastry into 9 equal squares, about 3” x 3” each. Dab a bit of apricot preserves into the middle of each square. You’ll have preserves left over for the glaze. Fan three slices of peach over the apricot preserves, leaving a little margin of pastry around the edges. (If the peaches are larger than the square, cut the slices in half to fit.) Lightly spoon preserves over peach slices.
Bake one sheet at a time in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. In the meantime, thin the rest of the apricot preserves with 2 or 3 teaspoons of hot water to make a glaze.
After 10 minutes, remove the tartlets from the oven and spoon the thinned glaze over each square. Return to the oven and bake for 2 minutes. Repeat with the second sheet. Cool on a rack before serving.
