Ingredients:
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 tablespoon butter
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
6 eggs
1 cup milk
3/4 cup biscuit baking mix
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped broccoli, thawed
2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 cup small curd cottage cheese
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a small skillet, saute mushrooms in butter until tender; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, eggs, milk and biscuit mix just until combined. Stir in the broccoli, cheeses, salt and mushrooms.
Pour into a greased round 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Also on our Christmas morning menu is this rich-tasting souffle. Like any puffy souffle, it will settle a bit after you remove the dish from the oven, but the pretty golden top is very attractive. I often add some cubed ham.
