Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 red onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound okra - rinsed, trimmed, and sliced 1/2-inch thick
2 cups frozen corn
1 bay leaf
3 large tomatoes - peeled, seeded, and chopped
1/3 cup vegetable broth
salt to taste
black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving grease in skillet. Crumble bacon into a bowl.
Heat bacon grease in the same skillet over medium heat and add bell pepper, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir for 3 minutes. Add okra, corn, and bay leaf. Cover skillet and reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes more. Add tomatoes and broth. Cook until okra is tender as desired, about 10 minutes.
Remove and discard bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper. Serve garnished with crumbled bacon.
