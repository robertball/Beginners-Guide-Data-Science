Ingredients:
4T yogurt with live cultures, no flavors
1/2 gal whole milk, not ultra pasteurized
You will need a
Strainer/colander
Basin or large pyrex
Heating apparatus that will get to 110, I use a heating pad on high
Bowl to fit the milk, ideally glass. Not plastic
Thermometer
Small bowl
Double Boiler or pot that the bowl can sit on

Directions:
Pour approx 1C milk into the small bowl and add yogurt, mix until dissolved. Bring the double Boiler to a boil and add milk and the thermometer. Heat milk until 180F to denture the proteins. Let it cool to 110F and remove any skin that has formed. Add the small bowl yogurt/milk mixture and stir. Maintain the 110F for 16 hours with plastic wrap on top. Your yogurt should look almost like jello. Place the strainer/colander in the Basin or pyrex and line the strainer with paper towels. Pour the milk into the strainer, cover with plastic wrap and set into the fridge for 3 days. Once a day empty the Basin (this is whey separation). Day 3, your yogurt should have an almost cream cheese texture and you can serve it with an ice cream scoop. Add toppings of your choice, honey, fruit, granola, etc. This yogurt is also excellent for use as a marinade in Indian recipes as its thicker and won't fall off foods.
