3/4 cup peach schnapps
6 tablespoons frozen lemonade concentrate, thawed

1 granny smith apple cubed

Directions:
In a large pitcher, combine dry white wine, peach schnapps, lemonade concentrate and sugar. Stir until sugar is dissolved. Add sliced peaches, raspberries, strawberries, and apples.
Refrigerate sangria until well chilled, at least 2 hours, or overnight to blend flavors. Serve over ice, and use a slotted spoon to include sliced peaches and fruit with each serving.
