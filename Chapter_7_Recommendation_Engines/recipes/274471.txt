Ingredients:
1 1/8 cups white sugar, divided, or as needed
3/4 cup butter
4 tablespoons molasses
1 egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided, or as needed
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 cookie sheets.
Beat 1 cup sugar, butter, molasses, and egg together in a mixing bowl using an electric mixer.
Sift flour, baking soda, ginger, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, cloves, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Beat into butter mixture until combined.
Combine 1/8 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a shallow bowl. Roll cookie dough into 1-inch balls. Roll cookies in the sugar-cinnamon mixture to coat. Place on the prepared cookie sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and edges are set, about 11 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool at least 5 minutes before serving or storing.

Description: 
These little cookies are my grandmother's specialty. Perfect to keep in the freezer for later as well! I used to make these all the time with my grandmother, now I get a huge basket of them for every holiday and birthday! 

In my grandmother's instructions, it tells you to sift some of the ingredients. It makes for a nicer batter, but I don't own a sifter and it's not particularly necessary, I used a whisk or a fork to turn and fluff the dry ingredients before adding.
