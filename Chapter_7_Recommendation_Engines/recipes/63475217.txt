In a large bowl, combine the popped corn and the toasted nuts. Set aside.
In a large saucepan, combine the butter, brown sugar, corn syrup and cream of tartar. Cook over medium low heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Add candy thermometer and cook over medium heat without stirring, until thermometer reaches 300-310 degrees. (Hard crack stage)
