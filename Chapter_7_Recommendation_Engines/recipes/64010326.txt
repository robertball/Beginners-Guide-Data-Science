Ingredients:
4 pounds pork baby back ribs
salt and pepper to taste
garlic and onion powder
BBQ sauce (Master)

Directions:
Season ribs with salt and pepper onion and garlic powder.  Roast at 400 for 1/2 hour, turning once or Brown up with oil on griddle
put the ribs cook on low for about 8-10 hours. Then I place them in the oven on a baking sheet for a half hour so that the sauce caramelizes onto the meat. It works every time!
