Ingredients:
2 Tbsp chili sauce, or ketchup
1 Tbsp packed brown sugar, dark-variety
1 clove(s) (medium) garlic clove(s), minced (or 1/2 tsp garlic powder)
1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
2 tsp mustard, course-grain recommended
1 tsp ginger root, fresh, minced (or 1/4 tsp ground ginger)
1 pound(s) uncooked trimmed T-bone beef steak, cut 1 1/2-inches thick

Directions:
Preheat grill to high.
In a small bowl, combine chili sauce (or ketchup), sugar, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, mustard and ginger; brush sauce all over steak. Grill, flipping once, brushing steak with any leftover barbecue sauce while steak cooks, about 6 to 7 minutes per side, or until desired degree of doneness.
Remove steak to a cutting board, cover loosely with aluminum foil and let stand for 10 minutes before slicing against the grain. Yields about 3 ounces steak per serving.
