Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
5 large Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch cubes
1 large carrot, coarsely shredded
2 pounds cooked corned beef, cubed
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
salt to taste (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Melt butter with the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook the onion just until it begins to brown, about 8 minutes; stir in the potatoes and carrot, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the cubed corned beef, parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper. Let the mixture cook until hash is crisp and browned, stirring often, 10 to 15 more minutes.

Description: 
I purposely cook a whole corned beef just to make hash.  There's nothing like the taste of fresh versus canned hash.  This is also good for leftover St. Paddy's Day corned beef.  I throw the carrot in for color, claiming it's the Leprechaun's gold. Serve with fried eggs and brown soda bread (farls).
