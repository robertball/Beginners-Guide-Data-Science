Ingredients:
1/2 cup oil for frying
1 ripe plantain, peeled and cut into 1-inch rounds
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Place a plate, upside-down, onto a work surface.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry plantain slices in the hot oil until slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer plantain slices using a slotted spoon onto the upside-down plate, reserving oil in the skillet. Place a second plate, right-side up, onto the plantains. Smash the plantain slices by gently pressing the top plate into the bottom plate.
Place the smashed plantains in the hot oil and fry until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer fried plantains to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle salt over plantains.
