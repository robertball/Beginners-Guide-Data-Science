Ingredients:
1 lb. catfish fillets
1 cup yellow corn meal
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons butter
2/3 cup chopped onion
2/3 cup chopped celery
2/3 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomato, drained
1 cup Herdez ® Red Guajillo Chile Cooking Sauce
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°. Coat a baking pan with oven-cooking spray.
Put milk in one shallow bowl. In a second shallow bowl or pie plate, combine corn meal with 1 t salt and 1/2 t cayenne. Dip fish fillets in milk and then into corn meal mixture, turning to coat well. Place on baking sheet. Drizzle with melted butter. Bake at 400° for 40 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
While fish is cooking, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet. Add onion, celery & bell pepper. Saute 5-10 minutes until vegetables are tender. Stir in diced tomatoes, Herdez (r) cooking sauce, oregano, Worcestershire & 1/2 t salt. Simmer 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in lemon juice, remove from heat, cover and keep warm. Serve over baked fish.
