Ingredients:
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons dried sage, divided
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 (6 ounce) pork chops
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon butter
1 cup apple cider
2 teaspoons honey

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Combine brown sugar, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon sage, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Dredge pork chops in seasoning mixture until coated thoroughly.
Heat olive oil and butter in an oven-safe skillet over medium heat until butter is frothy, 1 to 2 minutes. Brown pork chops in the hot skillet on each side, 7 to 10 minutes total. Add apple cider, remaining sage, and drizzle in honey. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes.
Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until pork chops are no longer pink in the centers, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Remove the skillet from the oven and plate pork chops with sauce.

Description: 
This recipe was an accident. I was experimenting with flavors and wasn't expecting much out of it, but the apple cider addition yielded some of the best pork I've ever tasted (and the boyfriend agreed).
