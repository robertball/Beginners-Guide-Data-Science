Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups Greek yogurt
2 eggs
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons water
1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups fresh blueberries
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a muffin tin with cooking spray or line with paper liners.
Whisk 2 cups flour, oats, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl.
Whisk Greek yogurt, eggs, applesauce, brown sugar, water, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl.
Toss blueberries with 1 teaspoon flour to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the muffins.
Fold flour mixture into the Greek yogurt mixture. Fold in blueberries. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
No oil, no butter... This muffin makes me feel not guilty about having more than just one. They are great to grab and go for a quick breakfast. The oats and Greek yogurt will keep you feeling full. Enjoy fresh from the oven or cool completely, store in an airtight container for 2 days, or pack away and freeze.
