Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
1/4 cup butter
2 (4 ounce) containers crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
10 ounces heavy cream
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and keep warm.
Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium heat. Stir in Gorgonzola cheese until creamy, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in heavy cream and cook, stirring frequently, until sauce has thickened, about 10 minutes. Add spinach and Parmesan cheese to sauce; cook until spinach is heated through and Parmesan is melted, 3 to 4 minutes.
Place warm pasta into the pot with the sauce and toss evenly to coat. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This is one of my all-time favorite recipes for penne pasta with Gorgonzola. It is a bit heavy, but so delish and quick, too! My whole family enjoys this one, even my 3-year-old! You can use fresh spinach if you like, just let it wilt in the sauce. I use frozen spinach for speed. You can also use two 10-ounce packages of spinach if you'd like. Enjoy! Serve with additional Parmesan cheese.
