Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
3 eggs
12 ounces Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
6 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
6 tablespoons butter, divided, or more to taste
2 (24 ounce) jars marinara sauce, or more to taste
12 slices mozzarella cheese
1 (3 ounce) package Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons oregano
2 tablespoons basil
1 tablespoon garlic powder

Directions:
Spread flour on a shallow plate. Beat eggs in a bowl. Pour bread crumbs into a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken breasts in flour. Dip in egg and roll in bread crumbs to coat.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry breaded chicken breasts, 2 at a time, until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining butter and chicken breasts.
Layer chicken breasts in a slow cooker, covering each layer with marinara sauce.
Cook on low until flavors combine, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place chicken breasts side-by-side in a baking dish, spooning additional sauce on top. Place 2 slices mozzarella cheese over each piece of chicken. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese, oregano, basil, and garlic powder on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.

This is a relatively simple recipe for making great chicken Parmesan at home. Goes great over angel hair pasta with a big piece of garlic bread, steamed broccoli, and a glass of Cabernet.
