Split chilies; rinse and remove seeds. Dry on paper towels. Arrange chilies on the bottom of an 11-in. x 7-in. x 1-1/2-in. baking dish. Top with cheeses. In a bowl, beat eggs; add milk and biscuit mix. Blend well; pour over cheese. Sprinkle with salt. Bake at 325 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until golden brown. Serve with salsa.

Description: 
Chilies are a 'must' where I live. I find they almost always improve a recipe that uses cheese. Sometimes I make this into a main dish by adding shredded cooked chicken after the chili layer. It really tastes good!
