24 prepared mini bakery croissants
1/2 cup light olive oil
1 1/2 tbsp Italian seasoning blended seasonings
1 tsp dried dill
2  tsp onion powder
2 1/2 tsp garlic powder
2 1/2 tbsp grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Place bakery croissants on ungreased sheet pan, place in oven for 7 to 9 minutes or until warmed through and slightly browned. Meanwhile, mix remaining ingredients together, thoroughly breaking up any large parmesan clumps. Note, oil will seperate if made ahead of time and will need to be stirred to incorperate ingredients.
Remove croissants from oven, slightly cool to touch. dredge each roll through the oil mixture and place back on pan. To soak up for a moment. Then serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a spin off of another. I couldn't find it when I needed it and so I remember basics: oil, parmesan cheese and spices. Make rolls, dip in mixture and ta-da excellent goodness spruces up a great meal or casserole. So This delightful recipe is made with buttery bakery croissants and there never is a roll left at the end of a meal.
