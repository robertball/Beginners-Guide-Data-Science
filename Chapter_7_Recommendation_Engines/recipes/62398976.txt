Description: 
When I was stationed overseas in Sembach, Germany all of the restaurants served this salad dressing. So simple and so tasty. It's slightly creamy and very tangy. Don't worry if it seems watery, it's supposed to be that way! If you like more of a sweeter dressing, try using evaporated milk instead.
