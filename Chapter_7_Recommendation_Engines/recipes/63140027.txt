1 egg
1 C gluten free all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda

1 1/4 C sugar free applesauce
1 C rolled oats
1/2 C mini choc chips + 1/2 C mini cinnamon chips

In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg. Combine dry ingredients seperately; add alternately with applesauce to the creamed mixture. Stir in oats and chips. Fill greased or *paper-lined muffin tins 3/4 full. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes.
*Paper cups work better to keep chips from sticking to the pan, and make the muffins easier to carry in the car on the way to work!

Description: 
Moist with just the right texture, these muffins are easy to make, and they melt in your mouth! I took the orignal recipe found on this site, and changed it up to be gluten free and lower in sugar/fats.  These muffins were highly praised, thinking these were too good to be gluten free! Replace the chips with raisins/nuts for an even healthier alternative.Modified from: Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Muffins
