Ingredients:
1 banana
2 eggs
1/3 cup rolled oats
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
cooking spray

Directions:
Blend banana, eggs, oats, and baking powder in a blender until smooth, about 45 seconds.
Spray a griddle or skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
A flourless banana pancake recipe I tried was mushy and difficult to flip. I adjusted the recipe and these came out puffy and light like traditional pancakes, though they contain no wheat flour, added sugar, or milk. Kids love the subtle banana flavor, too. Serve with butter and syrup of choice.
