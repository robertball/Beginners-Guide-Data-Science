Ingredients:
10 roma (plum) tomatoes - peeled, seeded and crushed
1/2 small onion, chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cinnamon

Directions:
Place tomatoes, onion, garlic, and olive oil in a slow cooker. Season with oregano, basil, cayenne pepper, salt, black pepper, and cinnamon.
Cover, and cook 10 to 15 hours on Low. The longer you simmer it the more flavorful it becomes. At 10 hours it's really good, but at 15 its even better.

Description: 
This tangy, zesty sauce instantly became a family favorite. I created it when my family came in from out of town; everyone raved about it and my husband begs me to make it all the time.
