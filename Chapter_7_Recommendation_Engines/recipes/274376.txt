Ingredients:
2 ripe mangoes, peeled and cut into small cubes
2 fresh peaches, peeled and cut into small cubes
4 Roma tomatoes, cut into small pieces
1/2 medium purple onion, minced
1/2 orange bell pepper, diced
1/4 red bell pepper, diced
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Combine mangoes, peaches, tomatoes, onion, bell peppers, jalapeno pepper, cilantro, lime juice, garlic, and salt in a bowl. If you like your salsa watery, leave the juice from the mangoes and peaches in the bowl. If you like your salsa a little more dry and chunky, drain the juice out.

Description: 
This wonderful salsa is tasty on grilled chicken or fish, or just served with tortilla chips. It's very refreshing and you won't be able to stop eating it. It tastes even better the second day.
