Ingredients:
2 sticks butter or margerine (room temperature)
2 cups sugar
5 cups flour
2 eggs
1 cup oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vanilla
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons cream of tartar

Directions:
Cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, oil, salt and vanilla.  Use mixer to mix well. In separate bowl, mix flour, baking soda and cream of tartar.  Mix all ingredients (wet & dry) together with mixer. Place batter in refrigerator for an hour or more to harden the dough so it isn't sticky. Remove from refrigerator and form into 1 inch balls. Roll into sugar and flatten on the cookie sheet. Bake at 350 for 10-12 minutes.
