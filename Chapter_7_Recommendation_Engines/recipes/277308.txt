Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package kielbasa sausage, cut into 2-inch pieces
3 cups chicken broth
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 (15 ounce) cans cannellini beans, undrained
6 cups chopped kale
1 cup diced fresh tomatoes
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook sausage in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until skin is crispy and a little browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and chop into bite-sized pieces when cool enough to handle. Reserve the pan drippings.
Meanwhile, combine chicken broth and garlic in a stockpot over medium heat; bring to a simmer.
Add chopped kielbasa, reserved pan drippings, undrained cannellini beans, chopped kale, diced tomatoes, olive oil, and oregano. Cook until beans begin to pop, 25 to 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This is a delicious simple stew--the kielbasa lends almost a buttery taste and texture. Inexpensive & very easy to prepare. Even my husband who hates soups asked for this one!
