Ingredients:
2 pounds chicken gizzards
½ cup all-purpose flour
¼ teaspoon paprika
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can water

Directions:
Clean and rinse gizzards, being sure to trim off any green material. Place cleaned gizzards in a large bowl. Mix flour, paprika, salt and pepper together in a small bowl; pour mixture onto gizzards and toss well to coat.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Brown coated gizzards in oil; drain and place in a microwave safe dish.
In a medium bowl mix together the soup and a soup can of water; pour mixture over gizzards, cover and cook in microwave on high for 15 minutes.
Stir, replace cover and cook for another 10 minutes. Check for tenderness; if still too firm,  cook in microwave for another 5 minutes. Let sit and set for 5 minutes after cooking, before serving.
