Ingredients:
1/2 cup brandy
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/3 cup frozen lemonade concentrate
1/3 cup orange juice
1 bottle dry red wine
1/2 cup triple sec
1 lemon; sliced into rounds
1 orange; sliced into rounds
1 lime; sliced into rounds
2 cups club soda

Directions:
Mix everything but club soda. Refrigerate overnight.
For any fruit you let sit in the sangria, cut off the rinds - if you let the sangria sit for long (which you should let it sit for at least 24 hours), the rinds will start to give your sangria a bitter taste.
Save some fruit to cut in a round and garnish each glass when you serve and add club soda just before serving.
