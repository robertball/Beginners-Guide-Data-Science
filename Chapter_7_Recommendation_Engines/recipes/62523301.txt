Ingredients:
3 large eggplants
1/2 lb bulk pork sausage (I like Jimmy Deans Hot pork sausage)
1/2 lb ground beef
2 cloves garlic
1/4 c. chopped green pepper
1/4 c. chopped onion
1/4 c. chopped fennel
1/2 c. chopped celery
Olive or grape seed oil for sauteing
dash each of cayenne pepper and Tobasco sauce
3-4 c. cooked rice
1/2 c. or so of fresh French bread crumbs
2-3 T. melted butter

Directions:
Spread washed and sliced in colander and sprinkle with salt each side.  Let stand for 2-3 hours to drain.  Wipe off excess salt (do not rinse in water).
Steam eggplant until tender then chop into approximate 3/4” cubes.  Saute in a small amount of olive oil to remove excess moisture, but do not cook dry.  For a stronger flavor, add minced garlic near the end of sauteing the eggplant.  As a French speaker, it pains me to see the word sauteing.  In French it would be, ‘apres faire saute l’aubergine,’ literally translated to ‘after making the eggplant jump.’
Saute the fennel until tender and add to the eggplant.  Brown the sausage and ground beef and add into the eggplant/fennel mixture.  This is a good point to test for seasoning.  I generally salt things as I go, but you may want to hold back a bit and see how much of the salt from the eggplant made it to this stage.
Next saute the green pepper, onion, and celery and add those into the eggplant mixture.  And finally, add in the cayenne pepper, Tobasco and cooked rice.  Put into a 2-qt casserole dish.  Spread with fresh bread crumbs and drizzle with melted butter.  Bake at  350 degrees F until warmed through, about 40 minutes
