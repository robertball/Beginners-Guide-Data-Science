Ingredients:
5 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pound lard
1 egg
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
5 tablespoons cold water

Directions:
Measure flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder into large bowl. Mix thoroughly and cut in lard until dough is the size of tiny peas.
Break egg into 8 ounce measuring cup. Beat with a fork, then pour in vinegar. Add enough cold water to reach the top (you will have a total of 1 cup liquid). Pour over flour mixture a little at a time, tossing and stirring with a fork until all liquid is absorbed.
Shape dough into a ball, then divide into four equal portions. Wrap tightly. Can be stored in refrigerator up to 2 weeks, or freezer up to 6 months. Each portion will make 1 double crust pie.
