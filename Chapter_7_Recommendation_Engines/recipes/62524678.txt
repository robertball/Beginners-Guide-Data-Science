Ingredients:
4 eggs
3 cups half and half or milk
1 1/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup canned pumpkin puree
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
8 - 10 cups challah or cinnamon swirl bread cubes
4 tablespoons brown sugar
whipped cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 9 x 13 glass baking dish.
Whisk together the eggs in a large bowl. Add the milk, sugar, pumpkin puree, vanilla extract, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves; whisk into a smooth batter. Add the bread cubes and toss gently to dampen.  Set aside for 15 minutes.
Pour the batter evenly into the prepared dish. Sprinkle brown sugar over the top. Arrange the dish in a roasting pan. Pour hot water into the roasting pan to halfway up the sides of the baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until pudding is golden brown and puffy, about 40 minutes; transfer to cooling rack for 10 minutes.  Top with whipped cream.
