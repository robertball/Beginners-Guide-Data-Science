Ingredients:
1 lb dry white beans
3 garlic cloves
4 medium carrots
2 medium potatoes
6 ounces tomato paste

1 Tbsp oregano
3 Tbsp olive oil
2 tsp salt

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, soak the beans over night.
Heat the oil, in a dutch oven, or any heavy pot,  over medium heat. Add chopped carrots, potatoes and garlic and saute for about 1 minute. Don't let the garlic burn. Add the tomato paste, oregano and salt.
Add the white beans and immediately after add about 6-8 cups of water (depending on how thick you want the soup). Cook on medium to low heat for about 30-45 minutes. Add the frozen broccoli previously thawed about 2 minutes before turning the heat off.
TIP: You can use canned white beans however cooking times will vary. The soup will be done is a mere 10-15 minutes.

I usually  double this recipe for the family so there are leftovers for the kids to take home. I use my immersion blender to make a blended soup. I left half of the soup un-blended for a nice consistency.broccoli..
