Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package al frescoÂ® Tomato & Basil Chicken Meatballs
Olive oil cooking spray
1 small zucchini, sliced
1 cup onion, sliced
1 cup fresh crimini mushrooms
4 ounces tandoori naan
1/2 cup light alfredo sauce
1/4 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained
1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped
3 ounces light mozzarella cheese, shredded
2 tablespoons Asiago cheese, shredded

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Prepare a baking sheet pan with the cooking spray. Mix zucchini, onions and mushrooms with the reserved oil from the sun-dried tomatoes and spread on the baking sheet. Roast in the oven for 10 minutes. Stir half way, and nicely brown. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
To assemble the NAAN pizza, spread half of each: Alfredo sauce, followed by the roasted vegetables, basil & place the meatballs flat face down, then top sun-dried tomatoes.
Sprinkle with mozzarella and asiago, bake 10 minutes until the cheeses are nicely browned.
Let sit for 5 minutes, slice and serve.
