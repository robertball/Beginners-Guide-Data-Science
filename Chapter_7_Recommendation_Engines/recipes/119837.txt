Description: 
As a new bride, I knew how to make scrambled eggs and bran muffins. Unfortunately, you can only live on love for so long. My dear husband held his tongue and ate the many flops that come with being a beginning cook. Many years later, I'm secure in the kitchen, and my family enjoys my cooking. This hearty dish even passes the test for teenage boys.--Glenda Schwartz, Morden, Manitoba
