Ingredients:
1 (1 1/2-pound) boneless beef sirloin steak
1 medium onion, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 medium green bell pepper, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 (14.5 ounce) can reduced-sodium beef broth
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon dill weed
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 dash crushed red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
In a large nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, brown beef on both sides. Place onion and green pepper in a 3-qt. slow cooker. Top with beef. Combine the broth, Worcestershire sauce, dill, thyme, pepper and pepper flakes; pour over beef. Cover and cook on high for 3-4 hours or until meat reaches desired doneness and vegetables are crisp-tender.
Remove beef and keep warm. Combine cornstarch and water until smooth; gradually stir into cooking juices. Cover and cook about 30 minutes longer or until slightly thickened. Return beef to the slow cooker; heat through.

My family of five likes to eat beef so this recipe is a favorite. I usually serve it with homemade bread or rolls to soak up the tasty gravy. -Vicki Tormaschy of Dickinson, North Dakota
