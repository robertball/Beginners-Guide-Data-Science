Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package tri-color rotini pasta
4 Roma (plum) tomatoes, quartered

1 (2.5 ounce) package bacon bits
1/2 (6 ounce) package dried cranberries, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse pasta with cold water until cool; drain.
Combine cooled pasta, tomatoes, cucumber, green bell pepper, red onion, and black olives in a large bowl.
Pour Italian-style salad dressing over the pasta mixture; toss to coat.
Sprinkle bacon bits and cranberries over the salad to serve.

Description: 
I wanted to try something different from the average pasta salads I've had. So I decided to experiment and thankfully everyone loved it! Feel free use more or less of any of the ingredients according to your palate.
