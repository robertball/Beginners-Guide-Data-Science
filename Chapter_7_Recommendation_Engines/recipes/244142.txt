Description: 
I first experienced this fondue at a popular chain restaurant. I've been trying to make it at home ever since. This is the closest I've come and it's always a big hit! Enjoy for a romantic dinner for 2 at home or prepare a larger quantity for a dinner party. Either way, we rarely have leftovers! Dip chicken, steak, veggies, etc.
