Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons whole milk
1 eggs
2 tablespoons unsealed butter, melted

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together buttermilk, vanilla extract, milk, eggs and melted butter. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat.
Combine the wet mixture into the dry mixture. Stir until it's just blended together leaving some small lumps in the mixture.
Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
