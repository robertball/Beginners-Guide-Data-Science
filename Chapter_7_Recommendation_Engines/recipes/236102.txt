Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 pounds cubed beef stew meat
1 onion, chopped
3 cups merlot wine
1 tablespoon beef bouillon granules
1 quart milk
4 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
6 carrots, diced
6 stalks celery, diced
3 tablespoons dried oregano
3 tablespoons dried basil
2 tablespoons ground coriander
2 tablespoons ground black pepper
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon salt

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over high heat; saute beef until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Add onion. Continue to saute until onion is softened and browned around the edges, about 5 minutes more. Transfer beef mixture to a bowl.
Pour wine into the same pot used to cook beef and bring wine to a boil. Boil until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes. Stir beef bouillon into wine and cook until dissolved, about 5 minutes. Return beef to the pot and add milk, potatoes, carrots, and celery. Season with oregano, basil, coriander, pepper, cumin, and salt and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium and continue to simmer until beef is tender, about 1 hour.
