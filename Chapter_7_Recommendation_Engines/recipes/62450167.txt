Ingredients:
2 cups cornmeal
1 Tbsp. flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 tsp. salt
3 cups water
1/4 cup butter
1 1/2 cups milk
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.
In a large bowl, stir together cornmeal, flour, sugar and salt. Set aside.
Boil together water and butter, and pour over cornmeal mixture. Stir until blended and cool to lukewarm. Add milk and eggs and mix well. Pour into the greased pan and bake for 45 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand 45 minutes before serving. Cut into squares and serve with butter.
The leftover pone is also great cut into slabs and pan-fried in butter.

Description: 
Here's one of the things my dad used to make (it was a short list, and it also included a simple and amazing Oyster Stew and the best chocolate fudge in the world). I love this stuff ... it's like a dense, very moist cornbread, and unique. I haven't seen a similar recipe for it. Enjoy!
