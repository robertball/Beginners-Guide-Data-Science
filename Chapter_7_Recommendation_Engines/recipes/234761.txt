Ingredients:
1 coffee filter
1 1/2 cups vanilla yogurt
1 cup half-and-half
1 (.13 ounce) envelope orange-flavored fruit drink mix (such as KOOL-AID®)
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk, chilled

Directions:
Line a mesh sieve with a coffee filter. Pour yogurt into sieve and allow yogurt to drain over a measuring cup in the refrigerator until about 1/2 cup whey is collected, about 8 hours.
Whisk half-and-half and drink mix in a large bowl. Add yogurt and sweetened condensed milk, stirring until smooth.
Pour into the container of an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Description: 
The flavor is like a Creamsicle®. The texture is creamier than sherbet, richer than frozen yogurt, yet lighter than an ice cream. Not quite sure what to call it, but it's delish!
