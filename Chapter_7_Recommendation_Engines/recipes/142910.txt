Ingredients:
4 extra-large eggs
1 1/4 cups matzo meal
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon chicken stock
1 tablespoon vodka
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 cup club soda
2 quarts chicken stock

Directions:
Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl until thick and light colored. Combine the matzo meal, vegetable oil, 1 tablespoon chicken stock, vodka, salt, pepper, basil, garlic powder, and club soda in a large bowl, and stir until well blended. Cover, and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.
Pour the 2 quarts chicken stock into a large pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Meanwhile, form small, 1 to 2 inch diameter balls using the chilled matzo mixture. Place the balls in the chicken stock, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until matzo balls are cooked through, 45 to 60 minutes.
