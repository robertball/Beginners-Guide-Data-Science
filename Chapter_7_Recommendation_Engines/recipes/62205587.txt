20 oz. ground chicken
1 medium onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2/3 c. marinated artichoke hearts, finely chopped
1 10-oz. package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and sqeezed dry
8 oz. cream cheese, softened
8 oz. Italian blend or other suitable shredded cheese, divided

Directions:
Cook and drain the manicotti noodles while proceeding with additional steps.
Cook the chicken and onion in a medium frying pan until the chicken is cooked through and in small pieces. Add garlic and cook one minute. Add artichoke hearts, spinach, cream cheese and 6 oz. of the Italian blend cheese; mix well and set aside.
Blend cottage cheese, milk, cornstarch, salt, pepper and nutmeg in food processor to make a smooth sauce. Pour sauce into a sauce pan, add Parmesan cheese and heat over medium heat until cheese has melted and sauce has thickened.

Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until heated through.
