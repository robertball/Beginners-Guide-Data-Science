Wilted Lettuce Salad Recipe

Ingredients:
12 oz Bacon (thick-sliced is easier to work with I think)
1 /2 c red wine vinegar
about 1 Tablespoon white sugar
generous amount of black pepper-coarse grind or freshly ground is best
hint of garlic powder (because everything is better w/ a little garlic :-)
about  1/2 Tablespoon dill weed
1 bunch green onions
1 head Romaine lettuce
same amount of spinach leaves
1/4 head Iceberg lettuce ("regular head lettuce")

Directions:
Dice up bacon -trimming & removing some of the fat, and cook in deep, heavy pot (stock pot is best) over medium heat until crisp, stirring occasionally. (figure about 15-20 minutes-do not cook on high heat.)
Meanwhile wash & dry the greens. Wash green onions, remove just the slightest bit of both ends & slice very small:use both green & white portions.
Remove cooked bacon with slotted spoon and set aside. Add onions to pan, stir up the brown bits, remove from heat and let sit for about 5 minutes (to soften the onmions & flavor the grease.)
Just before serving add vinegar, sugar, pepper, garlic & dill to pot with bacon grease-stir while warming over low heat if necessary. Dip on piece of lettuce in pot and taste-adjust for flavor preference (more pepper, vinegar, etc?)
Add the greens to the pot & toss until they "wilt". Add bacon bits & toss again.
