Ingredients:
1/4 cup creme fraiche
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon vanilla sugar
2 large ripe peaches, diced

Directions:
Stir creme fraiche, honey, and vanilla sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Be sure to scrape the spoon often, as the honey tends to stick to it and harden.
Divide diced peaches into 2 dessert bowls. Drizzle creme fraiche mixture over peaches and serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a fancy, elegant little dessert that is deceivingly quick-and-easy to put together. Garnish with a sprig of mint for extra prettiness. A little sprinkle of cinnamon is a nice twist.
