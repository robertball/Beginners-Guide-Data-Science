Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 bratwurst
2 apple, cored and sliced
1 sweet onion, sliced
2 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles beer
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook bratwurst in hot oil until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove bratwurst to a plate, reserving drippings in the skillet.
Stir apple and onion slices into the reserved drippings; cook and stir until the onion softens, about 6 minutes. Return bratwurst to the skillet, nestling them into the onion mixture. Pour beer over the sausages; season with salt and pepper.
Bring the beer to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the the bratwurst is no longer pink in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
A very hearty meal that's good in the autumn or winter. Lots of flavor and very much a comforting meal after a long day in the cold. It pairs well with coleslaw.
