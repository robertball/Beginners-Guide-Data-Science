Ingredients:
1 dash all-purpose flour
1 (15.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix (such as Duncan HinesÂ®)
1 cup water
3 eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
Cream:
3/4 cup white sugar
2/3 cup shortening
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
1/2 cup butter
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1 (16 ounce) can dark chocolate frosting

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 15x10-inch jelly roll pan.
Combine cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on low speed until moistened. Increase speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 24 to 29 minutes. Let cool completely, at least 45 minutes.
Combine sugar, shortening, evaporated milk, butter, vanilla extract, and salt in a bowl. Beat with a hand mixer until light and fluffy, 10 to 15 minutes. Pipe cream frosting in lines over the cooled cake.
Place chocolate frosting in a microwave-safe bowl. Warm in the microwave for 1 minute, checking after 30 seconds. Drizzle melted frosting over the cream with a spoon. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.
