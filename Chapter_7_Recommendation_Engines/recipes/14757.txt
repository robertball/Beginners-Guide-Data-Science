Ingredients:
4 pig's feet
2 tablespoons salt
2 cups white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon whole cloves
2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns
4 whole star anise pods
2 tablespoons pickling spice

Directions:
Rinse feet well, pat dry with paper towels and place in a large saucepan. Add enough water to cover and stir in 1 tablespoon of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low and simmer for about 4 to 5 hours or until the meat falls off of the bones.
Remove meat from bones and place in a shallow dish or bowl. Set aside. Drain saucepan, reserving 2 cups of cooking liquid. In the same saucepan combine the reserved cooking liquid, remaining salt, vinegar, cloves, peppercorns, star anise and pickling spices. Bring to a boil and boil for 35 minutes.
Strain liquid and reserve. Pour reserved liquid over the top of the meat. Cover and refrigerate. Chill for at least 10 hours before serving.
