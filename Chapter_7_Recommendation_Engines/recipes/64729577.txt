Ingredients:
12 large egg yolks
1 cup sugar
2 cups heavy whipping cream
4 cups whole milk
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Cinnamon and whipped cream (garnish)

Directions:
Separate egg yolks from whites (only yolks will be used).
Cream egg yolks with sugar on medium-high speed in electric mixer until light and fluffy.  Set aside.
Combine milk, cream and nutmeg in a large pot and heat to a bare simmer (1-2 bubbles surface every 2-3 seconds).  Remove from heat.
Temper the hot milk/cream slowly into the egg/sugar mixture, whisking constantly.
Once all milk/cream has been added to the egg mixture, return the mixture to the pan.
Continue to heat over medium, whisking constantly, until liquid reaches 160Â°F.
Pour mixture into a large pitcher, cover and refrigerate overnight (at least 6 hours).
