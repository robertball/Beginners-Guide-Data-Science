Ingredients:
1 1/2 lb eggplant
1 large sweet frying pepper
1 small zucchini
1 small yellow summer squash
water
3 cloves garlic
1/2 onion
1 pt grape tomatoes
20 leaves basil (or dried basil to taste, liberally)
olive oil
1 lb penne
To taste:
parsley
salt
pepper
red wine vinegar

Directions:
Peel the eggplant and cut it into 1/2"-1" chunks.  Chop the zucchini and squash in the same way, leaving the skins on.
Slice the onion and pepper into 2"-long strips.  Mince the basil and garlic.
Combine the eggplant, zucchini, squash, and onion in a frying pan.  Add 1 c water and mix until the water is absorbed by the eggplant.  Add enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan and the veggies.  Stir.
Place on medium heat.  Saute until the veggies begin to cook, then add the pepper, basil, garlic, and seasonings.  Saute until everything is thoroughly cooked and tender.
Boil a pot of water and add the pasta.  Remove when thoroughly cooked, then drain.
Meanwhile, prick each tomato.  Place on a grill topper on the grill.  Cook on medium-low heat for five minutes with the lid down, then flip each tomato and cook for an additional 5 minutes.
Remove the tomatoes from the grill.  When the other veggie mix is cooked, add the tomatoes and remove the mixture from the heat.
Stir everything together.  Add olive oil.  Stir again.
