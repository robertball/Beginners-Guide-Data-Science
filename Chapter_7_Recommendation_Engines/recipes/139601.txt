Ingredients:
1 pound trimmed skirt steak
1 (12 ounce) bottle beer
1/3 cup freshly squeezed key-lime juice
1 onion, cut into rings
1 large green bell pepper, cut into rings
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon lemon pepper seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon garlic salt

Directions:
Stir together the beer, lime juice, onion, and bell pepper in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Pound the skirt steaks to 1/4 inch thick, and mix into the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the skirt steak from the marinade. Discard the remaining marinade. Mix the onion powder, lemon pepper, garlic powder, and garlic salt together in a small bowl. Sprinkle the steaks with the spice mix on all sides.
Cook the steaks until they are firm, hot in the center, and well done, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 155 degrees F (65 degrees C).

Description: 
This is a favorite dish of mine that I picked up from my grandmother in Mexico. It is very tasty if done right. Serve with either corn or flour tortillas.
