Ingredients:
2 tablespoons     vegetable oil
1/2 cup    chopped onion
3/4 cup    long-grain brown rice
3/4 teaspoon    cumin
3/4 teaspoon     garlic salt
1 1/2 cups     chicken broth
1/2 cup      canned diced tomatoes(.Rotel)
1 (16 ounce)     can  fat-free refried beans
3/4    teaspoon garlic salt
1/2    teaspoon ground black pepper
12 ounces   frozen cooked shrimp without tails, thawed
2 teaspoons   minced garlic
1/2 cup    fat free yogurt
1/2 cup  reduced fat   mayonnaise
2  teaspoons    pureed chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
6    (10 inch) flour tortillas, warmed
3 cups    (Sargento)reduced fat Mex. blend  cheese
1/3 cup salsa

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook until tender, stirring frequently. Stir in rice, and season with cumin and 3/4 teaspoon of garlic salt. Cook and stir until the rice is lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth and the diced tomatoes. Bring to a boil, then cover and cook over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until all of the liquid has been absorbed.
In a small saucepan, stir together the refried beans, 3/4 teaspoon of garlic salt, and black pepper. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until heated through.
Place shrimp in a bowl, and stir in garlic until shrimp is coated. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with cooking spray.  Saute shrimp until heated through and lightly browned.
In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, mayonnaise, and chipotle peppers until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Place about 1/4 cup of cheese onto each warm tortilla. Then place about 1/2 cup of shrimp on the cheese. Top with 1/4 cup of beans, and 1/4 cup of rice. Spread on about a tablespoon of the chipotle sauce, and salsa to taste. Roll up, and serve.

Description: 
I worked at a Mexican restaurant that specializes in Baja dishes, and became addicted to this burrito... I moved away, so I had to create my own. The Chipotle Sauce is what makes it oh so yummy!Modified from: Shrimp Burritos
