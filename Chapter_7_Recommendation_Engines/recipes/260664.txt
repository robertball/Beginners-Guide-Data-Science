Description: 
Threw this together one night to use up some leftovers and knew after the first taste that I'd make it again repeatedly! I love that it's really easy to adjust ingredients to taste and use what's available in the pantry/fridge currently. I've also added sweet potatoes and cabbage and increased the vegetable broth for a more stew-like meal or to change up the leftovers. I would have also added peppers if I'd had them!
