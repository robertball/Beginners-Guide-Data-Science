Ingredients:
3 pounds red potatoes, cut into chunks
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon white vinegar
4 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
1 dill pickle, chopped
1/3 celery stalk, chopped
2 green onions, chopped
1 dash hot sauce
1 tsp. dried dill weed
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 dash onion salt
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the potatoes in a pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 10 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork. Drain, and transfer to a large bowl to cool.
In a medium bowl, mix the sour cream, mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, eggs, pickle, celery, green onions, and hot sauce. Season with dill, garlic powder, onion salt, salt, and pepper. Pour over the potatoes, and gently toss to coat. Chill at least 3 hours in the refrigerator before serving.

Description: 
This pretty potato salad has great flavor. Goes well with a summer barbeque, or anytime!  For a tangy twist, try using plain fat-free yogurt in place of some or all of the sour cream.  Garnish with additional sliced hard-boiled eggs, if desired.Modified from: Red Potato Salad
