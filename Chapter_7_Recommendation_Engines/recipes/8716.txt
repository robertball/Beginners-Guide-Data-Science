Ingredients:
8 chicken thighs
1/4 pound cooked ham, cut into one inch cubes
1 (16 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 green bell pepper, chopped
6 green onions, chopped
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 teaspoon salt
2 dashes hot pepper sauce
2 cups water
1 cup uncooked long grain white rice
1/2 pound Polish sausage, sliced diagonally

Directions:
In a slow cooker, place the chicken, ham, tomatoes, bell pepper, green onions, tomato paste, salt, and hot pepper sauce. Cover, and cook on Low for 4 to 5 hours.
Combine water and rice in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
Mix the cooked rice and sausage into the slow cooker. Cover, and cook on High for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the sausage is heated through.

Description: 
This is a family favorite and easy to prepare in the slow cooker. The chicken has a bite to it but one can control the heat by limiting the amount of hot pepper sauce used. Even if you don't like very hot food, include a few drops for flavor. (For the ham, I get the deli to slice about a one inch section of Virginia Ham).
