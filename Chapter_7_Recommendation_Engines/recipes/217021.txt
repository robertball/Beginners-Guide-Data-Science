Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
½  onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans with liquid
2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, drained
1 cup shredded carrots
¾ pound cooked, shredded chicken
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
4 cups chopped escarole
½ cup shredded Pecorino-Romano cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir onion and garlic until the garlic turns golden brown and smells toasty, about 6 minutes. Do not let garlic burn. Pour in the cannellini beans, diced tomatoes, and carrots, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, uncover the pot, and allow the mixture to simmer until slightly thickened, 5 to 8 more minutes.
Stir in the chicken and spinach, bring the mixture back to a boil, and mix in the escarole. Simmer until almost all the liquid is gone, about 10 minutes; turn off the heat, sprinkle with cheese, and cover; allow to stand for another 5 to 10 minutes to melt cheese.

Description: 
Super easy and quick, well balanced dish. You can do a lot with it, or keep it as is and you won't regret it. So good on a cold night. If you want a creamier sauce, omit the diced tomatoes. Use any and all vegetables you want! You can use this as a sauce to put over pasta or over rice to get a complete protein with the beans (then you can omit the meat if you want a vegetarian dish).
