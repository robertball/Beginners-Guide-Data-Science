Description: 
This recipe is one that my cousin made up using her mother's basic recipe when we were teenagers. It tastes like pecan pie with ice cream. It became one of the family's favorites. Nowadays we use our stand mixer's nice attachment, the ice cream bowl - or on-the-counter ice cream makers - and it still comes out great. I mix this up of a morning or the night before I plan to make it. One reason for this was the longer it sets, the better the flavors blend into cream mixture, making a much better flavored ice cream and a faster freeze time.
