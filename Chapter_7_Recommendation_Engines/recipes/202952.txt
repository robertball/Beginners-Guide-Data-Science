Ingredients:
2 cups mashed potatoes
3/4 cup frozen green peas, thawed
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon wasabi paste, or to taste
salt and pepper to taste
1 large egg
2 cups all-purpose flour, divided

Directions:
Process the potatoes, peas, garlic, ginger, wasabi, salt, and pepper in a food processor until the mixture is evenly green. Add the egg and process again until the egg is just incorporated. Add 1 cup of the flour and process until just mixed; transfer to a bowl. Being careful to not over mix, gently work the remaining cup of flour into the mixture until it forms a sticky dough. Cover with plastic wrap and store in refrigerator until chilled to help make it easier to roll.
Working on a well-floured surface with about 1/2 cup of the mixture at a time, roll into a rope about 1/2 inch in diameter. Cut the rope into 1-inch segments using a floured knife. Continue until all the dough has been used.
Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi, making sure to not overcrowd in the pot; return to a boil. Cook until the gnocchi floats to the top, about 3 minutes; drain.
