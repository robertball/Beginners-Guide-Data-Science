Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, cut into thick slices
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 teaspoons seasoned salt (such as LAWRY'SÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Sprinkle cauliflower slices on both sides with olive oil, brown sugar, and seasoned salt.
Cook cauliflower on the grill until char marks appear, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a grill-safe pan with a lid, cover, and continue cooking on grill until tender, about 20 minutes.
