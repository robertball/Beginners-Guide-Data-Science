Description: 
I lifted this recipe almost verbatim from SHED, my current 'favorite place to eat.' If you're ever near Healdsburg, CA, definitely stop by. This intensely tasty tartine with aioli and veggies gets even better with the boquerones (white anchovies) which are so different from regular anchovies.
