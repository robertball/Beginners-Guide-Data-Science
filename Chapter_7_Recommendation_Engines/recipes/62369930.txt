Less Sweet - Amish Whole Wheat Bread Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 cup vegetable oil
3 cups all purpose flour
3 cups whole wheat flour

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water, and then stir in yeast. Allow to proof (it will look like there are mini fireworks going off in the bowl) until yeast resembles a creamy foam.
Mix salt and oil into the yeast. Mix in flour one cup at a time. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth. Place in a well oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down. Knead for a few minutes, and divide in half. Shape into loaves, and place into two well oiled 9x5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise for 30 minutes, or until dough has risen 1 inch above pans.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes.
