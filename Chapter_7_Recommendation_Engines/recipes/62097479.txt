Ingredients:
1 bird, cleaned with skin on
1 T poultry seasoning (more or less depending on your tastes.)
1/2 t rosemary
Salt and Pepper
1/2 cup wild rice
10-15 mushrooms any type
1/2 stick butter

Directions:
Cook the wild rice according to directions.
While rice is cooking dust the bird inside and out with the poultry seasoning and rosemary. Add more if you want a stronger flavor.
Salt and pepper the bird to taste.
Slice the mushrooms and saute them with 2 T butter in a small pan. Cook them until they are not quite cooked but still partially firm, since they will cook more inside the bird. Set aside until rice is done.
When the rice is done add the mushrooms to the rice and then stuff the bird.
Place the bird in a baking dish.
Tie the back legs of the bird together so the stuffing doesn't come out during cooking.
Cut the remaining 2 T of butter into pieces and place in differnt spots on the bird.
Bake the bird at 425 for 45mins check the birds temperature with a meat thermometer. Cook until bird reaches the optimal poultry temperature. Times will vary depending on the size of bird.

Description: 
This recipe isn't too difficult but it looks like an expensive restaurant meal! It is the perfect way to fix up that Pheasant, Duck or even just a cornish game hen from your local grocery store. This recipe is made with a cornish game hen in mind so if you are using a larger bird you may want to adjust the amount of the indgreients.
