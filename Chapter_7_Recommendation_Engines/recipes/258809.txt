Description: 
I am just loving my spiralizer attachment from KitchenAid(<sup>&reg;</sup>), and it's been super busy in my kitchen! If you don't have the attachment, there are other ways to spiralize, including using a vegetable peeler.
 
This recipe was inspired by leftovers. Before serving, top this dish with your favorite chopped fresh herbs! I love roasting 2 chickens at once and serving them for dinner one night, then cutting the rest up and using for several different meals. I freeze what I won't use in the next 2 days. I also keep a little packed away for Jake! Love my doggie...
