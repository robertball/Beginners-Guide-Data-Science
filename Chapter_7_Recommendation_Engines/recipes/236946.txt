Ingredients:
2 (3.5 ounce) links Italian sausage, sliced
2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1 large tomato, coarsely chopped
1/2 cup red wine
1 head garlic, minced
1/3 cup minced onion
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
1 tablespoon fresh oregano
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon brown sugar

Directions:
Heat a stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot stockpot until browned, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Blend tomato sauce, tomato, red wine, garlic, onion, Parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegar, basil, olive oil, thyme, oregano, black pepper, red pepper flakes, salt, and brown sugar together in a blender until desired consistency is reached. Pour mixture over sausage; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until wine has cooked off, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
Making marinara sauce is literally one of my favorite things in the world to do. There is almost no way to go wrong other than adding too much salt or too much sugar. Just blend, simmer, and let the ingredients speak for themselves. For a spicier sauce add more chili flake.
