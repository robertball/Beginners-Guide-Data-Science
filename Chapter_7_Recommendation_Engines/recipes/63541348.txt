Ingredients:
1 quart water
4 carrots, sliced
2 small potatoes, peeled and diced
1 medium onion, diced
1 1/2 cups salsa, medium or hot
2 beef bouillon cubes
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1/3 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs (use less if adding rice)
1/3 cup Minute Rice (optional)
1/3 cup milk
chopped fresh cilantro (optional)

Directions:
In a large stock pot, bring water, carrots, potatoes, onion, salsa, and bouillon cubes to a boil. Reduce to a medium simmer, stirring occasionally, approximately 10 minutes.
Mix the beef, breadcrumbs, rice, and milk together in a bowl. Form into 1-inch meatballs, and drop into boiling broth. Once soup returns to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low.
Cover and cook 20 minutes, or until meatballs are no longer pink in center and vegetables are tender. Serve with sprinkled cilantro for garnish.
