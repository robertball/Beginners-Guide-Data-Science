Ingredients:
Winter squash seeds
olive oil or melted butter
salt to taste

Directions:
Remove seeds from squash. Rinse well in water, removing any strings and bits of squash that may remain. Pat dry with a towel or leave out on the counter for awhile to dry a bit.
Preheat oven to 325 deg F.
In a bowl, toss with a little olive oil or butter and salt.
Spread seeds on a foil lined baking sheet and cook for 15 to 25 minutes (timing will depend on how big/wet your seeds are) or until seeds start to pop. Remove from oven, cool and enjoy!
