Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2/3 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup cider vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 (4 ounce) can whole green chilies, drained and sliced lengthwise
4 slices Pepper Jack or Monterey Jack cheese
4 kaiser or sandwich rolls, split

Directions:
Pound chicken to flatten; place in a large resealable plastic bag. In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and oil; mix well. Set aside 1/4 cup for basting. Pour the remaining marinade over chicken;
seal bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Drain and discard marinade. Grill chicken, uncovered, over medium heat for 3 minutes. Turn and baste with reserved marinade; grill 3 minutes longer or until juices run clear. Top each with a green chili and cheese slice; cover and grill for 2 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve on rolls.
