Ingredients:
3/4 cup cold water
3 egg yolks
3 egg whites
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups sifted cake flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat cold water and egg yolks together until mixture makes 1 quart--at least 10 minutes. Slowly add sugar and vanilla to egg yolk mixture, beating for at least 7 minutes more.
Sift the cake flour, baking powder, and salt together. Fold into the egg yolk mixture.
Beat egg whites until medium-stiff peaks form. Fold one third of the egg white mixture into the batter to lighten; fold in remaining egg whites. Pour batter into an ungreased tube pan.
Bake in preheated oven until cake springs back when lightly touched with a fingertip, about 50 minutes. Turn upside down to cool in pan for 1 hour. Loosen sides and coax from pan.

Description: 
This is a lovely sponge cake that is reminiscent of the Deep South. May be cut into layers and filled and iced with lemon filling, or with whipped cream.
