Tikin Xic Recipe

Ingredients:
2 lbs snapper fillets (you can substitute cod, haddock or other firm white fish)
1/2 tsp salt
13.5 oz (100 gm) package achiote paste (not available in all parts of the country but easy to find on the internet)
1 tsp dried oregano
5 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
6 peppercorns, ground
4 Tbsp Seville orange juice (or substitute 2 Tbsp regular orange juice and 2 Tbsp cider vinegar or, I've also used plain lime juice with success)
3 Tbsp water
olive oil

Directions:
1. Combine all ingredients except the fish and olive oil in a blender. Blend it into a smooth paste.
2. Smear the paste all over the fleshy side of the fillets and marinate all night in the fridge.
3. When you're ready to cook the next day, coat both sides of fillets with olive oil.
4. Grill for 7-10 minutes per side, depending on thickness. Fish will flake easily when cooked.
We use one of those big fish shaped grill holders & it worked great.
I serve it with nacho chips & salsa and guacamole and also some coleslaw with thin slivers of jalapenos, plus cumin and lime juice mixed in.

Description: 
This was an incredible, marinated fish dish was cooked for us over an open fire and served with guacamole, salsa, fresh nacho chips, rice and cervezas all on the small Isla Contoy, a guarded Island with a bird reserve. It took me many months & many wrong tries before I hit it just right.
