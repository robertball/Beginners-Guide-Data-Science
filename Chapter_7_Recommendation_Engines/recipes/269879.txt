Ingredients:
1 (4 ounce) log goat cheese, softened
24 large, ridged potato chips (such as RufflesÂ®)
1/2 cup hot red pepper jelly
4 slices bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
1 jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced (optional)

Directions:
Spread about 1/2 tablespoon of goat cheese onto each potato chip, being careful not to break the chips. Add about 1 teaspoon of red pepper jelly to each chip and top with crumbled bacon and a jalapeno slice. Serve immediately, so the chips don't get soggy.
