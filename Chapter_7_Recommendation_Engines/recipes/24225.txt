Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) fillet beef tenderloin filet
garlic powder to taste
onion powder to taste
coarsely ground black pepper to taste
2 teaspoons caraway seed
kosher salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
Place tenderloin filet on a flat dish and sprinkle both sides with garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper to taste. Sprinkle on the caraway seeds on both sides as well. Next, sprinkle on the kosher salt. Press all of the seasonings into the meat, so that it all sticks well. Rub the filet all over the plate to pick up any loose seasoning.
Grill the filet on both sides, about 2 minutes each side, to sear in the flavors and bring out the nutty flavor of the caraway seeds. After searing, lower the temperature of your grill to medium heat and cook for about 6 minutes each side, depending on the thickness of your filet.
As your filet is cooking at the lower temperature, sprinkle on more kosher salt and caraway seed to taste. Cook to desired doneness.
