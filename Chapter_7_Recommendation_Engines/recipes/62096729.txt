Ingredients:
1 cup self-raising flour
2/3 cup boiling hot water [Variation: 1/3 cup brandy, 1/3 cup boiling hot water]
1 1/2 cups dried mixed fruits

Directions:
Combine the water and the dried fruits in a large bowl and set aside for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C/350 degrees F.
Beat the egg and pour into the fruits. Mix evenly.
Sift the flour into the bowl and mix thoroughly, until a sticky batter forms.
Pour into a lightly greased 1 lb loaf tin. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes before removing and cooling on a wire rack.

Description: 
Sugarless and butterless fruit loaf! You can add sugar if you want, but I suggest you don't go for more that 1/3 cup; this is pretty sweet by itself.
