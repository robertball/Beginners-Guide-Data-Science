Description: 
Mulled cranberry cider, like mulled wine, is a cold-weather tradition in my home.  This warm, comforting drink is easy to prepare and is a great finale for a holiday meal.  This recipe is for 2 quarts, which will serve up to 6 to 8 people; the amounts can be multiplied without any problems.
