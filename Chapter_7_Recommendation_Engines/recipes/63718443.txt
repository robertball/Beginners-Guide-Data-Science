Ingredients:
3 cups fresh blueberries
1 (9 inch) deep dish pie crust or Graham Cracker Crust
For the Custard:
3/4 cup white sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, beaten
2/3 cup sour cream
1 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp cinnamon
For the Streusel:
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the blueberries in the pie crust and set aside.
Combine 3/4 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, and salt. Add eggs, 1 tsp vanilla 1/4 tsp cinnamon and sour cream, stirring until blended, creating a custard. Pour the custard over the blueberries.
In another bowl, combine 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup flour. Cut in the butter with pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle the topping over the filled pie shell.
Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on wire rack.
