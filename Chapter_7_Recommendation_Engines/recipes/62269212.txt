Place chicken pieces in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Brush chicken with the sauce. Turn pieces over, and brush again.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn pieces over, and bake for another 15 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run clear. Brush with sauce every 10 minutes during cooking.
