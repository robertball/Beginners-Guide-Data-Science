Description: 
My dad would stop at our local store's deli each holiday just to purchase the dried beef cheeseball he loved.  One year after tasting a similar style, I decided to mix the two together and came up with this dip/cheeseball.  It is in honor of my dad who had to have his cheeseball every year!  This version is now a staple at all our family gatherings!
