Ingredients:
Whatever you like inside your calzone!

Directions:
Roll pizza dough into a rectangle the length of your baking sheet. It can be wider than the sheet because you will be folding the sides in. Place the dough on the baking sheet and let the sides hang off.
Sauce the center of the dough. Add toppings and cheese.
Cut the dough on the sides at about 3/4 inch intervals. Don't cut all the way to the filling.
Then "wrap the baby." Start at the bottom and alternate sides. Overlap the strips of dough onto the filling in a criss-cross pattern.
Bake your calzone at 375° F (190° C) for about 25-30 minutes.
