Description: 
Kugels are a mainstay of Jewish holiday meals. Defined as a baked pudding or casserole (usually from noodles or potatoes) this one is my own version of Kugel, which is adapted from a few recipes to make one that we really love.  I was taught by my elderly grandmother to always use Farmer's Cheese in kugel.  It's found in our regular grocery store in the dairy dept.  This is a rich and sweet kugel although they also come in a savory version.
