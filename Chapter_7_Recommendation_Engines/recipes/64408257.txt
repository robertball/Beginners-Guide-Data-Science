Ingredients:
1-1 1/2 pounds medium shrimp
2 tbsp minced garlic
1/4 cup diced onion
1/3 cup chopped celery
3 tbsp taco seasoning
1 1/2 tbsp parsley
1 10 oz can red enchilada sauce (mild)
1/2 tbsp cinnamon
1/4 cup mild chunky salsa
1/4 cup skim milk
1 cup 4 cheese Mexican blend
1/4 cup reduced fat mozzerella

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F
Place shrimp in a skillet on medium-high heat. Add garlic, onions, and celery saut√©ing for 7-10 minutes. (If the skillet begins to fill with liquid from the shrimp, carefully pour it out into the sink and resume cooking.)
Add taco seasoning and parsley, stirring thoroughly to combine.
Add enchilada sauce, salsa, and cinnamon stirring well.
Remove the skillet from the heat and add milk stirring it in slowly.
Place the entire mixture into an oven safe pie or square casserole dish. Cover with the cheeses and bake for 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
Serve hot on taco shells, small tortillas, or nacho chips with beans, sour cream, or shredded lettuce and spinach.
