Ingredients:
For 5 pounds of meat
2 cups soy sauce
1/2 cup worstershire sauce
1/2 cup Teriyaki sauce
1 cup brown sugar
2 TBS  Onion powder
2 TBS garlic
1/3 cup molasses
1 cup vinegar
1 cup pineapple juice

Directions:
You can use any kind of meat. Put meat in freezer until slightly frozen. This makes it easier to slice the meat. Cut meat into 1/4 inch slices. In a large bowl mix all the ingredients. Put your sliced meat into the bowl, cover and let sit for 6 hours. (For a stronger flavor let it sit overnight)remove the meat from the solution and drain. Place the strips of meat in a food dryer on the racks so they are not touching each other. Dry at 135*F. for 5 hours. Turn strips over and reduce temp to 125*F for 3 more hours. Drying time will vary depending on the drying method you use. You can also dry the strips in the oven on your lowest setting using cookie sheets. When working with meat always follow safety standards set out by the FDA. Refrigerate jerky after you finish. I vacuum pack mine. I can not tell you how long it keeps as the jerky is not around long enough to find out. Enjoy
