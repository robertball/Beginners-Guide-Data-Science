Strawberry Cream Cheese Clouds Recipe

Ingredients:
2 (10 ounce) packages puff pastry shells
2 pounds fresh strawberries
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups heavy cream

Directions:
Bake the frozen pastry shells as instructed on the box. Each box contains six pastry shells. Using two boxes, all twelve will fit on a large baking sheet. After they are done, remove top and hollow out the inside of pastries. Set tops aside to use later as garnish.
Slice strawberries lengthwise into medium-thin pieces. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar and set aside to chill in a medium bowl.
In a large bowl, beat together cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar and vanilla until smooth. In a separate large mixing bowl, whip heavy cream until stiff peaks form (about 3 minutes). Fold whipped cream into cream cheese mixture. Set aside and chill.
Fill each pastry with cream cheese until it just reaches the top. Spoon strawberries over top. Use the pastry tops as a garnish with a dollop of the cream cheese mixture and a strawberry slice on top.
