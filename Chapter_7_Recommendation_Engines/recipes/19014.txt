Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, cut the butter into the flour with a pastry blender or two knives, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Stir in pecans, press into bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish and bake 15 minutes, or until golden. Cool completely.
In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, confectioners' sugar and 1 cup whipped topping with electric mixer until smooth.

Pour onto cooled crust.  Spread remaining 2 cups of whipped topping on top of pudding mixture.  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of chopped nuts over all.  Chill in refrigerator until serving.
