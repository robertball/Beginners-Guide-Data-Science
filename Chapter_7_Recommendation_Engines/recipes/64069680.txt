Ingredients:
½ tsp. ground cinnamon
½ tsp. ground cardamom
¼ tsp. ground cloves
¾ oz. amaretto liqueur
3 oz. red wine (a Shiraz works well)
¾ oz. orange juice
Splash seltzer
Orange peel, for garnish

Directions:
Tie cinnamon, cardamom and cloves in a paper filter or empty tea bag and let steep in amaretto for 1 hour. Remove satchel, smell spiced amaretto, and try not to drink it straight.
Combine spiced amaretto, red wine, orange juice and seltzer in a tall glass filled with crushed ice and stir well. Garnish with an orange peel.

Description: 
This summer hit is my cold version of mulled wine or glogg. It is a sweet & spicy spritzer that’s even more refreshing than sangria
