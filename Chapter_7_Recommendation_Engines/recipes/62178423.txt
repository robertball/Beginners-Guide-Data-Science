Ingredients:
1 4lb. beef roast
Chopped onion
Chopped carrots
Chopped celery
Couple cloves of minced garlic
1 packet of brown gravy mix
2 T. water
1 packet dry onion soup mix
1 can cream of muchroom soup
10 oz. Diet Coke
2 beef bouillon cubes
Kitchen Bouquet
Water
flour

Directions:
Heat oven to 350F.
Put the roast in a roaster, spread onions, carrots, celery and garlic around and on top of roast.
In a mixing bowl, combine the gravy mix and water, mix in the onion soup mix and cream of mushroom soup. Add the bouillon cubes,stir in the Diet Coke and then pour over the roast.
Cover roaster and bake 1 hour.
Reduce the temp to 225F and bake for 2 hours. Turn roast over and bake 2 more hours, keeping roast covered.
Remove roast and vegetables from oven and let beef rest while making the gravy.
***To make gravy: put the roaster on top of the stove and bring gravy to a low boil. In a small bowl mix a runny paste with the flour and water. Stir this into the gravy and add around 1 T. of Kitchen Bouquet to brown it up a little. Stir and boil. If it's too thick, add a little water and stir; it it's too runny, add more of the water flour mixture. The addition of the water/flour/Kitchen Bouquet mixture give it more of an authentic gravy flavor and less "cream of mushroom soup" flavor.
