Ingredients:
1 teaspoon table salt plus more to taste
2 tablespoons white vinegar
4 large eggs, each cracked into a small handled cup
Ground black pepper

Directions:
Fill 8- to 10-inch nonstick skillet nearly to rim with water, add 1 teaspoon salt and the vinegar, and bring mixture to boil over high heat.
Lower the lips of each cup just into water at once; tip eggs into boiling water, cover, and remove from heat. Poach until yolks are medium-firm, exactly 4 minutes. For firmer yolks (or for extra large or jumbo eggs), poach 4 1/2 minutes; for looser yolks (or for medium eggs), poach 3 minutes.
With slotted spoon, carefully lift and drain each egg over skillet. (Can be dropped into ice water and refrigerated up to 3 days; see related Quick Tip: “Storing Poached Eggs.”) Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
