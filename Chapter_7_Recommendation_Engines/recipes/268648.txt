Ingredients:
2 pounds leeks, halved lengthwise and cut into 3/4-inch slices
5 tablespoons butter, divided
6 cups chicken stock
2 1/3 cups uncooked white rice
1 cup shredded Gruyere cheese
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add leeks and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in chicken stock and simmer for 5 to 6 minutes.
Add rice and cook, uncovered without stirring, until rice is tender and stock has been absorbed, 18 to 20 minutes.
Melt remaining butter in a saucepan over medium-low without browning. Add grated Gruyere cheese and mix into rice mixture just before serving. Season with a pinch of pepper and nutmeg.
