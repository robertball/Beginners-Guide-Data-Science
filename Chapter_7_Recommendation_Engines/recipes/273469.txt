1 red onion
1 fennel bulb
2 ribs celery

2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pinch salt
1 lemon, zested and sliced
1 pound red snapper fillets
1/2 cup dry white wine
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces

Directions:
Combine onion, fennel bulb, celery, and olives in a food processor with a slicing blade; process until everything is cut into a slaw-like consistency. Alternative use a knife to cut onion, fennel bulb, and celery into 1/8-inch thick strips and olives into rounds.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over low heat. Add vegetable-olive mixture and season with salt and lemon zest. Cook and stir until everything is soft, about 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread out vegetable mixture on the bottom of a 9x12-inch pan and set red snapper on top. Drizzle with white wine, olive oil, and lemon juice. Scatter butter on top.
Bake in the preheated oven for about 8 minutes. Move oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Broil red snapper for 2 minutes, making sure that it does not overcook.
