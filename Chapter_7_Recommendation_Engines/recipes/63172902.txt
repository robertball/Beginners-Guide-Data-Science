Ingredients:
Salad Ingredients:
3 cups of lettuce largely chopped into bite-size pieces
1-1/2 cups of cucumber that is chopped into half circles
1 cup of purslane leaves (and chop the stems)
2-1/4 cups of small tomatoes that are thinly sliced and then cut into quarters
1/4 cup of chopped mint leaves
1/4 cup of chopped parsley (optional)
=====================================
Dressing Ingredients:
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup olive oil
1-1/2 teaspoons of sumac powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3-1/2 tablespoons grenadine molasses
1/4 cup of semicircular slices of red onion or of chopped green onions
=====================================
Topping:
3/4 cup of Arabic bread that is cut into squares (if you don't find Arabic bread you may replace it with tortilla bread)
+you will need one of the following:
3 tablespoons olive oil (for stir frying; a healthier choice)
or
1-3/4 cups of vegetable oil (for deep frying)

Directions:
Mix salad ingredients into a large bowl.
In a separate small bowl mix dressing ingredients.
Cool both bowls in fridge.
Meanwhile prepare your crunchy bread topping by either stirring your bread squares in a skillet with the olive oil until crunchy and a bit golden, or by deep frying your bread squares until lightly brown. The choice is yours. If you deep fry lay your fried bread squares on paper towel to remove excess oil.
Let your bread squares cool down.
Before serving your Fattoush, mix the salad with its dressing, and then spread the bread on top. You may want to drizzle some grenadine molasses on top of the bread too.
Serve cool and enjoy!
