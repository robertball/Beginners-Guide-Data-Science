Ingredients:
3 cups sliced fresh peaches
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup shortening
1/2 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch square baking dish.
Place sliced peaches in prepared baking dish. Mix together 1 cup sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and almond extract. Place in oven while preparing shortcake (heating peaches first helps prevent dough from getting soggy).
In a large bowl, combine flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add milk and egg; stir just until flour is moistened. Spread over hot peaches. Sprinkle top with remaining sugar.
Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until top is golden brown.
