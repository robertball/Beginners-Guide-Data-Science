Ingredients:
2 cups chicken stock (preferably homemade)
2 cups evaporated skim milk
1 cup polenta
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, shredded
Kosher salt to taste

Directions:
In a large pot, combine stock and evaporated skim milk. Over medium high heat, bring the liquid to a boil. Slowly whisk in polenta so that it is not clumpy and whisk continuously for 5 minutes, reduce heat, cover and simmer, stirring regularly.
Whisk in Parmesan, add salt to taste and serve.
