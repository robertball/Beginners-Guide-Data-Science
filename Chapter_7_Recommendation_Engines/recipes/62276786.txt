Ingredients:
1 egg
1 cup milk, divided
1 Tablespoon canola oil
1 Tablespoon sugar
1 cup all purpose flour
1 Tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Crack egg into a medium bowl. Using a wire wisk, beat until frothy.
Add the oil, sugar, and about half the milk. Whisk to combine.
In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt.
Add dry ingredients to egg mixture and mix well.
Add remaining milk and mix well.
Allow to stand for 15 minutes. If the batter is too thick, or you like thinner pancakes, add a little milk at this point.
Preheat a greased griddle to 300 degrees F or until drops of water sprinkled on it sputter and evaporate quickly. Pour 1/8 to 1/4 cup batter onto the griddle. (*See note.)
Turn over with a spatula when bubbles begin to form on top and edges are dry. Cook second side to a golden brown color.
