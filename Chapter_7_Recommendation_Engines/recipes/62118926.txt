2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
4 1/2 cups confectioners sugar
4 10 ounce jars maraschino cherries with stems

Drain cherries, reserving 2 tablespoons of cherry juice for fondant. Rinse cherries and set on paper towels to drain and dry.
Mix sweetened milk, corn syrup and cherry juice together in a large bowl.  Gradually beat in confectioners sugar.  Mixture will be really stiff and will require a beater with a strong motor or finshing the mixing by hand.
Take a small amount of fondant and roll into a approximately 1 inch ball and then flatten.  Wrap the fondant around a cherry and set on wax paper.  Finish wrapping all the cherries.
Melt chocolate candy coating in a saucepan over low heat.Dip each cherry in the chocolate.  Place back on the wax paper and let the chocolate set up.  Store in an airtight container, in the refridgerator, for 1-2 weeks so fondant can soften.
