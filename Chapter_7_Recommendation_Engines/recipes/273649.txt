Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 pound mushrooms, cleaned and sliced
1 cup coarsely chopped onion
8 ounces fresh spinach - washed, stemmed, and coarsely chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (10 ounce) can Mexican-style diced tomatoes with lime and cilantro (such as RotelÂ®), half drained
1 (8 ounce) package neufchatel cheese
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
20 corn tortillas
1 pound shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 (8 ounce) jar salsa, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Heat a skillet over high heat. Add butter, mushrooms, and onion and cook until onions are translucent, 7 to 10 minutes. Add spinach and toss until wilted, about 3 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.
Heat a small saucepan over medium heat. Add diced tomatoes, neufchatel cheese, 8 ounces sour cream, and cumin. Stir until thoroughly mixed, about 1 minute, and remove from heat.
Place tortillas between 2 paper towels and heat in a microwave oven until warm, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Scoop about 2 tablespoons spinach mixture, 1 tablespoon cream mixture, and 1 to 2 tablespoons shredded Monterey Jack cheese into a tortilla. Roll up and place seam-side down in the prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Spread any remaining cream mixture on top of enchiladas. Sprinkle any remaining Monterey Jack cheese on top. Cover.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes.
Garnish individual servings with remaining sour cream and salsa.

Description: 
Delicious meatless enchiladas. You can vary the amounts of cheese and cream sauce to make them as light or heavy as you like. I use 3 to 5 varieties of mushrooms. Various oyster varieties, buttons, and baby portobello.
