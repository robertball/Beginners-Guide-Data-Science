Ingredients:
3/4 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3 oz pkg vanilla instant pudding
3 tablespoons soft butter
1 egg
1/2 cup milk
1 16 ounce can diced peaches drained (save peach juice)
1 8 ounce pkg cream cheese softened
1/2 cup sugar
Cinnamon/sugar

Directions:
1.  In a medium sized bowl Mix flour, baking powder, salt, pudding mix, butter, egg and milk (by hand or mixer, dough is very sticky.
2.  Grease a 9 inch pie pan. Spread mixture on bottom and sides to form crust (if you sprinkle  a little flour over the dough and use the back of a large spoon to spread the sticky dough it's easier, add flour as needed to the back of the spoon) .
3.  Spread diced peaches on crust (using more diced peaches to more fully fill the crust is also good).
4. With electric mixer Mix cream cheese, 4 tablespoons peach juice (I had a couple more tablespoons for added flavor) and 1/2 cup sugar until smooth and creamy,  Spoon on top of peaches.
5.  Sprinkle cinnamon/sugar generously over top of pie. Bake at 350 for 30-35 min, does not set in middle.

Easy to make and everyone loves it. I have also used fresh blueberries and strawberries and turned out very good.
