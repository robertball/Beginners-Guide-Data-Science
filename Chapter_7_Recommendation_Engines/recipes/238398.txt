Ingredients:
2 pounds ground turkey
1 green apple, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh mushrooms, or to taste
3 scallions, or more to taste, chopped
3 tablespoons barbeque sauce
2 tablespoons spicy mango chutney, or more to taste
2 tablespoons red pepper jelly
2 dashes Worcestershire sauce, or to taste
1 pinch seasoned salt, or to taste
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix ground turkey, green apple, mushrooms, scallions, barbeque sauce, chutney, red pepper jelly, Worcestershire sauce, seasoned salt, garlic powder, and black pepper by hand in a large bowl; shape into 8 patties.
Cook the turkey burgers on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
