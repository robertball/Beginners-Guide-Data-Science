Ingredients:
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 cup almonds
3 cups vegetable broth, divided
1 butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and diced
2 carrots, peeled and cut in chunks
1 onion, diced
4 cloves garlic
water as needed
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste
1 teaspoon chili powder, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook almonds in the melted butter until light brown, about 5 minutes. Pour 1 cup vegetable broth into the pot; bring to a simmer and cook until warmed, 1 to 2 minutes.
Pour remaining broth into the pot; add butternut squash, carrots, onion, and garlic. Pour enough water into the pot to assure the vegetables are completely submerged; bring to a simmer and cook until the carrots are completely soft and the volume of the liquid has reduced by about 1/3, 15 to 20 minutes.
Pour broth mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
Pour pureed soup into a separate vessel. Stir Worcestershire sauce, cinnamon, chili powder, brown sugar, and salt into the soup.
