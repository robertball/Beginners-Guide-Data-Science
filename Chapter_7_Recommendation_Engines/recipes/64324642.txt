Ingredients:
3/4 pounds cauliflower, cut into large florets (about 4 cups)
1 1/2 clove(s) garlic, peeled
14 ounce(s) broth, chicken, fat-free, less sodium, (1 cans)
salt, to taste
peppercorns, black, freshly ground, to taste
1 tablespoon chives, fresh, chopped

Directions:
In a large saucepan, combine cauliflower, garlic, and broth. If cauliflower is not completely covered by broth, add water to just cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until cauliflower is tender, about 12 minutes.
Reserve 2 tablespoons of the cooking liquid, then drain cauliflower and garlic. Transfer cauliflower and garlic to the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth, pulsing in some or all of the reserved cooking liquid, if necessary, to moisten mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Just before serving, stir in chives. Serve warm.
Each serving is 1 cup.
