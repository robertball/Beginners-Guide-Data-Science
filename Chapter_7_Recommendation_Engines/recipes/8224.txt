Ingredients:
3 egg yolks
1 cup frozen apple juice concentrate, thawed
3/4 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup chopped almonds
4 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup raspberry jam
2 tablespoons amaretto liqueur
1/3 cup blanched slivered almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch round cake pans.
In a large bowl, beat egg yolks.  Blend in apple juice concentrate, melted butter or margarine, and almond extract.  Combine flour, baking powder, and salt; gradually add to egg yolk mixture, beating until well blended.  Stir in chopped almonds.
In a clean bowl, beat egg whites with cream or tartar with an electric mixer at high speed until stiff peaks form.  Gently fold into batter.  Spread batter evenly into prepared pans.
Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until cake is golden brown around the edges.  Cool in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Turn cakes onto racks, and cool completely.
In a medium size mixing bowl, beat cream with an electric mixer at high speed until peaks form.  Beat in fruit spread, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Beat until thick and well blended.
Brush liqueur evenly over cake layers, spread a dollop of the whipped cream mixture on the bottom layer and stack the other layer on top. Frost top and sides with whipped cream mixture; press slivered almonds around edge.
