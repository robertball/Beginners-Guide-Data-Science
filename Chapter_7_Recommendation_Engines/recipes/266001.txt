Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 1/2 cups low-sodium tomato juice
2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHotÂ®)
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 (14.5 ounce) package baked tortilla chips, or to taste
1 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese, or to taste
1/3 head iceberg lettuce, shredded, or to taste
1 cup salsa, or to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet until beef is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease, and return beef to the skillet. Add tomato juice, hot sauce, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and cayenne pepper. Reduce heat and simmer gently, about 15 minutes.
Break tortilla chips into bowls and top with the ground beef mixture. Finish with Cheddar cheese, lettuce, and salsa.

Description: 
I created this dish so the kids could still enjoy one of their favorite foods, but with less fat and salt. It passed their taste-test with flying colors!
 Leftovers are great for school lunches.
