Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 cup butter
1/3 cup superfine sugar
1/3 cup golden syrup
1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Generously grease baking sheets.
Sift together flour and ginger.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, sugar and syrup and cook until butter is melted.  Allow to cool.
Stir flour mixture and lemon rind into syrup.  Drop by spoonfuls onto prepared sheets, well spaced apart, as the mixture will spread.
Bake 10 to 15 minutes in preheated oven, until golden.  Remove from oven and let cool 1 minute.  Have ready 5 small bowls, their undersides buttered.  Gently lift the brandy snap off the tray and bend it over a bowl to shape.  Remove baskets when cooler and set.
