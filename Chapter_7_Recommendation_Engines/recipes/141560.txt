Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
3/4 cup mashed banana
1 tablespoon canola oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
12 (6 inch) flour tortillas
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.  In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; set aside.
Beat butter and sugar until creamy. Beat in eggs one at a time, then add mashed banana, canola oil, and vanilla. Fold in flour and 1 cup of chocolate chips. Place a dollop of batter into each tortilla, then roll up in a cylinder to form an "enchilada"; place into prepared baking dish.
Bake "enchiladas" in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 45 minutes. Melt the remaining 1/2 cup of chocolate chips in a small bowl using the microwave. Drizzle over the "enchiladas" as soon as they come out of the oven.

Description: 
These enchiladas are a great twist to a banana bread recipe.  They're fun for a party, especially if it's Mexican themed! Sprinkle with powdered sugar for a nice effect.
