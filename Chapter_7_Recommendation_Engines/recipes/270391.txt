Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped yellow onions
4 cloves garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
6 cups chicken broth
1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1/2 pound kale, ribs removed and leaves torn into pieces
1 pound ham, cut into 1/2-inch chunks
2 cups canned diced tomatoes
1 cup great northern beans, drained
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
3 bay leaves
2 cups green peas
2 tablespoons lemon juice
3 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook until onions are translucent and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.
Add broth, potatoes, and kale. Increase heat to high and bring soup to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes.
Add ham, tomatoes, beans, rosemary, and bay leaves. Simmer on low for 15 minutes. Add peas and cook for 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper; stir in lemon juice and parsley.
