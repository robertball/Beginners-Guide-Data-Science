Ingredients:
1 1/2 lb chicken breasts cutlets or 1 1/2 lb chicken tenders
2 tbsp flour (use rice flour for gluten free option)
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tsbp butter
5-6 cloves of garlic - minced
2 cups chicken stock
1/2 cup white wine - optional
1/2 cup half and half
2 tbsp lemon juice
1/4 cup parmesan cheese
2 tsp cornstarch
salt and pepper

Directions:
Heat 1 tbsp of the olive oil and butter over medium high heat in a large pan. Season the flour with salt and pepper and dredge the chicken in it. Brown the chicken 2-3 minutes per side. Set the chicken aside, keeping it warm. Lower the heat to medium and add 1 tbsp of olive oil to the pan and saut√© the garlic for 30 seconds, being careful not to burn it. Deglaze the pan with white wine(if using)or the chicken stock scraping up the bits from the pan. If you are using the wine add the stock and let reduce over medium heat for about 10 minutes. Add the half and half, lemon juice, stir in the parmesan cheese and let reduce for another 10 minutes. If it's still too runny, dissolve the cornstarch in cold water and stir into the sauce. Add the chicken back to the sauce and allow to heat through, about 10 more minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve and enjoy!

Description: 
This creamy Alfredo-type dish has become a favorite of my family. My daughter requests it constantly served over bow tie pasta. You can also serve with rice.
