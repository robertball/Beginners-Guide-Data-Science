Ingredients:
3 lb. small red potatoes, washed, dried, unpeeled (about 12 potatoes)
½ cup + 1 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
to taste, kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 Tbsp. dried Greek oregano
1 Tbsp. minced garlic

Directions:
Heat oven to 450°F. Put potatoes in single layer in roasting pan and roast until tender, 40-45 minutes. When potatoes are tender, remove pan from oven and place on top of stove or heat-proof surface. Using flat bottom of sturdy china mug, press down and flatten each potato one at a time in roasting pan. Smashed potatoes should be about ½ thick. Potato skin will break, showing some of the white flesh, but potato should retain most of its round shape. Repeat until all potatoes have been smashed. (Don't worry if a few break up and fall apart.) Drizzle ¼ cup oil over potatoes, season generously with salt and pepper and return them to oven.
Roast potatoes about 25 minutes until they are browned on bottom. Remove from oven; turn over with large spatula. Drizzle another ¼ cup oil over potatoes and return to oven. Roast until they are browned on second side, about 25 minutes more, then remove pan from oven.
Scatter oregano and garlic over surface, season again with salt and pepper and drizzle with remaining Tbsp. olive oil. Toss potatoes with spatula to distribute seasonings evenly, then return them to oven for 5 more minutes. Roasting time after potatoes are smashed is about 55 minutes, total time 1 hr., 35 minutes. With spatula, transfer potatoes to large platter. Serve immediately.
