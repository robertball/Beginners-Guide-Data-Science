Description: 
When it comes to delicious, unique, and refreshing summer drinks, it's hard to beat horchata. We're doing a Mexican-style horchata, which is done with rice and almonds. The result is something that sort of looks like milk, but is much lighter, and pairs perfectly with all your favorite summer foods.
