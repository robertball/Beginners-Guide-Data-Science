Ingredients:
12 Roma (plum) tomatoes
6 cloves garlic, peeled
1 large sweet onion
2 jalapeno chili peppers
1 Habanero chili pepper
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt
2 fresh limes juiced, and pulp
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Dice the chili peppers and onion, and finely chop the garlic.
Place peppers, onion and garlic in an aluminum roasting pan small enough to fit in your smoker, or use aluminum foil ~ folded on itself a few times for durability.
Drizzle ingredients with olive oil, stirring to completely cover.
Smoke long enough to use 1 or 2 pans of wood chips; 1 to 2 hours should be adequate. Our intent is a smoky flavor, not to dry the ingredients.
Meanwhile dice the tomatoes and place in a large glass bowl. Add the chopped cilantro, cumin, salt lime juice and pulp. Cover and refrigerate.
When the ingredients are finished smoking, add to glass bowl, stir completely and return to the refrigerator.
Let the ingredients marinate together for at least 30 minutes, and enjoy!

Description: 
This is not a super-quick recipe… this is a “slow down and enjoy making a great, smoky salsa your family and friends will love.” But very easy to make.

I used a food smoker to get the smoke flavoring.
