Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages angel hair pasta
1/2 pound cooked bay shrimp
3/4 cup chopped green onions
1 1/2 cups ranch-style salad dressing

Directions:
Cook the pasta according to package directions; drain and rinse under cold water.
Mix together the pasta, shrimp, green onions and ranch dressing, then carefully work the shrimp into the pasta with your hands. (Note: As the salad sits, it will absorb some of the dressing; add a little dressing right before serving).
