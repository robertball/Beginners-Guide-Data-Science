Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
3/4 cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)
1/2 cup butter
2 pounds ground chicken
1 2/3 cups dry bread crumbs
2 stalks celery, minced
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®), or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Coat a large rimmed baking sheet with olive oil.
Heat 3/4 cup hot sauce and butter together in saucepan over low heat, whisking constantly, until butter is melted and completely incorporated. Cool to room temperature.
Stir chicken, bread crumbs, hot sauce mixture, celery, and eggs together in a bowl until evenly mixed; roll into 1-inch balls and place on prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Transfer meatballs to a platter and drizzle with 2 tablespoons hot sauce.

Description: 
These are just as good, if not better than, Buffalo chicken wings but without the mess! You can use ground turkey in place of the ground chicken. Serve on toothpicks with celery sticks, hot sauce, and blue cheese dressing.
