1 1/2 c flour
1 c oats
1/2 c white sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda

1 c mashed banana's (about 3 medium)

Directions:
Stir dry ingredients together. Beat eggs until frothy. Mix in oil, milk and banana.  Pour into dry ingredients.  Stir to moisten.  Stir by hand not by mixer - muffins will be tough if over mixed!
Batter should be lumpy.  Bake in greased muffin ins at 400 degrees for 20 - 25 minutes.
