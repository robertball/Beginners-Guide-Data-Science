Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 cups sliced carrots
1 ½ cups chopped onion
1 ½ cups chopped celery
1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic
12 cups vegetarian chicken-flavored broth
2 cups egg noodles
1 (14 ounce) container extra-firm tofu, drained and cubed
¼ cup raisins
½ teaspoon dried basil
½ teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon poultry seasoning
¼ teaspoon dried thyme
¼ teaspoon dried rosemary
¼ teaspoon dried marjoram
¼ teaspoon black pepper
¼ cup cornstarch
3 tablespoons cold water

Directions:
Melt the butter in a stockpot over medium heat.  Stir in the carrots, onion, celery, and garlic and cook until just tender, about 10 minutes.
Pour in the broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add the noodles, tofu, raisins, basil, oregano, poultry seasoning, thyme, rosemary, marjoram, and pepper.  Dissolve the cornstarch and water in a small bowl. Stir the cornstarch mixture into the soup.  Return soup to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.

Description: 
Tastes just like chicken noodle soup but with tofu.  I add raisins to this soup, just like grandma used to.
