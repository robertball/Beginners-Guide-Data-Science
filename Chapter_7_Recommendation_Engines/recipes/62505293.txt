Ingredients:
3 lbs. 			Ground Chuck
3 or 4 			Onions  Rough Dice
2 Cans (8 oz)		Tomato Sauce
1 Can (8 oz)		Chili Hot Kidney Beans (do NOT drain liquid)
1 Can (8 oz)		Diced Tomatoes (do NOT drain liquid)
2 tablespoons  		Chili Powder
1 Teaspoon 		Cinnamon
1 Teaspoon 		Cumin
½ Cup 			Sugar
1 Teaspoon 		Salt
1 Teaspoon 		Course Ground Black Pepper
Serving Condiments
1 Cup 			Finely Diced Onions
1 Cup			Shredded Cheddar Cheese

Directions:
Brown ground chuck in large heavy pan.  Ground chuck produces little grease.  Do NOT drain it.  Leave it in the pan.  IF, however, you use ground beef with a higher fat content a large amount of grease may be produced.  In this case, drain grease but leave a small amount in the pan.
Add the rough diced onions to the browned meat and slowly continue to cook until the onions are soft.
Add the tomato sauce,  kidney beans, diced tomatoes, chili powder, cinnamon, cumin, sugar, salt and course ground pepper.  Stir to mix ingredients thoroughly.
Slowly simmer mixture in covered pan for two (2) hours stirring occasionally.
Serve either by itself or over spaghetti.   Have finely diced onions and shredded cheddar cheese to top chili as desired.
