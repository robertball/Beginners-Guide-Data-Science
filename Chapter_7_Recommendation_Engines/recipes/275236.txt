Ingredients:
3 teaspoons olive oil, divided
1/4 cup diced onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup diced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons chickpea crumbs (optional)
1 tablespoon red wine, or to taste
1/2 cup cooked brown rice
1 teaspoon sesame oil
3 dashes soy sauce, or to taste
1 pinch dried oregano
1 pinch ground thyme
1 cup chopped fresh kale
salt and ground black pepper to taste
cooking spray
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and saute until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and chickpea crumbs and cook until mushrooms are soft, about 5 minutes. Pour in wine and cook for 1 minute. Add rice, sesame oil, and soy sauce and cook, stirring frequently, another 5 minutes. Add oregano and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Toss in kale and cook until warmed and slightly wilted, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Pour egg into the skillet; cook and stir until egg is set, about 5 minutes. Serve egg with kale and rice mixture and drizzle with Sriracha sauce.

I threw this together one morning when I had about a half hour to spare in between doing laundry and when I needed to leave for work. This is great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!
