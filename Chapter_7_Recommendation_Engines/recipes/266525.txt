Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
1/2 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic
3 eggs
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese divided

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Meanwhile, place mushrooms in a dry skillet over medium heat. Cook until they begin to brown and release moisture, 3 to 5 minutes. Add oil and garlic. Fry until softened, about 3 minutes more.
Beat eggs together in a bowl. Add 1/2 the Parmesan cheese. Mix well and stir into cooked mushroom mixture.
Serve the pasta topped with mushroom sauce and remaining Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This is a quick and easy upgrade to weeknight spaghetti dinner. I tend to make this low sodium, but you may want to add salt in the pasta water and while the mushrooms are cooking.
