Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 pounds fresh mushrooms, such as crimini, porcini, shiitake, or common (use one kind or a combination), cleaned and thinly sliced
2 teaspoons minced or pressed garlic
4 teaspoons sherry vinegar
2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
6 large eggs
3 1/2 cups milk
1 (1 pound) loaf day-old crusty sourdough bread, cut diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices (see notes), ends discarded
6 ounces shelled cooked crab, any bits of shell removed
1/3 cup chopped green onions, white and pale green parts only
2 cups shredded jack cheese

Directions:
Pour olive oil into a 12-inch frying pan or 14-inch wok over medium-high heat; when hot, add mushrooms and garlic and stir until mushrooms begin to brown and liquid has evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Add vinegar and thyme; cook, stirring often, to blend flavors, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add salt and pepper to taste.
In a bowl, whisk eggs, milk, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper to blend.
Cover bottom of a 3-quart baking dish (such as 9 by 13 in., at least 2 in. deep) with bread slices, trimming if necessary to fit in a single layer. Spread half the mushroom mixture evenly over bread; top with all the crab and half the green onions. Sprinkle evenly with 1 cup cheese. Pour half the custard mixture evenly over cheese. Arrange another layer of bread on top (overlap slightly if desired; save any extra bread for other uses), followed by remaining mushroom mixture, green onions, and 1 cup cheese. Spoon remaining custard mixture evenly over the top. Let strata stand at room temperature about 15 minutes, or cover and chill.
Bake, uncovered, in a 350 degree regular or convection oven until center is set (cut to test) and top is well browned, 45 to 50 minutes. Cut into rectangles or scoop out with a large spoon to serve.
