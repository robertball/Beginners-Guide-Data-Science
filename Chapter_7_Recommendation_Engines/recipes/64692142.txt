Ingredients:
3 - 4 Tbsp olive oil
4 large cloves of garlic, minced or sliced, your choice
1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes
2  28 oz tins of San Marzano tomatoes, or any plum tomatoes

Directions:
Heat oil on medium heat, in a large pot and add garlic and red pepper flakes, lower heat if you need to as to not burn the garlic. When garlic is soft and fragrant add your tomatoes. You can add them whole if you like a real chunky sauce or blend in a blender first, to make a smooth sauce. Bring to boil, then lower heat to simmer. Simmer uncovered, approximately one hour.

Description: 
A simple yet very tasty pasta sauce. I like to cook My Turkey Italian Meatballs (from this site),or other meats in it to add another layer of flavour. Add any herbs you like, as well.
