Title:
Pizza Dough for the bread machine Recipe

Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups milk
2 Tbsp olive or canola oil
2 Tbsp honey (or sugar if giving to child under 1)
4 cups bread flour, plus a little for kneading
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp yeast

Directions:
Mix all of your ingredients in your bread machine on dough setting.
Put a little flour on your counter, knead the dough until it's not too sticky (won't stick to the counter when rolled out), and roll it out evenly to fit your cookie sheet. I find doing this by hand is sometimes easier than with a roller.
Spray your cookie sheet and put dough on your cookie sheet. Tip: I find it easiest to put my dough on the cookie sheet and work with it until it fits the whole sheet. Then, fold half of it over on itself, spray that half of the sheet, put the dough back down, then repeat on the other side.
Bake at 375 degrees for 20-25 minutes.
It can get some pretty big bubbles in the crust, and I usually poke them with a fork and flatten some. Be careful though because hot steam can come out.
Top with sauce, cheese, and other favorite toppings, continue baking 15-20 minutes.
