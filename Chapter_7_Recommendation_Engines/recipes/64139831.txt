Ingredients:
4 medium bell peppers (any color you like)
1 lb lean ground beef
1 cup cooked rice
1 cup gluten free spaghetti sauce
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp chives
1 tsp celery seed
3/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Grease a glass baking dish and set aside.
Remove the tops of the peppers and use a spoon to remove the insides (seeds and such). Place peppers into a large pot and add 5 cups of salted water. Boil. Remove from pot and drain. Allow to cool slightly.
Brown beef in a skillet, then move it into a medium bowl. Add rice, half of the spaghetti sauce, oregano, celery seed and chives. Mix.
Spoon beef mixture into hollowed and boiled peppers. Pour remaining spaghetti sauce over the top and cover with cheese.
Bake 45 minutes. Uncover. Back 15 more minutes.
