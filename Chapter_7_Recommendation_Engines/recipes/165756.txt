Ingredients:
1/2 pound thick sliced bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2 carrots, diced
4 stalks celery, chopped
1 bay leaf
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons flour
4 cups milk
2 large potatoes, peeled and diced
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 pinch paprika (optional)

Directions:
Cook the bacon pieces in a large skillet over medium heat until the fat has rendered, and the bacon is crispy, about 8 minutes. Remove the bacon, leaving the grease in the pan. Stir the carrot, celery, and bay leaf into the bacon grease; cook for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Whisk in the flour, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Slowly whisk in the milk, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Once simmering, cook for 5 minutes, whisking frequently. Add the bacon, cooked vegetables, potatoes, and corn. Return to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes more. Use additional milk as needed to to achieve desired consistency. Garnish with paprika to serve.
