Ingredients:
6 ten inch flour tortillas
1 10 oz. can enchilada sauce (medium)
1 14.5 oz. can diced tomatoes
1 15.5 oz. can fajita seasoned chili beans undrained
1 2.25 can sliced black olives
1 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
In a glass casserole dish, I use 7x10x3, pour a small amount of enchilada sauce on bottom of pan so that the bottom is covered with sauce.
Tear a tortilla shells apart and layer over the sauce.
Spoon 1/3 can of beans over the tortillas.
Top with a layer of the shredded cheese.
Top shredded cheese with 1/3 can of the diced tomatoes.
Repeat layers starting next layer with tortilla shells.
The top layer will be the last torn up tortilla shell.
Spread remaining enchilada sauce on top of that and any left over tomato sauce and sauce from the beans.
Layer the top with sliced olives and top with another layer of shredded cheese.
Cover with tin foil and bake for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for 5 more minutes.
Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
Serve and top with Parmesan cheese if you like.
