Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1 (14 ounce) can pumpkin pie filling
1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
1 (5 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
6 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon allspice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Melt 1/2 cup sugar in an aluminum loaf pan and heat over medium heat. Continue to cook until it caramelizes, being careful to not burn the sugar. Fill a large pot of water with about 1 inch of water and place over medium heat. Move the aluminum pan into the large pot and set into the water.
Combine the pumpkin pie filling, evaporated milk, condensed milk, eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, vanilla, and allspice in a blender, blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into the loaf pan.
Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or overnight.
Run a knife along the edge of the loaf pan to loosen the flan. Invert the pan onto a serving plate and tap to release the dessert.
