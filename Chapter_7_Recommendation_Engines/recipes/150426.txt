Ingredients:
1 cup bread flour
2 3/4 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons white sugar
1/4 cup margarine
2 cups buttermilk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon buttermilk
1 teaspoon white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a shallow baking pan with cooking spray.
Sift together the bread flour, whole wheat flour, salt, baking soda, and 2 teaspoons sugar in a bowl. Cut the margarine into the flour mixture until pieces are nearly indistinguishable. Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in the oil and buttermilk. Stir with a spatula until dry mixture is completely moistened. Move the dough to a lightly-floured surface. Lightly knead the dough for no more than 1 minute. Place the dough into the prepared pan; pat down and around to form a round loaf. Cut a cross into the top of the loaf with your finger. Brush the top with 1 tablespoon buttermilk; sprinkle 1 teaspoon sugar over the top of the loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C); rotate pan and bake another 30 minutes.
Allow loaf to cool on a wire rack before slicing.

Description: 
My husband, a native Northern Irishman, loves this bread with a bowl of tomato and lentil soup or with butter and cheese or jelly. It really is so easy to make and comes out perfectly every time! I hope you will enjoy it too!
