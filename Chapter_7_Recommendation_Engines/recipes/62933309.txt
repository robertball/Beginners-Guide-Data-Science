Ingredients:
1 bone-in leg of lamb, sized appropriately for your needs
Herb rub (multiply per 2 pounds of lamb):
1 clove of garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger
1/2 teaspoon dry thyme
1/2 teaspoon ground sage
1/2 teaspoon dry marjoram
1 Tablespoon soy sauce (I use low sodium)
1 Tablespoon vegetable oil
1 bay leaf

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
Make sure you multiply the rub recipe by half the number of pounds of lamb you have, you'll want enough to put a good coat over the whole leg.
Combine the minced garlic, salt, pepper, and herbs in a small bowl.  Add the soy sauce and vegetable oil and mix well.  Add the bay leaf.  It should be a loose paste like consistency.
Cut slits in the lamb, then rub the herb mixture all over the skin.  Place lamb on a rack in a roasting pan and roast uncovered to your desired level of doneness.  I like mine on the rare side and find that roughly 25 minutes per pound is good, but your mileage may vary.
Let the leg stand, covered loosely in foil, for 20 minutes at room temperature before carving.

Description: 
An herb rub makes this leg of lamb so good! I always knew it was Easter when my mom made it, and the whole house smells awesome when it's cooking. It's the only recipe I specifically asked for when I moved out on my own.
