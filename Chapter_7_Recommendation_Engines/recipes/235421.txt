Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups water
2 cups Israeli couscous
1 red bell pepper, cut into 1/4-by-2-inch strips
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into 1/4-by-2-inch strips
1/2 cup olive oil
lemon, juiced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1 cup kalamata olives, pitted and halved
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add couscous and return mixture to a boil. Place a lid on the saucepan, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until couscous is tender and the water is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Transfer couscous to a bowl.
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook red bell pepper and yellow bell pepper strips in the hot skillet until soft and slightly charred, about 5 minutes; add to couscous and stir.
Whisk olive oil and lemon juice together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle oil mixture over the couscous mixture and stir to coat. Gently stir tomatoes, olives, and feta cheese through the couscous.

Description: 
This is a recipe I created when I needed something to take to a family get-together. It can be made ahead, so you just grab it and go! You can prepare all ingredients and refrigerate separately, then mix together before serving, but this recipe keeps well too!
