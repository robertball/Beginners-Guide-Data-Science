Ingredients:
28 oz can diced tomatoes
14 oz can chicken broth
8 oz can tomato paste
1/2 cup heavy cream
about 1/4 cup olive oil
3 tbsp finely chopped fresh dill
1 tbsp paprika
2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Drain the tomatoes, reserving the juice. Spread tomatoes on a baking pan, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake at 450 degrees F for at least 35 minutes or until browned. Don't be afraid of cooking the tomatoes too long; the blackened bits are juicy and have the richest flavor.
Combine the reserved tomato juice, caramelized tomato chunks, chicken broth, tomato paste, heavy cream and seasonings in a large saucepan. Cook over low to medium heat. Simmer for 10 minutes or until heated through, adding salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
Caramelized tomato chunks made this creamy soup almost sinful. The flavor is rich and spicy, nicely balanced by the sweetness of the roasted tomatoes. No one will believe you made it yourself.
