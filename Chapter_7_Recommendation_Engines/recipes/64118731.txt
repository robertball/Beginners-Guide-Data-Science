Ingredients:
2 T. olive oil
1 lg. sweet red pepper, cored and cut in 1/4 strips
1 med. zucchini- thinly sliced
2 tsp. minced garlic
1/2 tsp. black pepper
1/4 C. minced fresh basil
1 lb. sweet Italian sausage
3 med. potatoes , peeled and very thinly sliced
1 C. grated Parmesan cheese
2 C. shredded mozzarella, Monterey jack or cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425. Heat 1 T. oil in a 12 inch skillet over moderately high heat for 1 minute. Add the red peppers and zucchini and saute, stirring occasionally, until soft. Stir in the garlic, black pepper, and basil, and saute 2 minutes longer. Add the sausage, breaking up any clumps, and saute until no longer pink but not quite cooked through. Remove from heat.
Toss the potatoes with the remaining 1 T. oil. Spread 1/4 of potatoes, overlapping slightly, over the bottom of a lightly greased 10 inch pie pan or a 13x9x2 baking dish. Spread 1/3 of the skillet mixture on top, following 1/3 each of Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses. Press each layer down with your hands. Repeat the layers twice, finishing with a layer of potatoes.
Cover pie with foil, set in the lower third of the oven, and bake for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until potatoes a crisp and cooked through-5 to 15 minutes.
Remove the pie from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
