Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups cake flour
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, cut into cubes
4 large eggs
1 cup whole milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon coconut extract
1 teaspoon pineapple extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 36 muffin cups with paper liners.
Combine cake flour, all-purpose flour, white sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl; mix with hand mixer on Low until combined, about 3 minutes; add butter and mix just until butter chunks are coated with flour.
Beat 1 egg into the flour mixture at a time, assuring each is integrated fully before introducing the next; beat until the mixture forms a cake batter.
Slowly add milk, vanilla extract, coconut extract, and pineapple extract to the batter, beating and intermittently scraping down the sides of the bowl as you mix, until fully integrated; spoon into paper liners to about 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 17 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
No alcohol! 

I'm was inspired by my favorite drink! Made these for a party at work and they were a huge hit! Cool cupcakes completely before decorating with frosting.
