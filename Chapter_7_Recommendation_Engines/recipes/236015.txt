Description: 
Super quick and easy chicken that is easily varied! This is great to play with: add part of a ranch seasoning packet, garlic, or maybe add some scallions. You can also switch up the cheeses! Great with pepper jack cheese. When I make it fairly plain my son likes to dip the roll ups in ranch.
