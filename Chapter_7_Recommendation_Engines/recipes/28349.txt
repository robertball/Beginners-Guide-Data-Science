Very Spicy Thai Green Chicken Curry Recipe

Ingredients:
2 large shallots, peeled and quartered
10  Thai bird's eye chile peppers, seeded and chopped
2  fresh jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped
½ bunch fresh cilantro
½ bunch fresh basil
2 cloves garlic, peeled and halved
1 (1 1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and sliced
2  limes, zested and juiced
1 tablespoon lemon juice
½ teaspoon sesame oil
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
2  boneless chicken breasts, cubed
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 cup chicken broth
2  kaffir lime leaves

Directions:
Combine shallots, bird's eye chile peppers, jalapeno peppers, cilantro, basil, garlic, ginger, lime juice, lime zest, lime flesh, lemon juice, sesame oil, and pepper in a food processor. Process, adding enough olive oil to make a paste that is thick but not thick enough to form peaks when you stir it.
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat and fry curry paste, stirring constantly, until softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and cook until chicken has sealed on all sides, about 5 minutes.
Pour coconut milk and chicken stock into the saucepan with the chicken; mix well. Simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until liquid has reduced to a thick sauce that clings to a spoon, 20 to 30 minutes. Add kaffir lime leaves and simmer for 1 more minute.
