Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
3 stalks celery, diced
3 poblano peppers, seeded and chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
4 cups chicken broth
2 (15 ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
3/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1 (15.5 ounce) can hominy
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, celery, and poblano peppers in the hot oil until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper to onion mixture; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute.
Mix turkey into onion mixture; cook and stir until turkey is cooked through and no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Add chicken broth, cannellini beans, and oregano to turkey mixture; cover skillet and cook for 15 minutes. Stir hominy and salt into chili and continue cooking until heated through, about 15 minutes more.

Description: 
This chili is a healthier version of your traditional chili. But don't let the idea of healthy scare you away! This chili packs in the fresh flavors of peppers, cumin, and cilantro all combined into one amazing dish. Or as my fiancee would describe it, 'super-good'. Have fun with this recipe. Spice it up or simmer it down. Just have fun in the kitchen!
