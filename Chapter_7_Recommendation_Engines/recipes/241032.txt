Ingredients:
1 cup soy sauce
3/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1 (1 1/2-pound) skirt steak
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Whisk soy sauce and balsamic vinegar together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add skirt steak and turn to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator, 30 to 45 minutes.
Remove skirt from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade. Season steak with salt.
Cook steak until it begins to firm and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).
