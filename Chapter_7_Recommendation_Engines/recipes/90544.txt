Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup pepper sauce (such as Frank's Red HotÂ®)
1 cup Ranch-style salad dressing
2 cups diced cooked chicken
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, stir together the cream cheese and hot pepper sauce until well blended. Mix in the Ranch dressing, chicken and Cheddar cheese. Spread into a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. If oil collects on the top, dab it off using a paper towel. Serve with tortilla chips.

Description: 
This tastes just like hot chicken wings, but without the mess.  It is very addicting, and is perfect for football and tailgating season. Serve with tortilla chips. I take this whenever I have to bring a dish and am always asked for the recipe.
