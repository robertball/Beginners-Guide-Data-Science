Ingredients:
5 quarts ice water
6 ounces salt
3 ounces Prague powder number 1
3 ounces white sugar
2 tablespoons pickling spice
25 pounds beef brisket

Directions:
In a large plastic bucket or tub, mix together the ice water, salt, Prague powder, sugar and pickling spice. Submerge meat in the mixture, and refrigerate for 3 to 4 days. A weight may be placed on top of the meat to keep it submerged.
Cook corned beef as you normally would. Simmer or roast for about 50 minutes per pound, or until tender.

Description: 
This recipe is for 25 pounds of beef, but can scaled down. Prague powder number 1 is a commercial curing product that can be found at sausage supply shops. You may want to reduce the amount of salt, as this amount was used as a preservative.
