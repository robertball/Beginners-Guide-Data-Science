Ingredients:
1 cup panko (Japanese bread crumbs)
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®)
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon soy sauce
1 pound fresh crabmeat, well drained
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup panko (Japanese bread crumbs)
2 tablespoons butter
6 cups arugula leaves
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®)
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Mix 1 cup panko, egg, 2 tablespoons mayonnaise, sesame seeds, 1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce, ginger, sesame oil, and soy sauce together in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Fold crabmeat into the panko mixture. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 hour.
Spread 1/4 cup panko onto a plate. Shape crab mixture into 6 small, thick patties; press into the panko to coat.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook crab cakes in the melted butter until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.
Put 1 cup arugula on each of 6 plates. Top each pile of arugula with a crab cake.
Whisk 2 tablespoons mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce, rice vinegar, and lemon juice together in a bowl until smooth; drizzle over arugula and crab cakes.

Description: 
Crab cakes with an Asian twist. Delicious served on arugula or your favorite greens. Warm cakes will wilt greens. Drizzle with sauce and a pinch of salt. Sprinkle with sesame seeds for garnish. Another option would be to make these as bite-size cakes and serve as an appetizer.
