Description: 
Chicken and veggies in a creamy sauce. I created this as an alternative to using canned cream soups. I had a tube of Pillsbury® crescent roll dough, so I used that as a crust. It was okay, but I will use a regular pie crust (store-bought or scratch) the next time. My husband loved the chicken/veggie filling; it's a keeper.
