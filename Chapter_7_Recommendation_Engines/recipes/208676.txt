Ingredients:
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano leaves, crushed
12 ounces beef chuck or top round, sliced thin
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and thinly sliced
1 cup green beans, cooked and thinly sliced
2 ripe Chilean Hass avocados
1 teaspoon merken (see note) or cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 hamburger buns

Directions:
In medium bowl or deep plate, combine garlic, olive oil, paprika, cumin and oregano. Add beef slices and marinate. Set aside for 30 minutes. (Refrigerate if marinating longer.)
In large skillet or on griddle over high heat, cook beef slices until just done. Cut avocados in half, remove the pit and peel. Mash with Merken and salt in a small bowl.
Toast the hamburger buns, then spread with avocado mixture. Top with beef slices, green beans and a few slices of the pepper. Cover with top of bun and serve at once.

Description: 
This favorite Chilean sandwich from Chef Ruth Van Waerebeek is indeed a meal in a bun. You get meat, vegetables and fruit, all seasoned with traditional herbs and spices and spiked with jalapeno peppers. Another Chilean favorite is The Churrasco o Lomito - thin slices of marinated, sauteed beef or pork loin (lomito), topped with sliced tomatoes, avocado spread and mayonnaise. You can find thin sliced chuck or top round for this sandwich in most meat cases, or have the butcher slice it for you.
