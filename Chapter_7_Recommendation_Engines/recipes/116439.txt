Ingredients:
28 uncooked jumbo pasta shells
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 garlic clove, minced
2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1 (28 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes, well drained
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano, divided
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
2 eggs, lightly beaten
3 cups small curd cottage cheese
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt

Directions:
Cook pasta shells according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a skillet, cook the beef, onion and garlic over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the tomato sauce, tomatoes, 1/2 teaspoon oregano and basil. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 10-15 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine the eggs, cottage cheese, spinach, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, seasoned salt and remaining oregano. Drain pasta shells; cool slightly. Stuff with cheese mixture.
Spread 1 cup of meat sauce into each of two greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dishes; arrange shells over sauce in a single layer. Pour remaining meat sauce over the shells. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 40-50 minutes or until a thermometer reads 160 degrees F.
