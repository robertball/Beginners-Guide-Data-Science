Ingredients:
Ingredients
2 pounds ground veal
2 sticks string cheese
1/2 cup plain panko-style bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon basil
1/2 teaspoon cilantro
1/8 teaspoon paprika
1 cup ketchup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
In a large bowl, mix all ingredients except the cheese and ketchup, preferably by hand. Transfer to a 8x8 inch pan and form into a loaf shape. Press the string cheese into the loaf and reform the loaf so the cheese is completely covered.
Cover the pan with tin foil and bake for 50 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove the foil and top the loaf with the ketchup. Cook another 15 minutes uncovered, or to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let sit 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Decided to shake up an old classic and see what my wife thought. Now she won't let me make meatloaf any other way. If you're not into mixing meat and dairy, leave the cheese out.
