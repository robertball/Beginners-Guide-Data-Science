Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups brown rice flour
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup pecans, coarsely chopped
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon lemon zest
2 green tea bags (such as Organoâ„¢ Gold)
1 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup agave syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix brown rice flour, brown sugar, pecans, baking soda, and lemon zest together in a mixing bowl. Cut open tea bags and add contents to the bowl. Add butter, agave syrup, and vanilla extract. Blend with a fork until dough comes together.
Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place on a baking stone.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 11 to 13 minutes. Cool for 1 minute before transferring to a cooling rack. Gently press any broken cookies back together. Let cool. Repeat with remaining cookie dough.
