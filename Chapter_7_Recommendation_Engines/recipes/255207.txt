Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups flaxseed meal
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 eggs
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups oat flour
1 (3.5 ounce) package non-instant mocha chocolate pudding mix (such as Dr. OetkerÂ®)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup dark chocolate chips, or more to taste
1/3 cup hemp seed nuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 345 degrees F (174 degrees C).
Combine flaxseed meal, butter, eggs, brown sugar, white sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Stir in oat flour, pudding mix, and baking soda gradually. Fold chocolate chips and hemp seed nuts into the dough.
Scoop dough onto ungreased baking sheets with a cookie scoop.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 11 to 13 minutes. Flatten with a fork if desired.

Description: 
The hemp seed nuts need to be cooked under 350 degrees F or you will destroy the beneficial Omega fats in them. They are a healthy nut alternative for people who are allergic to nuts/peanuts. The dark chocolate paired with the mocha flavor pudding is very tasty. You can really use any flavor pudding. I have used chocolate, mocha, vanilla, and coconut, all with great results.
