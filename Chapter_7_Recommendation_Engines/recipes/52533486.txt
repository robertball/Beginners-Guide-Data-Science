Ingredients:
1 Tbs. olive oil
1 Tbs. red wine vinegar
1 Tbs. lemon juice
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
Dash cayenne
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 small zucchini, julienned
2 medium small yellow squash, julienned
1 large onion, sliced

1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips
1 (8.75 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
Serve in warmed 8 inch flour tortillas.

Directions:
In a large bowl combine marinade ingredients.  To the marinade add the zucchini, yellow squash, onion, green pepper and red pepper.  Marinate vegetables in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, but not more than 24 hours.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Drain the vegetables and saute until tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Turn heat to high to brown the vegetables. Reduce heat to medium. Stir in the corn and beans. Heat through and serve in warm tortillas.
