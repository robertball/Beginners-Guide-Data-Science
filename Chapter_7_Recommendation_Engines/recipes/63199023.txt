Ingredients:
1/2  lb. of ground beef or 1 lb.- if you prefer more beef (I like to stretch my dollar)
3 Tbsp. canola oil
4 Tbsp. of all-purpose flour
8 cups of chicken broth
1 can of diced tomatoes blended
1 tsp. onion powder
1 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp. cumin
1 tsp. garlic salt
3-4 chopped green chiles (Hatches) I use Pueblo chiles grown right here in Pueblo. (See notes for other kinds of chile.)

Directions:
Brown the ground beef in a large pot. Drain grease.
Move meat to one side. Add 3 T. of canola oil.
Whisk flour in the oil. Make a roux or paste with the flour and oil. Slowly add chicken stock whisking while you add the stock. This is eliminate lumps of flour in your chili.
Add blended tomatoes and seasonings. Bring to a boil.
Then, turn down to simmer.  Let your chili simmer for 20-30 min.
****You can substitute 4 oz. can of hot green chiles  for the 3-4 chopped green chiles.
