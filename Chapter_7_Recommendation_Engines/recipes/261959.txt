Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 large onion, diced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/4 pounds ground turkey
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
2 (28 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
1 cup dry white wine
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried basil
2 tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and a pinch of salt; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add turkey; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook for 2 minutes. Add red pepper flakes.
Stir tomatoes, white wine, tomato paste, oregano, and basil into the pot. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the raw wine flavor cooks off, about 1 hour. Stir in sugar to reduce acidity. Season with salt and pepper. Puree sauce with an immersion blender for a less chunky sauce.
