Ingredients:
4 or 5 chicken thighs
1 yellow onion
4 whole cloves
1 package (9oz) frozen chopped spinach
3 cans (10.5 oz)condensed chicken rice soup
1 cube chicken bullion

Directions:
1. Rinse chicken thighs and place them in a stock pot. Add cold water to cover the chicken.
2. Peel and quarter the onion and add to the pot, along with the cloves. Salt and pepper to taste.
3. Bring to a boil, then reduce to lowest heat and simmer for 60 to 90 minutes. (Spoon scum off top occasionally. Add a little water to keep chicken covered as needed.)
4. Remove the chicken thighs from the stock, and set them aside to cool. Remove and discard the onion and cloves. Do not discard the liquid in the pot, as that is your base stock for the soup.
7. Use a gravy separator (or spoon off) to remove the fat from the top of the stock, and pour the stock into a clean stock pot.
8. Unwrap the package of spinach and place the frozen block into the hot stock. Add the cans of chicken rice soup, plus 3 cans of water and the chicken bullion cube.
9. Pull the chicken meat off the thighs, shredding off pieces by hand and adding them to the soup.
10. Bring to a boil, stirring as the spinach thaws. Serve piping hot.

Description: 
A delicious spin on Italian Wedding Soup, replacing the meatballs with tender strands of chicken. My family loves it, even the picky eaters. My daughter called me from college her first semester to make sure I was making this soup on her first weekend visit back home.
