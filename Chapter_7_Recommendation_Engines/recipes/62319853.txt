Ingredients:
Filling:
4 shredded chicken breasts -- I flatten breasts, sprinkle with rotisserie seasoning and fresh thyme, then wrap in foil and bake at 375 degrees for about 20 minutes, then cool and shred.
1 1-lb. box Velveeta cheese made with 2% milk
1-2 chopped chiptoles in adobo
1 can Rotel tomatoes
smoked paprika to taste
Sour cream sauce:
1 cup fat free sour cream
1 cup unsalted chicken broth
2 teaspoons cornstarch
4 teaspoons water
12-14 corn tortillas
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Melt cheese and Rotel in microwave for about 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add chiptoles and chicken, mix well. Add paprika to taste and salt and pepper, if you choose.
Combine sour cream and broth in a saucepan and heat through. Add slurry made from cornstarch and water, stirring until slightly thickened. Remove from heat.
Microwave corn tortillas, wrapped in a clean kitchen towel, for about one minute, until softened.
Fill tortillas with about 2 tablespoons of mixture, roll and place seam side down in a casserole dish. Top with shredded cheddar cheese (about a cup) and the sour cream sauce. I add pickled jalapeno slices and smoked paprika to the top for garnish. Bake at 375 degrees until hot and bubbly.

Description: 
The filling for these is made with that old standby Velveeta, kicked up with chiptole chilies and plenty of shredded chicken. Topped with a sour cream sauce, it's even better the second day.Modified from: Jose's Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas
