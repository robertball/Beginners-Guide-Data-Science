Ingredients:
1 pound skirt steak (can sub flank steak or boneless, skinless chicken breasts)
Salt and pepper to taste
Approx. 1 T. granulated garlic
6 oz. papaya nectar
6 oz. soy sauce
2 T. olive oil
2 green peppers, sliced
1 - 2 large onions, sliced
1 T. chili powder
1 tsp. paprika
For garnish:
8 Flour tortillas
Sour cream
Shredded cheese
1 tsp. salt
Ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Score skirt steak lightly and season with salt, pepper, and granulated garlic. Place in large ziploc plastic bag. Combine papaya nectar and soy sauce and pour into bag with meat. Marinade in refrigerator at least 4 hours but preferably overnight, turning bag occasionally.
To prepare, preheat broiler. Take meat out of refrigerator and place on broiler pan while oven preheats.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large saute pan. When hot, add the sliced green peppers and onions and season with the chili powder, paprika, salt and pepper. Saute until golden brown.
Broil meat 1 - 2" from heat source for approx. 7 minutes per side and set aside to cool while vegetables cook. (Even better is to grill the meat if possible).
Cut the meat across the grain into thin strips. Serve with the sauteed vegetables, sour cream, cheddar cheese and tortillas.
