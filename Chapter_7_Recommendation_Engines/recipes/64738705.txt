Check for salt
Heat oil or shortening in medium frying pan over medium heat until shimmering, about 2 minutes. Add onion, garlic, and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft and just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. then add all the other seasoning and stir 1 minute
Add 1 can of the whole beans and mash almost COMPLETELY  with the back of a spoon or a potato masher but leave a few chunks. Add a can of the refried beans and mix,, stirring beans to whatever strikes your personal texture fancy.
Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until the bean starches begin to coat the bottom of the pan and turn golden brown, about 3 minutes. Add water or bean-cooking liquid, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan to incorporate the water and heat the beans through, about 2 minutes. (The beans may initially look soupy, but theyâ€™ll thicken as they cool, so be sure to add all of the water or bean-cooking liquid.)
