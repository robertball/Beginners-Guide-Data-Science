Ingredients:
1 cup butter
3/4 cup onion, minced
1-1/2 cups celery, stalks and leaves chopped
9 cups bread, cubed
1/2 tsp salt
1- 1/2 tsp thyme
1/2 tsp ground sage
1/2 tsp black pepper

Directions:
In large skillet, melt butter and saute onion and celery until onion is tender.
Stir in about 1/3 of the bread cubes.  Turn into a deep bowl.  Add remaining ingredients and toss.
Stuff turkey just before roasting.  Makes 9 cups (enough for a 5-6 kg turkey).  Be sure to put the turkey in the over immediately after stuffing the turkey.
If you are not stuffing a turkey (or all of the stuffing doesn't fit in the turkey), put the stuffing in an ovenproof dish and bake for 30-45 minutes (covered).  Add some chicken broth if stuffing is dry.
