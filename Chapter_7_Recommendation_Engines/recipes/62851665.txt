Description: 
This is a homemade recipe from Ed's dad.  Whenever I make these for someone, they fall in love with it and always request I make more.  It fills your home with a wonderful smell and is the best way to have cheap chops go so tender they fall right off the bone. Serve with hot sauce and mashed potatoes. I don't use hot sauce, husband can't tolerate spice anymore. You also can serve over rice and add a green salad..complete meal done without a lot of clean-up, ENJOY!!Modified from: Ed Zieba's Famous Family Pork Chops
