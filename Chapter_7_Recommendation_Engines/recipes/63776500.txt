Ingredients:
2 Cups Flour
1/2 Cup Sugar
1 tsp. Salt
3/4 C Shortening
1/2 Cup Cold Water

Directions:
Starting with the flour in a medium bowl, add sugar and salt.  Add shortening, mixing with fingers to the consistency of course meal.  Slowly add cold water, mixing until flour mixture comes away from sides of bowl and forms a ball.  Turn out onto floured board and knead a few times.  With floured rolling  pin, roll out to a rectangle and cut into 1 inch wide strips. Picking them up with the help of a spatula, arrange in a 13x9 greased pan in layers with your fruit filling, ending with strips of dough on top.  Bake your cobbler at 350 degrees close to 1 hr.  I sprinkle extra sugar and cinnamon on top. This may not be the prettiest, but it is down home good!

Description: 
Mr. & Mrs. Johnson had a small BBQ place and always had peach and cherry cobbler.  Their cobbler was to die for and she shared the dough part with me. I never use anything else.
