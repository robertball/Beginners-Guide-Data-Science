Ingredients:
1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 pounds zucchini, thinly sliced
1 cup shredded carrots
1 cup chopped mushrooms
1 3/4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 1/4 cups ricotta cheese
2/3 cup half-and-half
4 eggs, beaten
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Fit pie crust into a pie dish and prick the bottom of the crust with a fork. Bake in the preheated oven for 7 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until crust is golden, 8 to 10 more minutes.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir zucchini, carrots, and mushrooms until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes; drain. Place half the zucchini mixture in the crust. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.
Combine ricotta cheese, half-and-half, eggs, salt, oregano, basil, garlic powder, and pepper in a large bowl. Pour ricotta mixture into crust, top with remaining zucchini mixture and sprinkle with paprika.
Bake quiche in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
