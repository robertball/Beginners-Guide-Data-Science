Ingredients:
1.5 pounds lean ground beef
8 ounces Gluten Free macaroni, I use Barilla
1/2 cup chopped onion
1.5 Cups Gluten Free tomato soup, I use Pacific Organic Creamy Tomato
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (1.25 ounce) package Gluten Free taco seasoning mix, I use McCormacks
2 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
2 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 cup crushed Gluten Free tortilla chips
1/2 cup sour cream (optional)
1/2 cup Diced Green Onions (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large skillet, cook and stir ground beef over medium heat until brown and drain.   Mix in tomato soup, canned diced tomatoes, chopped onion and taco seasoning mix. Stir in uncooked pasta.
Spoon beef mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle crumbled taco chips and grated cheese on top.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the pasta is cooked. Serve with chopped green onions and sour cream, if desired.
