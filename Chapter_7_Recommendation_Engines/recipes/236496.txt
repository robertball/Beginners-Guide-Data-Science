Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
5 skinless chicken pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 large onion, cut into small cubes
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
3 cups white rice
2 cups water
1 (12 fluid ounce) can beer
1 carrot, cut into small cubes
1 cup green peas

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a heavy pot with a lid over medium heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper; cook in hot oil until just browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove chicken to a platter, reserving drippings in the pot.
Saute onion and garlic in the retained drippings until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir cilantro into the onion mixture; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir mixture for 2 minutes more.
Return chicken to the pot; add rice, water, beer, carrot, and peas. Place lid on the pot, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the rice absorbs the liquid completely and is tender, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is an original Peruvian recipe for cilantro rice with veggies and chicken. I really like to eat this with avocado seasoned with lime and salt, or with onions seasoned with lime, salt, and pepper. Delicious!
