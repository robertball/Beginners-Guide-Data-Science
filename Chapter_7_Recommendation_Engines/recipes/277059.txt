Ingredients:
2 cups flaked coconut
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
2 pinches ground cardamom
2 drops vanilla extract
2 tablespoons semolina flour (optional)
1/2 cup flaked coconut, or more as needed

Directions:
Place 2 cups coconut into a pan and heat over low heat until lightly toasted, making sure not to burn or change color, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
Bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat. Place condensed milk can in the middle of the boiling water; boil for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove using tongs; let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Pour into coconut and add cardamom and vanilla extract. Mix well. Let cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes.
Form mixture into small balls using oiled hands, as mixture will be very sticky, adding semolina as needed if very wet and runny.
Place remaining coconut into a shallow bowl or on a plate. Roll ladoos in coconut and serve.
