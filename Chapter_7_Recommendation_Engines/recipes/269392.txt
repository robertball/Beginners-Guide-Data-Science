Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large oranges, zested
1 cup finely chopped dried cranberries
1/2 cup finely chopped dried apricots

Directions:
Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg in a bowl; mix together.
Cream butter in a large bowl using an electric blender until fluffy and lightened in color slightly. Add sugar and cream on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, several more minutes. Mix in vanilla and orange zest. Add flour mixture in 3 batches and mix until just combined, kneading the last addition by hand. Knead in cranberries and apricots.
Divide dough in half and roll out into two 1 1/2x7-inch long logs. Wrap each log in parchment paper and refrigerate until dough is chilled, at least 4 hours.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Remove dough from the refrigerator and cut each log into about 16 slices that are 1/3-inch thick. Place slices 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies just begin to turn slightly golden on bottom, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.

Description: 
I was searching to make the perfect citrus-y cranberry shortbread cookie, but it always felt like something was missing. So on a final attempt, when I didn't have enough dried cranberries to make a full recipe, I threw in some dried apricots and bam! That was it! They add the perfect backdrop flavor to these shortbread cookies!
