Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 red onion, chopped
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch kale, stems removed and chopped
1 teaspoon tamari sauce
1 cup grated Romano cheese
1/4 cup whole wheat bread crumbs (optional)
6 eggs, beaten well
1 bunch fresh oregano, chopped
1 pinch sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 teaspoons olive oil
5 pickled picante peppers (such as Trader Joe's Peri Peri PeppadropsÂ®), chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat in large heavy skillet. Add red onion; cook and stir 3 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir 2 minutes. Add kale and continue to stir until kale is wilted, about 5 minutes. Place kale mixture in a large bowl.
Gently toss kale with tamari sauce, Romano cheese, whole wheat bread crumbs, eggs, oregano, sea salt, and black pepper until well combined.
Lightly coat an 8x8-inch baking pan with 2 teaspoons olive oil; pour in egg and kale mixture. Distribute chopped pickled picante peppers on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are well set and the top is lightly browned,  20 to 25 minutes. Cut into squares to serve.
