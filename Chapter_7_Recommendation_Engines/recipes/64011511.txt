Ingredients:
4 cups diced onion
2 cups diced celery
2 cups diced carrots
1/2 to 3/4 head of green cabbage, shredded
4 14.5 oz cans petite diced tomatoes
1 15 oz can whole kernel corn, drained
1 15 oz can Lima beans rinsed and drained
2 bay leaves
2 pounds browned ground beef, stew meat, or leftover roast.  (Stew meat will take the longest)
2-4 32 oz cartons chicken or vegetable stock as needed
2 lb red potatoes peeled and diced
**Any other vegetables as desired.
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large stock pot, combine all ingredients except potatoes.  Bring to a boil then reduce heat to simmer and cook until vegetables are just tender.  (If using stew meat, cooking it down takes a while.  Ground beef is quick)
Add potatoes, season with salt and pepper and continue to cook over fairly low heat until potatoes are done and meat is tender.
If soup is too thick, add water to reach the desired consistency.

Description: 
This is your basic, old fashioned vegetable beef soup like my grandmother always made.  It can have as few or as many vegetables as you like and all veggie with no meat is excellent as well.  Just make sure to get the onion, celery, and tomatoes in because that is the flavor base that is the key.
