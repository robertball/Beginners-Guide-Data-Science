Ingredients:
1 pkg yeast
1/4 c cracked wheat or bulgar
3/4 c warm (but not hot) water
2 tbsp olive oil
1-3/4 c whole wheat flour

Directions:
Mix yeast with water until thoroughly blended.
Add olive oil; mix well.
Add cracked wheat (we like the crunch it adds to the dough - if you don't then let the cracked wheat soak covered with approximately 1/8 c boiling water to soften before combining with the rest of the ingredients).
Add flour and mix till blended.
Turn out onto floured rolling surface and knead for about 5 minutes till dough is not sticky, but is elastic.
Shape or roll, add flour as needed, into pizza crust.
Place on heated pizza stone or pan. (Use no-stick spry if using a pan).
Brush top with 1/2-3/4 can tomato paste.  Sprinkle with 2 tbsp olive oil (opt).
Top with selected toppings of choice.
Bake 450 degrees for 15 minutes until done.

Description: 
Keep these ingredients on hand for when you have a spontaneous craving for Pizza for Dinner.  Turns out every time.  I like to bake this pizza on an oven stone (pizza size)for perfect even done-ness.
