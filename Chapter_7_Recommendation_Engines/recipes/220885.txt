Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 1/4 cups Champagne or other sparkling white wine at room temperature
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1/2 cup butter, softened
4 cups confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup Champagne or other sparkling white wine at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spray 24 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Mix cake mix and 1 1/4 cup Champagne in a large mixing bowl; stir in vegetable oil and eggs. Beat batter with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes.
Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them 3/4 full.
Bake cupcakes in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
Cool cupcakes in pans for 10 minutes before removing to finish cooling, about 30 more minutes.
Mix butter, 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup Champagne, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Stir in remaining confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, until frosting is smooth and creamy. Spread on cooled cupcakes.
