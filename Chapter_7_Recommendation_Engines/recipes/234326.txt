Description: 
A healthy and flavorful fresh juice to help you load up on those servings of veggies that may otherwise be difficult to consume. Add some ginger for a little kick. It's better if they're all chilled before juicing or shake the juice in a cocktail shaker with some ice just to chill, then strain the ice out before drinking.
