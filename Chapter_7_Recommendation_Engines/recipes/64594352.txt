Ingredients:
1 lb. lean ground beef
1 envelope dry beefy onion soup mix
1 cup water
3 T. tomato paste
1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp. dried parsley
1/2 tsp. pepper
1/4 tsp. dried thyme
Various vegetables to your liking...I usually use and layer in this order...
1-2 cups chopped cooked carrots
16 oz. frozen corn
12 oz. package petite green beans, steamed in the bag, then rough chopped
3 c. (or so!) leftover mashed potatoes
8oz. shredded cheddar cheese, divided
Parsley and cracked black paper

Directions:
Brown ground beef in skillet and drain fat.  Sprinkle dry soup mix and add water and tomato paste.  Stir well and add Worcestershire, parsley pepper and thyme.  Simmer about 10 minutes until hot.
If possible, have all of the vegetables heated through before assembling casserole.  In a 2 1/2 qt. casserole layer ingredients, beginning with beef mixture, then carrots, then corn, then green beans.
Mix heated mashed potatoes with 1/2 cup of the shredded cheddar.  Gently spread over top of casserole.  Sprinkle remaining cheese on top.  Sprinkle with parsley and coarse black pepper.  Bake covered at 375 for 30 minutes, remove cover and bake 10-15 minutes more, or until cheese is lightly brown and center internal temperature  measures at least 165 degrees.
Yummy alternative... add 3/4 cup steamed white rice to beef mixture.

Fantastic use of leftover mashed potatoes and carrots from a pot roast dinner...that's usually when I make it!
