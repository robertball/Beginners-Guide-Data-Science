Ingredients:
1 chicken breast (frozen or fresh)
1 cup broccoli florets (about 1/4 crown)
1/2 cup sliced button mushrooms (about 4)
1 Tbsp. light soy sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Line a baking dish with parchment paper.  Place chicken in dish and add enough water for the bottom of the pan to be barely covered (you could also drizzle the chicken with oil or place pats of butter on it; this is just how I do it).
Bake chicken for twenty minutes, or until almost cooked through.  If it is completely cooked it will most likely end up overdone after it is stir fried.
Place broccoli in a small frying pan, cover with 1 tsp. soy sauce and place over heat.  While the pan in heating, cut chicken into bite sized pieces on a plastic cutting board.  Stir fry broccoli until it is just turning bright green.
Add mushrooms to pan with second tsp. soy sauce, and stir fry until they begin to shrivel.
Add chicken with rest of say sauce.  Cook for 1-2 minutes or until cooked through.
Remove pan from heat and dump everything into a bowl or onto a plate.  Let cool slightly be digging in with a pair of chopsticks.

Description: 
I usually eat this for dinner when I'm only cooking for myself.  It is quick, yummy, and couldn't be much healthier.  I bake my chicken and then stir fry it for only a minute or two because it gives me twenty free minutes, but you can cook it any way you like.
