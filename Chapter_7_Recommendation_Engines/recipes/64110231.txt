Ingredients:
1 cup butter flavored shortening
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
1 tablespoon real pure vanilla
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup semi-sweet Ghirardelli chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lay out cookie sheets with a sheet of parchment paper.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter flavored shortening, brown sugar and white sugar in a mixer. Mixture will form soft peaks and lighten in color, it is impossible to overmix at this step. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well with each addition, then add in the vanilla .In a seperate bowl combine the flour, baking soda and salt; gradually stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, mix in the chocolate chips until just mixed, do not overmix. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. If freezing skip next step until ready to bake.
Bake for 10 minutes (11 minutes if frozen) in the preheated oven, until the edges start to tan. Cookies will continue to bake once out of oven for an additional 2 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes.
To store raw cookie dough scoop onto wax paper and put in a plastic freezer bag to enjoy whenever you wish.
