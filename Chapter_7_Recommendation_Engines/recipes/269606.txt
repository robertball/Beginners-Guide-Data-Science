Ingredients:
3/4 stick unsalted butter
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh ginger
5 cloves garlic, minced
7 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 1/2 pounds carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 cup dry white wine
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste
1/8 teaspoon curry powder
1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives, or to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, ginger, and garlic; saute until softened, 15 to 20 minutes. Add broth, carrots, and wine. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, until carrots are tender, about 45 minutes.
Puree with an immersion blender until carrots are no longer chunky and soup has a thick consistency. Add lemon juice, salt, pepper, and curry powder. Serve in large mugs with chives and fresh black pepper.
