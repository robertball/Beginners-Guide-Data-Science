Ingredients:
29 ounces canned sliced peaches
1/8 cup white sugar
1/8 cup brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/8 cup white sugar
1/8 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces
1/8 cup boiling water
MIX TOGETHER:
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a 1 quart baking dish, combine peaches, 1/8 cup white sugar, 1/8 cup brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Toss to coat evenly. Set aside.
Meanwhile, in a med bowl, combine flour, 1/8 cup white sugar, 1/8 cup brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. Blend in butter with your fingertips, or a pastry blender, until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in water until just combined.
Stir peach mixture and then drop flour mixture by spoonfuls over the peaches. Sprinkle entire cobbler with the sugar and cinnamon mixture. Bake until topping is golden, about 30-45 minutes.  Tent the top lightly with foil if it is darkening too quickly.
