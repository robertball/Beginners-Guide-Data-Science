Ingredients:
1 (14.75 ounce) can creamed corn
3/4 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
1/2 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup white sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 dash ground black pepper
1/4 cup oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Combine creamed corn, flour, milk, egg, sugar, salt, 2 teaspoons oil, baking powder, vanilla extract, and pepper in a bowl to create a thick batter. Add more flour to the mixture if it seems too thin.
Heat oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat.
Test the readiness of the oil by dropping a small drop of batter into the oil; it should immediately start to bubble and cook, indicating that the oil is hot enough. Carefully drop tablespoons of batter into the hot oil. Cook no more than 4 fritters at a time to avoid cooling the oil, which causes the fritters to absorb more oil than necessary.
Cook fritters in the hot oil for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Turn over and cook until both sides are golden brown, about 1 minute more. Lift from the oil and place on a paper towel to drain. Continue with remaining batter.

Description: 
These wonderful corn fritters came down from my great-grandmother. They can be served with maple syrup for breakfast, or as a side dish with jambalaya, chili, or a Mexican dinner.
