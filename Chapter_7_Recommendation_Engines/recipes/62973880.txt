Ingredients:
10 large marshmallows
2 cups of chocolate chips (I suggest semisweet)
10 mini candy canes
sprinkles

Directions:
1. Pour chocolate chips into microwavable bowl and heat for 30 seconds. Stir and heat 30 more seconds, then stir again. Continue this routine.
2. Put toothpick in each marshmallow. Dip in heated chocolate and place on waxed paper. Sprinkles go on the heated chocolate or you can put them on after you freeze the marshmallows. Freeze marshmallows. Let them sit a few minutes out in room temperature, take out toothpick and insert candy cane in its place, and enjoy your hard-earned dessert!
