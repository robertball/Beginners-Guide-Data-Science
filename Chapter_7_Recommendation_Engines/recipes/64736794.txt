Ingredients:
5 -6 Whole Medium Sweet Potatoes, microwaved or baked with skins on.
1/4 c. Caramelized Onions
1 T. Roasted Garlic
1 T. Coconut Oil
1 T. Ginger Pulp (not candied or sugared)
1 T. Creme Fraîche
1/8 tsp each:
Curry Powder
Turmeric Powder
Black or White Pepper, ground

Directions:
***See notes below on preparation tips***
Peel sweet potatoes.
In a medium bowl:
Mash the cooked sweet potatoes.
Chop and mix together the garlic and onions, and stir them into the potatoes.
Add the creme fraîche, ginger pulp, curry, turmeric and pepper to the mixture.
Stir all until they are well combined.
--Reheating--
Cold sweet potatoes can be reheated in the microwave for 10 minutes or in the oven at 350°F for 30 minutes, each method in a covered glass dish with glass lid
***Sweet potatoes can be baked ahead of time in a 400°F oven for about 35-45 minutes on the center rack.
I prefer to use the microwave, 3 sweet potatoes at a time, piercing each with a fork. Microwave on high for 5 to 6 minutes or until tender but not overdone.  2 batches is enough and saves time.
***Substitutions***
Milk can be substituted for the creme fraîche, and olive oil or butter can be substituted for coconut oil.  This will also result in a wetter mixture, so be mindful as you add liquids a bit at a time to control the texture you wish to create.
If using other forms of onion and garlic, the taste will be sharper if raw.  If caramelized onions and roasted garlic are not available, add chopped onions and garlic to a skillet with 2 T unsalted butter plus 1 tsp. olive oil. Sauté 10 - 15 minutes on very low heat until soft, clear but not toasted. Add everything in the skillet, including the oil, into the potatoes.
Ginger pulp can be purchased in pulp form in a squeezable tube at some places, or you can just peel it with the side of a teaspoon and grate it on a cheese grater.

Description: 
Sweet potatoes get spiced up! These potatoes are absolutely wonderful with added ginger, roasted garlic, caramelized onions, coconut oil, and a dash of turmeric and curry. No suger or salt is needed for these wonderful root vegetables! Creme fraîche adds a creamy texture and offsets the textures of the onions and garlic in this mixture. I have never had this dish anywhere but at home as my own creation because I am always looking for ways to incorporate ginger, curry and turmeric into my diet. I love all of the ingredients!
