Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup original oats
1/4 cup grounded flax seed
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup blueberries, frozen
1/2 cup applesauce
1 cup milk
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
1 egg
1 tsp maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350*F. Lightly grease a muffin tin. If using cupcake liners lightly oil that or they will really stick and you will lose half of the muffin.
In a large bowl all the dry ingredients and stir until well combined, add the blueberries and mix again. In another bowl add all the liquid ingredients and mix well. Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry bowl and mix. Be sure to scrape the sides so there are no flour bubbles.
Fill the muffin pan about 3/4 full and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted in the center.
