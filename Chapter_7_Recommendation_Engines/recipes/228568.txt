Description: 
Lots of different red sauce recipes out there; this one is superb. Been in the family for over 50 years. If you call your red sauce gravy, you gotta try this! Never understood why my grandpa does, but he is insistent. This recipe also freezes well, so feel free. To defrost, the sauce must thaw for about 6 to 8 hours and reheat in a pot.
