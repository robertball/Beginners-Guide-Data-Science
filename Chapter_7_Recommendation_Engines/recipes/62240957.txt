Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all purpose flour
3/4 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. baking powder
1 1/2 Tbsp. sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
3 eggs, seperated
1 3/4 cups buttermilk
4 Tbsp. butter (1/2 stick) melted
1 pint fresh bluberries
Confectioners' sugar
Maple syrup

Directions:
In a bowl, wisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, sugar and salt
In a small bowl, lightly whisk the egg yolks and buttermilk,  Whisk the yolk mixture into the flour mixture until well combined.  The batter will be lumpy.
In another bowl, with an electric mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on high speed until stiff but not dry peaks form, 2 - 3 minutes.  Gently fold the whites into the batter in 2 additions.
Put 1/2 tsp. butter into the well of a filled pancake pan.  Place over medium heat until the butter brgins to bubble.  Pour 1 Tbsp. of batter into each well and cook until the bottoms are golden brown, 3 - 5 minutes.  Put 5-6 blueberries in the center of each pancake then top with 1 Tbsp. of batter.  Using 2 wooden skewers, flip the pancakes over and cook until golden brown about 3 minutes more.
Put on a plate then repeat with rest of batter.
Dust with confectioners sugar and serve with maple syrup.
