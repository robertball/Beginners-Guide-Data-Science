1 (6 ounce) can frozen limeade concentrate
1 cup diet cola flavored carbonated beverage
1 cup orange juice
1 cup water

Description: 
Use cheap diet cola when making this drink.  The sweetener makes the drink taste like it has alcohol in it, but it doesn't.  Of course, you could always add some later!  Delicious either way!
