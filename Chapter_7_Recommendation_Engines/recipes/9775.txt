Ingredients:
1/4 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
3 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 cup lukewarm water
2 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1 cup butter, melted and cooled
2 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup chopped raisins

Directions:
In a large bowl, sprinkle the yeast on the warm water and stir until dissolved.  Stir in the melted butter. Beat in the eggs and sugar until well blended. Gradually mix in flour. Place dough in an airtight container and  refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to  3 days.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together the 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Set aside. Divide dough into 6 equal parts.  Sprinkle the  cinnamon-sugar mixture into a shallow pan.
Roll out dough into a circle on a flat surface to 1/8 inch thickness. Press dough into shallow pan and sprinkle again with cinnamon-sugar mixture.  Cut dough into 8 wedges, as a pie.  Sprinkle raisins on each wedge and roll each wedge, starting from widest to  point, as a crescent roll. Place each roll on cookie sheets, about 2 inches apart. Let crescents stand 15 minutes before baking.
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden.  Let cool on wire racks.
