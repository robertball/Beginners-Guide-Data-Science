Ingredients:
1 cup almond milk
3 eggs
1 cup sorghum flour (such as Bob's Red MillÂ® 'Sweet' White Sorghum Flour)
1 tablespoon melted butter
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Heat a lightly buttered skillet over medium-high heat.
Mix almond milk, eggs, sorghum flour, melted butter, and salt in a blender until the batter is homogenous.
Pour 1/4 cup batter onto the hot pan and swirl quickly to form a thin layer. Cook until there is no liquid on the surface and edges start to lift up from the pan, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook for a few seconds on the other side. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining batter to make about 8 crepes.

Description: 
I love crepes, but I'm gluten free, and I thought I'd never enjoy them again. Good news is, the original crepes are made with buckwheat flour, which is gluten free. I like them but they take overnight preparation, and as a mother of young kids, sometimes I just want to do something quick, so I tried sweet white sorghum flour, and the result was a light batter that holds great, and has soft texture and mild flavor. Excellent to make sweet or savory crepes. Stuff them with ham and cheese, chicken and your favorite sauce, smoked salmon, beef strips, veggies, eggs, or fruit and yogurt. Let your imagination inspire you.
