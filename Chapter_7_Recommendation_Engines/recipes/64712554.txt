Ingredients:
4 slices of dry thick bread, such as Texas Toast
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 cup of milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon cinnamon
pinch of nutmeg (optional)
Parchment paper cut to the size of the fryer basket

Directions:
Cut each slice of bread into thirds to make the sticks.
Line the bottom of the air fryer basket with the parchment paper.
Heat an air fryer to 360 degrees Fahrenheit according to manufacturer's instructions.
In a bowl mix the eggs, milk, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg until well incorporated.
Make sure each piece of bread is well submerged in the mixture. Then remove any excess liquid from each and place the bread in a single layer in the air fryer basket; cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the fryer. Set timer for 10 minutes; turn bread sticks halfway through cooking time.
Serve with you favorite French Toast topping such as powdered sugar, sugar and cinnamon mix or syrup.
