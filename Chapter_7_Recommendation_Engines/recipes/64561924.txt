Ingredients:
1 box yellow cake-mix  (I prefer Duncan Hines but any brand will do)
4 large eggs
1/3 C vegetable oil
1 C. sour cream
1/4 C. white sugar
1/4 C. water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375.
Very generously and thoroughly grease a 10" Bundt pan and then dust the entire interior with flour.
Put all of the ingredients into a large mixing bowl.
Using an electric mixer (not by hand--the mixing is essential) set on medium speed mix for 4 full minutes; scraping the sides of the bowl with a spatula as needed.
Evenly spoon the mixture into the prepared pan.
Bake for 38-42 minutes, or until lightly browned and a tester-toothpick comes out clean.
Cool for 20 minutes on a wire rack.
Invert onto a cooling rack and cool completely.
Transfer to a cake plate to serve.
Dust liberally with powered sugar or ice as desired.
Store loosely covered with foil or a cake-lid.

Description: 
A rich Bundt cake that has the comforting density of a pound cake that starts with a cake-mix.  Fool proof and delicious.
