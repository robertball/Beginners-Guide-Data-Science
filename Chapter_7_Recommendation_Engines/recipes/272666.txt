Ingredients:
2 pounds chicken wing pieces, drumettes and flats
1/2 cup orange marmalade
1/4 cup sweet chili sauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Set a wire rack inside a large foil-lined rimmed baking sheet; arrange chicken wings on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until wings are no longer pink at the bone and the skin is crispy, 45 to 50 minutes.
Mix orange marmalade and chili sauce in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Add cooked wings to marmalade-chili sauce and toss until well coated. Plate wings and pour extra sauce on top.
