Ingredients:
1 small package of pepperoni slices
24 frozen bread rolls, unthawed at room temperature 1 1/2 hours
Favorite cheese:
Traditional: 6 slices of American cheese cut in half
Spicy: 12 slices of hot pepper cheese
Mild: 12 slices of colby jack cheese
Italian: 12 slices of mozerella cheese
2 TBSP butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425
Roll two balls of dethawed dough together and strech out.
Add 10 slices of pepperoni and one slice of your choice of cheese
Fold over and seal edges so that there are no holes and pepperoni and cheese are not poking out
Place at least an inch apart on all sides on a sprayed cookie sheet (you may need to bake these in shifts)
Bake for 10 minutes or until top and bottom are browned
With a pastry brush, brush tops and sides of hot rolls. (You may also just use a stick of butter and rub the rolls down, this is my preferred method)

Description: 
Here in West Virginia (and I'm told Southern PA) we love our pepperoni rolls. These are quick, delectable and buttery rolls that pair well with any soup for an instant meal. I listed a variety of cheeses for you to experiment with so enjoy!
