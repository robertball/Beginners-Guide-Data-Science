Ingredients:
2 pounds breakfast sausage
cooking spray
2 pounds shredded Colby-Jack cheese, divided
12 eggs
1 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Spread a thin layer of Colby-Jack cheese in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Crack eggs on top of the cheese layer and break the yolks but do not stir. Layer crumbled sausage over eggs and top with remaining cheese. Drizzle cream on top.
Cover baking dish and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 1 hour. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite recipes. Great for brunch or special occasions. My mother would prep this on Christmas Eve Day and let it set overnight, then bake it Christmas morning for a simple but decadent dish. This is great for keto or LCHF diets, or you can use turkey breakfast sausage to reduce the fat.
