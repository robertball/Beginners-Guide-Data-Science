Ingredients:
1 egg
2 grape tomatoes, quartered
1 Tbs corn
1 Tbs diced mushrooms
1/2 Tbs chopped cilantro
1/2 Tbs sesame oil
1 tsp soy sauce
1 clove garlic, minced
1 small flour tortilla
Olive oil spray
Sriracha sauce

Directions:
Heat small pan (preferably the same size as tortilla) over medium high heat. You want to heat it until it is lightly smoking
In a small glass bowl beat egg until well blended
Add sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic and mix
Add tomatoes, corn, mushrooms and cilantro and mix
Place one tortilla close to your pan.
Lightly spray hot pan with olive oil.
Add egg mixture to hot pan and immediately place tortilla on top of it. Lightly press tortilla to evenly disperse egg mixture.
Turn stove down to medium low and allow egg to cook and attach to tortilla. About 1 minute.
Flip egg and tortilla over with a spatula (so that tortilla is on bottom of pan and egg up). Turn stove up to medium heat and allow tortilla to brown and lightly crisp. About 1 minute.
Remove from pan and put on plate. Add sriracha sauce (to your liking) and allow to cool for up to 1 minute. Fold in 1/2 like a taco and eat!

This is SO GOOD, incredibly easy and very quick to make. One of our family favorite's hands down. Eggs with an asian influence creates a very savory and satisfying meal.
