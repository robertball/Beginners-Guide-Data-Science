2 tablespoons wasabi paste, or to taste
1 cup toasted sesame seeds, divided

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, soy sauce, water chestnuts, shrimp, and 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds. Gradually stir in wasabi paste until you reach the desired amount of spice. Cover and refrigerate for one hour.
