Ingredients:
6 medium sweet potatoes
1/2 cup olive or vegetable oil
1/4 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon cider or white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon finely chopped onion
1 1/2 teaspoons poppy seeds
1 teaspoon grated orange peel
1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel
2 medium tart apples, chopped
2 green onions, thinly sliced

Directions:
In a large saucepan, cook sweet potatoes in boiling salted water until just tender, about 20 minutes. Cool completely.
Meanwhile, in a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the next nine ingredients; shake well. Peel potatoes; cut each in half lengthwise, then into 1/2-in. slices. In a 4-qt. bowl, layer a fourth of the sweet potatoes, apples and onions; drizzle with a fourth of the salad dressing. Repeat layers three times. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours. Toss before serving.

Description: 
Pairing a seasonal fruit and vegetable makes for a very pretty and unusual salad to accompany a turkey dinner. The poppy seed dressing has a citrus tang and really brings out the flavor. If you're looking for a different side dish, give it a try!
