Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2 large red onions, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced
1 red or green bell pepper, cut into thin strips
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 beef flank steak, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
4 7- to 8-inch flour tortillas, warmed
1 15-ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained, warmed

Directions:
1. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 7 minutes. Add the bell pepper strips, sage, and oregano. Stirring constantly, cook, uncovered, over medium-high heat for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are golden and the peppers are crisp-tender.
2. Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Trim fat from the steak; score on both sides by making shallow cuts at 1-inch intervals in a diamond pattern. Rub with salt and black pepper. Grill 8 to 12 minutes for medium rare or 12 to 15 minutes for medium, turning once.
3. To serve, thinly slice the steak diagonally across the grain and top with the onion mixture. Serve with warm tortillas and black beans on the side.
