Ingredients:
2 1/4 t yeast
1/4 cup warm water
3 T sugar
3 T butter, melted
2/3 cup sour cream
1 egg, large
1 t vanilla
2 1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 t salt
1/4 t baking soda
Cinnamon Mix:
2/3 cup brown sugar
2 t cinnamon
5 T butter, melted
Glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
1 - 2 T milk

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water and let sit until foamy.
Mix in sugar, butter, sour cream, and egg.
Mix in 2 cups of flour, salt, and baking soda.
Turn out onto floured surface and work in remaining flour adding up to an additional 1/4 cup if necessary (note: do not use KA - dough is WAY to soft and it won't come together).  Original recipe said to only add up to 2T flour, but I had to increase.  Knead until soft and smooth.
Let rise in greased bowl 1 hour.
Gently punch down and divide into 12 sections (apx 50g each); then divide each section into 6 smaller sections, rolling them into small balls as you go.
Dip each ball in butter, then roll in sugar mixture.
Using a 12 tin muffin pan, line edges of each muffin tin with 5 balls, then place final ball on top.  You should have 12 muffin tins with 6 balls in each one.
Let rise another 40 minutes or until doubled.
Bake @ 350 for 20 minutes
Remove from pan (may need to let sit a few minutes) then drizzle with glaze.
