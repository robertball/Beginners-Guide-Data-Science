Ingredients:
8 slices bacon, cut in half
2  potatoes, cubed
2 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons seasoned salt

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place 4 large sheets aluminum foil on a flat work surface. Place 4 pieces bacon in the middle of each sheet of aluminum foil; pile 1/4 of the potatoes on top. Drizzle 1 1/2 teaspoon butter and 1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt over potatoes. Wrap aluminum foil around potatoes to create a pouch.
Place aluminum foil pouches on the preheated grill; cook until potatoes are tender and bacon is crispy, 10 to 15 minutes. Open pouches carefully.

These are a summertime family favorite and are so easy to cook! Great dish that doesn't warm up the kitchen, though you could also make them in the oven.
