Ingredients:
800 Grams boneless lamb
1/2 c. extra virgin olive oil
1/4 c. fresh lime juice
2 large grated onions
1 clove of garlic, crushed
4 medium tomatoes
1/2 tsp. saffron
1 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. black pepper
1 tbsp. sumac (optional)

Directions:
Prepare marinade: combine olive oil, lime juice, onions, garlic, saffron, salt and black pepper.
Cut lamb into 1 cm thick and 4-5 cm long pieces. Do not remove all the fat as you will need it to melt. Marinate overnight (preferrably 24 hours) in refrigerator. Container should be covered.
Thread lamb on long, thin metal skewers. Thread whole tomatoes separately on another skewer. Brush with marinade. Barbeque for about 5 minutes on each side, turning frequently. Serve hot with plain rice (Polow or Chelow) or on middle-eastern bread. If served with rice, some sumac may be sprinkled on.
