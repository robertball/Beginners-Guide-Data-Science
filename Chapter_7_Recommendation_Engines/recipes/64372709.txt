1/4 tsp turmeric
1 tomato diced
3 T. tomato paste
1/4 tsp liquid smoke

1/2 tsp onion powder
1 cup spinach or sliced kale
pepper
3 T nutritional yeast
Hot sauce to taste

Directions:
In saucepan, combine the oats, mushrooms, turmeric, tomatoes, smoke, garlic and onion powder with water. If using kale add it here, if spinach, add at the end. Bring to a boil, stirring to prevent scorching. Once boiling, reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes until water is absorbed and the oats are creamy. Add spinach if using here, along with nutritional yeast. Eat as is or with hot sauce of your choice.
