Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package Regular Flavor Jimmy Dean Pork Sausage, cooked, crumbled and drained
2 (15 ounce) packages refrigerated pie crusts
2 cups chunky-style salsa, drained
6 eggs, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup milk
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degree F.
Unwrap piecrusts and roll each out to slightly thinner than original thickness. Use a 4-inch cookie cutter to cut circles out of crust; gently press each circle into bottom and up the sides of ungreased muffin cup baking pans (crust will not reach top of tin). If necessary, re-roll dough scraps to make additional dough circles.
Combine cooked sausage with remaining ingredients; mix well. Spoon mixture into each crust, filling about 3/4 full.
Bake 40 minutes or until crust is browned.
