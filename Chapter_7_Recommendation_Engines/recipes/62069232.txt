Ingredients:
Pancake mix
Eggs
Milk or water
Soft but solid tofu in a block.

Directions:
First drain you tofu well.... while it is "drying" or draining..... prepare pancake batter.... Add one egg to pancake batter as directed on box , add a little extra sugar and some ground cinnamon..... and add just enough milk to make a very thick batter.... thicker than you would make for pancakes.... set aside some pancake "flour" or mix.....
First dredge thin (1/4 inch at most) slices of tofu in the pancake flour.  Then dip the tofu into the pancake batter.... Have about half and inch of hot oil ready in a skillet..... once oil is hot drop the tofu pieces into the oil...... reduce heat and cook..... flipping once or not too much untill pancakes mix on outside is cooked.... puffed and golden brown.... like pancakes.... now butter (optional) tofu pancakes and generously drizzle with syrup or jam or powdered sugar..... serve. Enjoy!

Description: 
Tofu is good for you and can be prepared a variety of ways.  Its custardy texture lends itself to sweet dishes. This is a great dish to trick kids etc. into eating tofu. There's lots of tofu stuff out there but plain tofu is still the best .... least processed (what does it take to get a tofu dog??) This recipe is sweet and rich and delicious.
