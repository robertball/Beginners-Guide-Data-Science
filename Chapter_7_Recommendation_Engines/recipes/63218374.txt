Ingredients:
4 teaspoons coriander
1 tablespoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1 pound roasted red peppers
1/3 cup chopped onion
2 whole serrano pepper, seeded and minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon lime zest
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
salt and pepper, to taste
48 large shrimp (21-30 size), peeled and deveined
1 whole pineapple, cored and cubed, yielding 48 pieces
1/2 cup chopped green onions
3 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Heat coriander, cumic and turmeric in a skillet until fragrant, 2-3 minutes. Pour into a food processor and add the peppers, onions, serrano peppers and garlic. Process until smooth. Add honey, lime juice and zest and pulse a couple of times. With food processor running, slowly pour in the oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Toss shrimp with a little bit of the paste and spread on a baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees for about 5-6 minutes, then broil for 1 minutes. Use a toothpick to skewer a cooked shrimp and a piece of pineapple together or simply lay both on a platter. Sprinkle with green onions and sesame seeds. Serve with additional pepper paste for dipping.

Description: 
The marinade for this recipe does double duty Â– you use part of it to marinate the shrimp, then serve the rest as a dipping sauce later. Either skewer the shrimp with a piece of pineapple or to make life easier (what I opted for) simply plate the cooked shrimp on a platter next to cubed fresh pineapple chunks.
