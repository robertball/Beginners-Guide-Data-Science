Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
2 (.25 ounce) packages quick-rise yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup water
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 pound thinly sliced deli ham
1 cup shredded Swiss cheese
1/2 cup chopped dill pickles
1 egg, lightly beaten

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine 3 cups flour, sugar, yeast and salt. In a small saucepan, heat water, mustard and butter to 120*-130*. Add to flour mixture. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (dough will be stiff). Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.
Roll dough into a 14-in. x 12-in. rectangle on a greased baking sheet. Arrange half of the ham over dough. Top with cheese, pickles and remaining ham. On each long side, cut 3/4-in.-wide strips about 2-1/2 in. into center. starting at one end, fold alternating strips at an angle across filling. Pinch ends to seal. Cover and let rise for 15 minutes.
Brush with egg. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
