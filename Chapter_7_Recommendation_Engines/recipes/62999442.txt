Ingredients:
3 Red Bell Peppers, seeded & diced
12 - 8.25oz cans Apricots in light syrup, reserve liquid
8 cans plums in heavy syrup, reserve liquid
1 - 20oz can crushed pineapple, in juice
5.5 C Cider vinegar (2.5 & 2C)
1.5 C Sugar, white
3 oz Karo
67 g chopped ginger root
2 Tb salt
1/4 C Mustard Seeds
1 large sweet onion, diced
2 Anaheim peppers, seeded & diced
5 cloves garlic
1 whole cinnamon stick
3/8 ts cayenne

Directions:
Drain fruit, reserving 4 C liquid of each (plum & apricot)
Remove from pits from plums and set fruit aside.
In a non-reactive kettle, combine 2.5C vinegar, sugars, and karo and bring to 220F, stirring constantly.
Add everything else: fruit, reserved fruit liquid, pineapple, 2C vinegar, ginger, salt, mustard seeds, onion, chilies, garlic, cinnamon, cayenne and the bell peppers.
Simmer uncovered for 3 hours, stirring every so often.
Remove the cinnamon stick.
Use blender (stand or hand) to process solids until smooth. If you want a clearer sauce, strain the solids out instead of blending. That will cut quantity roughly by half.
Ladle into sterilized jars.
Process in a boiling water bath.
Let 'season' for two weeks before use.
Serving size - 2TB

Description: 
I make & can duck sauce every year. Each year, I vary the recipe slightly, still looking for that perfect sauce.  This version is based on 2009 - due to canned fruit. I made a few minor changes - including the addition of pineapple.
