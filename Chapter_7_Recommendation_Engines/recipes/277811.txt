Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon Greek seasoning
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground thyme
4 large russet potatoes, peeled and diced into 1-inch cubes
3 ounces crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine olive oil, balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, Greek seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic powder, oregano, and thyme in a large plastic bag or bowl. Add potatoes and shake until potatoes are coated.
Place into a baking dish that's large enough to accommodate potatoes in a single, snug layer.
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. Top with feta cheese. Return to the oven and bake for another 5 minutes. Serve.
