Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 cups almond flour
1 teaspoon rubbed sage
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
4 chicken breasts

Directions:
Beat the eggs thoroughly in a shallow bowl. Sift together the flour, sage, salt, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder in a bowl to combine.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Oil should be about 2 inches deep. Dip chicken pieces into the beaten egg, then dredge in the seasoned flour to thoroughly coat.
Fry chicken in the hot oil until golden brown on the first side, about 10 minutes; reduce heat to medium, and fry chicken on second side until golden brown and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 7 more minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
