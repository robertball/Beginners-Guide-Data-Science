Ingredients:
8 large eggplants
8 large potatoes
8 green bell peppers
8 large onions
8 summer squash
6 tomatoes
1 pound fresh green beans
1 pound whole fresh mushrooms
2 bulbs garlic, cloves separated and peeled
1/4 cup chopped fresh dill weed
1/4 cup chopped fresh oregano
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
3/4 cup olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Prepare the eggplant before assembling ingredients, by cutting them into 2 inch chunks and putting them into an extra large bowl with salted water to cover. This will draw out the bitterness from the eggplant. Let this sit for about 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cut the potatoes, green bell peppers, onion, squash and tomatoes into 2-inch chunks. Cut the green beans and mushrooms in half and peel the garlic cloves.
Drain and rinse the eggplant, then combine it with all the other chopped vegetables, the dill, oregano and basil and place all into a 3x13x18 inch roasting pan. Pour the tomato sauce and olive oil over all.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 2 1/2 hours, adding a little water about halfway through cooking time to keep moist.
