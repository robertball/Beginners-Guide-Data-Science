Ingredients:
1 (1 1/4 pound) flank steak, cut into 8 pieces
2 tablespoons avocado oil
1 (8 ounce) package cremini mushrooms, roughly chopped
1 onion, finely chopped
2 large cloves garlic, grated
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 cup dry red wine
1 1/2 cups beef broth
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup water
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Saute steak, working in batches, until brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Set aside on a plate.
Heat avocado oil in the pot. Saute mushrooms and onion until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and thyme; saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in wine; cook and stir until almost evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add broth, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer.
Add the beef to the broth mixture and turn to coat. Select the Meat option according to manufacturer's instructions. Close and lock the lid; set timer for 20 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, at least 20 minutes. Remove the beef and set aside. Stir water and flour together to make a slurry. Select the Saute option and add the slurry slowly. Cook until liquid thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Pull the beef apart using 2 forks. Stir beef back into the liquid.
