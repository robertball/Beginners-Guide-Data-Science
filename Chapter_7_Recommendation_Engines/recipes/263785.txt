Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup oil
2 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups grated zucchini
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat sugar, oil, eggs, and salt together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add zucchini and mix on low until blended. Add flour, baking soda, and cinnamon; beat until batter is smooth.
Pour batter into an ungreased 8x12-inch baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out dry, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Light and moist, these flavorful zucchini spice bars have been a favorite fall treat in my family for ages. If I am taking them to a party, I will add a little cream cheese frosting, but I rarely have time to frost them at home before my family devours them!
