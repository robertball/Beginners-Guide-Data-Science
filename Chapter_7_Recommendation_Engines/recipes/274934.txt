Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium onion, diced
1 pound lean ground beef
2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
2 (14.5 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 1/2 cups canned corn
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
2 red bell peppers, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 jalapeno pepper, diced, or more to taste
3 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons ground cumin
2 tablespoons onion powder
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
salt to taste
2 limes, cut into wedges (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a skillet. Saute garlic and onion in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add ground beef and cook and stir until brown and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard fat from the skillet.
Place meat mixture into a slow cooker and add diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, pumpkin, kidney beans, black beans, corn, chiles, red bell peppers, green bell pepper, jalapeno, chili powder, cumin, onion powder, bay leaves, coriander, cayenne, and salt. Mix well.
Cook chili on High for 2 hours, or on Low for 4 to 6 hours.
Serve in bowls and squeeze a lime wedge into each.

Description: 
Don't let the pumpkin scare you! You wouldn't know it was there if the cook didn't tell you! The flavors blend nicely and don't overpower one another. This slow cooker chili is heart-smart and tasty too - unless you're like me and top it with a bit of fat-free sour cream and sharp Cheddar cheese. I also squeeze a bit of lime juice into each bowl to add a little zing.
