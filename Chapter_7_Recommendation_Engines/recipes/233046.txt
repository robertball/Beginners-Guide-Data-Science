Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 (12.8 ounce) boxes frozen potato pierogies
3 tablespoons butter
2 (8 ounce) ham steaks, diced
1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
2  green onions, diced, or to taste
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1 cup sour cream
Â½ cup milk
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with aluminum foil; spray with cooking spray.
Arrange pierogies on the prepared pan; spray pierogies with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 10 minutes; flip pierogies and continue baking until lightly golden, 9 to 10 more minutes.
Melt butter in a large frying pan over medium heat; cook and stir ham, mushrooms, green onions, and garlic in the melted butter until ham and mushrooms are lightly brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir pierogies into ham mixture; cook until flavors have blended, about 5 minutes.
Mix mushroom soup, sour cream, and milk together in a bowl; season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Pour soup mixture over ham-pierogie mixture. Cook and stir until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
