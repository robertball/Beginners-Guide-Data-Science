Sri Lankan Curry Recipe

Ingredients:
1 lb. cooked lean pork, beef or lamb, cut into cubes (slices if using raw meat)
2 T. coconut oil
2 oz. sliced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped fine
1 tsp. ginger root, peeled and minced
1/3 c. cilantro leaves, chopped
4 large mushrooms, sliced
1 tsp. Sri Lankan Curry powder (or whatever type you have)
1½ tsp. Garam Masala:  (I use mine:
½ tsp. cinnamon
1 Roma tomato, cut into large pieces
1 c. pork (or beef) broth + 1/4 c. water (more if you like more sauce)
½ c. coconut cream (or coconut milk)
Dash salt

Directions:
Cut up meat and onion.  Heat coconut oil in non-stick skillet or wok over high heat.  Add onion and saute until it begins to soften.  Add meat and saute until meat is beginning to brown a bit.  Add all remaining ingredients except the tomato and coconut cream. Stir well, cover tightly, lower heat to lowest setting and simmer about 10 minutes (longer if you used raw meat, to ensure it gets tender).  Once your meat is tender, add tomato and coconut cream and simmer 10 minutes longer until tomato is just beginning to soften but is not falling apart.  If you use coconut cream, this will be thick enough as is (was for us).  You can always sprinkle with your favorite thickener at this point and stir until it thickens up to your taste.  At this point, I like to saute some banana slices in butter on a griddle (flipping only once when the first side is golden brown) and always serve them with my curries if I have them in the house.  You want to saute nice RIPE ones for the best flavor.
