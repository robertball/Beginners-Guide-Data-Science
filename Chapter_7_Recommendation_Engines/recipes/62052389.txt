Description: 
I forgot something in the recipe I just submitted and don't know how to fix it.  The topping needs 8 oz of thawed Cool Whip folded in before it is spread on top of pie, and I left this out.  Can you please add this to the recipe I submitted for Cantaloupe Cream Pie?  It is an excellent pie and not the same as the one on your web site.
