Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds salmon fillet (maximum 1 1/2 in. thick)
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary leaves or crumbled dried rosemary
1/3 cup orange marmalade
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup thin slices red onion
Salt

Directions:
Rinse salmon, pat dry, and lay skin down in a lightly oiled shallow 3-quart casserole (about 9 by 13 in.). Rub 1/4 teaspoon pepper over salmon.
Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until fish is opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart pan over high heat, combine rosemary, marmalade, balsamic vinegar, and onion. Boil, stirring often, until reduced to 1/2 cup.
Cut salmon into equal pieces; use a wide spatula to transfer to plates. Spoon onion mixture over and around salmon. Add salt to taste.

Description: 
'I started experimenting with balsamic vinegar,' Jenifer-Joan Lauren says, 'and wanted to use it in more things.' She often serves salmon, and the vinegar soon became an integral part of a sauce for the fish. If desired, garnish portions with small rosemary sprigs. Jenifer-Joan Lauren, Maple Valley, Washington
