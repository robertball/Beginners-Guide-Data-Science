Ingredients:
cooking spray
Casserole:
1 pound extra-lean ground turkey breast
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 (15 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes, drained
1 (8 ounce) can tomato paste
1 sweet potato, peeled and cut into noodle shapes
1 eggplant, sliced into 1/2-inch pieces
1 teaspoon tarragon flakes, divided
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/8 teaspoon oregano
1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom
Sauce:
1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon almond flour
1 tablespoon coconut flour
1 cup unsweetened almond milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8-inch square pan with cooking spray.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground turkey, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until turkey is browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Add sweet potatoes; cook and stir until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
Combine eggplant, 1/2 teaspoon tarragon flakes, salt, pepper, chili powder, cumin, oregano, and cardamom in a bowl; toss until eggplant is coated.
Layer coated eggplant on the bottom of the prepared pan; top with turkey mixture.
Bake casserole in the preheated oven until sweet potatoes are lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
Heat a saucepan over high heat. Add olive oil, almond flour, and coconut flour; cook and stir until mixture thickens, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-high. Whisk in almond milk slowly until combined. Cook, continuing to whisk, until sauce is reduced by half, about 10 minutes.
Remove casserole from the oven; cover with sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top of the casserole has browned, 40 to 45 minutes. Top with remaining 1/2 teaspoon tarragon. Slice into 6 pieces with a sharp knife.
