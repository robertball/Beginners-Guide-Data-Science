Ingredients:
PAN
2 tsp. Butter
1 T. White Sugar
1 tsp. Ground Cinnamon
BATTER
2 C. All-Purpose Flour
1/2 C. White Sugar
1/2 C. Light Brown Sugar
1 T. Baking Powder
1/2 tsp. Salt
1 tsp. Ground Cinnamon
1/2 tsp. Ground Nutmeg
1/4 C. Chopped Walnuts or Pecans
1/2 C. Butter (melted) or Canola Oil
1 C. Bananas (mashed)
1/4 C. Milk
2 Eggs
1 tsp. Pure Vanilla Extract
1-2 tsp. White or Light Brown Sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Generously grease a 9x5" loaf pan with 2 tsp butter. Mix 1 T. sugar with 1 tsp. cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle pan with cinnamon/sugar mixture, all over the bottom and up the sides of the pan.
In a large bowl; whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. In another medium/large bowl; beat 1/2 C. butter or canola oil, with 1/2 C. white sugar and 1/2 C. light brown sugar until creamy. Beat in eggs (one at a time), vanilla extract, and milk until combined. Stir in the mashed bananas. Add the wet mixture to the flour mixture, beat on low-speed until thoroughly combined (a few lumps are okay). Stir in chopped walnuts or pecans. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan, and sprinkle the top of the batter with 1-2 tsp. white/light brown sugar.
Bake in 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes - 1 hour, or until toothpick inserted in center of the loaf comes out clean. Let cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before removing from pan to finish cooling on a wire rack. ENJOY!
