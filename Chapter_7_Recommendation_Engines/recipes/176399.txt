Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 egg
2 tablespoons amaretto or almond extract
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seed
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup pistachio nuts, chopped, plus extra for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat butter with an electric mixer at medium speed until creamy. Gradually add sugar; mix well. Add egg; beat well. Add amaretto, lemon zest and fennel seeds; mix to combine.
In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to butter mixture; beat well. Stir in pistachio nuts (dough will be stiff).
Shape dough into 1-inch balls; place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. If desired, flatten balls slightly and sprinkle with additional chopped pistachios. Bake for 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool slightly on baking sheets; remove to cooling racks and cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.

Description: 
Butter makes this simple drop cookie soft and rich while pistachios give it an unexpected crunch. Lemon rind and fennel seeds round out the cookie with a citrusy-anise flavor.
