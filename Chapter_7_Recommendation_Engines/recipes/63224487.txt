Ingredients:
1 cup shrimp, cleaned
1 clove garlic, slivered
1/2 cup sweet Thai chili sauce
10-12 slices bacon

Directions:
Mix shrimp and garlic; pour chili sauce on mixture.  Cover and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, for several hours.
Cut bacon slices in half and fry until partially cooked (not too much or it is hard to roll up); drain. Wrap each shrimp in bacon piece and secure with a wooden pick.
Set oven to broil and/or 550 degrees.  Broil 2-3 inches from heat until bacon is crisp.
Makes 20-24 appetizers.
