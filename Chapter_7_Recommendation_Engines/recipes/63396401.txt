Ingredients:
3/4 cup (90 grams) all purpose flour
1/4 cup (30 grams) whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/3 cup (66 grams) sugar
Pinch freshly ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1/3 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg
Semisweet chocolate, tempered or melted, or powdered sugar, for coating

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400Â°F and lightly grease a mini doughnut pan.
Sift the flours and baking powder together. Whisk in the sugar, nutmeg, and salt. Set aside.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, milk, vanilla, and egg. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir until just combined. Do not overmix or your doughnuts may be rubbery.
Fill each doughnut cup 1/2 to 3/4 of the way full with the batter. You can do this with a spoon, but I prefer using a piping bag to fill each cup evenly and cleanly. It's important not to overfill or as the doughnuts rise, you'll lose the hole.
Bake until the doughnuts spring back when touched, 6 to 10 minutes depending on the size of your doughnut pan. Let cool completely on a wire rack; then dip in melted chocolate or dust with powdered sugar.
