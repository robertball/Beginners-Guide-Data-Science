Description: 
This is by far one of my favorite recipes. I love making this for my family on a chilly fall evening. 
I've also made this ahead of time, froze it, and served it for Thanksgiving dinner.
All our friends and family are always requesting that I make it every year. It's super easy and a true crowd pleaser!
