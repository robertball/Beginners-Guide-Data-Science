Ingredients:
8 center cut pork chops
2 pounds sauerkraut, drained
1 large red apple, diced
1 onion, chopped
1 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon caraway seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, and brown the pork chops on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Place the chops into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Mix the sauerkraut, apple, onion, brown sugar, and caraway seeds in a bowl until well combined, and spread the sauerkraut mixture over the pork chops. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until the pork is no longer pink inside, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
As a soldier during WWII my Dad learned to make this hearty pork dish from a local German woman during the Allied occupation of Germany. I don't know the German name for it, but it is delicious!
