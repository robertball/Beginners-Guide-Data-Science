Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 cup pumpkin puree
1/4 cup almond milk
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
ground flax seed (optional)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Combine butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add pumpkin puree, almond milk, eggs, and vanilla extract; beat until well combined.
Combine flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a separate bowl. Mix in ground flax seed, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves. Make a well in the center and pour butter mixture into the well. Stir just until batter is combined. Fold in pecans and spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 20 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I have searched for a moist and delicious healthy pumpkin muffin recipe for a long time. Finally, I modified a very old banana bread recipe and voila--it makes muffins or a loaf and it is fantastic! These muffins also taste great with a cream cheese icing.
