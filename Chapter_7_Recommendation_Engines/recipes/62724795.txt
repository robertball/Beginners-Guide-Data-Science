2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1.  Fry bacon in large skillet over medium heat until crisp.  Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons drippings in skillet.  Crumble bacon and set aside.
2.  Add mushrooms, onion, and garlic to reserved drippings and cook over medium heat until tender and most of the mushroom liquid has evaporated (about 6-8 minutes.)
3.  Mix in flour, salt, and pepper.  Add cream cheese, Worcestershire, and soy sauce.  Reduce heat to low and stir until cream cheese is melted.  Stir in sour cream and bacon.  Serve warm with crackers and/or breadsticks.
