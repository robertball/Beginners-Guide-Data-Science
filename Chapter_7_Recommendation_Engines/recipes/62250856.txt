Description: 
I found a recipe for an Enchilada pie, the more I looked at it, the more I thought, this doesn't look right, and it doesn't have what I want. I wanted the look of a lasagna but the taste of Enchiladas and refried beans. SO I came up with this recipe, and it hit the spot with the family. Very cheesy and flavorful....
