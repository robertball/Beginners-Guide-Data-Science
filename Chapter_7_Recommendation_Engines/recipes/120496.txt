Description: 
'I created this recipe when unexpected guests stopped over and I didn't have enough chili for everyone,' recalls Cindy Cuykendall of Skaneateles, New York. The surprising supper became a family favorite, and the friends who dropped by Cindy's house never had a clue that servings were a smart 68Â¢ each.
