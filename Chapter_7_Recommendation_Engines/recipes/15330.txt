2 tablespoons milk

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream the butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Stir in the milk and vanilla. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt, stir into the creamed mixture. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the rolled oats, chocolate chips and walnuts.
