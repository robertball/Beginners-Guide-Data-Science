Description: 
Queso blanco is a soft, unaged white cheese that originated in Spain. It's also fantastically easy to make at home! Add salt for a savory cheese to crumble on salads, or skip the salt for a creamy soft cheese that is delicious served with a drizzle of honey! Store queso in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
