Ingredients:
1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
3 tablespoons basil pesto
1 (8 ounce) package fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine cherry tomatoes, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper in a bowl; toss until well combined. Spread cherry tomatoes evenly on the prepared baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until skins start to wrinkle and insides are soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool.
Line another baking sheet with parchment paper. Unroll puff pastry sheet on top. Make shallow cuts 1 inch from the edges to create a border, being careful not to cut all the way through. Prick the inner rectangle all over with a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed up slightly, about 10 minutes.
Spread pesto over the center. Cover with 1/2 of the tomatoes. Scatter mozzarella cheese on top. Distribute remaining tomatoes over the cheese.
Bake until pastry is golden and cheese is melted, 5 to 10 minutes more.

Description: 
I love caprese salad, but was looking for something a bit more filling for dinner. I pulled some puff pastry out of the freezer and decided to make a savory tart. Roasting the tomatoes first keeps sogginess to a minimum. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if you have them.
