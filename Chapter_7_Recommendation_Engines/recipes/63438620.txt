Ingredients:
2 cups flour
4 t baking powder
1 t salt (optional)
1 1/2 T  sugar
5 T butter
2/3 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425.
Lightly grease a cookie sheet.
Mix the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in a bowl.
Cut the butter in bits and work it into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or your fingers until it resembles coarse meal.
Slowly stir in the milk, using just enough to hold the dough together.
Turn out onto a floured surface and knead for a minute or two.
Divide dough into 8 pieces, shape each into a slightly flattened circle and place on prepared cookie sheet.
Bake for 10-12 minutes.

These are the best when split while warm and served with sweetened strawberries and fresh whipped cream!  They are also great warmed for breakfast with jam or marmalade.
