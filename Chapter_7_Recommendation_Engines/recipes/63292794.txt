Ingredients:
1 1/2 c. white sugar
1/4 c. oil
1/2 c. butter
3 eggs
1/4 c. brandy
3/4 c. milk
1 can well-drained crushed pineapple
2 1/2 c. flour
2 1/2 t. baking powder
1/2 t. baking soda
1 t. salt
FROSTING:
1 can cream of coconut
1 - 8oz. package cream cheese

Directions:
Line cupcake pan with liners and preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a bowl, cream together sugar, butter, and oil until fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time.
Stir in the brandy, milk and pineapple.
Sift remaining ingredients together and slowly add to the mixture. (May want to use a hand mixer to get a lighter, fluffier batter)
Spoon batter into cupcake liners, leaving about 1/8" of liner free (this cake doesn't rise a lot).
Bake for 17 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
As soon as the cupcakes leave the oven, spoon 1 t. of brandy over the tops of them and let seep into the cake. Let the cupcakes cool completely before frosting.
FOR FROSTING: Using a mixer, beat the can of cream of coconut together with the softened cream cheese until lump free.
