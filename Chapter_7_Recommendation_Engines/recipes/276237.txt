Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated
3 1/2 tablespoons sambal oelek
2 pounds shredded cooked rotisserie chicken
8 cups chicken broth
6 cups sliced kale
1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk
salt to taste
1 (8 ounce) package thin rice noodles (bean threads)
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 red onion, cut into wedges
1 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic and ginger and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in sambal oelek and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add shredded chicken, chicken broth, kale, and coconut milk; bring to a simmer. Cook until kale is wilted, 1 to 2 minutes; remove from the heat.
Submerge rice noodles in the pot and stir to uncoil as they cook in the hot chicken broth mixture, about 5 minutes. Ladle into bowls and garnish with cilantro and onion wedges. Squeeze a lime wedge in each bowl.

Description: 
Spicy coconut broth mixed with noodles and leftover chicken (I like to use rotisserie chicken) is topped with cilantro, red onions, and a squeeze of lime juice. It will be a lot of noodles to broth (it's like a combo of stew and soup) so add less noodles if you want it to be more soupy.
