Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 (1 ounce) package dry ranch salad dressing mix
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
20 large jalapeno peppers, halved and seeded
1 pound sliced bacon, cut in half

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Stir together the cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, ranch dressing mix, and garlic powder in a mixing bowl until evenly blended. Spoon some of the cheese mixture into each jalapeno half, wrap with half a bacon strip, and secure with a toothpick. Arrange the wrapped jalapeno halves onto a broiler pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until the bacon is no longer pink and beginning to brown, about 20 minutes.
