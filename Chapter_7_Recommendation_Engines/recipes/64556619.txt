Ingredients:
3 cups cooked chicken, cubed or shredded
2 tsp chili powder
2 tsp cumin
2 tsp onion powder
2 tsp garlic powder
1-2 tbsp oil
1/2 onion, chopped
1/2 green or red pepper, chopped
1/4 c flour
7-10 oz salsa verde
1 can navy beans
1 can black beans
1 bag (11 oz)  frozen fiesta corn
1/4 c half and half
2-3 cups chicken broth
2 tbsp sour cream
Top with chopped green onions, cheddar cheese, cilantro

Directions:
I used precooked chicken, but if starting with uncooked chicken, add 2 tblsp oil and brown diced chicken. Cook until mostly done, add seasoning mixture and mix well. Remove from pan.
Add onions and peppers to pan (add more oil if necessary). Cook until tender. Add chicken back to the pan, then add flour and stir to coat evenly.
Add salsa verde, beans and corn. Mix well.
Add stir in broth and half and half, add sour cream. Cook on low to medium-low, stir often. Soup should thicken as it cooks. (I started with 2 cups of broth, but added about another cup).
*Comments: serve over rice for a hearty meal
*I had precooked the thawed  chicken breasts in the crockpot with a little chicken broth on low for about 4 hours.  It was soooo tender!
*I used World Table roasted green medium salsa verde.  Perfect flavor with not a lot of heat.

Description: 
Adapted from a copycat recipe of Cheesecake Facotry's white chicken chili, but doesnâ€™t seem like white chicken chili to me.  It's so thick an yummy it should probably be called a stew! Mmmmm
