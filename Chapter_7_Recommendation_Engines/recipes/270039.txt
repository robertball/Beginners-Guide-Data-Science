Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (8.5 ounce) bag malt vinegar-and-sea salt chips (such as Kettle BrandÂ®)
3 egg whites
1 pound cod fillets, cut into 4-inch pieces and excess moisture pressed out
3 cups coleslaw mix
2 green onions, chopped
1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt
2 tablespoons honey mustard
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon celery seed
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper
8 slider buns

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet and spray the rack with cooking spray.
Place chips in a blender in batches and process to the consistency of bread crumbs. Transfer chips to a flat plate.
Beat egg whites together in a bowl. Dip a piece of fish in egg white, coat in chip crumbs, and place on the prepared rack. Repeat with remaining fish. Spray fish with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil fish until brown and crispy, about 5 minutes.
While fish is cooking, combine coleslaw mix and green onions in a large bowl. Whisk yogurt, honey mustard, vinegar, celery seed, salt, and pepper together in a separate bowl. Pour dressing over coleslaw mix and toss to combine.
Place a piece of fish on the bottom half of each slider bun and top with coleslaw.

Description: 
A twist on the classic flavors of fish and chips in a hand-held slider. Unlike the traditional dish, this fish is baked instead of fried, and the coleslaw is dressed with Greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise, resulting in a much healthier alternative.
