Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cooked quinoa, divided
1 1/2 cups cooked brown rice, divided
1 1/2 cups almond milk
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 tablespoon vanilla extract, or more to taste
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice

Directions:
Combine 1 cup quinoa, 1 cup brown rice, almond milk, honey, brown sugar, and salt in a pot over medium heat; stir until almond milk is heated through, about 5 minutes.
Whisk egg in a small bowl. Mix in some of the hot milk mixture to gradually warm up the egg to room temperature.
Pour egg mixture into the saucepan. Add remaining 1/2 cup quinoa, 1/2 cup brown rice, vanilla extract, and pumpkin pie spice. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until mixture begins to thicken, 10 to 15 minutes. Scoop mixture into 2 serving bowls.

Description: 
A warm breakfast pudding with more texture than regular oatmeal. It tastes great the same day you make it, and heats up well for those rushed work mornings. Top with blackberries, blueberries, dried cranberries, raisins, toasted coconut, or nuts.
