Ingredients:
2 heads of cabbage, finely shredded
10 onions, chopped
10 sweet red peppers, chopped
4 cups water
4 cups vinegar
1 cup oil
1 tbsp celery seed
3 tbsps salt
1 tbsp mustard seed
1 tbsp tumeric
1 1/2 cups sugar

Directions:
Day 1:
Place shredded cabbage in a large non reactive bowl or a plastic pail, sprinkle with salt, toss to combine, cover with a lid or saran wrap.
Day 2:
Squeeze out any liquid from the cabbage, discard the liquid, set aside drained cabbage.
In a large pot combine water, vinegar, oil, spices and sugar, bring to a boil.
Add onions, red peppers and drained cabbage.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes.
While the vegetables are cooking prepare your jars and lids for canning, I usually need 6 to 8 1 litre jars.
When jars and vegetables are ready ladle the vegetables into the jars leaving at least 1 inch of head space. Slide a knife down the sides of the jars to remove any air, place lids on, just finger tighten lids and process in a hot water bath for 25 minutes or what is appropriate for your altitude.

My grandmother always made this to eat as a side salad with sandwiches or cold meat. I have seen similar recipes called Amish Pickled Coleslaw.
