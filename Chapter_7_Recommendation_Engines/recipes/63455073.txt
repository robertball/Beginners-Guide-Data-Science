Ingredients:
1 3lb Boneless Pork loin Roast
2 carrots minced
1 red bell pepper diced
2 celery stalks diced
2 medium white onions diced
4 cloves fresh garlic minced
1/4 cup fresh parsley chopped fine
2 15 ounce cans crushed tomatoes
1 6 ounce can tomato paste
1 cup deep red wine (I used Pinot Noir)
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the onions, carrots, bell pepper and celery, half the fresh parsley in the bottom of slow cooker.
Rub the pork roast with the dried oregano, basil, and salt and pepper, place on the bed of vegetables in slow cooker.
Top the roast with the minced garlic and add salt and pepper to taste.
Mix in a bowl the tomatoes, wine, the other half of fresh parsley, and fennel seed and pour over the roast. Use a spoon to push some of the sauce down into the vegetables around the side of the roast.
Cover and cook on low for 7 to 8 hours.
Remove roast to a plate and remove any fat pieces from the meat and shred with forks. Return the meat to the crock pot and mix with sauce and vegetables well.
Continue to cook on warm or low another 1 hour.
Serve over cooked pasta of your choice, or mashed potatoes.
