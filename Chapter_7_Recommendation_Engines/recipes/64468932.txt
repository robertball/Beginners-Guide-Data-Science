Ingredients:
1/2 of a 10oz bag of miniature marshmallows
2 tbs of hazelnut spread
2 tbs peanut butter
1/2 stick of butter
2 cups Cinnamon Toast Crunch or similar cereal, crushed

Directions:
In a medium bowl, preferably a clean, untainted one, melt the butter using your heating method of choice.  I prefer to use the heat of my burning love of kale, but a microwave could always do. then mix with cereal .  Set aside.
mix hazelnut spread and peanut butter in a medium microwave safe bowl and microwave for 15 seconds.  Stir, then repeat.  Be sure to reassure your mixture that you will not overheat it.  Offer to take it to a nice bonding lunch to ease its fears if necessary.
Add marshmallows to the peanut butter mixture and stir thoroughly.  Do it quickly to put the marshmallows out of their misery.  Drowning slowly is a cruel death.
Spoon dead marshmallows (around 6) onto the cereal and coat with the crumbs while rolling into a ball.  This ball is not an outside toy.
Place each ball on the cookie sheet and refrigerate for 30 minutes, then enjoy.
Share with your friends, and share with those who are hungry.
