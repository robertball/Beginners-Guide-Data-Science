Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
1/2 cup sugar
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
Colored sugar (optional)

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar; gradually add flour. Divide dough in half.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out each portion to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with 2-in. to 3-in. cookie cutters dipped in flour. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Sprinkle with colored sugar if desired.
Bake at 300 degrees F for 20-25 minutes until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
I found this recipe in a magazine over 30 years ago and have made the cutouts for Christmas ever since. Four ingredients make them an oh-so-simple recipe to whip up during the hectic holidays.
