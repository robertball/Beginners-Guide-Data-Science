Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter
6 slices bacon
1 large sweet potato, cubed
1 cup chopped broccoli
1/4 yellow onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
2 cups fresh spinach
salt and ground black pepper to taste
6 eggs, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter.
Cook bacon in a skillet on medium heat until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Remove and chop coarsely.
Cook sweet potato, broccoli, onion, and garlic in the same skillet until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add spinach; season with salt and pepper and cook until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes.
Beat eggs in a bowl until foamy. Add bacon and spinach mixture and stir well. Pour mixture into the baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until top and sides are golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
This casserole is a way to have healthy fats and delicious veggies without all the bad stuff. There is a punch of flavor in this and you can even package individually to eat throughout the week. One of my favorite go-to recipes. Top with cheese if desired.
