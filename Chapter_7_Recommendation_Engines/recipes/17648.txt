Ingredients:
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
salt and pepper to taste
2 pounds cube steak
1/4 cup vegetable oil for frying
1 (32 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Dredge the meat in the crumbs.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the breaded meat in the oil, and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until well browned on both sides.
Drain excess oil, and pour in the spaghetti sauce. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes.
