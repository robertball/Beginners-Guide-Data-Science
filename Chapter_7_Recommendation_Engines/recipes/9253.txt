Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds boneless pork loin roast
1 cup real maple syrup
4 tablespoons prepared Dijon-style mustard
2 1/2 tablespoons cider vinegar
2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir together the maple syrup, mustard, vinegar, soy sauce, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Place pork roast in a shallow roasting pan. Spread glaze evenly over pork roast.
Roast pork in the preheated oven uncovered, until internal temperature measured with a meat thermometer reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 1 hour.  Remove from oven, and let rest about 10 minutes before slicing to serve.
