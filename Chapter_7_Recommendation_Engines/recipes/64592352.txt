Ingredients:
3-5 lbs Boneless Beef Short Ribs
3/4 cup Pure Maple Syrup or Honey
2/3 cup Ketchup
1/3 cup Mustard
1/4 cup Lemon Juice
1 tbsp Liquid Smoke
1 tsp Chili Powder
1/2 tsp Garlic Powder
Salt and Pepper

Directions:
Boil ribs for about 1 hour 15 minutes to reduce amount of fat on the ribs and soften the meat.
In a bowl combine all ingredients, except for the salt and pepper and mix it together thoroughly.
Drain the meat and place in a glass baking pan or any other baking pan but I find glass works best.
Broil the meat on Medium for 45-60 minutes, while basting the meat with the bbq sauce.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
