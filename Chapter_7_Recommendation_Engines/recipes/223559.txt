Directions:
Whisk olive oil, balsamic vinegar, raspberry jam, and Dijon mustard in a bowl.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add sugar snap peas; cover and steam until bright green but still crunchy, about 30 seconds. Transfer to an iced water-filled bowl; drain.
