Ingredients:
5 1/2 pounds McIntosh apples - peeled, cored, and chopped
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract (optional)
2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Blend apples in batches in a blender until no large chunks remain.
Combine blended apples, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger in a slow cooker.
Cook uncovered on High for 1 hour. Place cover on slow cooker and continue cooking, stirring about twice per hour, until smooth, 6 to 8 hours. Remove the cover and continue cooking and stirring until thick and spreadable, 2 to 4 hours.
Spoon into jars leaving about an inch of space at the top; seal and freeze.
