Ingredients:
3 pounds beef chuck roast
1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing
3 cloves garlic, minced

Place roast into a stainless steel or glass mixing bowl. Pour dressing over the roast, and turn to coat. Cover, and refrigerate for 24 hours.
Preheat oven to 285 degrees F (140 degrees C).
Line a 13x9 inch baking dish with aluminum foil. Place the marinated roast in the dish. Rub the garlic and pepper into the meat. Pour any leftover marinade over the roast.
Bake at  285 degrees F (140 degrees C) for 1 1/2 hours. Increase heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), and continue baking for an additional 2 hours.
Remove roast from oven, and cover with foil. Let sit for 15 minutes before serving.
