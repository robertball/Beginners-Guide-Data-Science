Ingredients:
2/3 cup agave nectar
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup raw sugar
2 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon sunflower seed oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/3 cup coconut flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups shredded zucchini
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with parchment paper.
Beat agave nectar, applesauce, raw sugar, eggs, sunflower oil, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Whisk all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, coconut flour, baking soda, and salt together in another bowl. Add flour mixture to applesauce mixture and stir until combined.
