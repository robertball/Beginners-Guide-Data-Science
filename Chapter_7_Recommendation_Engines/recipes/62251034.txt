Ingredients:
4 cups of water or as needed to cover noodles
1 chicken or vegetable broth bullion cube
1 package uncooked Japanese rice noodles (can sub. angel hair spaghetti)
1/2 pound pre-cooked medium shrimp (approx. 24 or more)
1 teaspoon ginger, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon sesame seeds (omit if you use Teriyaki sauce with sesame seeds like I did)
2 tablespoons olive oil or as needed
1/2 red bell pepper, sliced into thin strips
1/2 green bell pepper, sliced into thin strips
1/2 yellow or orange(or both) bell pepper, sliced into thin strips
3 green onions, sliced (including tops)
3 tablespoons teriyaki sauce w/sesame seeds
1 cup (approx) sugar snap peas (fresh or frozen, dethawed)

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add vegetable or chicken broth cube and allow to dissolve. Add noodles, reduce heat, cover and simmer until noodles are cooked, approx. 15-20 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large wok or skillet. Add bell peppers and green onions; saute 3 to 4 minutes to soften slightly. Add chopped garlic and ginger. Saute and add teriyaki sauce. Add peas and shrimp (and sesame seeds if needed) saute until shrimp are heated thoroughly, being careful not to overcook. They are already cooked.
Spoon noodles onto serving plates and top with shrimp mixture.
