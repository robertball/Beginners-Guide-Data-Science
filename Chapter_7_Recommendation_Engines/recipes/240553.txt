Ingredients:
½ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
salt and ground black pepper to taste
5 cups water
2 cups uncooked wild rice
1 teaspoon butter
4 cups finely sliced red cabbage
2 large red bell peppers - seeded, cored, and chopped
2 bulbs fennel, trimmed and chopped
2 bunches kale, leaves stripped from stems and torn into pieces
¼  lemon, juiced, or to taste

Directions:
Whisk 1/2 cup lemon juice, olive oil, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until dressing is smooth.
Bring water, wild rice, and butter to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Drain excess liquid and cook uncovered until water is completely evaporated, about 5 minutes more. Stir rice and let cool slightly.
Combine cabbage, red bell peppers, and fennel in the bowl with dressing; toss to evenly coat. Place kale on top of the cabbage mixture and spoon warm wild rice over kale; let sit until kale is slightly wilted, 5 to 10 minutes. Toss until salad is evenly mixed, adding more lemon juice to taste.

Description: 
This is my interpretation of a wonderful, good-for-you kale salad originally prepared by Seattle's top natural foods grocery chain. The flavorful wild rice, kale, and veggie combination with a lemony dressing can be made year-round and earns raves whenever it's served. It also keeps wonderfully, so make it ahead with no hesitation.
