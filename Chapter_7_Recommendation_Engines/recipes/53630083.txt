Ingredients:
1 cup shortening
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces

Directions:
Heat the shortening in a large, cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.
In a brown paper lunch bag, combine the flour, salt, and pepper. Shake two chicken pieces in the bag to coat, and place them in the skillet. Repeat until all of the chicken is coated and in the skillet.
Fry the chicken over medium-high heat until all of the pieces have been browned on both sides. Turn the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 25 minutes. Remove the lid, and increase heat to medium-high. Continue frying until chicken pieces are a deep golden brown, and the juices run clear.
