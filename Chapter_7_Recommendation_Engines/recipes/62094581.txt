Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups fresh ripe raspberries (can also use frozen if out of season - thaw completely)
1 table spoon cornstarch
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 cup of splenda (or other powdered sweetner recommended for baking)

Directions:
Combine the lemon juice and corn starch until it is a smooth paste.
Add the raspberries to a sauce pan on a moderate heat, and press with a wooden spoon until all squashed.
Add the corn starch and lemon juice along with the sweetner.
Stir and heat continuously until the raspberries have all disolved you have a thick coulis style mixture.
Remove from the heat and press through a sieve into a bowl until all that is left in the sieve is the seeds and the pulp.
Chill the final result in the fridge for 10-15 minutes or until you are ready to use it.
Bring to room temperature and spread on the bottom layer of your cake.
Carefully place the top layer of cake on top being careful not to push down so that you don't lose the filling out of the sides.
Frost your cake as you desire.

Description: 
This is such a fruity low calorie filling. It is a little tart (or sour) so it works best with really sweet and moist chocolate cakes. It is a very different filling to what you find in most layer cakes, but you will be surprised at how well it works!
