Ingredients:
14 ounces honey
1 1/4 cups white sugar
9 tablespoons butter
6 tablespoons milk
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
5 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 pinch ground cardamom
1 pinch ground mace
1 pinch ground cloves
1 pinch ground cinnamon
3/4 cup dried currants
1 tablespoon dried currants
3/4 cup chopped almonds
1 tablespoon chopped almonds
3/4 cup chopped candied citron
3 tablespoons chopped candied citron
1 1/4 cups apricot jam
2 tablespoons water
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
4 tablespoons hot water

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin pans for 24 cookies.
Combine the honey, sugar, butter, and milk in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the sugar and butter are melted and the mixture is hot but not boiling. Transfer to a mixing bowl and cool.
Sift together the 4 cups plus 1 tablespoon of flour, 5 tablespoons of cocoa powder, and the baking powder.
When the milk mixture has cooled, stir in the eggs, lemon zest or extract, the flour and cocoa mixture, and the ground cardamom, mace, cloves, and cinnamon. Fold in the 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon currants, the 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon chopped almonds, and the 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon chopped citron.
Fill the muffin cups 1/2 full with the batter. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet.
Combine the apricot jam and the 2 tablespoons of water in a saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove from heat. When the cookies have cooled, brush them with the warm jam mixture.
Sift the confectioners' sugar with the 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder. Add just enough hot water to give the glaze a good coating consistency. Pour the glaze over the cookies. When the glaze has dried completely, pack the cookies in airtight containers.
