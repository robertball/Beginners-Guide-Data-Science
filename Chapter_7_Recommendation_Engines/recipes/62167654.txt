Ingredients:
1 personal size watermelon OR half a medium watermelon
1 cup cachaca (sugar cane spirit from Brazil)
2 tablespoons turbinado sugar (more or less to taste)

Directions:
Cube watermelon into about 1 inch pieces and place in a non-reactive container that is water tight.  Add cachaca and sugar.  Put on the lid and make sure it's sealed.  Shake the mixture to be sure the alcohol gets all over the fruit and the sugar starts to dissolve.  Put it in the fridge at least two hours but preferably over night.
Shake the mixture again right before serving.  Use toothpicks to serve out of the container or arrange on a pretty plate.  Enjoy poolside.
