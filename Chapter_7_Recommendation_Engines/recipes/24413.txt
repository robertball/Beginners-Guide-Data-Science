Ingredients:
2/3 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/3 cup chopped green chile pepper
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
1 tablespoon margarine
3 cups vegetable broth
2 cups peeled and cubed potatoes
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground red pepper
2 cups cheese tortellini
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 pint half-and-half cream

Directions:
In a large pot over medium heat, cook onion, bell pepper, chile pepper, garlic and jalapeno in margarine until tender but not brown, 5 minutes.
Stir in broth, potatoes, cumin, salt, pepper and red pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer about 20 minutes, until potatoes are just tender.
Meanwhile,  bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and set aside.
In a small bowl, stir together flour and vegetable oil.  Pour into soup, increase heat to medium, and cook until thickened and bubbly.  Stir in corn, half-and-half and tortellini and heat through.  Serve.
