Ingredients:
MEATBALLS:
1/4 cup Panko crumbs (I used Homemade from whole grain bread)
2 lbs 93% lean ground turkey
1 egg
1 tablespoon ginger, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
3 scallions, chopped
1 tablespoon sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons sesame oil
SOY/LIME DIPPING SAUCE:
4 tablespoons sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons water
1 chopped fresh scallion

Directions:
Preheat oven to 500Â°F.
Mix ground turkey, panko, egg, salt, scallions, ginger, cilantro, 1 tbsp soy sauce, and 2 tsp oil and mix with your hands until combined well. Shape into a 1.5 oz ball and transfer to a baking dish that has been sprayed with cooking spray. Repeat with remaining mixture. Bake until cooked through,(165 F) about 15 minutes.
DIPPING SAUCE:
Mix together lime juice, water, soy sauce, and remaining 1 teaspoon of oil in a bowl. Add scallions.
Transfer meatballs to a serving dish. Stir sauce, then drizzle meatballs with 1 tablespoon sauce.
Serve meatballs with remaining sauce, about 1 tbsp per person and heaping 1/4 cup of brown rice. (You probably won't use all the dipping sauce.)
