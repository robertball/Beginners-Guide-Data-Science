Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
1/2 yellow onion, diced, divided
1 yellow bell pepper, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 orange bell pepper, diced
6 ounces thick cut smoked ham steak, diced, divided
1 (15 ounce) can HORMEL® Mary Kitchen® Corned Beef Hash
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 egg, lightly beaten
3 green onion tops, finely chopped
1 cup mozzarella cheese, grated
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup panko bread crumbs

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions, yellow, red, and orange bell peppers, and 1/2 of chopped ham until onions are soft, 5 or 6 minutes. Add corned beef hash and garlic. Cook and stir until ingredients begin to brown, 3 or 4 more minutes. Remove from heat.
Stir in the remaining ham, 1 beaten egg, green onions, and the cheese. Mix well.
Place flour, remaining 2 beaten eggs, and panko crumbs in 3 separate shallow dishes. Shape croquettes into small ovals or rounds about the size of a golf ball. Roll croquettes in flour, then eggs, then panko crumbs. Place on a rack.
Gently lower the croquettes into hot oil. Do not crowd them; you can cook in batches. Fry until nicely browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
