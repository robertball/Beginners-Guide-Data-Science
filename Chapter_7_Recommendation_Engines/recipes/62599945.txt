Ingredients:
5 medium white mushrooms, cleaned and sliced
1/4 cup olive oil
1 small yellow onion, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 pound finely ground lean beef
1 16-ounce can plum tomatoes, with juice
2 bay leaves
1/4 cup Cabernet Sauvignon
1/4 cup beef broth
Pinch of oregano
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
4 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
1 pound penne (or spirali pasta), cooked al dente

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add the mushrooms, and blanch for 2 minutes. Drain, chop finely, and reserve.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high flame and sauté the onions for 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the blanched mushrooms, garlic, and ground beef, and continue to cook and stir for 7 to 8 minutes, until the meat is browned. Coarsely chop the tomatoes and add with their juice, then bay leaves, wine, broth, and oregano. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 15 minutes.
Remove the bay leaves. Add the butter and parsley and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle and stir in the Parmigiano-Reggiano and serve over the cooked pasta.
