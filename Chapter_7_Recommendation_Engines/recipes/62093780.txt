Ingredients:
1 clove of garlic
3 tablespoons of pine nuts (pignolias)
1 bushel/bunch of basil
2 tablespoons of olive oil
2 tablespoons of romano cheese
2 tablespoons of parmagiano cheese
1 cup of milk

Directions:
Grind all ingredients in blender for about 2-3 minutes. I suggest not adding a whole cup of milk to blender right away, but rather a half of a cup first just so it does not become too watery. If not enough, then add another half cup of milk. Once pasta is cooked, remove water from pasta, then add pesto sauce to the pot of pasta and cook on high for one minute. Then enjoy!
