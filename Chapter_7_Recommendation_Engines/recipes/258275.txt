Ingredients:
1 cup orzo pasta
Vinaigrette:
1/3 cup plain low-fat yogurt
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon coarse salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Salad:
1 cup halved cherry tomatoes
1 cup peeled and diced English cucumber
3 3/4 ounces canned salmon, drained and flaked
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh chives
1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh dill

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
Whisk yogurt, lemon juice, olive oil, honey, lemon zest, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until vinaigrette is smooth.
Mix tomatoes, cucumber, salmon, parsley, chives, and dill with the orzo; add vinaigrette and toss until coated.
