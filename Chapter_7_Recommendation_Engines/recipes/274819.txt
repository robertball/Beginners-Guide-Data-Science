Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups quick-cooking oats
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup butter-flavored shortening
1 cup buttermilk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Cut in shortening and mix until just a few chunks remain. Add buttermilk and vanilla extract; stir until combined.
Shape dough into individual scones, about 3 inches across and 1 inch thick. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before lightly dusting with powdered sugar.
