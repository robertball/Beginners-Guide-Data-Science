Ingredients:
1 whole chicken
10 carrots
2 large onions
3 stalks celery
fresh parsley

Directions:
Using the largest pot you have, fill half of it with chicken parts (legs and thighs make the most flavorful soup).
Add about two large onions, a few celery stalks, and some parsley. Season with salt and fill pot with water.
Simmer for about 4 hours and then strain through a colander or strainer, saving the broth.
Skim off top layer of fat (don't worry if you can't get it all).
Puree carrots in a blender and return to the broth.
Remove chicken skin from the chicken parts and return to the broth. Onions, celery, and parsley should not be used at the start of the SCD regimen because fibrous parts may cause problems.
