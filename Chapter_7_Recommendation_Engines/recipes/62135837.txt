Ingredients:
1 medium onion chopped fine
2 10 oz cans tomatoes with green chiles-drained
2 15 oz cans black-eyed peas-drained
1 15 oz can kidney beans-drained & rinsed
1 15 oz can corn-drained
1/2 cup jalapenos (sliced, pickled, drained)
2 tablespoons garlic powder
12 oz zesty italian dressing

Directions:
Drain all vegetables really well.
Combine all ingredients, stir.
Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours until all flavors combine.
Serve with tortilla chips or favorite crackers.
Note, I've substituted various peas and beans in place of the ones above and it turned out great. To cut the heat, omit the jalapenos and/or use tomatoes without green chiles.
