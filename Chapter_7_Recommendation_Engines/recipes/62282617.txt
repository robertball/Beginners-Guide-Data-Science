Pasta Salad Recipe

https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 package small shell macaroni
Any combination of the following chopped vegetables:
cucumber
tomatoes
radishes
green onion
bell pepper
1 1/2 - 2 cans medium black olives
Hellman's real mayonnaise
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook the macaroni as directed.  Rinse in cold water and refrigerate while chopping the vegetables.
Chop generous amounts of veggies and place in a large bowl for mixing.
Drain olives and cut each one in half and add to bowl.
Mix veggies, olives, shell macaroni, salt and pepper with mayo (add a couple of large spoonfuls, mix, and add more if needed).  There should be a good coating of mayo, but not too thick.
Taste for seasonings (plenty of pepper is good.)  Refrigerate an hour or so before serving.  This makes a large bowl full and is great for entertaining.
I personally use all the vegetables except the bell peppers (ex-hubby didn't like).  The combination of black olives, cucumber, tomato, radishes, green onion, and black pepper is really good.
