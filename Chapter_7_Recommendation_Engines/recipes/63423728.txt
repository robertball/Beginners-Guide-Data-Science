Ingredients:
•2 lbs of lean ground port or a mixture of beef, pork and veal ground together
•1 medium onion, chopped
•1 Tbsp minced garlic
•1 cup breadcrumbs or 1 medium raw potato, diced (*see Cooks Notes)
•Salt and pepper to taste
•¼ tsp ground cloves or nutmeg
•6-8 inches of uncooked celery stalk, finely chopped
•½ cup water
•1 deep dish double crust pie shell

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.
On medium heat, saute ground meat for 5 minutes.  Add onion, seasonings, and chopped celery.  Cover and cook for 10 minutes.  Add either bread crumbs and water OR diced potato. Cover and cook until all vegetables are soft.
Transfer mixture to pie shell.  Top with second pie crust; seal edges with thumbprints, two fingers, or the tines of a fork.  Brush top with beaten egg yolk and a tsp of milk (or a mixture of milk and melted butter).  Both methods will produce a golden finish to the pie top.  Cut vents in the center.
Bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Serve warm.
While pie is baking, prepare side dishes.  Heat on stove or microwave.  Remove from heat, cover and keep warm on stove, or in separate bowls on a warming tray.
