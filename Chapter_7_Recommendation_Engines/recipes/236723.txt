Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 lemon, juiced
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 (4 ounce) salmon fillets

Directions:
Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, olive oil, lemon juice, cornstarch, garlic powder, and black pepper together in a saucepan; cook over medium-high heat until sauce is thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Arrange salmon fillets on the prepared baking sheet. Brush sauce on both sides of each fillet. Fold aluminum foil loosely over fillets and seal edges together creating a packet.
Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 12 to 15 minutes.
Bring remaining marinade to a boil and serve alongside cooked salmon.

Description: 
A simple soy sauce and brown sugar marinade, with hints of lemon and garlic, are the perfect salty-sweet complement to rich salmon fillets. 
Adding vinegar or fish sauce and white pepper will emerge new flavors to create a Filipino or Thai twist!
 For more of a twist, use other types of fish, like cod, catfish or tilapia. You can even use it on chicken! Trust the cooking of the fillets and do not be tempted to open or you will lose valuable time and heat.
