Ingredients:
3 cups water
2 cups quinoa
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1 fresh jalapeno pepper, chopped
1/2 cucumber, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup chopped green onion
3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
1 lemon, juiced

Directions:
Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan. Remove from the heat and stir in the quinoa. Cover and let stand until the couscous absorbs the water entirely, about 10 minutes; fluff with a fork.
While the couscous soaks, stir the feta cheese, jalapeno pepper, cucumber, green onion, mint, basil, cilantro, parsley, cumin, cayenne pepper, and lemon juice in a large bowl. Add the prepared couscous and mix well.
