Ingredients:
8 cloves garlic, finely chopped
4 red chili peppers, seeded and chopped
Olive oil as needed
2 lb fresh shrimp, peeled and deveined
Coarse sea salt

Directions:
Divide garlic and chilies among 8 individual, flameproof ramekins.
To each ramekin add enough oil to just cover shrimp when added later.  Heat over medium-high heat until garlic turns golden brown, being careful not to burn garlic; approximately 5 minutes.
Add shrimp and remove from heat after 1 minute.
Sprinkle with coarse salt and serve immediately.

Description: 
My husband's version of garlic shrimp that he had as part of a tapas platter in Spain.  Simple, and fabulously different!  Be sure to serve with lots of crusty bread!
