Ingredients:
cooking spray
3/4 cup half-and-half
1/2 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3 medium potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup shredded Gruyere cheese
1/4 cup bread crumbs, divided
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan with cooking spray.
Combine half-and-half, milk, salt, pepper, and garlic powder in a large saucepan; bring to a boil. Add potatoes and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until the potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat.
Add Cheddar cheese, Gruyere cheese, and 1/8 cup bread crumbs; stir gently until combined.
Pour potatoes into the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and remaining bread crumbs.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is crunchy, about 30 minutes.
