Description: 
This is a modification of my father's hoppin' john recipe. The only difference between his and mine is the use of tomatoes. It's a great recipe for the holidays (New Year's) or any time during winter months. There are many versions of this recipe here, but this one is quick so you can throw it together after a long day at work for the whole family to enjoy!Modified from: Quick Hoppin' John Soup
