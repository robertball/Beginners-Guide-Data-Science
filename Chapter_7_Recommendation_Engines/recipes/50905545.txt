Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 large chopped onion
1 pkg. taco seasoning
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp. cumin
1/8 teaspoon garlic salt
12 (8 inch) flour tortillas
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
8 ounces shredded Colby cheese
2 (19 ounce) cans enchilada sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a heavy saucepan or skillet, brown the ground beef taco seasoning and onions. Season the ground beef mixture with garlic, cumin and garlic salt and set aside. Heat enchilada sauce in pan large enough for tortillas. Dip each tortilla in sauce.
Spoon some meat mixture and cheese into the center of each tortilla, roll them up and arrange them in a 9x13 inch baking dish or oblong pan. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over the rolled enchiladas and top with any remaining meat or cheese.
Bake in the preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes.
