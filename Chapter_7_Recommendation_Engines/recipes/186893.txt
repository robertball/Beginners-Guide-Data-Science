Description: 
Great winter salad with all raw veggies! You have to try it to believe how wonderful it is.  Our 3 girls (6 and under) call it 'Sister Slaw' and will it eat before the rest of the meal. Massage the salad with your hands, especially the kale, to get the dressing worked into the veggies. This is critical and helps soften everything and really is the most important part!
