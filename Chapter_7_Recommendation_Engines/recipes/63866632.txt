* Cook in: Double stacked 2 aluminum foil pans*

Directions:
Cut potatoes very thin. Set sliced potatoes in 12x9" aluminum foil pans -*double layer the pans*(I buy the cheap throw-away pans)
In saucepan, add 1 stick of butter on low heat, let melt slowly, add heavy whipping cream, milk, pepper, salt, and onions. Blend well over low heat until warm, but not boiling.
Pour warm mixture over potatoes in aluminum pan.
Bake at 350 degrees for 2-2 1/2 hours, uncovered. Watch closely. Serve when potatoes have a nice golden brown top.

Description: 
This is my favorite recipe that my mother finally gave to me! These scalloped potatoes are wonderful every time. I swear it is the pans that she cooks them in that make them so great.
