Ingredients:
6 oz. whole-wheat fettuccine
2 tsp toasted sesame oil, plus more for noodles
Juice of 1 lime
2 tbsp warm water
1 1/2 tbsp chunky peanut butter
1 1/2 tbsp. low-sodium soy sauce
2 tsp chili sauce, such as sriracha
2 c. shredded chicken
1 red or yellow bell pepper, sliced
2 c. sugar snap peas
1 c. cooked edamame (optional)
Chopped peanuts, sesame seeds, or chopped scallions (optional)

Directions:
1.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to package instructions. Drain the pasta and toss in a large bowl with a bit of sesame oil and rice wine vinegar to keep the noodles from sticking.
2.Combine the lime juice, water, peanut butter, soy sauce, chili sauce, and sesame oil in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave 45 seconds, then stir to create a uniform sauce. Add the sauce to the noodles and toss to mix. Stir the chicken, bell pepper, sugar snap peas, and edamame if using. Top individual servings with peanuts, sesame seeds, or scallions if you like.
