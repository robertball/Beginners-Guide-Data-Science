1 tablespoon chia seeds
1 tablespoon flax meal
1 cup frozen blueberries
1 scoop (1 oz.) vanilla protein powder

Directions:
Add ingredients to the blender in the order listed.  If using frozen fruits, make sure to add them last as it will be easier to blend.  If using fresh, not frozen fruit, you may need to add a few ice cubes in order to thicken it up.   Blend on high for 30 seconds.
