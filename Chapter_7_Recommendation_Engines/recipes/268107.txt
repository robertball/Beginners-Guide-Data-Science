Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 shallots, minced
1 (28 ounce) can canned peeled Italian tomatoes, coarsely chopped, juices reserved
1 tablespoon Italian herb seasoning, or to taste
salt to taste
ground white pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream, or more to taste
1/2 cup dry white wine
10 ounces smoked salmon, chopped
1/2 cup dry sherry
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter and olive oil in a pot over medium heat and cook shallots until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and 1/2 the juice. Season with Italian herbs, salt, and white pepper. Cover pot and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove pot from heat and puree contents using a stick blender until smooth. Stir in cream.
Return pot to stove and bring to a boil. Add white wine, smoked salmon, and sherry. Season with salt, white pepper, and basil and heat until warmed through but do not boil.
Serve spaghetti with tomato-smoked salmon sauce and freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
My family is a big fan of smoked salmon in pasta, and this is one of my favorites. The sauce has a lovely cream-and-tomato flavor, and once you add in the smoked salmon, it's heaven!
