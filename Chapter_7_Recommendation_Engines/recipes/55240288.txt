Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup chopped green onion
4 cups fresh baby spinach
1 cup frozen corn
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon ground cumin
6 ounces Pepper Jack cheese, shredded
1 (14 ounce) package egg roll wrappers
vegetable oil for frying
Add:  1 cup chopped chicken, 1 tsp. chipotle powder (or pepper).
Can fill in tortillas as well.

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onions, and cook until tender. Stir in spinach, corn, black beans, and lime juice. Season with salt and cumin. Remove from heat, and stir in cheese.
Place 1/4 cup of filling in the center of each egg roll wrapper. Fold in the sides, and roll egg rolls; dampen the edges with a small amount of water to seal.
In a large heavy skillet, heat enough vegetable oil to cover egg rolls over medium-high heat. Working in batches, carefully place egg rolls in hot oil, and cook until golden brown. Remove to paper towels.
