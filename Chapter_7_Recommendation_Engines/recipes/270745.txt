Ingredients:
Meatballs:
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 cup minced cilantro
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 scallions, minced
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2 tablespoons soy sauce
Sweet Soy Dipping Sauce:
2 slices fresh ginger, or more to taste
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 box toothpicks

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine turkey, cilantro, bread crumbs, egg, scallions, vegetable oil, sesame oil, and soy sauce in a large bowl. Gently mix with your hands until combined. Roll tablespoon-sized scoops between your palms to form meatballs. Arrange meatballs on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until well browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce. Smash ginger with the heavy side of a knife and place in a small pot. Add brown sugar, soy sauce, rice vinegar. Stir over medium-low until sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes. Simmer, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Fish out ginger and divide sauce among small cups.
Serve meatballs alongside sauce, with toothpicks for dipping.
