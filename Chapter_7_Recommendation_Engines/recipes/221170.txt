Description: 
Steamed head of cauliflower without butter, milk, extra calories, or carbs. Very light, very tasty. My 12-year-old child is very picky, but absolutely loves my faux mashed potatoes as they are very similar in texture and taste to the real thing. As an extra we've even added roasted garlic cloves. Heavenly!
