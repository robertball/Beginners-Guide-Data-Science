Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat butter and sugar in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; beat in egg and vanilla extract. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl and mix the dry ingredients thoroughly into butter mixture. Drop cookies about 2 inches apart, 1 teaspoon at a time, onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool cookies on wire racks.

Description: 
This recipe comes from my favorite cookbook from a church. It is simple, easy, inexpensive and delicious! Not to mention it tastes better than the vanilla wafers you can buy at the store! You can make the cookies bigger if you'd like, they just won't have as crispy of an outside. We like to add a slice of banana between two cookies, dip them in chocolate, and then freeze them (;
