Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups apricot nectar
1 1/2 cups chopped pitted dates
1/2 cup chopped dried apricots
1 tablespoon grated orange peel
1 1/4 teaspoons dried rosemary, crushed
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup sugar
1 egg
1/3 cup evaporated milk
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine apricot nectar, dates and apricots. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in orange peel and rosemary; cook for 10-15 minutes. In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add egg and milk. Combine flour and baking soda; add to creamed mixture alternately with date mixture, beating just until combined. Pour into two greased and floured 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 35-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks.
