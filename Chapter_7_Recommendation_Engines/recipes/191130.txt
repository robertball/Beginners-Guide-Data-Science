Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1/2 small onion, chopped
1 (5 ounce) can tuna, drained
1/3 cup sour cream
3 tablespoons cream cheese
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives
1/8 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
5 eggs
1/4 cup milk
2 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in a large skillet. Cook and stir onion over medium heat until onions begin to brown.
Combine tuna, sour cream, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, olives, dill, garlic powder, and cooked onion in a large bowl.
Beat eggs with milk in a large bowl. Heat 2 teaspoons of oil in the skillet used to cook the onions. Pour the egg mixture into the hot pan. As eggs set, lift the edges to allow the liquid to run underneath for even cooking. When eggs are almost fully set, spoon tuna mixture onto one half of the eggs; fold the untopped half over the filling. Cover pan, and remove from heat. Allow omelet to rest in covered pan until the cheese is melted.
