Ingredients:
1 (20 ounce) can DOLEÂ® Pineapple Chunks, drained, juice reserved
1/2 cup reserved pineapple juice
1/2 cup orange juice
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice or cinnamon
10 bamboo skewers*
20 medium DOLE Strawberries
3 DOLE Bananas, cut in 1-inch rounds
2 DOLE Mangos, cut in 2-inch pieces
Vanilla ice cream (optional)

Directions:
Heat grill to medium.
Combine orange juice, pineapple juice, lemon juice, honey, allspice and cornstarch in small saucepan. Over medium heat, stirring occasionally, bring to a boil and cook until thickened. Remove from heat; cool slightly.
Thread pineapple, banana, strawberry and mango on wooden skewers. Repeat so there are 2 pieces of each fruit on each skewer. Repeat for remaining skewers.
Grill kabobs 3 to 5 minutes per side until fruit starts to brown. Generously brush fruit with sauce while grilling.
Serve skewer alone or with vanilla ice cream. Pour remaining sauce over fruit and ice cream to taste.

Description: 
You don't need chocolate for these sundaes! After trying a homemade hot fruit sauce over ice cream, you'll never go back to the same old fudge again.
