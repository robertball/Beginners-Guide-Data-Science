Ingredients:
1 pound tilapia fillets
1 teaspoon tamarind paste
1/4 cup hot water
1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated
2 cloves garlic, pressed
salt to taste
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste

Directions:
Rinse tilapia fillets and dry with paper towels. Dissolve tamarind paste in hot water in a bowl; stir ginger, garlic, salt, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, and cumin into tamarind mixture to make a paste. Rub paste over fish and let stand 15 minutes to absorb flavors (or longer in refrigerator if desired).
Heat vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook fish with tamarind paste in the hot oil until the flesh is opaque and flaky, about 4 minutes on the first side and 2 minutes on the second side. Drizzle with lemon juice.

Description: 
This simple dish stands out from the ordinary because of the subtle tartness of the tamarind and the heat of the pepper.
