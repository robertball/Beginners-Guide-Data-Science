Ingredients:
1 pound zucchini squash
1/4 cup prepared pesto
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup panko bread crumbs, divided
1 pound plum tomatoes, cut into 1/4-inch slices
8 slices SARGENTO® Sliced Reduced Sodium Provolone Cheese

Directions:
Wash zucchini but do not dry. Cut crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices; transfer to a microwave-safe casserole dish. Cover with lid. Cook in microwave oven 3 to 4 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain in colander; rinse with cold water to stop cooking. Transfer to clean kitchen towel or paper towels to dry. Toss zucchini with pesto sauce and pepper.
Sprinkle 1/2 cup breadcrumbs in bottom of 8 or 9-inch baking dish. Spoon half of zucchini mixture evenly over crumbs. Arrange half of tomato slices over zucchini; top with 4 slices cheese. Repeat layering with remaining zucchini mixture, tomatoes, cheese and breadcrumbs.
Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.
