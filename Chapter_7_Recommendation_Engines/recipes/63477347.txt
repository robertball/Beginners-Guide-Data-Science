Combine Rice Chex, Golden Grahams, coconut and almonds in a large mixing bowl.  In a medium-sized saucepan, cook butter, sugar, and corn syrup to "soft ball" stage, about 234 degrees on a candy thermometer.  Pour over cereal mixture and stir until all is well coated.  Pour mixture onto two large cookie sheets to cool.  Stir occasionally to prevent clumping. Store in airtight container.
