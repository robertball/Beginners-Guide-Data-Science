Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
8 large red potatoes (I just use reg. potatoes)
1 C. Ranch dressing
1 C. Sour cream
1 C. Chedar Cheese divided in half  (I always use more..we like a lot)
1/4 C. crumpled bacon or more if like bacon.
1 tsp salt (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cut potatoes in quarters.  Put in large pan and cover the potatoes with water.  Bring to a boil about 10 min. and then drain really good. While the potatoes are boiling I like to cook my bacon so it has time to cool.  Then in another bowl combine ranch dressing, sour cream, half cheddar cheese and bacon.  Add potatoes and stir well.  Spoon into a baking dish and top with remaining cheese. Bake until bubbly..about 20 min.  This doesn't look the greatest, but it's good and my family loves it.

Description: 
If you like to make different dishes with potatoes, you have to try this one! I don't buy the store Ranch, I think it tastes better when you make it with the packets.  I serve 3 people with this and we always have leftovers. I'm not sure where I got this recipe from, but I hope you like it too.
