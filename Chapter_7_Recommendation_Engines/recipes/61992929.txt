Description: 
These muffins are extra large and yummy with the sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top edge for a wonderful extra-generously-sized deli style muffin.  Add extra blueberries too, if you want!Modified from: To Die For Blueberry Muffins
