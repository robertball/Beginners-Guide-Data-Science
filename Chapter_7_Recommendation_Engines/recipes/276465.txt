Description: 
Although it is tradition to flavor chili with a lot of heat, this fall chili (flavored with pumpkin) is milder than most. Autumn recipes don't have to be spicy to keep you warm, just piping hot! This one is easy to put together in an Instant Pot®. Top with shredded Cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and avocado slices. Add taco chips to the edge of the bowl, or sprinkle with corn chips. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro.
