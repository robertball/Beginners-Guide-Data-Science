Description: 
Otherwise known as 'Goop,' this chip dip is the most delectable dip you'll ever taste! It was created by my late aunt.  Folks can't seem to get enough of it. Don't tell them the ingredients till they've tasted it! Serve with potato chips, pretzels or your favorite vegetables. They'll be licking the bowl!  Note: you can add more or less of the anchovy paste and onion to suit your tastes.  If you like a thinner dip, add a little more milk.
