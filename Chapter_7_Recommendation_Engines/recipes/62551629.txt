Ingredients:
1 2-pound roasted chicken, skin discarded, meat removed from bones and shredded (4 cups)
1/2 cup prepared barbecue sauce
1 cup canned black beans, rinsed
1/2 cup frozen corn, thawed, or canned corn, drained
1/4 cup reduced-fat sour cream
4 leaves romaine lettuce
4 10-inch whole-wheat tortillas
2 limes, cut in wedges

Directions:
1.Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, barbecue sauce, beans, corn and sour cream; stir to combine. Cook until hot, 4 to 5 minutes.
2.Assemble the wraps by placing a lettuce leaf in the center of each tortilla and topping with one-fourth of the chicken mixture; roll as you would a burrito. Slice in half diagonally and serve warm, with lime wedges.

Description: 
These burritos are something of a Tex-Mex wonder: tangy barbecue sauce, some roast chicken (or rotisserie chicken) and vegetables, all wrapped up in tortillas. For the best taste, look for a fiery barbecue sauce without added corn syrup.
