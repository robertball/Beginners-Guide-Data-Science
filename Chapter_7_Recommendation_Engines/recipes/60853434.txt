Ingredients:
1 serving of cooking spray
1/2 lb uncooked ground turkey breast
16 oz fat free canned refried beans
8 oz of salsa
4-1/2oz canned green chili peppers, mild, drained and sliced
1 tsp chili powder
3 TBS scallions, thinly sliced
1 cup reduced fat shredded monterey jack cheese
8 large burrito-size wheat flour tortillas
1 cup salsa
1/2 cup fate free sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Coat a large skillet with cooking spray. Coat a 13x9x2 baking dish with cooking spray.
Add turkey to skillet and cook over medium-high heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Drain any access liquid from the pan and then add beans, 8oz of salsa, chili peppers, chili powder and scallions. Cook until heated through, about 3 minutes; stir in cheese.
Meanwhile, wrap tortillas in foil; warm in oven for 10 minutes.
Assemble chimichangas by spooning about 1/2 cup of the mixture into the torilla, fold in sides and roll up.
Place chimichangas in prepared baking dish. Bake uncovered until torillas are crisp and brown, about 20 minutes. Serve each topped with 2 TBS of salsa and 1 TBS of sour cream.
