Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 cup water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
4 (0.13 ounce) packages unsweetened fruit-flavored drink mix (such as Kool-AidÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Line 48 mini muffin cups with mini paper liners.
Beat cake mix, water, vegetable oil, eggs, and unsweetened drink mix powder until batter is smooth and evenly colored.
Fill the prepared mini muffin cups about 2/3 full of batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cupcakes are set in the middle, about 15 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake should come out clean.
Allow mini cupcakes to cool before decorating.

Description: 
I made these cupcakes for Easter and they were a great success. They're easy and festive. I separated the mix into 3 bowls and added a different flavor of drink mix to each bowl - about a tablespoon to each bowl. I used grape, cherry, and orange. Frost however you like and decorate with sprinkles, colored sugar, etc.
