Description: 
This is a very easy recipe that always gets rave reviews and many recipe requests. A co-worker who is from Mexico shared it with me. It's very quick to prepare, and can be served immediately. I like to make it at least an hour before serving, so the flavors can marry. The key ingredient is the El Pato® Tomato Sauce (yellow can), which can be found in the ethnic section of your supermarket. You may have to go to a Mexican market if you can't find it at your usual supermarket. Serve with tortilla chips. Leftovers are great the next day, too!
