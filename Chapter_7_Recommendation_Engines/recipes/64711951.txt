Ingredients:
•	25 ounces yellow potatoes (such as Yukon Gold)
•	1 tbsp rock salt
•	2 spring onions, chopped(white parts only)
•	1/2 cup minced Italian flat-leaf parsley
•	2 cloves of garlic, slightly crushed to release the flavor
•	4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, divided
•	1 tbsp white wine vinegar
•	Salt and pepper to taste
•	1 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:
1.	Add the potatoes and 1 tbsp rock salt to a large pot filled with cold water. Bring to a boil. Cook the potatoes until tender, but not mushy, about ten minutes depending on their size.
2.	While the potatoes are cooking, whisk together 3 tbsp olive oil and one tbsp white wine vinegar in a small bowl. Add the two crushed garlic cloves. Set aside.
3.	Once the potatoes are ready, drain and allow to cool enough to handle. Peel them and cut into one-inch cubes putting them into a large serving bowl. Sprinkle the onion and parsley evenly over the potatoes and lightly toss to distribute the onion and parsley. Salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle the oil and vinegar mixture evenly over the potatoes lightly tossing taking care not to break the potatoes.
4.	Top with the remaining tbsp of oil and red pepper flakes immediately before serving.

Description: 
Born vegan, this is a classic potato salad that can be found on Italian tables from the North to the South. In Italy you’ll find it everywhere: formal luncheons, family get togethers, weeknight dinners, and even in hospital and school cafeterias. Many Italians add cooked green beans. Leftovers are delicious tossed with pesto and pasta. Buon appetito!
