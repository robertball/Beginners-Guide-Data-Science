Ingredients:
1 shortcrust pastry crust
1 2/3 cups ripe persimmons, peeled and pureed
1 (14 ounce) can evaporated milk
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 pinches ground ginger
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a 9-inch pie plate with the pastry crust. Cover the crust with a sheet of parchment paper and fill with dried beans, lentils, or rice.
Blind bake the crust in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove and discard parchment paper and beans.
Whisk together persimmon puree, milk, eggs, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt. Pour the mixture into the crust.
Bake pie in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until a skewer inserted near the centre comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Serve cold.

Description: 
This persimmon pie has a similar texture to pumpkin pie, but features the sweet honey-like flavor of persimmons. Since ripe persimmons are so naturally sweet, this pie doesn't contain any added sugar.
