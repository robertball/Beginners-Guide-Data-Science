Ingredients:
3 cups gluten-free rolled oats
1 cup chopped, pitted dates
1 cup chopped hazelnuts
1/2 cup chopped almonds
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup coarsely chopped gluten-free pretzels
3 tablespoons chia seeds
2/3 cup water
1/2 cup ground flax seeds
1 cup pumpkin puree
2 ripe bananas, mashed
2 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper.
Gently mix oats, dates, hazelnuts, almonds, raisins, cranberries, pretzels, and chia seeds in a large bowl.
Mix water and flax seeds together in a small bowl. Let stand until thickened, about 5 minutes.
Mix pumpkin puree, bananas, and honey together in a medium bowl. Gently mix into the oat mixture until soft and evenly combined. Spread onto the cookie sheet in an even 1/2-inch layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned but still slightly gooey, 25 to 33 minutes. Let cool before cutting into bars.
