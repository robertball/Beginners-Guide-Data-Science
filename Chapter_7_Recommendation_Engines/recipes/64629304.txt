Ingredients:
2 filet mignons (about 8 ounces each)
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon Kosher salt
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided

Directions:
Set the steaks out on the counter at least 30 minutes before you plan on cooking them to take the chill off.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Pat the steaks dry and then brush each steak with the oil. Mix the salt and pepper on a plate, then roll each steak in the salt and pepper mixture, liberally covering all sides.
Heat a well-seasoned cast iron skillet over high heat (yes, all the way up — this is key!). Once the skillet is very hot, add the steaks to the pan. Sear them evenly on all sides, getting a nice brown crust all over*. It should take about 2 minutes per side to get a good sear.
Remove the pan from heat, place a pat of butter on top of each steak, and then transfer the skillet to the oven. Cook the steaks until internal temperature reaches your preferred doneness**:
120 F for rare
125 F for medium rare
135 F for medium
Remove the steaks from the skillet steaks and cover tightly with aluminum foil . Allow to rest at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving.
*Searing a steak over high heat is most likely going to create enough smoke in your home to set off your fire alarm. Make sure to do this in a well-ventilated area, and turn on the fan above your stove. I usually crack open a window and a door, too.
**I find about 5 minutes in the oven makes my steak perfectly medium rare, just how I like it. This does vary based on the thickness of the steak, so it’s best to use a meat thermometer.

Description: 
This isn’t a knock on Bern’s (the steak was delicious), but rather a revelation that a quality piece of meat prepared with the right technique can produce a steak that rivals even the finest steakhouse in the world. Of course, I’d never turn up a trip to Bern’s (or any steakhouse for that matter), but I love knowing I can make something restaurant quality myself, for a fraction of the price.

Every now and then, I’ll treat myself to a steak in the middle of the week. It’s one of the easiest things I make, too  no chopping, long cooking times, or messing up a bunch of pans. The trick is gett
