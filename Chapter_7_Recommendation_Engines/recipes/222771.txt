Ingredients:
8 small ripe bananas
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
2 1/2 cups whole milk
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 cup light whipping cream
1 cup chopped almonds (optional)

Directions:
Place bananas in a food processor; puree until smooth.
Stir sweetened condensed milk with pudding mix in a large bowl. Stir in banana puree, whole milk, heavy whipping cream, and light whipping cream until smooth. Chill pudding mixture in freezer for 1 hour, scraping down sides and stir after 30 minutes.
Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches "soft-serve" consistency. Gently stir in almonds. Transfer ice cream to a one- or two-quart lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight.
