Ingredients:
3 lbs corned beef brisket
½ cup black pepper
1 tbsp paprika
1 tbsp garlic powder
1 packet pickling spice
COLESLAW
1 cup mayonnaise
1 tbsp salt
2 tbsp black pepper
2 tbsp white vinegar
¼ cup sugar
1 lemon, juiced
1 red cabbage
1 green cabbage
Burger buns
Your favorite sauces/mustard for serving
Sauerkraut (optional)

Directions:
Combine the black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and pickling spice in a small bowl and mix well.
Generously sprinkle the spice mixture over both sides of the corned beef brisket.
Smoke the corned beef brisket at about 225°F for 4-6 hours.
Combine the mayonnaise, salt, pepper, white vinegar, sugar, and lemon juice in a medium bowl and whisk until smooth.
Cut each cabbage into quarters and remove the core.
Thinly slice the cabbage quarters and add to a large bowl.
Pour the dressing over the sliced cabbage and mix well with hands.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve.
Thinly slice the smoked corned beef and pile it atop the burger buns.
Finish the sandwiches with your favorite condiments and toppings. (Sriracha aoli, stone ground mustard, regular yellow mustard, and sauerkraut are all great options!)
Serve the coleslaw on the side or try it on top of your sandwich. The choice is yours!
