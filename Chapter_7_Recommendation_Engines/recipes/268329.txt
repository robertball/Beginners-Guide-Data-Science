Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (8 ounce) package tempeh, crumbled
1/2 cup chopped zucchini
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped carrot
1 3/4 cups milk
1 (3.5 ounce) package dry Alfredo sauce mix (such as KnorrÂ®)
1 tablespoon butter
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
4 tablespoons pesto
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Saute garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tempeh, zucchini, red pepper, and carrot. Cook and stir until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Add milk, sauce mix, and butter. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Drain spaghetti and add to the sauce. Mix in pesto. Cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Top with Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes.
