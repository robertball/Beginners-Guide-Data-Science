Ingredients:
10 1/2 ounces Blueberry vodka
3 ounces simple syrup
3 & 1/2 (1/4 ounce) packets of gelatin powder
Approx 60 Large Fresh Blueberries

Directions:
Lightly spray your ice cube molds with cooking spray ~ wipe with a paper towel so that there is only the barest layer.
Combine the vodka and simple syrup in a small saucepan. Add gelatin powder to the vodka mixture.
Stir the ingredients over low heat, until the gelatin is dissolved and incorporated into the vodka mixture, about 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.
Place a few blueberries in the bottom of each individual ice cube mold, and carefully pour the vodka mixture into each.
Refrigerate the ice cube tray until set, preferably overnight. These cocktails will keep, refrigerated, for as long as 2 days.
