These BLT Egg Bites make the perfect weekday breakfast! It's nice to do any prep work the night before such as chopping vegetables to save some time in the mornings. The kids can take their egg bites on the go or enjoy as a meal with their favorite salsa and a side of fruit. They make quick-fix leftovers the next day too.
