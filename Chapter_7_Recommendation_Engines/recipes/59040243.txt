Ingredients:
1 pound sweet Italian sausage links, casings removed
3/4 pound lean ground beef
1/2 cup minced onion
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (4oz) can tomato paste
1 (26oz) jar of marinara sauce
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
12 no-boil lasagna noodles
15 ounces ricotta cheese
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups mozzarella cheese, grated
1/2 cup grated Parmesan/Romano cheese blend
1 tablespoon salt free garlic/herb seasoning
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
In a dutch oven,  over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil,  onion and garlic until softened and slightly browned.  Add the sausage and ground beef and cook until browned and cooked through.  Stir in the tomato paste, stirring for about 2 minutes allowing the tomato paste to caramelize slightly. Pour in jar of marinara sauce and reduce heat to low and allow to simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  In mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, Parmesan/Romano cheese, salt, garlic powder, and garlic/herb seasoning.

Preheat oven to 350  degrees F
To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.  Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
