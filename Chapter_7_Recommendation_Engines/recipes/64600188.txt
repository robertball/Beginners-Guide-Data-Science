Ingredients:
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup sugar
1 large egg
1-3/4 cups sugar
1 cup canola oil
3 large eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tsp baking powder
2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking soda
2 cups chopped peeled tart apples
1 cup shredded carrots
1/2 cup chopped pecans, toasted
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup butter, cubed
2 Tbsp milk
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 cup chopped pecans, toasted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°. Grease and flour a 10-in. fluted tube pan. In a small bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth; beat in egg.
In a large bowl, beat sugar, oil and eggs until well blended. In another bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt and baking soda; gradually beat into sugar mixture. Stir in apples, carrots and pecans.
Transfer half of the batter to prepared pan; layer with cream cheese mixture, then remaining batter. Bake 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in cake portion comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
In a large saucepan, combine brown sugar, butter and milk; bring to a boil. Cook and stir 1 minute. Remove from heat; whisk in confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Drizzle over cake. Sprinkle with pecans.
Notes: To remove cakes easily, use solid shortening to grease plain and fluted tube pans. To toast nuts, bake in a shallow pan in a 350° oven for 5-10 minutes or cook in a skillet over low heat until lightly browned, stirring occasionally.
