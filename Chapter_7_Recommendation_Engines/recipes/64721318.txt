Ingredients:
1/4 cup granulated white sugar
1/4 cup raw sugar
3/4 cup toasted hazelnuts
4 ounces dark chocolate bar (70% or 75% cacao), chopped
1/4 cup powdered milk
1/4 cup light vegetable oil

Directions:
Blend the two sugars in a food processor or blender until pulverized. You may have to do this in batches to not burn the motor.
Add the hazelnuts and continue blending until you get a smooth cream. Meanwhile, microwave the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl at 180W in two minutes cycles until melted. Add the powdered milk and blend to combine. Add the oil. Blend again.
Add the melted chocolate to the cream and blend until fully incorporated.
Pour into a glass jar. Allow the cream to cool before sealing and refrigerating.
