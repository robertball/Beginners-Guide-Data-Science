Description: 
These cookies are great for breastfeeding mothers! They are moist and super yummy and they help boost and/or maintain milk supply. And yes, husbands can eat them too! I have to hide these from my hubby when I make them! The brewers' yeast, wheat germ, flax seed, and whole oats are why these cookies help with milk supply for lactating mothers. Don't skip those ingredients!
