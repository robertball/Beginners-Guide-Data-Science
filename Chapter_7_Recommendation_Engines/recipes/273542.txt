Avocado Brioche Recipe

Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/3 cup almond milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 ripe avocados, mashed
2 tablespoons almond milk
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 cups bread flour
2 tablespoons vegan margarine (such as Earth BalanceÂ®)
cooking spray
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Combine yeast and 1/3 cup almond milk in the bowl of a stand mixer and let sit for 5 minutes.
Add all-purpose flour, mashed avocados, 2 tablespoons almond milk, sugar, and salt to the yeast mixture and mix on low speed until combined. Add bread flour and mix well until blended. Knead on medium-low speed until dough is smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes; dough will appear sticky, but it will not stick to fingers.
Add vegan margarine to the dough and knead on medium-high speed until incorporated, about 1 minute. Transfer dough to an oil-coated bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
Punch dough down, cover, and let rise again for another 2 hours.
Combine olive oil and salt in a small bowl.
Divide dough into 4 equal portions and shape each into a smooth ball. Coat a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Place dough balls into prepared pan and brush with about 1/2 the oil mixture, reserving the rest. Cover loosely with oiled plastic wrap and let rise until loaf fills the pan and mushrooms over it, about 1 hour more.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Brush remaining oil mixture on top of the loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
