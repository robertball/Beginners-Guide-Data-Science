Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package firm tofu, cubed
3 tablespoons light soy sauce, or more to taste
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk

8 ounces broccoli florets
1 (4 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1  leek, cut lengthwise, washed, trimmed, and sliced thin
1  carrot, cut into matchsticks
1 squeeze lemon juice, or to taste
1 pinch white sugar

Directions:
Combine tofu and 3 tablespoons soy sauce in a small bowl and marinate for about 20 minutes.
Remove the solid top layer of coconut cream from the coconut milk can and heat in a wok over medium heat. Add curry paste and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add tofu, broccoli, mushrooms, leek, and carrot and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Pour in remaining coconut milk and simmer until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Season with soy sauce, lemon juice, and sugar.

Description: 
You can use any vegetable combination for this vegan Thai curry. I usually just raid my fridge and use whatever needs to go. The cooking goes really fast, so it is best to do all the prep in advance. Do check the spiciness of your Thai curry paste before using it - there is a wide variety and you don't want to ruin your curry with too much curry paste. Better to start with a smaller amount and then add.
