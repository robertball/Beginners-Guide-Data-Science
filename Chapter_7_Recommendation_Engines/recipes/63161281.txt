Ingredients:
12 oz bag fresh cranberries
3/4 cup orange juice
2/3 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
2 oz gold rum, optional

Directions:
Place all the ingredients in a sauce pan and cook on medium-high for 15-20 minutes or until most of the liquid has reduced – stirring occasionally. You’ll hear the cranberries popping – don’t worry, that’s what you want them to do.
Remove from heat and serve.
Cranberry sauce can be made days ahead and brought to room temperature or slightly heated before serving.
