Ingredients:
1 poblano pepper
3 cloves garlic, peeled
5 ripe tomatoes
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
2 tablespoons lime juice

Directions:
Preheat the broiler.
Place poblano pepper and garlic cloves on a medium baking sheet. Turning pepper frequently, broil at maximum distance from heat until browned, about 15 minutes.
In a food processor, place roasted pepper, roasted garlic, tomatoes, cilantro, cumin, chili powder and lime juice. Process using pulse setting until an evenly chunky texture is obtained. Chill until serving.

Description: 
My mother-in-law loves Tex-Mex but has an onion allergy.  After several attempts, I invented an authentic tasting salsa that derives some of it's smokey flavor from the roasted pepper.  I've taken to roasting the peppers in bulk so I can always have some on hand.
