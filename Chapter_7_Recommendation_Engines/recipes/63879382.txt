Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups fresh milled flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
3 teaspoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
2 large eggs
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
In a food processor, combine the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Cut in butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add eggs and milk, pulsing just until moistened.
Turn onto a well-floured surface. Roll to 3/4-in. thickness; cut with a floured 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Place on a lightly greased baking sheet.
Bake at 450 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
