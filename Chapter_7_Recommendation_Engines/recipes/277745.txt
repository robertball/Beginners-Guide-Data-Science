Ingredients:
1/2 cup mayonnaise (such as Hellman'sÂ®)
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons minced onion
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice (optional)
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pound lean ground turkey
1/2 cup diced fire-roasted red peppers
1/4 cup Italian-style salad dressing
1/4 cup finely minced sweet onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 (12 ounce) package dinner rolls, split and toasted

Directions:
Mix mayonnaise, garlic, onion, lemon juice, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Let set while you make the sliders.
Mix turkey, red peppers, dressing, sweet onion, garlic, oregano, and thyme together in a large mixing bowl. Cover and let sit in a refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes.
Form turkey mixture into patties that are a little larger than your dinner rolls.
Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Cook patties in the hot oil, turning occasionally, until browned and no longer pink in the centers, 5 to 10 minutes per side.
Serve with garlic-onion mayonnaise mixture on toasted dinner rolls.
