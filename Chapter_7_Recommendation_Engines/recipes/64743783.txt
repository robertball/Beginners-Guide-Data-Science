Ingredients:
1/2 cup toasted dock seeds or plantain seeds
1 cup sunflower seeds, soaked for 8 hours and drained
1 cup chia seeds
1 cup flaxseed, ground
3/4 cup rye flour + some for rolling out crackers
3/4 cup acorn flour
3 carrots, finely grated
2 stalks of celery, minced
1 large white onion, minced
5 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon sea salt, plus more for sprinkling
1 tablespoon grapeseed oil, plus more for brushing
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit
In a large bowl, blend together dock seeds, sunflower seeds, flaxseed, chia seeds, rye flour, acorn flour, carrots, celery, onion, garlic and salt
Stir in grapeseed oil and honey until incorporated
Add more rye flour as needed so dough is no longer sticky, but still moist
Let mixture sit for 30 minutes
Divide dough in half and roll out thinly on a floured surface (not paper-thin, but “cracker-thin")
Cut crackers to desired shape and place them on a baking sheet
Crackers can be close together, as they hold their shape as they cook
Gather dough scraps, re-roll, and cut as needed
Repeat with remaining dough half
Brush crackers lightly with grapeseed oil (or rub with fingers), sprinkle with a little more salt
Bake for 15 - 20 minutes
Remove from oven and cool on rack
Store in an airtight container and enjoy for up to 2 weeks
If you live in a humid environment, crackers can be re-toasted in the oven
