Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups fresh strawberries, hulled
1/2 cup white sugar, divided
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone non-stick mat that is larger than the tray to prevent juice from spilling onto the tray.
Combine strawberries, 1/4 cup sugar, and balsamic vinegar in a bowl; toss gently to coat. Transfer to the baking sheet, scraping down the bowl with a spatula to ensure all the liquid is included.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside to cool, about 30 minutes.
Transfer cooled strawberries and all juice to the bowl of a food processor. Add remaining 1/4 cup sugar and cream; mix until smooth.
Pour strawberry mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions until it reaches the creamy texture of a gelato, 40 to 45 minutes. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Fresh strawberries and balsamic vinegar pair perfectly - even more so in this homemade Italian ice cream. I roast the strawberries in the oven for 30 minutes to release all their sweet juice.
