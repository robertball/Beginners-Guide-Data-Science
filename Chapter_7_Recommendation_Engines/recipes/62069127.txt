Ingredients:
1/2 Pound Frozen Shrimp (Tail Off)
1/2 Cup Green Peppers
1/2 Cup Red Peppers
1/2 Cup Onions
1 Tablespoon Vegetable Oil
2 Tablespoons Soy Sauce
1/2 Tbsp. Fajita Seasoning
1/2 Tbsp. Lemon Pepper
1 Package of Crispy Red Tostadas
1 Can Refried Beans
1 Teaspoon Chile Powder

Directions:
Put frozen shrimp in a bowl of warm water to thaw, set aside.
Cut onions and peppers in long thick fajita style slices and set aside. Prepare lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro, and jalape√±os. Arrange on a serving tray with shredded cheese and sour cream, set aside.
Prepare refried beans in a microwave safe bowl. Scoop beans from can, gradually add Chile powder, and mix thoroughly. (This will give the beans some punch!) Microwave on high heat for 2 minutes. Cover to keep beans hot.
Heat a large skillet to high heat and add oil. Add fully thawed and drained shrimp, onions and peppers. Then add soy sauce, fajita seasoning and lemon pepper. Cook until shrimp and veggies are lightly browned and coated with seasonings. (About 5 minutes)
Present Fajita at the table, still sizzling in the skillet with your tostadas, toppings plate and warm beans. Instruct guests to smear beans on tostada, followed with fajita mixture, desired toppings and enjoy!
