Ingredients:
40 mini tart shells (your own or purchased)
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
5 oz. (approx. 1/2 can) sweetened condensed milk
2 TBSP corn syrup
1/2 cup chocolate chips
1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Bake the tart shells until golden brown, following manufacturer's directions.  Cool slightly.
In a heavy saucepan, melt the butter and dissolve the brown sugar in the butter.  Add the condensed milk, corn syrup and chocolate chips and bring to a boil - stirring frequently so it doesn't burn.  Let boil for two minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat and add vanilla and chopped pecans.  Pour immediately into prepared tart shells.
