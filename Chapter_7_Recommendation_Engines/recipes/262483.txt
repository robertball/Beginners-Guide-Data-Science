Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or more to taste
2 russet potatoes, diced
2 carrots, diced, or more to taste
3 stalks celery, diced
1 onion, diced
1 1/2 (32 fluid ounce) containers vegetable broth
2 (8 ounce) packages sliced mushrooms, divided
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons herbes de Provence
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 bay leaf
2 cups chopped kale

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add potatoes, carrots, celery, and onion. Cook and stir until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Add broth, 1 package of mushrooms, salt, herbes de Provence, pepper, and bay leaf. Cook until vegetables are soft, 15 to 20 minutes.
Place kale in a separate saucepan over low heat and add water to cover. Cook until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain excess liquid.
Coarsely chop the second package of mushrooms.
Fill blender halfway with the vegetables and broth. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Pour into a pot. Repeat with remaining vegetables and broth. Pour all of the pureed soup back into the saucepan. Add the kale and chopped mushrooms. Let simmer until mushrooms are just tender, 5 to 10 minutes more.
