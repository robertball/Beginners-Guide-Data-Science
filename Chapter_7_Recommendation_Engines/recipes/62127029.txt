Ingredients:
Mixture A:
6 cups regular rolled oats
5 cups Rice Krispies
2 1/2 cups sweetened coconut flakes, unpacked
2 cups sliced almonds
3/4 cup sunflower seeds, unsalted, TOASTED (not raw)
1/3 cup sesame seeds, TOASTED (not raw)
3 tablespoons oat bran (optional)
1/4 cup golden flax seeds (optional)
3 tablespoons wheat germ (optional)
2 tablespoons cornstarch
3/4 cup rice flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon cardamom
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon allspice
Mixture B:
1 cup honey
1/2 cup vegetable oil
6 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1/4 cup water
5 tablespoons packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
***Mixture C (optional):
1 cup dried fruit:  any combination of cherries, cranberries, apricot, mango, blueberries, banana chips (broken into smaller pieces), pineapple, raisins, etc.

Directions:
Preheat oven 275*F degrees.
In a large bowl, stir together all ingredients in Mixture A.
In a separate, microwave safe bowl, stir together all ingredients of Mixture B.  Microwave on high for 3-4 minutes until sugar has melted and no longer granular.
Combine both mixtures, stir until evenly coated.
Spread onto two large (approximately 12x17) baking sheets (may want to bake on silicone baking mats to prevent sticking).
Bake for approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes.  (For softer/chewier granola, stop baking after 45 minutes.)  DO NOT OVERBAKE, DO NOT BROWN!!
***If you are adding fruit, stir Mixture C into granola halfway into baking time.
Let cool completely.  Gently scoop from pan leaving some large clusters.
Store in airtight container.
