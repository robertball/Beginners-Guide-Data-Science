Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil
2 cups hot water
2 (6 inch) matzo sheets
2 large eggs
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon butter, divided
kosher salt to taste

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a non-stick frying pan over low heat.
Pour hot water into a bowl. Break matzoh sheets into small chunks and soak in hot water, about 2 minutes.
Whisk eggs and 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt in a separate bowl.
Strain matzoh and shake to remove excess water; stir matzoh into egg mixture.
Pour the heated oil out of non-stick frying pan; place 1/2 tablespoon butter in hot pan.
Pour matzoh and egg mixture into hot butter; cover and cook until a 'pancake' forms, about 10 minutes.
Slide matzoh 'pancake' onto a plate.
Place remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter in hot pan.
Place a second plate over matzoh 'pancake' and flip plates over so the uncooked side is on the bottom.
Lie matzoh 'pancake' in melted butter; cover pan and cook until bottom of pancake is browned, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat and season with kosher salt.
