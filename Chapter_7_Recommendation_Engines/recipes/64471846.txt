Ingredients:
24 oz marshmallow fluff
12 oz regular cream cheese
1/2 stick butter
Pinch of salt
1 cup mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Spray mini muffin tin with non-stick grease spray.
Melt chocolate chips and butter in a pot over medium heat. Take a spoon or brush to coat inside of mini muffin tins with melted chocolate mixture. Put in freezer for 20-30 minutes or until hardened. At this time, take a regular baking sheet and freeze as well. Apply second coat of chocolate to the mini muffin tin and freeze for another 15-20 minutes.
In a separate bowl, use a mixer to whip the marshmallow fluff and cream cheese. Mix until the mixture is a fluffy consistency. Add more fluff for taste (mixture shouldn't have a distinct cream cheese taste at all).
Carefully remove the chocolate bowls from the mini muffin tin. Be delicate so as to not break the chocolate bowls. Remove the frozen baking sheet, apply a sheet of wax paper, and place the bowls on the wax paper.
Take a spoon and scoop the marshmallow mixture into the chocolate bowls.
Once all of the mini bowls are filled, enjoy!
You can add fruit, sprinkles, nonparels, or food coloring as desired for fun details and decorations!!!
