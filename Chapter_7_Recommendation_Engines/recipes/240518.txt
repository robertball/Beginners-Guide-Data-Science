1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Description: 
The addition of cayenne pepper to this chipped beef cheese ball gives it that extra zip, and the whipped cream cheese makes it a little softer and more spreadable. I served this over the holidays and no one could get enough! Serve with your favorite crackers.
