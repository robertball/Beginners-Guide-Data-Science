Ingredients:
Dipping Sauce
1 cup Greek yogurt (2%)
1 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded, and grated
3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint
1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest, plus 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
Meatballs
1-1/2 pounds Martha's Ground-Meat Mix
3/4 cup finely crumbled feta cheese
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh oregano
1/4 teaspoon crushed red-pepper flakes
Extra-virgin olive oil, for hands and baking sheet

Directions:
Make dipping sauce: Mix together yogurt, cucumber, mint, lemon zest and juice, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in medium bowl; season with pepper.
Make the meatballs: Gently mix together meat, feta, oregano, and red-pepper flakes in bowl. Do not overmix. Form mixture into thirty 1-1/4-inch meatballs. (You may wish to oil hands to prevent mixture from sticking.) Slide 5 meatballs onto each of 6 metal skewers.
Preheat broiler with rack in top third of oven. Lightly brush rimmed baking sheet with olive oil. Broil skewers on baking sheet until just cooked through and deep golden brown, about 8 minutes. Serve with dipping sauce.
