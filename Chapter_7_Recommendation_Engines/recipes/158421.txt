Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) shark steaks
2 cups milk
1 tablespoon lemon juice
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the shark steaks in a shallow dish and pour milk over them to cover. Let stand for 2 hours, or refrigerate overnight.
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Remove the shark steaks from the pan and pat dry. Discard leftover milk. Season the steaks with lemon juice, sea salt and pepper.
Grill the steaks until meat is firm, about 15 minutes, turning once. Fish should appear white all the way through.
