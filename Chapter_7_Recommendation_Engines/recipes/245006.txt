Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast
8 thick-cut bacon strips
1 cup sweet barbeque sauce
2/3 cup MUSSELMAN'S® Apple Butter
2 chipotle peppers (from a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce)

Directions:
Soak 8 wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes. Preheat grill to medium or medium-low heat. (Between 300-350 degrees F.)
Cut the chicken breasts into 3/4 inch bite-sized pieces. Then cut the bacon into 3/4 inch strips. Alternate threading the chicken and bacon onto 8 skewers, leaving a bare handle on one end of each skewer. Sprinkle the chicken skewers with salt and pepper.
Place the barbeque sauce, MUSSELMAN'S® Apple Butter, and chipotle peppers in the blender. Puree until smooth.
Grill the chicken skewers for 4 minutes per side. Then brush the skewers with the chipotle apple BBQ sauce and grill another 3-4 minutes per side, until the edges of the bacon are crisp, but not burned. Serve warm.
