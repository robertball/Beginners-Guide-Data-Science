Ingredients:
Ginger Cake
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter
1 egg
1 cup fancy molasses
2 1/2 cups flour
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp ginger
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp cloves
1 cup hot water
Caramel Sauce:
1 cup butter
1 cup whipping cream
1 1/2 cups brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F. Cream together sugar and butter, then add egg and fancy molasses. Mix all dry ingredients together and then gradually add to creamed mixture.
Add 1 cup hot water at the end and stir until mixed together. It will seem thin.
Pour into greased 9x13 pan and bake at 350 F for 25-29 minutes.
Caramel Sauce: Melt butter and sugar. Add cream. Boil a few minutes. The longer boiled, the thicker the sauce. Can make ahead, but it might separate. If so, mix and heat it again. Serve warm.
