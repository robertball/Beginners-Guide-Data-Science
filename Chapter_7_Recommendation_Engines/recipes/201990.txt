Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 large green bell pepper, chopped
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, chopped
4 large cloves garlic, minced
2 1/2 pounds boneless country-style pork ribs, cut into 3/4-inch pieces
1 1/2 cups fresh sweet cherries, pitted and cut into quarters
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 lime, juiced
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
3 tablespoons honey
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan with a lid over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion, green bell pepper, green onions, jalapeno pepper, and garlic until softened, about 10 minutes.
Stir in the pork, cherries, cilantro, lime juice, chili powder, cumin, and onion powder, and mix well. Bring the mixture to a boil, cover, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook until the pork is cooked through and no longer pink, and the vegetables and cherries have given up their juices, about 30 minutes.
Remove the lid, stir in the honey, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer uncovered until the sauce reduces and the pork is tender, about 30 more minutes. The sauce won't be extremely thick.
