Ingredients:
For pulled Pork:
3 tablespoons smoked paprika
1/2 tablespoon onion powder
1/2 tablespoon salt and ground pepper
1 onion, peeled & sliced
4 cups beef stock
1 - 5 to 6 pound boneless pork shoulder or Boston butt, rinsed and dried
12 soft hamburger buns, split
Coleslaw, for serving
For the Barbecue Sauce:
2-1/2 to 3 cups ketchup
2 large tablespoons light brown sugar
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 tablespoon freshly ground pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup stock, from pulled pork
2 tablespoons light corn syrup

Directions:
Place pork roast in slow cooker.  Add paprika, onion powder, salt and pepper. Place the onion around the roast. Pour beef stock over pork and turn to high heat for 6 hours.
For bbq sauce:
Meanwhile, mix the ketchup, broth from pulled pork, both sugars, 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper, the onion and mustard powders, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, corn syrup and in a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes. Once thickened remove from heat and set aside. Drain most of remaining juice from pulled pork and shred with forks(I leave about 1/2 cup) then pour bbq sauce into the slow cooker and turn heat to low.  Stir the pork and bbq mixture to coat the meat. Cook on low heat for about 30 minutes.
To make sandwiches top buns with pulled pork and coleslaw of your choice.
