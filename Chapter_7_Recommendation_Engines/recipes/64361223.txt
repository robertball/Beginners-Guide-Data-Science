Ingredients:
1 Flat Cut Corned Beef with Spice Packet
5 Idaho Potatoes
1 Onion
5 Garlic Cloves
2 tsp Cajun Season Salt
2 T Oil
1 T Yellow Mustard Powder
1 T Red Pepper Flakes
1 T Peppercorns
1 T Granulated Garlic

Directions:
Secret to the recipe is to cook the potatoes and beef enough ahead of time to cool thoroughly. Overnight is preferred, but you can cook them first thing and refrigerate. Potatoes tend to mush if they aren't thoroughly cool.
Boil whole potatoes with skin on for 25 minutes. Cover and cool in refrigerator.
Cover corned beef in water add spice packet, mustard powder, pepper flakes, peppercorns, and granulated garlic. Cover and boil for 3 hours or slow cook for 8-10 hours. Corned beef is done when fork inserts into center easily. Cover and cool in refrigerator.
Time to make the hash:
Dice potatoes into 1/3" cubes.
Heat large skillet over medium high heat. I use a large cast iron chicken fryer with high sides.
Add oil (should cover bottom of pan completely.  Once oil is heated add diced potatoes.
Large dice onion and mince garlic.
Turn potatoes and add onion and garlic.
Add Cajun seasoning.
Turn heat down to Medium.
Large dice corned beef.
Stir and turn potatoes.
Add corned beef.
Stir and turn every 2-3 minutes until thoroughly heated.
Taste and season to taste.
