Ingredients:
1liter whole milk
300g butter
250g powdered sugar
100g yeast
1,5kg flour
0,5ts cardamom
0,5ts vanilla sugar

Directions:
Bring milk, butter and powdered sugar to a boil. Then let chill until body temperature. I use a finger to check it.
If you use fresh yeast, stir it into the mix. If not, mix the yeast together with cardamom, vanilla sugar and flour before adding the fluid.
Knead the dough until smooth. Roll out about 40 buns.
Let the buns rise for 1hour in a warm and draft free room. I put mine under a clean kitchen towel.
bake for 7-10 min on 250C (480 F).
I sometime glaze mine with egg or milk before baking..
