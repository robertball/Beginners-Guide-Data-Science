Ingredients:
1/2 package puff pastry dough, thawed
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (6 ounce) can crab meat, drained
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup thinly sliced green onion, divided in half
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning, or to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 pinch paprika

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Unroll puff pastry dough. Cut out very small circles (or squares) to fit in the bottom and a little bit up the sides of a mini muffin (or tartlet) pan. You can even use puff pastry scraps & they'll be just fine!
Press puff pastry cut-outs into the mini muffin (or tartlet) pan. Set aside.
In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, crab, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, Cheddar cheese, 2 Tblsp. green onions, Worcestershire sauce, Old Bay Seasoning,  and a pinch cayenne pepper. Spoon 1 teaspoon of mixture into tarts and garnish with paprika.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes, or until light brown. Do pop one out of the pan to see if the underside is golden-colored.
For an extra burst of flavor & color, serve with the remaining 2 Tblsp. of green onion sprinkled on top.
These freeze wonderfully. Just reheat before serving.

Description: 
Based on an All Recipes appetizer King Crab Appetizers. I used puff pastry for great texture & taste, & heightened the flavors, as I'd tried it as written originally & found it bland to my taste. You can even use puff pastry scraps - they'll look as perfect as the ones cut out with a cutter!Modified from: King Crab Appetizers
