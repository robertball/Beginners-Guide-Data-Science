Ingredients:
-1.5 pounds of lean beef
-package of Italian sausages
-1 bag penne pasta
-2.5 cups cottage cheese
-4 cups mozzarella cheese (divided into 2.5 & 1.5 cup portions)
-1 cup grated parmesan cheese
-2 onions chopped
-3 cans of diced tomatoes
-1 can tomato paste
-1 cup water
-3/4 tablespoon fennel seed
-1.5 table spoons dried oregano
-1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
-1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
-1/2 tablespoon ground pepper
-1/4 tablespoon sea salt
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
-1 & ½ table spoons ground marjoram separated in 1 & ½ portions
- 2 tablespoons fresh minced garlic
- 1 table spoon brown sugar
-1/2 tablespoon ground basil leaves
- ½ tablespoon ground rosemary
-Olive Oil Cooking spray

Directions:
-Brown beef and drain. Cook sausage and cut up into cubes then add to beef. Add chopped onions,fennel seed, garlic, oregano, nutmeg, cinnamon, ground pepper, sea salt, chili powder, brown sugar, basil leaves, rosemary and 1/2 tablespoon ground majoram. Stir all ingredients together over medium-low heat. Add tomato paste, canned tomatoes & water. Bring to a boil and stir. The meat mixture can be combined immediately but is best if allowed to simmer for 1-3 hours.
In seperate bowl combine cottage cheese, 2.5 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, 1 cup grated parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon ground majoram. What I also like to do, is put in a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cinnamon. Mix together in bowl. Using a fork or potato masher, mash ingredient together until cottage cheese is no longer chunky and mixture becomes more of a paste resembling ricotta cheese.
Boil penne noddles. I add a tablespoon of fresh minced garlic and a tablespoon of olive oil to the water while it cooks to keep the noodles from sticking and to give them a little extra flavor. Drain and set aside.
Spray a 8 X 11 oven safe dish with olive oil and pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.
Spoon a small amount of meat mixture on bottom of dish and spread evenly. Sprinkle mixture with a pinch of mozzarella cheese and dash of parmesan cheese. Spoon a single layer of noodles on top of this. Then spoon on meat mixture, spreading evenly ensuring that it sinks down between the noodles. With clean hands grab a handful of the cheese mixture and put small globs over the top until all of sauce is covered and no more cheese mixture remains. Place another layer of noodles on top of this, and then the meat mixture. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella cheese over the top.
Bake in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.
