Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) bar milk chocolate (such as Ritter Sport)
3/4 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Chop chocolate bar into small pieces; place in a glass or stainless steel bowl.
Combine cream and sugar in a small saucepan and bring over medium heat. Just as mixture starts to boil, pour it over chocolate and whisk until combined and chocolate has melted. Stir in butter. Set aside to cool and thicken, at least 15 minutes.
