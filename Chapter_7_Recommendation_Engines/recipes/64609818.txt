Ingredients:
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped; plus 2 heads, halved crosswise
1 Tbsp coarsely chopped rosemary, plus 4 sprigs
1 Tbsp fennel seeds, coarsely chopped
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
2 Tbsp olive oil, divided
Freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2pound pork tenderloin
4 slices bacon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425°. Toss chopped garlic, chopped rosemary, fennel seeds, salt, and 1 Tbsp oil in a small bowl; season with pepper.
Rub garlic mixture all over tenderloin (if you have time to do this in the morning, great; chill pork until dinner). Scatter rosemary sprigs in a large baking dish and set tenderloin on top. Wrap bacon slices around tenderloin, tucking ends underneath so bacon stays put. Nestle halved heads of garlic around tenderloin and drizzle everything with remaining 1 Tbsp oil.
Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of tenderloin registers 145° for medium, 30–40 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest at least 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
Okay, it's not REAL porchetta, had to cut corners on the classic Italian dish—using thick cut bacon and skipping the multiday air-drying process. It’s not traditional, but it sure is delicious.
