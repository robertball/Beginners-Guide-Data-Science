Ingredients:
Prepared pizza dough (I make my own, but refrigerated will work, too.
2 cups chopped, cooked chicken breast
1/2 cup chopped portabella muchrooms
1/2 red onion, chopped
1 cup mozzarella cheese
1 egg, beaten
For Sauce:
2 Tbsp. butter
2 Tbsp. flour
1 cup milk
1 tsp. salt
5-6 cloves garlic, minced (optional: roast first)
3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
To prepare sauce, melt butter over medium heat in large saucepan. Mix in flour. Gradually add milk, stirring constantly, until sauce is creamy, thick, and smooth (more milk may be needed). Stir in salt, garlic, and parmesan cheese. Remove from heat.
Divide pizza dough into 6-8 balls (or more for mini-calzones). On a floured surface, roll each ball into approximately 8 inch circles . Spread each circle with garlic-parmesan sauce. On top of sauce, layer chicken, mushrooms and red onions, then top with mozzarella cheese, leaving a 1-inch gap around edges. Fold calzone in half to create a semicircle. Wet tips of fingers with water to help seal the edges. Using a fork, press lightly around edge to create design. Repeat this until all calzones are sealed.
Place calzones on nonstick cookie sheet and brush tops with beaten egg. Bake at 400 degrees for around 30 minutes, or until crust is golden brown and fully cooked. Note: insides will be very hot.
