Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package ladyfinger cookies
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 cup white sugar
4 eggs
1 1/2 pints sour cream
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon almond extract
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line the sides of one 10 inch springform pan with lady fingers then line the bottom with lady fingers (cutting lady fingers, if necessary).
Cream the cream cheese and sugar together. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Stir in the extracts and fold in the sour cream. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Cover tops of lady fingers with foil.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 50 to 60 minutes, until almost set in the middle. Remove cake from oven and let stand for 1/2 hour, then remove sides of pan. Place in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours. Before serving top with canned pie filling.
