Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1 (0.13 ounce) package unsweetened, fruit-flavored soft drink mix
1 liter lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage
1/2 cup cold water
1 quart vanilla ice cream

Directions:
In a large pitcher, stir together the sugar, drink mix and cold water. Pour in the lemon-lime soda, and stir to blend. Place one or two scoops of ice cream into glasses, and pour the punch over them. It will make a 'potion' that bubbles up.

Description: 
This is a fun drink to make with a group of children. My daughter's Brownie Troop loved it. Use any flavor of drink mix that you like!
