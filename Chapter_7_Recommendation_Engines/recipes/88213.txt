4 large fresh tomatoes
4 ounces goat cheese
1 tablespoon chopped bottled roasted red peppers
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven broiler.
Slice the tops off of the tomatoes and hollow out by removing the seeds.
In a bowl, mix the goat cheese and chopped red peppers together. Spoon an equal amount of the cheese mixture into each hollowed out tomato. Place stuffed tomatoes upright in a baking dish. Top each tomato evenly with the bread crumbs and torn basil. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
