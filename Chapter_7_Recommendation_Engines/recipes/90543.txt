Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - diced
1 tablespoon minced garlic, or to taste
¼ cup thinly sliced onion
12 ounces fresh or frozen green beans
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons heavy cream

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned. Add garlic and onion, and reduce the heat to medium. Cook and stir just until fragrant. Mix in the green beans, cover and cook to your desired doneness, at least 5 minutes.
Uncover, and stir in the cream and cheese just until everything is coated. Remove from the heat and enjoy.

Description: 
These are the BEST green beans you will ever have. This recipe can be altered to your liking.  I throw bacon in and omit the chicken for a side dish.  Makes wonderful leftovers, but there are never any unless I eat them alone.
