Divide dough in half, and press 1 half onto bottom of ungreased 9 inch springform pan.  Layer with sliced apples.  Sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmed, if desired.  Press remaining half of dough on top of apples.  Sprinkle with almonds, and slightly press them into the dough.  Bake in preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until almonds brown and knive inserted into center of cake comes out clean.  Let cool in pan for 10-15 minutes.  Loosen side of pan with a knife, and then remove sides completely.  Let cake completelt cool before slicing and serving.  I like to sprinkle with powdered sugar right before serving.

Description: 
This a wonderful old-world recipe from Oma in Holland.  Sometimes I omit the apples, and spread a store-bought almond paste in between the layers of dough.  I sometimes serve this simple cake as a coffee cake for brunch.
