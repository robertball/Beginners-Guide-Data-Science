Ingredients:
1 Tbsp cooking oil
1 Tbsp butter or margarine
2 Boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed
1 Tbsp Italian seasoning (or herb of choice)
1 Tbsp garlic salt
1 White or yellow onion, finely chopped
5 Cloves garlic, minced
5 Roma tomatoes, chopped
Black pepper to taste
Crushed red pepper to taste
1 jar prepared alfredo sauce
1/2 cup fresh parmasan cheese, grated
12 Oz. fettucine noodles

Directions:
Fill a large pot with water and heat until boiling, and add pasta.  Follow pasta instructions for al dente preparation, and drain slightly before al dente.
While you wait for the pasta water to boil, heat the oil and butter over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle cubed chicken with the Italian seasoning and garlic salt.
Add seasoned chicken the heated oil/butter mixture and cook until chicken is almost done, about 5 minutes.  Add onion and saute until almost soft, another couple of minutes or so.  Add garlic and cook for about a minute.  Add roma tomatoes, black pepper, and crushed red pepper. Cook until tomatoes are soft.
Reduce heat to medium-low and add the jar of prepared alfredo sauce and heat through, stirring often.  Stir in the parmesan cheese once sauce is heated through.
Once pasta is drained, add to sauce mixture and allow to cook for 3-4 more minutes, or just until pasta is finished cooking to al dente.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
Since I'm a working mom, I don't have time to make every meal from scratch.  So this recipe allows me to cheat a little and use a prepared alfredo sauce, while still adding fresh touches to make it taste more homemade.  Easy to make, and leftovers are very yummy too!
