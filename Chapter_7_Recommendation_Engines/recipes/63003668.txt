Ingredients:
2 cups Cherry Tomatoes
2 Tablespoons Olive Oil
2 pinches Sea Salt
2 teaspoons Cumin Seeds
1 pinch Dried Rosemary
1 pinch Dried Thyme
1 bunch Fresh Basil (Green And Purple)
2 cloves Garlic, Finely Chopped
1 loaf Of Rustic Baguette
Olive Oil, For Drizzling On The Tops

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300ºF. Cut cherry tomatoes in half and place on a parchment-lined pan. (Use parchment paper if you don’t want to clean up a messy pan afterward.) Drizzle on some olive oil, a couple pinches of salt along with a sprinkle of cumin seeds, dried rosemary and dried thyme. Mix it all together and arrange tomatoes cut-side down on the pan. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until you see the tomatoes have puffed up and caramelized on the bottoms.
While the tomatoes are roasting, roughly chop the basil and garlic, then set aside in a bowl. Thinly slice a rustic baguette or any loaf of bread and either toast it in the oven or in your toaster.
When the tomatoes are ready, arrange the toast on a platter. Drizzle each piece with olive oil, sprinkle the garlic basil on it with some sea salt, and finally, spoon the roasted tomatoes on top. The sweet and tangy cumin-scented tomatoes are the highlight of this dish. Enjoy!
