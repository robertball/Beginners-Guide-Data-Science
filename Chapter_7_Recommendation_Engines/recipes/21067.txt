Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 pound sausage
1 teaspoon minced onion
1 pound processed cheese food, cubed
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 (1 pound) loaf cocktail rye bread

Directions:
Preheat the broiler.
Place ground beef, sausage and onion in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until meat is evenly brown and onions are soft. Drain liquid.
Mix in the processed cheese food, oregano and Worcestershire sauce. Stir continuously until the cheese is melted.
If the bread is not sliced, cut it into thin slices. Spoon approximately 1 tablespoon of the mixture onto each slice. Place the slices in a single layer on a baking pan.
Broil the slices 10 minutes, or until the cheese is slightly browned and the bread is toasted.
