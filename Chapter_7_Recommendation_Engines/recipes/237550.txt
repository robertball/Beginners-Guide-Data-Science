Ingredients:
1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup herbed goat cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Arrange asparagus, side-by-side, on a baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil over asparagus; season with salt and pepper. Crumble goat cheese over asparagus.
Roast in the preheated oven until cheese is slightly melted and asparagus are tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Roasting veggies always needs revamping every now and then, and I like to experiment by pairing them with different dressings or cheeses. I happened to love goat cheese and had extra on hand. I paired it with asparagus, and they lived happily ever after.
