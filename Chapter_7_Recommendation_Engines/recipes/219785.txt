Ingredients:
5 large potatoes, cubed
1 large carrot, cut into small dice
1 small stalk celery with leaves, cut into small dice
1 small onion, diced
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
water to cover
2 cups milk, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 tablespoon butter
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine the potatoes, carrot, celery, onion, and salt in a 2-quart pot; pour enough water over the potato mixture to just cover. Bring the water to a boil, and cook until the potatoes are soft but not mushy, about 25 minutes. Drain about 1/4 of the remaining water from the mixture, taking care to not lose any of the vegetables. Stir the milk into the vegetable mixture with the basil, dill, and butter. Season with salt and black pepper to serve.
