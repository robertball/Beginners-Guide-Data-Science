Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 carrots, chopped
6 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste (optional)
2 teaspoons maple syrup (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 cups vegetable broth
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed
2 (15.5 ounce) cans canned red beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, with liquid
1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed tomatoes, with liquid

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, carrots and garlic; cook and stir for a few minutes to release the flavors. Season with maple syrup, cumin, chili powder, and black pepper. Pour in the vegetable broth, black beans, 1 can of red beans, and corn. Bring to a boil.
Meanwhile, combine the remaining can of red beans and crushed tomatoes in the container of a large food processor or blender. Process until smooth. Pour into the soup pot, and stir to blend. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 15 minutes.

Description: 
A yummy soup that even picky kids will love! Red beans and black beans are mildly seasoned and simmered in vegetable broth. With these ingredients this is a healthy vegetarian soup with a complete protein. If you add the chili powder, leave out the maple syrup. It totally changes the taste. Garnish with sour cream, green onions and tortilla chips for a festive meal. This is great served with cornbread.
