Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) unbaked deep dish pie crust
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
3/4 cup water
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons strawberry-flavored Jell-OÂ® mix
1 quart fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake pie crust until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Remove crust from oven and turn oven temperature down to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat cream cheese, eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in a bowl until smoothly combined.
Pour filling into crust.
Bake until filling is set, about 30 minutes.
Remove from oven and let cool completely.
Whisk together 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, water, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and strawberry gelatin in a saucepan until smooth; place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring constantly, until the gelatin has dissolved and the glaze has thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.
Arrange the sliced strawberries atop the cheese filling.
Pour warm glaze over sliced strawberries. Chill thoroughly in refrigerator before serving.

Description: 
This was a recipe from a friend of my mom's and the only strawberry pie I've ever made. There is nothing better than freshly picked strawberries in the summer on this pie.
