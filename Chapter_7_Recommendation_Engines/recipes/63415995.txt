Ingredients:
3 cups of all-purpose flour
1 tea. salt
2 tea. baking powder
2 tea. baking soda
2 tea. cinnamon
1/2 tsp. ginger
1/2 tsp. cloves
1/4 tsp. mace
2 cups sugar
2 cups cooked pumpkin
1 1/2 cups apple sauce
4 eggs, beaten
(1/2 cup chopped nuts and/or 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips optional)
1/4 cup sprinkled confectioner's sugar

Directions:
Blend sugar & applesauce in a mixing bowl; stir in pumpkin & beaten eggs.  Mix the salt, baking soda & baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, & mace into the pumpkin mixture. Add nuts and/or chocolate chips, if using them.  Mix well.  Finally, add flour mixing well.  Preheat oven 350 degrees.  Pour batter into 2 well greased loaf pans & bake for 1 hour.  Check doneness by inserting toothpick & pulling out to see if 'clean'.  May need to bake additional 10 minutes if not done.  Once cooled, top with confectioner's sugar or cream cheese frosting.

Description: 
This yummy family tradition started when buying the kids their pumpkins. Each of the kids got one to make their jack-o-lanterns.  Mama got one to COOK!  Friends & family usually enjoy this treat.  Tweak it to fit your family as I do mine!  Enjoy with powered sugar on top or cream cheese frosting! :)
