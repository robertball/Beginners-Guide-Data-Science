Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
1 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
3/4 cup melted butter, divided
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
FILLING:
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
ICING:
2 tablespoons butter, softened
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
5 tablespoons milk

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine yeast and water.  Add milk, 1/2 cup butter, eggs, sugar, salt and 2 cups of flour.  Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl; turn once to grease top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.  Punch dough down; let rest for 10 minutes.  Divide in half.  On a floured surface, roll each portion into a 15-in. x 10-in. rectangle.  Brush with remaining butter.  Combine filling ingredients; sprinkle over dough.  Roll up, jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seams to seal.  Place, seam side up, on two greased baking sheets.  Fold each roll in half lengthwise with seams touching, with one side 1-1/2 in. longer than the other.  With scissors, make a lengthwise cut down the middle to within 1 in. of open ends.  Open and lay flat; arrange into a heart shape.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool on wire racks.
In a mixing bowl, cream butter, sugar and vanilla.  Add enough milk to achieve desired consistency; drizzle over hearts.
