Ingredients:
1&1/2 lbs. cooked and devined shrimp( I live in New Orleans so I get them fresh and boil then in a spicy seasoning blend, but store brought pre-cooked shrimp will do just fine)
1/2 cup of mayonaise
1&1/2 tbl spoon of ketchup
1 tlb spoon or mustard
1 to 2 stalks of celery
3 boiled eggs
Season salt, to taste (I use Goya Adobo)
Black Pepper, to taste

Directions:
Finely chop shrimp, eggs and celery and add to a bowl.   Mix in mayonaise, ketchup, mustard.
Season to taste with seasoning salt and pepper.
Chill for a couple of hours.
My family likes it with buttery crackers or it's great on toast.
