Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
2 cubes chicken bouillon, crumbled
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
3 Tbs. butter or margarine
3 heaping Tbs. of flour
3 cups of milk
salt, to taste
bread (optional)
hard-boiled eggs (optional)
cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; stir in the ground beef, chicken bouillon, garlic powder, black pepper, and onion powder. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Remove browned beef to a bowl.
In same skillet, melt butter or margarine. Stir in flour, until totally incorporated. Cook mixture for about 3 mins. To prevent lumps, pour in milk in small amounts (approximately 1/4 cup), working the milk into the butter/flour mixture after each addition. The last 1 to 1 1/2 cups of milk should be able to be added at one time. Heat over medium-low heat, allowing to thicken. If too thick, add more milk.
Stir ground beef into sauce and reheat through. Salt, to taste.
Serve over toasted bread with chopped hard-boiled eggs and/or cheddar cheese.
