Ingredients:
1 Tablespoon olive oil
1 Large Vidalia onion, very thinly sliced (if you can't find Vidalia, use another sweet variety like Walla Walla, Maui or Texas Spring)
1/4 Cup water
One 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature
1/2 Cup mayonnaise
1/4 Cup sour cream
1 Teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 Teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 Teaspoon onion powder
1/2 Teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 Scallion, green part only, thinly sliced

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium- high heat.
Add the onions and saut√© 5 to 7 minutes, until beginning to brown. Stir in the water and scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.
Turn the heat to low and cook 30 to 35 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden brown. If the pan looks to dry, add a tablespoon of water. Let cool completely.
In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, Worcestershire, garlic salt, onion powder and pepper.
Using an electric mixer, beat until smooth. Stir in the reserved onions and the scallions. Chill until serving time.
