Ingredients:
1 long English cucumber diced small
2 large avocados diced and scooped out if the skin- do not cut the avocado until the recipe calls for it.
3 minced garlic cloves
1 minced Fresno chili (I use the entire chili for maximum heat. Adjust to your liking.
1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro
Juice of a large lime (or two small ones)
Zest of 1 lime
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Add diced cucumber into a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  The salt will draw out the water from tthe cucumber - you want this.
Add the juice and zest of the lime.
Add the cilantro, garlic and Fresno chili.
Mix and set in the fridge until chilled- at least 60 minutes.
After the mixture is chilled go ahead and dice up your avocados and add them it the salsa.  Mix around smashing the avocado, but leaving it a bit chunky.
Serve.
