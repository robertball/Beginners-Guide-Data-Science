Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 Tablespoon vanilla
7 eggs, separated
3 1/2 cups flour, divided
2 cups candied cherries
2 cups candied pineapple
1 1/2 cups golden raisins
1 1/2 cup dark raisins
3 cups pecan halves or piaces
Peach jam, melted
151 Dark Rum

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees.  Line bottom and sides of 10-inch tube pan with brown paper (used grocery sack works well).  Grease and set aside.
Cream butter, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy.  Beat in egg yolks alternately with 3 cups of the flour.
In a large bowl, mix fruits and nuts with remaining 1/2 cup flour and coat well.  Stir into batter.
Beat egg whites to soft peaks; fold into batter a little at a time.  Spoon batter into prepared pan.
Bake in 250 degree oven for 2 1/2 hours, until pick inserted comes out clean.  Pour 1/4 cup rum slowly over cake; cool on rack.
Remove cake from pan.  Peel off paper and wrap in rum-soaked cheesecloth.  Store in cool place in an airtight container to age, one month or longer, adding additional rum each week as needed to keep moist.
Brush with melted jam to glaze before serving.
