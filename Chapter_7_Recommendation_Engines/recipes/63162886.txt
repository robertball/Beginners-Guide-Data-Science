Ingredients:
32 oz canned chickpeas
olive oil
curry
chili powder
salt
coriander seeds
1 shallot
2 naan breads

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Finely chop the shallot.
Place the chopped shallot in a frying pan.  Pour in enough olive oil to coat the pan and the shallot.
Saute on medium heat until the shallots are thoroughly cooked.
Add the chickpeas.  Add enough olive oil to coat them well.  Add curry to taste; it should be at least enough to color all the chickpeas.  Add chili powder, salt, and coriander seeds to taste.  The dominant flavor should be curry.
Meanwhile, place the naan breads on a cookie sheet and brush with olive oil.
Place the naan in the oven.  Remove after about 10 minutes.
Mash about a third to a half of the chickpeas in the pan.  Add enough olive oil to make this mixture wet.
The chana marsala is done when the chickpeas are fully heated.  Serve over the naan.

Description: 
My take on a traditional Indian recipe.  I used whole wheat naan breads, but you can use white naans.  If you can't find naan bread, you can use flatbread instead.  A great side dish is spinach with butternut squash.
