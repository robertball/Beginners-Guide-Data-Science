Ingredients:
1 Cup 	Soy sauce
1/3 Cup	Brown Sugar
1/2 Cup	Worchester sauce
1.5 Tablespoon  Liquid smoke
1/2 Tablespoon  Lemon pepper
1/2 Tablespoon	Garlic powder
1/2 Tablespoon  Paprika
1/2 Tablespoon  Black pepper
1/2 Tablespoon  Curry Powder (optional)
3 Lbs London Broil all fat trimed

Directions:
1.)Cut meat into ¼” thick slices(1/8" for thin)with the grain. Use food slicer or have your store butcher do it for you. If not cut even jerky will be inconsistent.
2.)Combine all ingredients into bowl, mix and add meat. Let marinate minimum of 15 minutes, best if done over night.
3.) Lay out the meat on a cooling rack or dehydrator tray.
Once layed on tray crushed chili or black pepper can be added on top of meat before dehydrating. Be aware black pepper can make it very hot.
Place meat in oven with door open part way, if door is closed meat will bake. Cook at 140-180, it is best to use store bought dehydrator. Test meat every half  hour after 3 hours for doneness. Meat should be dry to the touch but still have some give.
Let cool on rack before storing in a container. If you use plastic bags do not remove air or moisture will form on meat.
