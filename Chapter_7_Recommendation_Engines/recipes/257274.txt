Ingredients:
Lamb Meatballs:
1 small onion
1 cup fresh mint leaves
3 cloves garlic
1 pound ground lamb
3 tablespoons ground sweet paprika
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
cooking spray
1/4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed
Yogurt Sauce:
1 (6 ounce) container Greek yogurt
2 tablespoons tahini
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
4 sheets lavash bread
1 (4 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese
1 cup shredded lettuce
1/2 cup diced fresh tomatoes
1/2 cup cucumber matchsticks

Directions:
Combine onion, mint, and garlic in a food processor; process until minced. Add lamb, paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper; process until smooth.
Form 1 1/2 teaspoon of the lamb mixture into a ball. Repeat with remaining lamb mixture to make 20 meatballs.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Fill a large skillet with 1/4 inch of oil; heat over medium heat until bubbles form around the end of a wooden spoon dipped into the oil. Add half of the meatballs; cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining meatballs.
Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until center is no longer pink, about 10 minutes.
Mix yogurt, tahini, and lemon juice together in a bowl to make yogurt sauce.
Place 2 to 3 tablespoons yogurt sauce in a line down the center of each sheet of lavash. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of feta cheese, 1/4 cup of lettuce, 2 tablespoons of tomato, 2 tablespoons of cucumber, and 5 meatballs. Fold up one end and sides of the lavash to roll into wraps.

Description: 
Lamb meatballs are mixed with garlic, onion, paprika, cumin and mint. They are blended smoothly in a food-processor to make it kid-friendly by hiding the green mint. The meatballs are lightly fried and baked before adding to a pita with feta, lettuce, tomatoes and a tahini yogurt sauce.
