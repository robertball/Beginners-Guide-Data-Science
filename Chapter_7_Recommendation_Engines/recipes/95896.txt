Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon-pepper seasoning
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
3/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 (4 pound) boneless beef rib roast

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a small dish, mix together the lemon-pepper seasoning, paprika, garlic salt, rosemary and cayenne pepper. Rub over the entire roast.
Place the roast with the fat side up on a roasting rack set inside a shallow roasting pan.
Bake for 1 hour and 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the roast reaches your desired degree of doneness, or at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for medium-rare. Medium is recommended: 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).  Let the roast rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving into thin slices.
