Ingredients:
15 washed and dried very small new potatoes
5-7 slices of uncooked bacon
powdered ranch or garlic seasoning
15 toothpicks
ranch dressing or bbq sauce for dipping

Directions:
Cut the bacon into thirds, this should be just enough to wrap around the potato if they are small enough.  Wrap each potato with bacon and secure it with a toothpick.   Sprinkle the wrapped potatoes with the powdered seasoning.  Place on grill over low heat.  Turn the potatoes to allow the bacon to cook on all sides.  The potatoes will be done when the bacon is nice and crispy.
