Ingredients:
1 box pasta (any shape you like)
4 cups chicken broth (low sodium)
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts (or cutlets or tenderloins)
1 can cream of chicken soup (reduced fat)
1 onion chopped (or onion powder)
1 cup shredded sharp cheddar or mozzerella
2 tsp dried thyme

Directions:
Boil the pasta in the chicken broth and throw in the thyme until al dente.
Meanwhile, saute the chicken until no longer pink in the middle.
Take out of pan and cook onions until caramelized.
While the onions are cooking, tear or chop the chicken into bite-sized chunks.
The pasta should be done at this point.
Place cream of chicken soup, onions, and chicken into the pasta pot (almost all of the chicken broth will be gone - no need to drain) and mix well.
Pour mixture into a greased 13 x 9 dish and bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.
Take out, sprinkle cheese over, and put it back into oven until cheese is melted.
