Description: 
This is such an easy recipe to throw together with a few ingredients. It always gets rave reviews. The recipe uses peanut butter, but you can substitute any nut butter or sunflower seed butter. A favorite of mine is to use hazelnut butter. Slice into triangles and top with some whipped cream (I use chilled coconut milk) and orange zest.
