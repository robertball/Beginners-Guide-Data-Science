Description: 
My husband loves chocolate and so does most of our family!  I must be weird because chocolate has never been a first choice for me but every now and then I may take a little corner.  I had just mixed up some fresh almond butter at my local store and had all of the other ingredients to create this Paleo Chocolate Espresso Cake and it was a big hit!
