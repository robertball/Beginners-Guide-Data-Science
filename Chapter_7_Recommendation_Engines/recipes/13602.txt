1 (8 ounce) can cream-style corn

1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup melted butter
1 cup shredded Swiss cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish.
Combine the eggs, corn muffin mix, cream-style corn, whole-kernal corn, sour cream, and melted butter. Mix well and pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Remove casserole from oven and sprinkle cheese over the top. Return to oven and bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes or until a knife comes out clean. Serve warm, spooning servings right from the pan.
