1 jar Ragu (any style)
12 baby peeled carrots
3 stalks celery
6-8 mushrooms
1 cube beef or veggie stock dissolved in 1 cup water
1 large onion
fresh basil and oregano (1 tbsp chopped or 1/2 tbsp if dried)
1 Tbsp chopped garlic
1/2 tsp garlic and onion power, salt and pepper
1-2 Bay leaves
For the white Sauce:
3/4 of one stick of butter
1/4 cup flour
30 ounces milk
1/2 tsp of prepared mustard
Pinch of ground nutmeg (if desired)
1/2 tsp salt (only if using unsalted butter)
Cheese:
1 large tub of Ricotta Cheese
3 cups shredded Cheddar
2 oz of either parmersan or asiago cheese
16-20 Raw uncooked lasagna noodle (no need to use "no boil" noodles)

Directions:
Grease a large 15X8 casserole dish, (preferably rectangular in shape)
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Brown ground beef in a large sauce pan and drain fat
Add all vegetables and stock, garlic and seasonings and cook approx 15 minutes
Add Ragu and mix well. Simmer for 45 minutes to tenderize the meat
Microwave the 30 oz of milk with the stick of butter in large microwave safe bowl until very hot, approx 4.5 minutes
Remove from microwave, wisk well.  Add flour, mustard, nutmeg if using, salt and return to microwave for additional 2/3 minutes. The sauce should be almost boiling and will thicken as it stands.

Don't forget to remove the Bay leaf!
In the casserole dish, layer in this order: 1. White sauce, 2. Cheese, 3. Meat 4. UNcooked lasagna noodles, and repeat until complete.
The casserole should be topped with white sauce and the reserved half cup of cheese.
Cook in oven for 75 minutes, the casserole should be covered with foil for the first 40 minutes of cooking. Brown to your preference.
Add 1 to 2 small to medium cans of petite sliced tomatoes depending on how tomato-ey you like it
