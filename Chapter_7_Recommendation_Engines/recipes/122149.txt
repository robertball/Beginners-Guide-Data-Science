Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup sugar
5 eggs
1 cup buttermilk
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies, drained
1 1/4 cups cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup whole kernel corn
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in buttermilk and chilies; mix well. Combine the dry ingredients; gradually add to creamed mixture.  Fold in corn and cheeses. Fill well-greased cactus-shaped or regular muffin cups with about 1/3 cup batter.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.

Description: 
'I adapted a recipe from a small Texas cafe to come up with these moist, spicy corn bread muffins,' recalls Marion Lowery of Medford, Oregon. 'They're wonderful alone or with butter and a bit of ham for a midday sandwich.'
