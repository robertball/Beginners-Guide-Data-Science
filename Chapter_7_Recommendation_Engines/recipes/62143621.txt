1 stick butter or margarine, softened to room temp.

Sprinkle salt and pepper on turkey and inside cavity.
Place onion and garlic inside cavity.
Place turkey inside the oven bag, and place the oven bag in a big roasting pan.
Rub butter mixture all over turkey, top and bottom (this will be messy, but this will be your only mess).
Seal oven bag, and bake at 350 for 3-3 1/2 hours (until meat thermometer inserted in thigh reads 180).
Let sit in bag for up to 1 hour before removing to carve.
