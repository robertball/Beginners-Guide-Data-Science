Ingredients:
1 cup confectioner's sugar
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup margarine, room temperature
1 cup vegetable oil (I use canola)
2 eggs
2 tsp vanilla (or lemon or orange or a combination)
4 1/2 cups flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp. cream of tartar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Lightly grease cookie sheets.
Cream sugars, margarine and oil together; beat in eggs and extract.
Combine dry ingredients (whisking or sifting) and add to the creamed mixture.  (Dough can be refrigerated for easier handling, but it's not necessary)
Roll into balls, about 1" in diameter.  Place on cookie sheets and press with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar to flatten.  Sprinkle with sugar (plain or colored).
Bake at 350 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes.  (Do not overbake - bottoms should be only very slightly browned)
Let cool on sheets a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.  Store in an airtight container.
