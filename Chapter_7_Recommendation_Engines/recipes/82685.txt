Ingredients:
3 tablespoons sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and chopped
1 tablespoon capers, drained
2 tilapia fillets
1 tablespoon oil from the jar of sun-dried tomatoes
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons kalamata olives, pitted and chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl, stir together the sun-dried tomatoes, olives and capers. Set aside.
Place the tilapia fillets side by side in a baking dish. Drizzle with oil and lemon juice.
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the fish flakes with a fork. Check after 10 minutes, so as not to overcook, or the fish may be dry.  When fish is done, top with the tomato mixture, and serve.

Description: 
We had some beautiful tilapia fillets, but no recipes! I had recently bought some amazing sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, and decided to invent a slightly Mediterranean fish dish for a quick weeknight dinner.  My husband is a recipe purist, always follows them to the letter, but after this, he's learned to trust my inventions!
