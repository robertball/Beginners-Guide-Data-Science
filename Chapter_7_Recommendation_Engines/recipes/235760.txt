Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups elbow macaroni
3/4 pound ground beef
1 cup frozen pearl onions
1 cup canned corn kernels, drained
1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, or more to taste
1 (26 ounce) jar chunky spaghetti sauce (such as Del MonteÂ®)
salt to taste
1/3 cup shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain. Return drained macaroni to the pot.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until partially browned, 3 to 5 minutes; add pearl onions, corn, and Italian seasoning. Continue to cook and stir until the beef is no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Place a cover on the skillet and cook until the onions are heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain and discard excess fat. Add beef mixture to macaroni.
Pour spaghetti sauce over the beef and pasta; stir to coat. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until hot, about 5 minutes.
Season pasta mixture with salt and more Italian seasoning, as needed; top with Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend to serve.

Description: 
This is no elementary school goulash, although it's as easy and a teen-pleaser. I created this recipe with what I had on hand, but the pearl onions and corn kick it up. It's hard to stop eating.
