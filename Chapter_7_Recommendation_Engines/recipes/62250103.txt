Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon fresh or granulated garlic
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
3 tablespoons chili powder
3 cans low sodium chicken stock
.....
8 to 10 ounces ground beef
1/3 cup minced onion
1/2 teaspoon fresh or granulated garlic
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
.....
10 - 12 corn tortillas
3 cups shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees and spray the bottom and sides of a  9" x 13" pan with a non stick spray.
Make a roux with the butter and flour and stir for 2 minutes until well blended.  Add garlic, salt, pepper, chili powder, chicken stock and mix well.  Stir  to make a medium thick gravy.  Simmer for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly.
Saute ground meat, minced onion, garlic, salt and pepper until meat looses its pink color.  Set aside.  Place 4 or 5 tortillas on a paper plate and cover with a wet paper towel.  Place in microwave and cook for 1 minute or until the tortillas are hot.
For each enchilada, place one tortilla on your work surface and place 2 tablespoons of meat in a line down the center.  Cover the meat  with 2 tablespoons cheese and 2 tablespoons sauce.  Roll tightly and place in prepared pan.  Repeat until all tortillas are used, pressing them tightly against one another to prevent unrolling during cooking.  Ladle sauce on top of enchiladas...covering them completely  (more sauce is better).  Sprinkle remaining cheese over the sauce. (more cheese is better too)
Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes.

Description: 
My favorite enchilada recipe. It's been loved, used and tweaked for many years.  The basic recipe calls for ground beef but I've used beef, pork, and chicken.
