Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds individually frozen chicken wing pieces (or thawed)
1 cup water
1 cup barbecue sauce
1 tablespoon butter, melted

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select manual function. Place a trivet in the pressure cooker and add the water. Place the wings on the trivet.
Close, lock the lid and seal the vent. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 12 minutes. Allow 20 to 25 minutes for pressure to build if wings are frozen. 10 to 15 minutes for thawed wings.
When cooking time is done release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Preheat broiler or air fryer (400 degrees for air fryer)
Remove the wings and pat dry with paper towels.
Mix melted butter and barbecue sauce. Baste the wings with the sauce.
Place the wings on a foil lined jelly roll pan.
Broil wings for 5 - 15 minutes turning once until desired caramelization and crispness is reached.  If you use an air fryer cook for 20 minutes turning halfway to ensure even browning until desired caramelization and crispness. Baste again with barbecue sauce if desired.
