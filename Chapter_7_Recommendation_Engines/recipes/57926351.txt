Ingredients:
4# bone in chicken,cut up.
4-5 stalks celery chopped.
1 large onion, diced.
2 T dried parsley or 1/3 C fresh.
1 1/2 C carrots chopped.
2 C chicken stock.
poultry seasoning or season salt.
kosher salt & black pepper.
DUMPLINGS:
2 C flour.
1 1/2 T baking powder.
2 t dried parsley.
2 1/2 t season salt blend.
1/4 C butter, melted.
3/4 C milk.

Directions:
In large stock pot, place chicken pieces, onion, parsley, celery, carrots and broth. Add water to cover chicken.
Add some seasonings(more will come later, so don't over season, now)
Simmer for about 2 hours until chicken is very tender and cooked through.
Remove chicken from pan onto large platter and let cool about 30 minutes.
Once cool enough to handle, carefully remove the meat from the bones and skin and return to stock pot.
Taste, reseason, and return to a simmer while preparing dumplings.
Add baking powder, parsley and season salt to flour and mix well to combine.
Add melted(slightly cooled) butter and mix slowly with fork until just mixed into flour mixture. This won't be crumbly like other biscuit type doughs, but will be slightly lumpy.
Slowly add milk to center of flour mixture and carefully mix until just combined. DO NOT OVER MIX
Drop dough by large spoonful into broth.
Let simmer, covered, about 10 minutes, carefully spoon broth over dumplings, then recover and simmer another 10-15 minutes until dumplings are cooked through.
