Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups rolled oats
1 cup candy-coated milk chocolate pieces (such as M&M;'s®)
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup flax seed meal
1/3 cup brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir oats, milk chocolate pieces, flour, flax seed meal, brown sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the oat mixture.
Whisk egg in a separate bowl until light and fluffy. Add honey, oil, and vanilla; whisk until well-combined. Pour egg mixture into the well in the oat mixture. Stir until evenly combined. Pour mixture into a 9x13-inch glass baking dish; pat down and spread the mixture flat, leaving at least 1-inch of space between the mixture and the sides of the dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and set, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
Very tasty! My uber-picky 12-year old even loves them, so I know that the toughest critic will enjoy these. For a crunchier bar, bake longer; for a chewier bar, bake less.
