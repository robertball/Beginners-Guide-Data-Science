Ingredients:
1 large pan cornbread, cooked and cooled
5 pieces white bread, torn into small pieces
4 eggs
1 onion, chopped
5 celery ribs, chopped
1 tsp. sage
1 tsp. poultry seasoning
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp. onion powder
1 tsp. thyme
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. pepper
16 oz. chicken stock
4 tbsp. butter

Directions:
Either toast the bread and cornbread or let it sit out to become crunchy.  Melt butter in saute pan and saute onion and celery until softened.  In a very large bowl, combine crumbled cornbread, white bread, all seasonings, beaten eggs, cooked onion and celery and half of the chicken stock.  Mix well.  If mixture appears dry keep adding in as much chicken stock as needed until it comes together.  Pour into a greased 9 by 13 inch baking dish and cook at 375 degrees for 45 minutes or until golden brown.

Description: 
This is my favorite dressing recipe. I sometimes add in cooked pork sausage for variety and other times I leave it out.  This is a staple at Thanksgiving and Christmas.
