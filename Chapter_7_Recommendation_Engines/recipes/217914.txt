Ingredients:
½ cup honey
4 teaspoons dry mustard powder
1 teaspoon curry powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons applesauce
4  chicken leg quarters
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
⅓ cup water

Directions:
Mix together the honey, dry mustard powder, curry powder, garlic powder, soy sauce, and applesauce in a bowl until thoroughly combined, and place the chicken legs into the mixture, spooning the honey mixture all over the chicken to coat.
Heat the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and place the chicken into the hot skillet, shaking off excess honey mixture. Retain extra honey mixture in bowl. Puncture a few holes in the chicken legs with a sharp meat fork, and brown the bottom sides of the chicken, about 8 minutes. Pour in water, and turn chicken legs over. Cover, and cook until the chicken meat is no longer pink inside and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 more minutes.
Drizzle the chicken with the remaining honey-curry mixture, bring to a boil, and spoon the pan drippings over the chicken to serve.
