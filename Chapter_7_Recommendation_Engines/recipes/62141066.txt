Ingredients:
1 package of the dry mix/dehydrated scalloped potatoes in any flavour of your choice.
4 medium potatoes peeled and sliced thin
1 1/2 cups water
1 1/2 cups milk
2 tbsp butter
1 cup sour cream
4oz cream cheese (optional)
1 handful of grated cheddar cheese

Directions:
Pour dry mix potatoes into a large pot
add 4 sliced potatoes
add water and milk
follow the directions on the package for STOVE TOP cooking.
Once potatoes are just cooked (do not over cook), remove from heat and add sour cream, butter, cream cheese and cheddar cheese.
If you would like to make it extra special, you can put it in an oven safe dish and sprinkle additional grated cheese on top and place under the broiler for a few minutes, but since these are technically NO BAKE, you don't have to and they are still amazinly good!  Guaranteed!
