Ingredients:
2 large eggs
3/4 cup sugar
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 cup whole milk

Directions:
Mix the cream and milk together in a large pot and heat over medium-low heat.
Beat the eggs in a separate bowl, until they turn lighter in color.  Slowly add the sugar while continuing to beat.
When an instant read thermometer reads 140 when inserted into the cream mixture, remove it from heat. While whisking the egg mixture, slowly add small amounts of the cream/milk mix until about a third of the cream and milk have been added. Pour in the rest of the cream and milk and mix thoroughly.
Return to heat and heat to 175 degrees.  Hold for 30 seconds.
Strain and chill until it reaches 40 degrees.
Freeze in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions.
