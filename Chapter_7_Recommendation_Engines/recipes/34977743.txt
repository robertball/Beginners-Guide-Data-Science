Description: 
Grandma and grandpa Johnson had a lovely home in Encino on an acre of property, a large portion of which was devoted to growing fruit trees and vegetable gardens. Included in the fruit they grew were persimmons, the kind that need to ripen till they're VERY soft. These are like little moist cakes and are wonderful topped with a cream cheese icing.
