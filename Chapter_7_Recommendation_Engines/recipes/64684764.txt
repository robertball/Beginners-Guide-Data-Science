Ingredients:
1 cup red wine (I prefer using a good Cabernet Sauvignon) *Please don't use cooking wine! Use the real stuff!
1/3 cup granulated sugar
6 whole cloves
1 cinnamon stick
1/2 teaspoon ground Jamaica allspice
5 oranges
2 tablespoons of fresh torn mint leaves

Directions:
In small sauce pan, bring the red wine, sugar and spices to a boil, stirring frequently.
Once at boil, reduce heat to med-low and simmer mixture until syrup like approximately 15 minutes.
Strain syrup into bowl and let cool (approx 5 minutes)
Cut peel and white pith from oranges.
Slice oranges into rounds and arrange onto plate.
Drizzle with reduced red wine syrup and garnish with mint leaves.
(note: I prefer chilled so set in fridge for extra 10 mins before serving)
