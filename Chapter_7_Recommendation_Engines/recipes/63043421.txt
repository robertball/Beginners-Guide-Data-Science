Ingredients:
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon natural peanut butter
1 teaspoon hoisin sauce
1/8 teaspoon salt
3 uncooked ounces soba noodles, cooked and drained
1/4 cup shelled, unsalted, raw pumpkin seeds
1/2 red bell pepper, finely diced
1 carrot, peeled and thinly sliced
2 radishes, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons green onion (scallion), thinly sliced
1 Quorn Naked cutlet or 2 small chicken tenderloins

Directions:
Cook soba noodles according to package, set aside. In a small skillet, heat pumpkin seeds over low-medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and beginning to pop. In a small bowl, lightly mix together peppers, radishes, and carrots. Whisk together garlic, parsley, olive oil, peanut butter, hoisin sauce, and salt. Set noodles, veggies, pumpkin seeds, and peanut butter mixture aside.
Cook Quorn cutlet or chicken in the microwave or skillet.  Once cooked through, dice into small pieces and add to peanut butter mixture while still hot. Mix well.  Stir in soba noodles.
Portion noodle mixture into dishes. Top each with raw vegetables, followed by pumpkin seeds and green onion.

Description: 
This is a light, fresh dish with Asian-inspired flavors.  The raw vegetables provide color and crunch to the salty, savory noodles. If you don't have hoisin sauce, you may want to substitute a little miso paste and/or soy sauce. 

It is not meant to be heavily sauced - if you like saucy noodles, you may want to double or triple the sauce portion of the recipe. It is best served at room temperature.
