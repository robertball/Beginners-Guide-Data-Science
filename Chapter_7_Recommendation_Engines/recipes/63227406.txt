Ingredients:
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup butter or margarine softened
1 tsp vanilla
1 large egg
2 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 bag chocolate chips

Directions:
Before you begin, pull out your butter/margarine sticks, take off the wrappers, cut them into 4ths, and let them sit at room temperature until you're ready to use them.
Heat oven to 375 degrees.
In large bowl, beat sugars, cubed butter, vanilla and egg with electric mixer on medium speed (or spoon if you don't have one) until consistent.
Stir in flour - adding it slowly, or in 1/4 measurements at a time.
Add baking soda and salt.  Dough will be stiff.  Stir in chocolate chips too.
Spoon dough onto an UNgreased cookie sheet in tablespoon measurements about 2 inches apart.
Bake 8-10 minutes or until light brown.  Remove from the oven, and transfer cookies onto a wire rack to cool (about 2 minutes).
