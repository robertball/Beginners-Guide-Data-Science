Ingredients:
6 boneless chicken breasts
for the marinade:
1-3 habanero chiles (scotch bonnet peppers), seeded and chopped. Use fewer if a more mild sause is desired, this is HOT
10 green onions, chopped
1/2 cup chopped onion
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 3-inch piece ginger, peeled and chopped
1/4 cup whole allspice
4 bay leaves, crushed
1/3 cup fresh thyme
1 teaspoon freshly-ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon freshly-ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon sea salt (to taste)
1 tablespoon freshly-ground black pepper
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup white vinegar
1/4 cup lime juice
1/2 cup orange juice

Directions:
Seed and finely chop habanero peppers (wear gloves). Trim chicken of fat. In a large bowl, combine the garlic, ginger, allspice, bay leaves, cinnamon, nutmeg, thyme, pepper, and salt. With a wire whisk, slowly add the olive oil, soy sauce, vinegar, orange juice, and lime juice. Add the Scotch Bonnet pepper, onion, green onions, and mix well. Add the chicken breasts, cover and marinate for at least 1 hour, longer if possible, but NOT overnight. Cook the breasts on the grill until thoroughly cooked. The marinade can be made into a sauce by reducing it on the stove top and adding about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch mixed in a quarter cup of water. Warning: this sauce sneaks up on you... don't eat too quickly!
I like this served on coconut rice with black beans.
