Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups sesame seeds
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
10 dried red chile peppers, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Toast the sesame seeds in a skillet over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Spread onto a baking sheet to cool.
Heat 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil in the skillet, again over medium-low heat. Fry the red chile peppers in the hot oil until they begin to change color, about 5 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet.
Use a mortar and pestle to grind the sesame seeds, chile peppers, and salt into a powder. Nuvvu podi will keep for a few months on the shelf.

Description: 
This is my favourite podi (powder). 'Nuvvu' is the Telugu word for 'til' or 'sesame seeds.' This powder is great eaten with rice. It also adds a lovely flavor when sprinkled into Andhra kooras (sabjis).
