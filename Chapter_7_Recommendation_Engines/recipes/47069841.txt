Ingredients:
2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon olive oil
8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/2 cup flour seasoned with salt and pepper to taste
1 pint heavy cream
1/4 cup Dijon mustard + Dijon mustard rub for breasts
4 teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon
1/4 cup white cooking wine
4 minced cloves of garlic
2 cups sliced mushrooms
1/2 onion chopped

Directions:
3-4 Hours before cooking, rub chicken breasts with Dijon Mustard, refrigerate.
Melt the butter and heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Coat chicken in seasoned flour, and place in the skillet. Brown on both sides. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and continue cooking 15 minutes, or until chicken juices run clear. Set aside and keep warm.
Deglaze the chicken pan with white wine.  Sautéed minced cloves of garlic, ½ of an onion, chopped, and 1 cup of sliced mushrooms until the onion was soft and the mushrooms were mostly cooked.  Stir cream into the pan, scraping up brown bits. Mix in mustard and tarragon. Cook and stir 5 minutes, or until thickened. Return chicken to skillet to coat with sauce. Drizzle chicken with remaining sauce to serve.
