Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
1 cup sour cream
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in water. Add the sour cream, egg, sugar, salt and 2/3 cup flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (dough will be sticky). Fold in cheese and pepper. Do not knead. Divide in half. Place in a greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
