Ingredients:
2 Cans of Yams or you can use sweet potatoes
2 cups Oatmeal
1/2 cup Brown Sugar or Brown Splend
2 teaspoon Pumpkin Pie Spice
Dash of Cinnamon
Small Marshmallows
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
In a small bowl combine brown sugar, oatmeal, spices and the butter and mix together to create a crumble like when you make coffee cake topping.  In your casserole dish place Yams first then your crumble and top with marshmallows. Cook in 350 degrees oven covered for 20 minutes and then uncover to toast the marshmallows.  This is a recipe I made by mistake this thanksgiving, I added the oatmeal to give my topping a thickness and it is amazing.
