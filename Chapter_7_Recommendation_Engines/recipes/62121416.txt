Ingredients:
-About 12-18 lasagna noodles (I use 18 of the Barilla No Bakes or 12 of the DaVinci Lasagne)
-1 cup grated parmesan cheese
-4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
-Sprigs of flat leaf parsley, for garnish
For the meat sauce:
-3 tbsp. olive oil
-1 lb. mixture of ground beef, veal, and pork
-4 oz. pancetta, diced
-1 vidalia onion, finely chopped
-3 garlic cloves, minced
-2/3 cup red wine (I use merlot)
-1 can (6oz.) tomato paste
-2 cans (28oz. each) crushed tomatoes
-14 baby carrots
-6 basil leaves, torn into pieces
-1 pinch Italian seasoning
-1 pinch red pepper
For the white sauce:
-2 1/2 cups whole milk
-1 bay leaf
-1 small Vidalia onion, diced
-1/4 cup butter
-1/3 cup all purpose flour
-1 pinch grated nutmeg

Directions:
If you're using the old fashioned noodles, blanch in a pot of boiled water, just until soft enough to slightly bend.  Make sure that you stir well.  Drain on paper towels.
Make the meat sauce.  First you want to steam or boil about 8 of the baby carrots until tender.  Then you want to process in a small chopper (or you could chop) and set aside.  Reserve the water used for steaming for later.  Heat the oil in a large pot and add the beef, veal, and pork mixture along with the onions and cook for about 5 minutes.  Add the pancetta and garlic and cook for 5 more minutes.  Stir in the wine and cook until well reduced.  Stir in the tomato paste and fill the can up twice with the starchy water previously used from the carrots steaming and add to the pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, carrot puree, the 6 basil leaves, Italian seasoning, red pepper, and salt and pepper to taste.  Also, throw in the remaining 6 carrots into the sauce.  These release sweetness and absorb the acid of the tomatoes.  You can leave them in or take them out later.  Bring to a boil and then lower the heat and cook for about one hour, tasting it halfway through and adjusting spices.
While the meat sauce is simmering, make the white sauce.  Pour the milk into a saucepan and add the bay leaf and onion.  Heat gently until the milk is just below the boiling point and then remove the pan from the heat and set aside to infuse for 10 minutes. Strain the milk into a large glass bowl, through a small sieve.  Discard the bay leaf and onion. Melt the butter in a clean saucepan and stir in the flour.  Cook for 1 minute, stirring with a whisk, then gradually add the strained milk mixture, until it boils and thickens to form a smooth sauce.  Season with salt and pepper and add nutmeg to taste.
Spread some meat sauce in the bottom of a rectangular baking dish.  Top with a single layer of pasta sheets.  Drizzle on some white sauce, then sprinkle with the parmesan and mozzarella.  Repeat the layers until all ingredients have been used, finishing with a layer made by swirling the last of the two sauces together.  Sprinkle with parmesan and mozzarella.
Preheat the oven to 375 and bake the lasagne for about 30 minutes until bubbling and golden brown.  Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting. Serve garnished with parsley.

Description: 
I got this recipe from my Aunt in Italy several years ago and everyone loves it!  It uses 2 sauces, a ragu and a bechamel, as opposed to the normal cheese and sauce layers. Enjoy!
