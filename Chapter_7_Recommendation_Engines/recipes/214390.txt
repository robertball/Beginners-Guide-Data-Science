Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) salmon fillets
1 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons bottled lime juice
2 tablespoons bottled lemon juice
2 teaspoons grated orange zest
2 teaspoons chopped garlic
1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place salmon in a single layer in a large baking dish. Whisk together vinegar, olive oil, honey, lime juice, lemon juice, orange zest, garlic, white sugar, ground ginger, chili powder, red pepper flakes, and salt in a large bowl. Pour over salmon. Marinate, refrigerated, for 1 to 3 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove fish from marinade. Discard used marinade. Place on preheated grill. Cook just until it flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes per side.
