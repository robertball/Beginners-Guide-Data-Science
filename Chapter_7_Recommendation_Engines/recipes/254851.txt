Ingredients:
3 large ripe tomatoes, quartered
3 tablespoons olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
6 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Place tomatoes into a food processor; blend until smooth.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in tomatoes, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until all liquid has evaporated from the tomatoes, 10 to 15 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium. Add eggs; cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is evenly dry and no large chunks remain, 7 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
Also called strapatsada, this simple dish consists of just three ingredients: eggs, tomatoes, and olive oil. You'll be amazed, however, at the depth of flavor that is derived from such simplicity. Serve with crusty bread and feta for any meal of the day, or even as part of a meze spread. Enjoy hot or cold, though I must say I like this dish better the next day after leaving it in the fridge all night!
