Ingredients:
2 cups rolled oats (not instant)
1 1/2 cups milk
2/3 cup (packed) brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup applesauce
1 cup flour
2/3 cup chopped walnuts or almonds
2/3 cup dried cranberries or dried cherries
3 Tablespoons maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Combine oats and milk in the mixing bowl. Stir together. Allow to soak for 5-8 minutes while you assemble the other ingredients.
In another bowl, stir together flour, cinnamon, and baking powder.
To the mixing bowl, once the oats have softened in the milk, add the applesauce and blended dry ingredients. Combine well.
Add nuts and cranberries(or cherries)and mix until evenly distributed.
Lightly spray a 8×10? pan with cooking spray or line it with parchment paper. Pour batter into pan and smooth to even out.
Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in to the middle comes out clean and mostly dry – not sticky or wet looking.
Remove pan from oven and poke holes with a toothpick (or kebab stick) across the top of the oatmeal bars evenly. Drizzle the syrup on top of the oatmeal bars and brush to cover. (Apply more if you wish for a sweeter bar)
Allow to cool. Cut in to bars/pieces.
Store covered or in an airtight container until ready to eat.  Bars will last 3-4 days on your counter top in an airtight container.
