Ingredients:
3/4 pound fresh green beans, trimmed and halved
4 1/2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon orange zest strips
kosher salt to taste
1 teaspoon grated orange zest

Directions:
Place green beans in a steamer basket over 1 inch of boiling water and cover. Cook until the beans are tender but still firm, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain, and keep warm.
Meanwhile, stir together olive oil and 1 tablespoon orange zest strips in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until the olive oil has been infused with the flavor of the orange zest, about 2 minutes. Discard zest strips.
Toss drained green beans with flavored olive oil and kosher salt over medium heat until the beans are hot and coated with oil. Place onto a serving dish and sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon grated orange zest to garnish.
