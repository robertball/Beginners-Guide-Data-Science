Ingredients:
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 cup peanut butter
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, cream together the margarine, peanut butter, and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the peanut butter mixture. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the unprepared cookie sheet.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Do not overbake: cookies will be soft and chewy. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
