Description: 
My family loves French fries and with 4 children the bag fries from the store just weren't enough and became too expensive.  So I tried batter - after all it makes chicken, shrimp, and onion rings crispy so why not potatoes.  Now even my husband can't get enough of these French fries.  They even stay crispy when you reheat in the microwave.
