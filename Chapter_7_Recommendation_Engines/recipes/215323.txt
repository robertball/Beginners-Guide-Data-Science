Ingredients:
1 pound giblets, neck, and clipped wing tips from turkey
2 carrots, roughly chopped
1 stalk celery, roughly chopped
6 cups water
2 cups chicken stock
1 1/2 cups turkey drippings from roasted turkey
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 tablespoons red currant jelly
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
While the turkey is roasting, place the giblets, turkey neck, and clipped turkey wing tips into a large saucepan with the carrots, celery, water, and chicken stock. Bring to a boil over medium heat, skim off any foam that forms on the top, reduce heat to low, and simmer the stock for 3 hours. Strain the stock, skim off the fat, and set aside. There should be about 4 cups of stock.
Skim off and discard all but 1/4 cup of the fat from the drippings in the roasting pan, and place the roasting pan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour, then cook and stir the flour mixture until it becomes pale golden brown, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the stock and tomato paste; bring to a boil, simmer for 5 minutes, then whisk in the red currant jelly. Simmer for 10 more minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.

Description: 
This unique turkey gravy is rich and delicious. Make the stock while your bird roasts; then as it rests, prepare the gravy. My family looks forward to this specialty every year.
