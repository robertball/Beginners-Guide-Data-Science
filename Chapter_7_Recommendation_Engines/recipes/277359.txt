Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
4 cups cabbage slaw mix
1 tablespoon chopped fresh jalapeno pepper
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup yellow cornmeal
2 tablespoons taco seasoning mix
1 pound cod fillets, cut into bite-sized pieces
8 (6 inch) corn tortillas

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray the basket of the air fryer with cooking spray.
Combine cabbage slaw, jalapeno pepper, lime juice, olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Mix until evenly combined and set aside.
Mix together flour, cornmeal, and taco seasoning in a separate bowl. Add fish pieces and toss until evenly coated, discarding any remaining seasoning mix. Place in the prepared air fryer basket and mist lightly with cooking spray.
Cook fish in the preheated air fryer for 5 minutes. Shake the basket, and cook until fish is crispy and flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes more. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate.
Place cabbage slaw mixture into the air fryer basket.
Cook until cabbage is caramelized, about 8 minutes, stirring halfway through the cooking time.
Spoon cabbage onto tortillas and top with fish.

Description: 
Unlike most fish taco recipes, the slaw in this recipe is air-fried instead of raw creating a caramelized version which leaves the fish to be the crispy star of the show.
