Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 egg whites
2/3 cup orange juice
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly coat muffin pans with nonstick cooking spray, set aside.
In a mixing bowl, stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Make a well in the center of flour mixture, set aside.
In a separate bowl, stir together egg whites, orange juice, oil and vanilla.  Add egg white mixture all at once to the flour mixture; stir just until moistened.  Fold in blueberries.  Spoon into prepared muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden and toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean.  Cool slightly before removing from pans. Serve warm with butter.
