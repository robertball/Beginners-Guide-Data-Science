Ingredients:
4 cups bran flakes cereal
2 cups wheat bran cereal (such as Kellogg's® All-Bran®)
2 cups boiling water
2 1/2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups shortening
4 eggs
5 cups all-purpose flour
5 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 quart buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a muffin pan or line with muffin cups.
Combine bran flakes and bran cereal in a heat-proof bowl. Cover with boiling water; stir and let sit until softened.
Beat sugar, shortening, and eggs together in a very large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy.
Sift flour, baking soda, and salt into a bowl. Add flour mixture and buttermilk alternately to sugar mixture. Stir in softened bran; mix until evenly incorporated.
Spoon batter evenly into prepared muffin pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 15 minutes.
