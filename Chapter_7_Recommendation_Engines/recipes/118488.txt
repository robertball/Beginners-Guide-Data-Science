Ingredients:
4 cups Assorted fresh berries
1 cup sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons cornstarch
SPONGE CAKE:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/8 cups sugar, divided
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 eggs, separated
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
CREAM FILLING:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
2 cups whipping cream, whipped

Directions:
In a bowl, combine berries, sugar and lemon juice. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Gently press berries; drain, reserving juice. Set berries aside. In a large saucepan, combine cornstarch and reserved juice until smooth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Cool completely.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, 1 cup sugar, baking powder and salt. Whisk egg yolks, water and oil; add to dry ingredients, beating until smooth. In another mixing bowl, beat egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining sugar, beating on high until stiff peaks form; fold into batter. Spread into an ungreased 9-in. springform pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for 30-38 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.
In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and confectioners' sugar until smooth. Fold in whipped cream. Split cake into three layers; place one layer on a serving plate. Spread with a third of the filling; top with a third of the berries and drizzle with 1/4 cup berry syrup. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.

Description: 
'I love traditional tiramisu,' notes Diane Way of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 'but my husband was never crazy about the coffee flavor. So I got a little creative, leaving out the mocha and adding fresh berries. The result was luscious!'
