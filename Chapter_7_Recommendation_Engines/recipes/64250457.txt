Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground clove (optional)
1 cup sweet potato, baked
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup walnuts or pecans, toasted and chopped, optional

Directions:
Center a rack in the oven and heat to 350ยบ F.
Butter and flour an 8 1/2- x 4 1/2- x 2 1/2-inch loaf pan.
Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon together, set aside.
In the bottom of a medium bowl, mash sweet potato into a chunky paste. Whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, eggs and vanilla into the sweet potato until blended.
Switch to a large rubber spatula.
Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then add the dry ingredients in 3 parts, stirring gently until they disappear and the batter is smooth.
Stir in nuts.
Pour batter into the pan and smooth the top.
Bake 50-60 minutes, or until a tooth pick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean.
After 30 minutes in the oven, check the bread for color. If it looks like it is browning too quickly, loosely cover with aluminum foil.
When the bread is done, transfer it, in the pan, to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes.
Unmold the bread and place right side up on the rack to cool.
