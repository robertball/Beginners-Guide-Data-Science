Description: 
This is a recipe handed down to me from my mother-in-law. My husband and I LOVE to make these together! He makes the puffs while I make the filling and the frosting. A cookie press makes this recipe much easier! We use it to press out the puffs onto the cookie sheet, as well as to fill the puffs AND to frost them! We always get rave reviews when we bring this dessert to a gathering, and it is the first to go! (Note: You WILL have extra filling)!
