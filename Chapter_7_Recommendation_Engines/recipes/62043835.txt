1 can (19.75 oz.) Campbell's pork and beans
1 1/2 cups cooked elbow macaroni or small shells

1 5.5 oz. can V8

Directions:
Preheat oven according to biscuit package.  Brown turkey with green pepper in skillet.  Drain fat and return to skillet.  Stir in beans, cooked macaroni, V8 and salt & pepper.  Heat through.  Pour mixture into casserole dish.  Place uncovered in oven.  Meanwhile, quarter biscuits and place on baking sheet.  Bake according to directions on package.  When biscuits are almost done, remove casserole from oven and stir.  Top with cheese of choice and return to oven until cheese melts.  When done, dish out onto serving plates and press several biscuit pieces into the casserole.  Great served with a salad.  This is my husband's favorite.  Enjoy!!
