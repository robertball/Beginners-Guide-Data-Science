Ingredients:
2 pounds red potatoes
1 bunch green onions, chopped, dark green parts separated from white and light green parts
3 cloves minced garlic
3/4 cup plain soy yogurt
1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard
1 pinch cayenne pepper
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water until cool enough to handle. Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch cubes.
Water saute white and light green onion pieces until soft and slightly golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, stir, and remove skillet from heat.
Stir potatoes, green onion-garlic mixture, dark green onion pieces, yogurt, yellow mustard, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until evenly combined.

Description: 
Chef John's quick-and-easy green onion potato salad passes by mayonnaise in favor of yogurt and garlic with a touch of mustard. I left out the oil and used soy yogurt for a healthier outcome.Modified from: Almost Fat-Free Green Onion Potato Salad
