Ingredients:
1 large head cabbage, shredded
2 bunches scallions, finely chopped
1 shallot, finely chopped
1 cup shredded carrots
2 stalks celery, shredded
1x1 inch piece ginger, shredded and chopped.
1-1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup white vinegar
3 tbsp sweet rice wine vinegar
3 drops sesame seed oil
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon dry mustard
1 tbsp Tahini

Directions:
Using a food processor with a shredder or a manual grater, shred the cabbage, carrots, celery, and ginger. Place in a large mixing bowl;
Finely chop the shallot and scallions (all of the scallion other than the roots) using the blade attachment of a food processor or finely chop with a knife;
Combine cabbage, scallion, ginger, carrots, and celery with 1 cup sugar and the tahini*, and mix well.  Let stand while completing the next step;
In a small saucepan, combine vinegar, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, vegetable oil, salt, and dry mustard. Bring to a boil;
Pour hot dressing over cabbage mixture, and mix well.  Transfer to a plastic container, as metal bowls may interact with the vinegars, and refrigerate for at least 24 hours prior to serving;
Transfer to a serving bowl with a slotted spoon or mesh spoon to allow excess liquid to drain back into the proofing container. You can garnish with toasted sesame seeds or black sesame seeds or both!
