Ingredients:
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
4 tablespoons whole milk
2 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate mini chips
2 squares of 72% or higher dark chocolate
1 egg
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 pinch of Mexican chili pepper
Sea salt

Directions:
In a medium bowl, beat the egg, brown sugar, and chili pepper until smooth.
In a small pan, mix the cream and milk.  Heat on low until the milk starts to bubble.  Remove from heat and stir in chocolate until the mixture is smooth.
Slowly, add the chocolate mixture to the egg mixture while whisking constantly.  Once smooth, pour into ramekins.
Cover each ramekin with foil and puncture the center of the foil in each.
Place in a baking dish and fill with hot tap water half-way up the ramekins.
Bake at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes.  Allow to cool in water bath for another 30 minutes on the counter.  Refrigerate 4 hours or until time to serve.
Sprinkle with sea salt to serve.
