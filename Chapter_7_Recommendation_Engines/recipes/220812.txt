Ingredients:
3 cups thick-cut oatmeal
1/2 cup hulled sunflower seeds
1/3 cup hulled pumpkin seeds

1 tablespoon wheat germ
1 cup chopped dried cherries
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2/3 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/3 cup pure maple syrup
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Combine oatmeal, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, flax seeds, wheat germ, chopped dried cherries, salt, and cinnamon in a large bowl.
Mix applesauce, maple syrup, and vanilla in a separate bowl.
Pour applesauce mixture over the oatmeal mixture; mix until evenly coated.
Spread the mixture onto the prepared baking sheets; smooth into a single thin layer.
Bake in preheated oven 20 minutes, stir gently to turn, and continue cooking until crisp and golden brown, another 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
After searching for a healthier granola recipe, I tweaked a few to lessen the sugar. I use seeds instead of nuts due to allergies. Still very crunchy, delicious, and satisfying! Change the dried fruit to fit your tastes (blueberries, cherries, cranberries, apricots, etc.).
