1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon dried rosemary
3 bay leaves
1 cup soy sauce

Description: 
Wow...A favorite with all my family and friends. I refuse to give any of them the recipe because it is so easy. I love it when they keep asking for it! I often throw all the ingredients into slow cooker and head to work. We all eat when ever we get in the door. The au jus is great! Add beef to lightly toasted buns, and dip away in the au jus.
