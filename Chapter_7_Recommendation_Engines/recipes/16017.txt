Ingredients:
8 tablespoons melted butter
6 tablespoons corn syrup
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 pounds confectioners' sugar
3 (10 ounce) jars maraschino cherries, drained
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 tablespoon shortening

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine butter, corn syrup, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla, and sugar. Knead dough, and form it into balls with a cherry wrapped in the middle. The balls should be approximately the size of walnuts. Place balls in the freezer to chill.
In a double boiler, melt chocolate chips and shortening together. Dip the cooled balls in the chocolate, let cool on parchment paper.

Description: 
Very good--better than store-bought! Make them a week or two before serving, so the candies will develop the juice around the cherries.
