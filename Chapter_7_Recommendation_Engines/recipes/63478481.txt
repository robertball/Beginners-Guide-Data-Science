Ingredients:
soup:
2-3 pounds of cooked chicken, chopped (I use the pickings from my rotisserie recipe)
1 carrot peeled and grated
2 celery chopped
1 onion chopped
2 cans chicken broth
1 can vegetable broth
4 cups water
2 tsp dried parsley
2 tsp dried thyme
corn starch to thicken
Drop Dumplings:
2 cups flour
3 tsp baking powder
2 tsp salt
2 tbsp butter
1 cup milk
2 tsp dried parsley
3-4 quarts boiling water

Directions:
In a stock pot add onions and celery with broth and simmer until soft.
Add chicken, water, parsley, thyme and carrots and bring to a slow boil.
Add cornstarch to water in a cup and pour into chicken soup. Continue until soup is to desired thickness.
Dumplings:
Warm milk and butter in microwave for 1 minute, or until butter and milk are well incorporated.
Sift flour, baking powder, salt into milk and butter, and mix.
Mix in dried parsley.
Drop teaspoon sized dollops of batter into gently boiling water, stirring gently to keep them from sticking.
Once they begin to float, move them to chicken soup, mixing them in.

Description: 
A great way to enjoy left over chicken. Make a comfort food for the cold weather. My kids asked for seconds and thirds and the left overs from this goes great in a chicken pot pie.
