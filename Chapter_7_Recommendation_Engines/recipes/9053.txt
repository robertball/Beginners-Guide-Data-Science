Ingredients:
1 cup diced, cooked chicken meat
1 (10 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables, thawed
1 ½ cups chicken broth
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine chicken, vegetables and broth or wine in a medium saucepan over medium low heat. Stir all together and let simmer until heated through.
In a small bowl beat cornstarch into evaporated milk and add to chicken mixture. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste, unless leftover chicken has enough of its own seasoning already. Serve hot.

Description: 
I make this with leftover chicken, and serve it over biscuits or pastry shells. A good way to use up leftovers that won't quite stretch by themselves!
