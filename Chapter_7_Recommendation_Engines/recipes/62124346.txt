Ingredients:
2 Tbsps olive oil
1 large onion, cut into thin wedges
2 tbsps minced garlic
1 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes, do not drain
2 cups sliced cremini, portabella, or white button mushrooms
1 cup pimento-stuffed olives, coarsely chopped
2 tbsps each: fresh oregano and parsley, chopped fine. Use 1/2 the amount of dried if fresh is not available.
2 tbsps lemon jiuce
Salt and pepper to taste
4 6-8oz flounder filets

Directions:
For sauce, in a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat.  Add onion and garlic; cook 2-3 minutes, or until onion is tender.  Add undrained tomatoes, mushrooms, olives, oregano, salt, and pepper, and lemon juice.  Bring sauce to boiling.
Gently place fish in skillet; spoon sauce over fish.  Return to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer covered 8-10 minutes, or until fish flakes easily with a fork.  With a wide spatula, carefully lift fish from skillet to a serving platter.  Spoon sauce over fish and serve.

Description: 
This recipe has quickly become a family favorite since the first happy accident that created it. Most of the ingredients are already on hand, and it cooks up quick and delicious.  The best part is that there is only one skillet to clean!  Serve with hot buttered rice, crusty bread, and a small green salad for a light but satisfying meal.  Use whatever flaky white-fleshed fish you have on hand, such as sole, halibut, or tilapia.  Also try substituting bone-in pork chops, or chicken breasts for the fish.  Adjust cooking time accordingly.  It tastes great no matter what protein source you choose!
