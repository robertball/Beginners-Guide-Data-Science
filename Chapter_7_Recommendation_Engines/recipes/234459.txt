Ingredients:
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
Icing:
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 tablespoon hot water, or as needed
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
24 whole pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
Sift flour, baking soda, and 1/8 teaspoon salt together in a bowl.
Beat 1 cup butter, white sugar, and egg in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add flour mixture, vanilla extract, and lemon extract to butter mixture; stir until dough is well blended. Roll cookie dough into walnut-size balls and place 2 inches apart onto prepared cookie sheets. Press each ball down with the bottom of a glass to flatten slightly.
Bake in the preheated oven until baked through, 6 to 7 minutes. Cool.
Stir confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter, hot water, and vanilla together in a bowl until sugar is completely dissolved and icing is smooth. Spread icing on cooled cookies and top each cookie with a pecan.

Description: 
My grandma, Opal June Carlson (Gram C), made these cookies whenever my dad and I came to her cottage on Lake Okoboji for a visit. Although at the time I picked off the pecan halves that my 7-year-old self didn't yet appreciate, these simply delicious cookies were amazing and will live forever in my heart along with my Gram C!
