Ingredients:
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, or more to taste
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 pounds fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
1/2 cup unsalted raw cashews
3 1/2 cups vegetable broth
1 (14 ounce) can organic coconut milk
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Combine coconut oil and onion in a large pot over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, salt, rosemary, thyme, and pepper; cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add asparagus. Cook and stir over medium heat for 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium-low and add cashews, vegetable broth, and coconut milk. Bring to a low boil, cover, and simmer until asparagus is tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Turn off heat and stir in lemon juice. Let stand until cooled slightly.
Puree asparagus soup using an immersion blender until smooth. Garnish with chopped parsley.

Description: 
Delicious cream of asparagus soup. Perfect for yummy, light dinners.. I serve this soup with gluten-free croutons or toast and finely chopped parsley. You can also refrigerate the asparagus soup for 3 to 4 hours and serve it chilled, but I prefer it served warm.
