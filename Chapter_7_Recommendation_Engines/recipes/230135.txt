Ingredients:
6 (2.07 ounce) candy bars
2 teaspoons butter for greasing, or as needed
3 cups white sugar
3/4 cup butter
2/3 cup evaporated milk
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Place candy bars into freezer for about 10 minutes to firm; slice 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch thick.
Line a 9-inch square baking dish with aluminum foil amd grease with butter.
Heat sugar, 3/4 cup butter, and evaporated milk in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring to melt butter and dissolve sugar. Bring mixture to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until a candy thermometer inserted into the middle of the syrup reads 234 degrees F (110 degrees C), 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir chocolate chips into syrup until melted and smooth. Stir marshmallow cream and vanilla extract into mixture to make a smooth fudge.
Spread half the fudge into the prepared dish and layer the candy bar pieces over the fudge; pour remaining fudge on top of candy bars. Let cool to room temperature before cutting into squares.

This is a recipe that I found years ago and it was made with Milky Way速 bars and I changed it. I have used Snickers速, 3 Musketeers速, Milky Way速, etc. My kids love this.
