2 tablespoons smoked olive oil

Description: 
Fresh salad, great side for summer dinners. Use regular olive oil if smoked olive oil is unavailable. Smoked olive oil has its own unique taste, and while you could substitute with regular olive oil I would strongly suggest trying the smoked first; it is really amazing.
