Ingredients:
4 cups granulated sugar
3/4 cups unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon honey
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Place all the ingredients, except butter, in a medium large pot and turn to medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. once boiling, allow mixture to double in size. Once doubled, turn heat to low and allow mixture to get to soft-ball stage. To do this allow a few drops of the mixture to drop in to a cup of water and leave it for 5 seconds. Pick the drops out of the water and if it flattens out in a few seconds, take the mixture off heat and set it into a saucepan filled with water. Place the butter into the mixture and do not stir it in. Once you can touch the bottom without burning yourself, take the pan and stir constantly using a wooden spoon. When the fudge loses its gloss, poor it into a 9 by 9, buttered pan. Allow the fudge to sit till it's hard. Cut into squares and serve.
