Ingredients:
Crust:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup shortening
1/4 cup water
2 eggs
1 tablespoon lemon juice
Filling:
6 apples - peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch thick slices, or more to taste
1 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk 2 cups flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut shortening into flour mixture using a pastry blender or a fork until crumbly.
Whisk water, eggs, and lemon juice together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until dough forms a ball. Split dough into halves; roll each half into about a 9x13-inch rectangle. Press 1 rectangle into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Place apple slices in a large bowl; add sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, and cinnamon. Toss apples to coat; spread over crust. Cover apple filling with remaining crust, piecing together any scraps to cover any holes. Cut several slits into top crust for ventilation while cooking.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are browned and crisp, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool to room temperature before cutting into squares, about 30 minutes.
