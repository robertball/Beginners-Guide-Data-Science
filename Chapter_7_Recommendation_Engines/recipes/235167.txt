Ingredients:
1 tablespoon paprika
2 teaspoons onion powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons ground thyme
1 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste
1 (3 pound) pork roast, cut into 3-inch chops
2 1/2 tablespoons canola oil, divided
1 1/2 teaspoons butter
2 onions, sliced
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle wheat beer, divided
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
3/4 cup barbeque sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 (1.5 fluid ounce) jiggers bourbon whiskey
3 dashes hot pepper sauce
6 crusty bread rolls, split

Directions:
Combine paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, thyme, and salt in a small bowl; season with black pepper.
Blot pork chops dry with paper towels, then rub with paprika mixture.
Heat about 2 tablespoons canola oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Fry pork chops in batches until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer browned pork chops to a slow cooker.
Wipe skillet clean and heat remaining 1 1/2 teaspoon canola oil and butter over medium heat; cook and stir onions, 1/2 bottle beer, and a pinch of salt until onion is tender and slightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add liquid smoke. Spread onions over pork.
Mix barbeque sauce, remaining beer, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, bourbon, and hot sauce in a bowl; pour over pork.
Cook pork on Low until very tender, about 8 hours. Shred and divide pork over rolls to make sandwiches.
