Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups long grain white rice
2 1/2 cups water
3 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
1 pound fresh tomatillos, husks removed
3 jalapeno peppers, cut into large pieces
1 clove garlic
1 tablespoon salt, or to taste
1 tablespoon corn oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 1/2 pounds swai fish
1 clove garlic, minced
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice

Directions:
Combine the rice, water and bouillon in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes or until rice is tender and water has been absorbed. Set aside.
Meanwhile, in a large pot, bring about 2 inches of water to a boil. Add jalapenos, and cook for 5 minutes, then add the tomatillos. Boil for 5 more minutes. Remove the tomatillos with a slotted spoon, and transfer to a blender. Add 1 clove of garlic, salt and 1 or 2 jalapenos. Puree until liquid, then taste, and blend in more jalapeno as desired. Set aside.
Heat the corn oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and 1 clove of garlic; cook and stir until fragrant. Add the fish fillets, and cook for about 2 minutes per side. Pour in the tomatillo sauce, and mix in the cilantro and lime juice. Simmer for a few minutes, or place under a broiler until fish flakes easily with a fork.
Serve fish immediately on a bed of rice. Spoon sauce over the top. Enjoy with your favorite ice cold beverage. Buen Apetito!

This is a recipe that I tried and my husband and I really liked it. I made it spicy, but you can control the heat.
