Ingredients:
1 tablespoon duck fat
3 unpeeled red potatoes, diced
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper

Directions:
Melt duck fat in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering, about 1 minute. Add potatoes; cook, stirring minimally, until potatoes are golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess fat.
Combine parsley, salt, and white pepper in a bowl; toss over cooked potatoes to coat evenly.
