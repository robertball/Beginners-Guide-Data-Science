Ingredients:
8 ounces shredded vegan cheddar cheese
3/4 cup room temperature water, divided
1/2 cup cooked Mexican style black beans
10 ounce can diced tomatoes with green chiles (such as Rotel®)
1 tbsp pickled jalapenos, optional

Directions:
Put the vegan cheese shreds in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave at 900W for one minute. Remove from the microwave. Stirring constantly, add 1/2 cup water. Microwave again for another minute at 900W. Stir to create a smooth texture. Continue to microwave and add water until the desired consistency has been reached.
Fold in the black beans and tomatoes. Top with pickled jalapenos. Serve warm.
