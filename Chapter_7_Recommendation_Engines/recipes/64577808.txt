Ingredients:
6 cups low sodium chicken broth
½ white onion, chopped
3 ribs celery, chopped
¾ teaspoon Mexican oregano (or regular oregano)
1 teaspoon garlic, chopped
¼ teaspoon ground chipotle, or to taste
1  peeled and spiralized butternut squash (a 4 inch section will yield plenty of noodles)
2 cups diced cooked turkey
1  peeled and spiralized butternut squash (a 4 inch section will yield plenty of noodles)
Cilantro or parsley, chopped for garnish

Directions:
1) Bring chicken broth, onion, celery, oregano, garlic and ground chipotle to a boil in a large pot. Cover, reduce heat and simmer about 20 minutes.
2) Cut the neck off of the butternut squash above the portion housing the seeds, peel off skin and spiralize.
3) Add turkey and spiralized butternut squash; simmer until heated through, about 3 to 5 minutes. Garnish with chopped cilantro or parsley.
Notes/Footnotes:
This can easily be converted to a vegetarian recipe by using vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth and eliminating the turkey. You can also sub chicken for the turkey.
