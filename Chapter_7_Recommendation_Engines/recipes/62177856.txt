Image:

Ingredients:
1 Qt milk of your choice, skim, 1%, 2% or whole (I  use skim organic)
1 container of PLAIN yogurt (again, I use fat free organic)
A thermal container of some kind (I use a jumbo insulated mug but when making a larger recipe, I used a plastic container inside a 6 pack cooler)
Note: you MUST have a thermometer to make this recipe

Directions:
Place milk in a pan & heat to boiling (212 degrees), stirring occasionally
Once milk reaches boiling, remove from heat & let cool to 122 degrees
Once milk has reached 122 (IMPORTANT.... do NOT add the yogurt if the temp is above 122 or it will kill the cultures and therefore not make yogurt) stir a bit of yogurt. It can be as little as a teaspoon or the entire containter, you just need some to get the active cultures
Pour into thermal container, seal and set aside for 8-12 hours (time is up to you)
After the resting period, pour the yogurt into a storage container and refrigerate.

Description: 
Make your own yogurt in these easy steps! You can make however much yogurt you want. I just listed a quart for this recipe but it's basically foolproof, I have yet to have a recipe NOT turn out. The type of milk and yogurt for your starter is entirely up to you. Once you make your first batch you never have to buy yogurt again... just use a bit from your old batch to make your next!
