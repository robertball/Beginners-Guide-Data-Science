Ingredients:
½ cup water
½ cup ketchup
1 large onion, halved and sliced
¼ cup low sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon honey, or more to taste
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon garlic powder
⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
⅛ teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 (4 to 6 pound) whole chicken

Directions:
Stir water, ketchup, onion, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, honey, flour, garlic powder, black pepper, and poultry seasoning together in an oven-safe Dutch oven. Simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend, 5 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place chicken in Dutch oven and turn to coat in ketchup mixture. Spoon 1/4 the mixture and onions into the chicken cavity. Place chicken breast side down into Dutch oven; cover with an oven-proof lid.
Bake chicken in the preheated oven, basting once, for 45 minutes. Uncover the Dutch oven and increase heat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Turn chicken breast side up and bake until chicken has browned, about 15 more minutes. Let chicken stand for about 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite recipes and was given to me by a neighbor many years ago. I've been making it ever since when the weather is cool and it is cozy to have the oven on. It is a no fail, super-easy recipe and I guarantee it will please your family and friends. The recipe can also be made with a cut up chicken.
