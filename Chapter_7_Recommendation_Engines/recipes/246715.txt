1/4 cup chopped fresh mint, or more to taste
1/4 cup lime juice
3 tablespoons fish sauce

Bring water to a simmer in a large skillet over medium heat. Add turkey; cook and stir until no longer pink and and it registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) on an instant-read thermometer, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat.
