Ingredients:
1.5 cups Flour
1 tspn Baking Powder
1.5 cups Oatmeal
1/2 (heaping) tspn Salt
1/2 cup Room-Temp Butter
1 tspn Vanilla Extract
2 tblspn Room-Temp Peanut Butter
3/4 cup White Sugar
1/2 cup Brown Sugar
2 Eggs
1/2 cup White Chocolate Chips
1/2 cup Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
3/4 cup Dried Cranberries

Directions:
1. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt.  Combine with oatmeal. Set aside.
2. Cream butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together until lightens in color, about 3-4 minutes.  Thoroughly mix in peanut butter, vanilla, and eggs.
3. Add dry ingredients into wet, 1 cup at a time, until just combined (do not over beat).  Then fold in remaining ingredients.
4. Press batter into a log on parchment or plastic wrap and twist both ends to make a smooth log, about 12-14" long and 3" in diameter.  Batter may be frozen at this point.  Or chill for at least 30 minutes before cooking, if so, preheat oven to 350.
5. To cook, using knife, cut 3/4" slices from log and place onto silpat-lined baking sheet (or lightly greased).  Cook 10-12 minutes, until almost firm, cool on cookie sheet until firm.

Description: 
My sister makes the best cranberry oatmeal toffee cookies, but lacking the right ingredients I came up with a new variation, which I love -- maybe you will too!
