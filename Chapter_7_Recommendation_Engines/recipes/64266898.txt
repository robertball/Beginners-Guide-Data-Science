Description: 
This is served every year for breakfast after we open presents from Santa Claus.  My niece request this at our family get together also.  It is a family tradition to have hash brown casserole.  I thought I'd try another recipe instead this year but my daughter screamed No!  It's not Christmas without it!!!)
