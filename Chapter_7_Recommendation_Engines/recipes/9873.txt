Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
3/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
3 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
To make crust:  Mix together the butter, 1 1/3 cups flour and 1/4 cup sugar with a fork until crumbly.  Press into an 8 inch square pan and bake for 20 minutes.  Crust will look white.  Do not brown!
Combine the eggs, 3/4 cup of sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, baking powder and lemon juice in a blender. Blend until well mixed.  Pour over pre-baked crust.
Return to oven and bake an additional 20 minutes.  Remove from oven and sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Let bars cool before cutting.
