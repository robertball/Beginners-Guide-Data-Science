Ingredients:
6 large bone-in chicken breast halves
1 (10 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1 (10 ounce) can cream of chicken soup
1 (15 ounce) can chili, no beans
1 cup picante sauce
1/2 cup milk
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
12 corn tortillas, torn into strips
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place chicken in a baking dish. Cover and bake for 1 hour in preheated oven. Remove chicken from dish and allow to cool. Remove meat from bone and tear into small pieces.
Meanwhile, mix the cream of mushroom soup, the cream of chicken soup, chili, picante sauce, milk, onion, cumin, and garlic powder in a large bowl.
Spread half the shredded chicken into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover the chicken with half of the tortilla pieces. Pour half of the sauce on top of the tortillas; sprinkle half the Cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack cheese evenly over the dish. Repeat the layers with the rest of the ingredients.
Bake in preheated oven until all the cheese has melted and sauce mixture is bubbling, 35 to 40 minutes.

This family pleaser is definitely not your ordinary chicken casserole. I started making this years ago and still get requests for it.
