Description: 
This recipe was a most requested one from a former neighbor of my mother-in-law.  She was always making these for anyone in the area that was having an event.  They are the best rolls I've ever experienced. To get the lukewarm milk gently warm on stovetop or microwave. It should not be hot or cold.
