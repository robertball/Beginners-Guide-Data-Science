Ingredients:
1 original Bobli Crust (thicker one)
1/3 C Alfredo sauce
3 TBS. Pesto
2 portabello mushroom caps grilled
8-10 stalks asparagus, grilled
1 medium grilled chicken breast(I use an italian marinade)
2 roma tomatos, thinly sliced.
1/2 C 5 blend italian cheese

Directions:
1. Grill Chicken Breast
2. lightly coat mushrooms in olive oil, salt and pepper, and grill until cooked.
3. lightly coat asparagus in olive oil, salt and pepper, grill until just tender, you still want them to crunch.
4. Combine your alredo sauce and pesto, spread over crust. you can add more or less sauce if you want too.
5. When you are done grilling, thinly slice the chicken, mushrooms; place on the pizza.
6. cut the asparagus into 1 inch pieces and place on pizza.
7. Top with the thinly sliced romas
8. Lightly top with cheese.
9. Turn your grill to low heat, place pizza on the grill.  You want to grill the pizza until the cheese is fully melted. and if you lift the pizza crust and tap it, the crust should be hollow sounding.
The grilling process should take around 15 min.
10.  Make sure to bring a cookie sheet to carry your pizza in on, it will be hot and delicious!
