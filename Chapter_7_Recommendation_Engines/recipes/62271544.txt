Ingredients:
2 lbs. ground beef
5 garlic cloves minced
1 lg onion chopped
1 tspn salt
3 cans chili beans w/hot or mild sauce
3 cans tomatoes w/green chiles
2 Tspn cumin
2 Tblspn chile powder
optional:
1 small bunch chopped cilantro
2 serrano peppers minced
grated cheddar cheese
corn chips

Directions:
In a dutch oven cook ground beef, salt, onion, and garlic until meat is brown and crumbly.  Drain off excess fat.  Stir in next 4 ingredients and simmer for 30 minutes.  You can add more cumin and chile powder at this point if the seasonings need to be adjusted.  You can serve right away, but I find that the chili tastes even better the next day after the flavors have melded together.  You can serve the chili over corn chips and garnish with cheese, cilantro and chopped serrano peppers for extra heat.  ENJOY!!
