Description: 
'I was fixing a Western omelet form my husband while frying up potatoes in another pan,' recalls Shirley Frank of Neponset, Illinois. 'I cut up too many vegetables for the omelet and didn't want to waste them, so I added them to the potatoes. Everyone wanted a taste. Now I make this hash at least once a month.'
