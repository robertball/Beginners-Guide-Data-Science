Ingredients:
1 medium pineapple, peeled and cored
8 dried pasilla and/or guajillo chile peppers
¼ cup orange juice
¼ cup vinegar
4 cloves garlic, minced
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground cumin
? teaspoon ground cloves
2 pounds boneless pork loin, cut into 1/2-inch slices

Directions:
Cut pineapple into 1/2-inch slices, reserving juice; cover and refrigerate pineapple and reserved juice separately.
Remove stems and seeds from dried chiles (tip, p. xx). Place chiles in a medium bowl and add enough boiling water to cover. Let stand 30 minutes or until soft; drain, discarding liquid.
In a food processor or blender combine the reserved pineapple juice, the chiles, and the next six ingredients (through cloves). Cover and process or blend until nearly smooth.
In a 3-qt. rectangular baking dish arrange pork slices in a single layer, overlapping slices as necessary. Pour chile pepper mixture over pork, spreading evenly. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours. Remove pork from marinade, discarding marinade.
Grill pineapple and pork slices, covered, over medium heat 6 to 7 minutes or until pork slices are slightly pink in the center and juices run clear (160°F), turning once. Coarsely chop pork and pineapple.
