Ingredients:
1 lemon
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell'sÂ® Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup (Regular or 98% Fat Free)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (6 pound) roasting chicken
1/4 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Heat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Grate 1 1/2 teaspoons zest and squeeze 1 tablespoon juice from the lemon.
Stir the lemon zest, lemon juice, soup, rosemary, thyme and garlic in a medium bowl.  Reserve 1 cup soup mixture for the gravy. Place the chicken into a shallow roasting pan.
Roast the chicken for 20 minutes. Brush the chicken with 1/4 cup soup mixture.
Roast for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.  Remove the chicken to a serving platter and keep warm.
Spoon off any fat from the pan juices.  Stir the wine in the roasting pan and heat over medium-high heat to a boil, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  Stir in the reserved soup mixture and water and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling.  Serve the gravy with the chicken.
