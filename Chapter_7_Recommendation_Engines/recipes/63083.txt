Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package hot roll mix
1/4 cup Equal速 Spoonful*
2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided
1 cup very hot tap water
1 egg, slightly beaten
1/4 cup Equal速 Spoonful**
5 tablespoons unsalted stick butter or margarine, melted
3/4 cup dried cranberries
1 cup reduced-fat granola cereal
4 ounces reduced fat cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons Equal速 Spoonful***
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoons 2% milk

Directions:
Combine hot roll mix, yeast packet, 1/4 cup Equal(r) and 1-1/2 teaspoons cinnamon. Stir in hot water, egg and 3 tablespoons melted butter. Mix until a soft dough forms. Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead in cranberries. Continue to knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 3 minutes. Shape into a ball. Cover with a bowl and let rest 5 minutes.
Spray a 15x10-inch baking pan with non-stick cooking spray. Press dough evenly into pan. Combine 1/4 cup Equal(r), remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Spread over surface of dough. Sprinkle with granola, pressing lightly into dough. Cover with waxed paper and let rise until puffy, about 25 minutes.
Bake in preheated 375 degree F oven 18 to 22 minutes or until edges are golden. Cool in pan on wire rack 5 minutes. Meanwhile, beat cream cheese, 2 tablespoons Equal(r), vanilla and enough milk to form a spreading consistency. Drizzle cream cheese mixture over warm focaccia. Serve warm or at room temperature.
