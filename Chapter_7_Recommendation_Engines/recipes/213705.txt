Ingredients:
1 clove garlic, peeled
5 serrano peppers
1/2 onion, cut into 4 wedges
10 roma (plum) tomatoes
sea salt to taste

Directions:
Cover a large griddle or skillet with aluminum foil and heat on the stove over medium-high heat. Roast the garlic, serrano peppers, onion, and tomatoes on the hot griddle, turning frequently, until lightly blackened, but not burned, about 5 minutes for the garlic, 10 minutes for the peppers and onions, and 15 minutes for the tomatoes. Set the vegetables aside to cool.
Blend the garlic, peppers, onion, tomatoes, and salt in a blender or food processor until smooth. Store covered in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

Description: 
This is a traditional Mexican sauce that works great over meats, fish, beans, rice, tacos, and quesadillas. Roasting the ingredients might seem like a bother, but it doesn't take more than 15 minutes and it's worth every single second.
