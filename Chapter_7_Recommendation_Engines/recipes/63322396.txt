Ingredients:
1 lb raw peeled shrimp, thawed
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup quinoa
1 tbsp canola or olive oil
1 bunch green onions, sliced
1 cup fresh corn kernels, or thawed frozen corn
1 cup thawed green peas
1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
1 tsp toasted sesame oil, or more to taste
1 tbsp soy sauce, or more to taste

Directions:
In a medium size pan, bring the chicken broth to a boil.  Add quinoa and cover.  Reduce heat to low, and let simmer just like rice for 18-20 minutes.
While quinoa is cooking, heat a pan to medium heat and add oil.  When the oil is hot, add green onions and cook until fragrant.  Add corn and cook with onions 5 minutes or so on medium-low until the corn is cooked through and lightly toasted.  Once the corn and onions are cooked, add the shrimp to the pan and cook quickly until barely cooked through.  Do not overcook!  Better to slightly undercook at this point than cook through completely.  Add the peas to the pan and remove from the heat until the quinoa is finished cooking.
When the quinoa is done, add it quickly to the pan, and return the heat to medium.  Stir it all together and add the toasted sesame oil and soy sauce, and let it all heat through.  Remove from the heat and add cilantro.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
My husband's two favorite things are shrimp and quinoa.  One night I combined the two into a fantastic 20 minute dish that tastes like a very light but flavorful fried rice.  The recipe will serve 4-6 as a side dish, or makes two big bowls if served as a main.  You can add ginger, extra veggies, chicken, ham...the possibilities are endless!
