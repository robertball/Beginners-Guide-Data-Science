Ingredients:
3 cups broccoli florets
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1  medium onion, finely chopped
Â¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 (9 inch) unbaked deep dish pie crust
4  eggs, beaten
1  egg yolk, beaten
1 pint heavy cream
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup shredded provolone cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place a steamer basket in a medium saucepan filled with about 1 inch of water. Place broccoli in the steamer basket, and bring water to a boil. Cover, and steam 5 minutes, or until broccoli is tender but firm.
Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat, and saute garlic and onion until tender. Mix in the broccoli, and continue cooking 1 to 2 minutes. Season with red pepper flakes. Transfer to the pie crust.
In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, egg yolk, and heavy cream. Pour over the broccoli mixture in the pie crust. Season with salt and pepper. Top with Provolone.
Bake 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
