Ingredients:
1 lb. country style pork ribs (4-5 ribs)
1/2 yellow onion, cut in wedges
1 Tblsp. Oil for browning
seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder
fresh cilantro (optional)
1 cup Mojo or other bottled marinade
1 cup chicken broth
splash of Orange or other citrus juice if desired

Directions:
Heat oil in Pressure cooker pot.  Cook the onion until soft.  Add cilatro if desired. Rinse and season the ribs with salt, pepper, garlic (or you can add some fresh minced garlic to to onions).  Brown the ribs on each side.  Pour in enough marinade to coat ribs; continue to brown a bit longer.  Add chicken broth to cover the ribs (you can also add a splash of orange juice if you like the citrus flavor).  Cover.  Bring  up pressure and then cook for about 20-25 minutes.  Let pressure drop on it's own.  Ribs will be tender and the juices are delicious served on rice.

Description: 
Falling off the bone tender and rich with flavor.  Ribs are browned, then pressure cooked in a   garlic-citrus marinade.  Serve with Rice & Beans. I often vary the flavor by using prepared 30-minute marinades such as Chipolte, Cuban Lime, Honey mustard.
