Ingredients:
2 pounds sirloin steak
2 tbs olive oil
Salt
Pepper
1 14  oz can of sliced mushrooms with liquid
2 14 oz cans of beef broth
2 TBS corn starch
1/2 cup cold water

Directions:
Cut the sirloin into 8 equal size pieces.
Season steak with salt and pepper.
In a 12 inch pan with high sides and a lid , heat  olive over medium heat.
Brown steak on both sides about 5 minutes each.
To the pan add mushrooms with juice, and beef broth.
Cover and reduce heat to low. If your liquid reduces during the simmering process add water to fully cover the meat.
At the 2 1/2 hour mark, shift the lid off the pot to allow steam to escape and allow liquid to reduce a bit.
At the 3 hour mark, remove steak to plate.  Bring sauce  to a boil.  In a small bowl mix cornstarch and water.
To boiling sauce stir in cornstarch mixture and bring back to a boil.
The gravy will have a loose consistency- it’s how we serve it. Add more cornstarch in 1 TBS to 1/4 water. increments until you find your desired consistency.

Description: 
This is  my  comfort food. My favorite dish of all time.   You know the one you’d request for your birthday?  This is home to me. It’s not fancy but it’s so savory and so good.  Almost like a stroganoff without the sour cream. It’s easy but it takes a bit of time. Because the gravy  is reduced, it’s full of flavor. You’ll want to serve this over mashed potatoes or egg noodles.
