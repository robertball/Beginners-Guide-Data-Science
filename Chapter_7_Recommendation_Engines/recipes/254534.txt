Description: 
More method than recipe, I heated up my panini maker one night to make a grilled cheese, only to find out that I'd left the waffle plates inside. Instead of changing out the plates, I used them anyway and I loved the outcome. The sandwich gets super crispy but the cheese is still soft and gooey inside the little squares. It's my 'go to' method for grilled cheese now. Serve with spicy pickled veggies on the side!
