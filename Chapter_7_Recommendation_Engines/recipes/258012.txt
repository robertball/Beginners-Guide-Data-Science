Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (8 ounce) package flour tortillas
1/2 cup pizza sauce
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 (8 ounce) package sliced pepperoni

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.
Use a round cookie cutter or small mason jar lid to cut circles from the tortillas that are slightly larger than the bottom of the muffin cups. Place 1 circle in the bottom of each cup.
Spoon some pizza sauce over each tortilla circle; top with some mozzarella cheese and 1 pepperoni slice.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Scoop out of the muffin cups using a spoon.
