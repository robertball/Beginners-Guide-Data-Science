Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) round Brie cheese
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup chopped pecans
1 tablespoon rye whiskey

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut slits about 1/4-inch deep in a crossing pattern across the top and along the sides of the Brie wheel. Place the brie in a baking dish.
Bake the Brie in the preheated oven until softened, about 5 minutes.
While the Brie bakes, stir the brown sugar, pecans, and whiskey in a small bowl; pour onto the top of the Brie and return to the oven another 10 minutes. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This mix of baked brie topped with brown sugar, pecans, and rye whiskey is too good for words. You could use any other type of whiskey, such as bourbon. Serve with crackers.
