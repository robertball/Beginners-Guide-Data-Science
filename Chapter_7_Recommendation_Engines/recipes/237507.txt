Ingredients:
1/2 cup reduced-fat sour cream, or more to taste
1/2 cup reduced-fat mayonnaise
1/2 lime, or more to taste, juiced
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon chipotle chile powder
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1 tablespoon fresh cilantro, chopped
1/4 teaspoon minced garlic

Directions:
Whisk sour cream and mayonnaise together in a bowl until smooth; add lime juice and whisk until again smooth and pourable, though still creamy, adding lime juice or sour cream if the mixture needs to be thinner or thicker.
Stir cumin, coriander, dill, oregano, and chipotle chile powder through the sour cream mixture. Fold jalapeno pepper, cilantro, and garlic through the mixture.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the seasonings disseminate throughout the sauce, at least 1 hour.
