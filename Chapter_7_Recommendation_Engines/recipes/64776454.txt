Ingredients:
3/4 cup buckwheat flour
3/4 cup all-purpose gluten free flour
1/2 cup rice flour
1 tsp baking powder
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 stick unsalted butter, softened
3 eggs
2 large, ripe bananas
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
For the Streusel Topping:
1 cup rolled buckwheat flakes
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
4 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Prepare a 12-muffin tin.
Prepare the streusel topping. Mix together the rolled buckwheat flakes, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 4 tbsp butter, and vanilla extract. Set aside.
Mix together the buckwheat flour, all-purpose gluten free flour, rice flour, and baking powder. Set aside. In a stand mixer, cream the butter and 3/4 cup brown sugar. Add the bananas in chunks mixing until just combined, leaving small chunks of banana. Mix in the flour little by little until fully incorporated. Fold in the walnuts.
Pour approximately 1/4 cup batter in each well (about half-way full). Top each with equal amounts of streusel topping.
Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the tops have browned and a toothpick comes out clean. Cool completely before serving.
