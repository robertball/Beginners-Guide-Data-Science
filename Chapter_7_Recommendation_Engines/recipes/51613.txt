1/3 cup prepared peanut- or garlic-flavored stir-fry sauce
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper (optional)
2 tablespoons chopped unsalted cashews or peanuts

Buitoni®
Description: 
This stir-fry is redefined - with pasta instead of rice. It's a great way to get all the vegetables found in Asian stir-fries, but with an Italian accent. Serve with fruit salad and a glass of Perrier® water to complete this meal.
