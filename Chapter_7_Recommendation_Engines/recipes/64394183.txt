Ingredients:
2 lbs lean beef top round
2 cups cream soda (for other interesting flavors try using dark soda, root beer, cherry cola, or vanilla flavored cola)
1 cup bourbon
1/3 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup liquid smoke
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tbsp onion powder
1/2 tsp chili powder

Directions:
Wrap the top round in butcher's paper or plastic film and chill it in the freezer for one to two hours to firm it up before slicing.
Combine all the other ingredients in a mixing bowl.
Remove the top round from the freezer and slice it against the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices. Add the sliced beef to the marinade, mix thoroughly. Place the beef in the fridge and allow to marinate for four to six hours.
Layer tin foil on the bottom of the oven to catch any drippings. Remove the wire racks from the oven and coat with nonstick spray. Pre heat an oven to 175 degrees F.
Remove the beef strips from the marinade and pat slightly dry. Lay the beef strips on the prepared wire racks so they hang without touching each other. Place the wire racks directly in the preheated oven. Cook the beef for four hours.
Prop the oven door open every hour for 15 minutes with the handle of a wooden spoon to allow air flow. To cool the jerky, turn off the oven, open the door and allow the jerky to sit for 30 minutes.
Remove the jerky from the wire racks and store in a tightly sealed container.
*You should have roughly a one week shelf life if placed in an air tight container.
