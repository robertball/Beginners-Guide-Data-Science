Ingredients:
1 egg
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon milk
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated pecorino Romano cheese
1/2 teaspoon adobo seasoning, or to taste
1 teaspoon olive oil
4 (4 ounce) thinly-sliced veal cutlets
1 1/2 cups arugula, divided
4 tablespoons golden raisins, divided
4 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, divided
4 teaspoons olive oil, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk egg, lemon juice, and milk in a small bowl. Place flour in a separate shallow bowl; mix Italian crumbs, pecorino Romano cheese, and adobo seasoning in a third bowl.
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Dredge each veal piece in flour, dip in egg mixture, and press into bread crumb mixture to coat both sides. Pan-fry the breaded veal cutlets in the hot oil until crumbs are lightly browned and coating is set, about 1 minute per side. Transfer veal to a baking dish.
Bake cutlets in the preheated oven until juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer veal onto 4 serving plates and top each cutlet with 1/4 of the arugula; sprinkle raisins over the arugula. Drizzle a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar and 1 teaspoon olive oil over each serving.

This meal is great for a quick dinner after work. Veal comes out of oven moist and delicious! I paired with baked yams and broccoli. All ingredients are commonly found in the house and can be put together last minute.
