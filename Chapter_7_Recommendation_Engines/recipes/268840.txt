Ingredients:
1 cup water
9 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 pinches salt
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 eggs
1 3/4 cups freshly grated Comte cheese, divided
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine 1 cup water, butter, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Cook until butter has melted, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Add 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour all at once and mix vigorously with a wooden spoon until a smooth dough forms. Return saucepan to low heat; briefly cook and stir until dough pulls away from the pan and starts to dry out, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool for 1 minute.
Beat eggs into the dough, 1 at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Add 1 cup grated Comte cheese and season lightly with pepper.
Use 2 teaspoons to place small mounds of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between them.
Stir together egg yolk and 1 tablespoon water in a bowl and brush onto the dough mounds. Sprinkle with the remaining Comte cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed up and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Turn off heat and let gougeres cool in the oven with the door half-open.

Description: 
Gougeres (French cheese puffs) taste best when they are still warm, but they can also be made in advance and frozen. I like to serve them with a glass of wine as an aperitif. You can use Gruyere cheese instead of Comte cheese.
