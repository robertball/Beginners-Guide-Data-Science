Ingredients:
4 small pheasants, cleaned and rinsed
1/2 pound sliced bacon
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 cup sour cream
1 cup water
1 small onion, chopped
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the pheasants into a large slow cooker. Wrap and drape the bacon over the birds, covering the pheasants as much as you can. Whisk the condensed soup, sour cream, water, chopped onion, onion soup mix, and mushrooms together in a mixing bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour over the pheasants.
Cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours, or on High for 5 to 7 hours.

Description: 
This recipe is very simple yet delicious. Pheasant is normally a dry bird but this recipe keeps it wonderfully moist.  It almost falls right off the bone!
