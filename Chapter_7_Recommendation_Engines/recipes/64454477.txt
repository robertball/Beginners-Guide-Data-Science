https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
100g dark chocolate
Half a cup aquafaba
Quarter cup of coconut milk
Quarter cup of sugar
GARNISH (optional)
1 tbsp chocolate shavings
a handful of pomegranate seeds
a handful of chopped pistachios

Directions:
Melt chocolate and coconut milk together in a double broiler or over very low heat
Whisk aquafaba in a stand mixer on high for about 10 minutes or until stiff peaks form
Slowly add in sugar
The melted chocolate should be cool by now but if it's not, I have a plan! Hold your bowl/glass/cup/container in front of a fan while mixing, it should only take 1-2 minutes to cool (but don't let it solidify)
Fold the cooled melted chocolate into the aquafaba
Place in a glass/cup/pretty thing and put in the fridge to chill overnight (4 - 24 hrs).
