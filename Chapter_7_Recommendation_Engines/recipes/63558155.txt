Ingredients:
2 Tbsp sesame oil
1/4 lb thin sliced sirloin
1 medium onion, diced
3 Tsp. Korean chili paste
2 medium zucchini, diced
1 1/2 cups kimchi coarsley chopped
4 cups beef broth
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 16oz. package soft tofu
4 eggs (optional)
1 tbs chili oil
4 green onions, thinly sliced
steamed rice for searving

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan with a tightfitting lid over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion, sliced sirloin, then season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened, about 5 minutes.
Add the chile paste and chili oil then stir to combine, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the zucchini, season with salt, and stir to combine. Add the kimchi and cook, stirring occasionally, until simmering, about 2 minutes. Add the broth and soy sauce and bring to a boil. Taste and season with salt as needed.
Using a large serving spoon, add the tofu by very large spoonfuls, taking care not to break up the tofu into little bits. Gently press down on the tofu with the back of the spoon so that the broth is mostly covering it. Simmer until the tofu is heated through and the flavors have melded, about 3 minutes.
Crack the eggs, if using, into the simmering mixture. Cover and simmer until the whites are set, about 2 minutes. Divide the stew and eggs among 4 bowls, being careful not to break up the tofu or the egg yolks. Garnish with the sliced green onions and serve immediately with rice on the side.
