Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
1 cup butter
2 eggs
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 Tbsp. grated lemon rind
1 tsp. vanilla
3-1/2 cups cake and pastry flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. cream of tartar
extra sugar for rolling

Directions:
Cream sugar and butter in large bowl.  Add eggs, lemon juice and rind, and vanilla.  Mix until smooth.  In separate bowl, combine flour, soda, salt and cream of tartar.  Add to butter mixture, mixing until blended.  Chill dough for 1 hour.  Shape dough into 1-inch balls, roll in additional sugar.  Place 2 inches apart on greased cookie sheets.  Bake at 325 for 15 to 20 minutes until light brown on bottom.  Cookies will be soft in center.  Cool 2 minutes, then remove to wire racks to cool completely before storing.  These freeze beautifully.
