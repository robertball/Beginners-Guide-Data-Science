Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
3 tomatoes
9 medium slices onion
6 slices processed American cheese
18 slices sourdough bread

Directions:
Preheat the broiler.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown but still soft. Drain, slice into thirds and set aside.
Slice each tomato into 6 slices, then halve the slices. Halve the onion slices. Cut the cheese slices into thirds.
On a large baking sheet, arrange the bread slices in a single layer. Top with cheese, tomato, onion and bacon.
Broil 5 minutes, or until the bacon is golden brown.

Description: 
Hot and tasty bacon, tomato and cheese open-faced sandwiches. A family favorite.  Use a long, thin loaf of sourdough and any cheese you have on hand. The only trick is cutting the ingredients to size for the bread.
