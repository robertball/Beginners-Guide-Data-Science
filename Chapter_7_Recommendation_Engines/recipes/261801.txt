Ingredients:
1 cup raw flax seeds
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 cup cold water

Directions:
Place flax seeds in mixing bowl. Add salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne. Pour in water. Stir. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheeting with a silicone mat or parchment.
Transfer soaked flax seeds to prepared baking sheet. Spread out into a thin, flat rectangle, about 1/8 inch thick, using a spatula. Score the rectangle into about 32 small, rectangles.
Bake in preheated oven until flax seeds have darkened and contracted slightly, about 3 hours. Cool in oven with door ajar. Break into individual crackers.

Description: 
I heard that if you mix flax seeds with an equal amount of water, soak them, and spread them thin, you'll get a tasty cracker. I heard right! These have a nutty, earthy flavor. They're light, but still sturdy enough for dips and spreads. Experiment with other seasonings if you like.
