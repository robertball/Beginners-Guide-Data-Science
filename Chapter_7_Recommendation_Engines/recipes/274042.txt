Ingredients:
1 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons powdered zero-calorie sweetener (such as SwerveÂ®)
1 tablespoon vodka
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Combine cream, sweetener, vodka, vanilla extract, xanthan gum, and salt in a wide-mouth pint-sized jar. Blend cream mixture with an immersion blender in an up-and-down motion until cream has thickened and soft peaks have formed, 60 to 75 seconds. Cover jar and place in the freezer for 3 to 4 hours, stirring every 30 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
Quick to make and no ice cream machine needed! After trying different variations of ingredients, I finally figured out a combination that produced a smooth and creamy texture, yet didn't freeze rock-hard like most no-churn ice cream can. The vodka is optional, however it really helps keep the ice cream scoopable and you don't taste it!
