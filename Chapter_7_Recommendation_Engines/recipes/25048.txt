Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons margarine
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt margarine. Stir in cocoa, remove from heat and set aside to cool. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, 1 cup white sugar and brown sugar until fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the cocoa mixture and the vanilla. Blend in the sifted ingredients to form a soft dough. Cover dough and refrigerate for at least an hour or two.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll chilled dough into 1 inch balls, roll them in the remaining sugar and place them 2 to 3 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
