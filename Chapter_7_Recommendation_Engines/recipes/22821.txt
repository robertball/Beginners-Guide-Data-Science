Ingredients:
¾ cup white wine
¾ cup tomato and clam juice cocktail
3 cloves garlic - peeled and sliced
½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 pound mussels, cleaned and debearded
3 tablespoons butter

Directions:
In a stock pot, combine the wine, juice cocktail, garlic and pepper flakes. Bring to a boil and add mussels.
Cover and continue to boil for about 4 to 6 minutes or until all the mussels have opened. Discard any mussels that haven't opened.
Remove mussels from liquid and keep warm. Pour off liquid to leave about 1 cup. Try not to discard the garlic. Boil the 1 cup of liquid until it's reduced to about 3/4 of a cup.
Add butter and stir until butter has melted and sauce has thickened slightly. Serve mussels with sauce.

Description: 
What timing!  Although I have eaten mussels many times, October 17 was the very first time I cooked them, and (if I do say so myself!) they were great.  A friend and I ate every last one, and he raved about the flavor the whole time.  This is my own recipe.
