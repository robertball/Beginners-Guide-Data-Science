Ingredients:
1 pomelo
1 mango
2 oranges
2 cups club soda

Directions:
Peel pomelo and separate the fruit from the pith. Place fruit segments into a high performance blender (such as a Vitamix(R)). Blend on variable 1, quickly switching to variable 10. Blend for 1 minute.
Peel mango, remove pit, and cut into slices. Add to the blender and blend for another minute.
Cut oranges in half and squeeze juice into a small container. Strain to remove pulp, if desired, and pour juice into the blender. Add club soda and blend on high speed for 1 minute. Serve chilled.
