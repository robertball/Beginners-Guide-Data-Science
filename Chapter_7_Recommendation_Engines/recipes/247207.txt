Ingredients:
10 small red potatoes, scrubbed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup dry white wine
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/2 cup mayonnaise
6 tablespoons pesto, or more to taste
1 small red onion, finely sliced, or to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with lightly salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool until easily handled, 5 to 10 minutes.
Peel potatoes and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices. Place in a large bowl. Sprinkle with salt. Add white wine, olive oil, and lemon juice; toss lightly to combine.
Mix mayonnaise and pesto together in a small bowl. Pour over potato salad and toss gently. Garnish with red onion. Chill until serving.
