Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
1 teaspoon chopped fresh Italian oregano leaves
1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil leaves
1 teaspoon ground garlic powder
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 boneless chicken cutlets
1-1/2 cups purchased marinara sauce or your homemade version
1 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella
4 tablespoons grated Parmesan
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Stir the oil and herbs in a small bowl to blend. Season with salt and pepper. Brush both sides of the cutlets with the herb oil. Heat a heavy large oven-proof skillet over high heat. Add the cutlets and cook just until brown, about 4 minutes per side. Remove the skillet from the heat. Sprinkle the butter pieces atop the cutlets.
Sprinkle half mozzarella over each cutlet. Spoon the marinara sauce over and around the cutlets.  Then sprinkle remaining mozzarella & Parmesan over each.  Cover with foil and bake until the cheese melts and the chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes.  Remove foil and turn oven to broil.  Broil cheese on top to golden brown 4-5 minutes.  Remove cool and serve with pasta and garlic bread.

This is a recipe that is much healthier than the fried and battered version.  Also it tastes great!  Serve over spaghetti noodles with some garlic bread.
