Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons black onyx cocoa powder (from Savory Spice Shop®)
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons miniature semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup cherry pie filling

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine 1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons flour, cocoa powder, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Fold in chocolate chips.
Whisk together 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream, almond extract, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Stir cream mixture into flour mixture with a spatula until there are large clumps. Mix in cherry pie filling. Press the dough gently and lightly into a ball, being careful not to overmix.
Place dough onto a large cutting board and press into a disc that is approximately 1-inch thick and 10 inches in diameter. Cut into 8 wedges and transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Rotate the baking sheet and bake until the scones have a crispy crust with a light, moist interior and the edges look dry, about 10 more minutes. Remove from the oven, transfer to a cooling rack, and cool for 15 minutes.

Description: 
These are so decadent tasting, but surprisingly have very little chocolate! The bonus they cook rather quick! I use black onyx cocoa powder from the Savory Spice Shop®- it allows for a much deeper, darker, and richer chocolate taste that regular Dutch processed cocoa powder just doesn't have.
