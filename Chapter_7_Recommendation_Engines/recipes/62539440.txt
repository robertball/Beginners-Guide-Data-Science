In a large microwavable bowl, microwave chocolate chips, peanut butter and butter uncovered on High 1 minute; stir.
Microwave 1 minute longer or until mixture can be stirred smooth.
Drop and stir in vanilla. Pour mixture over cereal, stirring until evenly coated.
Divide the mixture among 2 gallon sized resealable food-storage plastic bags.
Divide the powdered sugar among the two bags. Seal and shake until well coated.
