2 cucumbers, peeled and sliced
1 medium tomato, coursely chopped
1/2 red onion, sliced
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
3 tbsp garlic salt
1 tsp pepper
1 1/2 tsp italian seasoning

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a somewhat flat container (helps to marinate).
Toss to coat evenly, until oil and vinegar are well mixed. Add more garlic salt to taste.
Serve immediately if desired, but better if marinated for about an hour.
After eaten, the marinade may be reused for another batch of salad.
