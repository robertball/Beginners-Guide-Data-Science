Ingredients:
4 russet potatoes, sliced into 1/4 inch slices
1 onion, half diced and half sliced
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground mustard
1/2 teaspoons salt
2 cups milk
1 bay leaf
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 2 quart covered casserole dish.
In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Mix in the flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and mustard and stir constantly with a whisk for one minute. Add diced onion and cook, stirring constantly, another minute. Stir in about half a cup of the milk and whisk to smooth out lumps, then stir in the rest of the milk and add the bay leaf. Cook until mixture has thickened slightly. Remove from heat, remove the bay leaf and add cheese, stirring until melted.
Layer 1/2 of the potatoes into bottom of the greased dish and season to taste. Layer the sliced onion and add about 1/3 of the cheese sauce. Add remaining potatoes, season with to taste, and cover with remaining sauce.
Bake, covered, 1 hour and 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Uncover and bake an additional 20 minutes.
