Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds beef short ribs, cut flanken-style
1/2 large Asian pear, cored and cubed
1 white onion
1 kiwi, peeled and diced
5 cloves garlic
1 cup soy sauce
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Place ribs in a large bowl of water; soak for 1 hour. Drain ribs and return to the bowl.
Combine Asian pear, onion, kiwi, and garlic in a food processor and puree. Transfer to a bowl and stir in soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, sesame, oil, and black pepper. Pour marinade over ribs in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, turning once, at least 8 hours or overnight.
Strain marinade and discard.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill ribs until crispy outside and meat is no longer pink, about 8 minutes per side.

Description: 
So this Korean ribs recipe is basically LA galbi with my own personal touches. It has received praise from many Koreans; however, I'm not sure if they were just being nice or not. You don't need a portable/tabletop stove for this (you can use a stovetop instead), but it's more fun this way. Serve with rice, kimchi, garlic, etc. Garnish with sesame seeds.
