Ingredients:
3 tbsp apricot preserves
2 tbsp red wine vinegar
2 tbsp olive oil (divided)
1 clove of garlic, minced
3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed of fat
Sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste

Directions:
Combine the apricot preserves, red wine vinegar, 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil, and the minced garlic. Mix with a whisk until well combined, set aside.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Season both sides of the chicken thighs with sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste. Heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil in an OVEN PROOF skillet over medium high heat. Add the seasoned chicken breasts when the pan is hot and cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Turn the chicken over and pour the apricot sauce evenly over the top of the chicken. Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Serve the chicken with the sauce drizzled over the top. Enjoy.
