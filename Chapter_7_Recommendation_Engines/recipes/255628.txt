Ingredients:
10 small potatoes
4 tomatoes, diced, divided
1 onion, diced, divided
1 green chile pepper, diced, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup olive oil, divided
10 corn tortillas
5 ounces truffle-infused cow's milk cheese, grated

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.
Place 1/2 of the tomatoes, 1/2 of the onion, and 1/2 of the green chile pepper in a food processor or blender; season with salt and pepper. Blend until smooth.
Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add potatoes and mash with the back of a wooden spoon or fork. Season potatoes with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir 1/2 cup blended tomato mixture into potatoes.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook 1 tortilla until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Spoon 1 tablespoon potato mixture onto 1 side of the tortilla, cover with truffle-infused cheese, and fold taco in half. Fry in the oil until brown and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining oil, tortillas, potato mixture, and cheese.
Mix the remaining tomatoes, onion, and green chile pepper together in a bowl; add the remaining blended tomato mixture until salsa is well mixed. Serve salsa alongside tacos.

Description: 
This is an awesome and hearty vegetarian taco. Any cheese can be used but the potatoes really accent the truffles and bring out the flavor. Serve with tortilla chips and salsa.
