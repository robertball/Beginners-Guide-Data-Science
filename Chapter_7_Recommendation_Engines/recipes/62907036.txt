Ingredients:
2 TBSP unsalted butter
8 oz of chicken breast(s)
1 (1 ounce) packet Hidden Valley® Original Ranch® Salad Dressing & Seasoning Mix
1 large egg
1 TBSP milk
3/4 Cup plain breadcrumbs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350.  Melt the butter in a 9x13 bake dish.
Slice the chicken breast(s) against the grain to create thin chicken strips/nuggets.
Set up three stations: a plate or bowl with the Seasoning Mix, a second station with the egg and milk, whisked together, and a third with the breadcrumbs.
Roll the chicken pieces in the Seasoning Mix, then coat in the egg mix, and cover with crumbs.  Arrange in the baking dish and bake for 15 minutes.  Gently turn the chicken pieces over and bake another 15 minutes.
For a more intense ranch flavor, serve with additional ranch dressing for dipping.
