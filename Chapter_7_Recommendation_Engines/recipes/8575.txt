Ingredients:
6  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 cups cooked wild rice
½ cup roasted green chili, chopped
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
¼ cup chopped green onions
1 teaspoon ground cumin
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 cup crushed corn flakes cereal
1  egg, beaten

Directions:
Mix together rice, chili, cheese, onion, and cumin.
Rinse chicken thoroughly, and pat dry.  Cut a slit in each breast to create a pouch that is open on one side only.  Stuff each chicken breast with rice filling.
Coat each stuffed breast with beaten egg, then coat in potato flakes and place in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 40 minutes, or until juices run clear. If the breasts dry out too quickly, cover loosely with a piece of foil.
