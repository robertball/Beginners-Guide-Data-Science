Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all purpose flour
2 tsp. yeast
1 tsp. salt
2 Tsp. sugar
3 Tsp. butter at room temperature
1 egg
7 oz. Mozzarella cheese, shredded
6 oz. Mozzarella cheese, cubed
1/2 cup warm water
3 Tsp. of milk for brushing

Directions:
Mix the flour, sugar, and salt in a big mixing bowl.
Make a hollow in the center.
Add yeast, 6 oz. of the shredded cheese, and egg into the center.
Mix together, add water as needed.
Form into a dough.
Add butter, and knead for 6 minutes on a flat surface.
Put dough into a well oiled bowl.
Cover loosely with a wet towel.
Let the dough rise till it doubles in size, approximately 30 minutes.
Separate the dough into 8 equal portions.
Flatten each one into a round shape about the size of your palm.
Add the cubed cheese into the center.
Wrap up the dough like a ball, so the cheese is in the middle.
Place on prepared tray, and let the rolls rise for another 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Brush with milk and sprinkle with the remaining 1 oz. shredded cheese.
Bake for 20-25 minutes till cheese is golden brown.

My kids can feast on Mozzarella cheese anytime of the day, so I came up with this recipe for them. If you cannot eat them right away, put them in the microwave for a quick warm up. Your taste buds will thank you for the melted cheese!
