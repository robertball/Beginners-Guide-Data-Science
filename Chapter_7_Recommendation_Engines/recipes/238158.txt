Ingredients:
cooking spray
6 cups frozen blueberries
1/4 cup cornstarch, or as needed
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
1 orange, zested
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pastry for a double-crust 9-inch pie, at room temperature
1 egg white, lightly beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9-inch pie dish with cooking spray.
Mix blueberries and cornstarch together in a bowl until all the blueberries are coated. Add sugar, orange juice, orange zest, vanilla extract, and cinnamon to blueberries; stir until well mixed.
Press 1 pie crust into the prepared pie dish. Brush the bottom crust with Â½ of the beaten egg white. Pour blueberry mixture into the pie crust.
Lay the second crust over the blueberry filling, crimping the 2 crusts together to seal. Cut 4 1/2-inch slits into the top crust. Brush the top crust with the remaining egg wash. Cover crust edges with strips of aluminum foil to prevent burning.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, 50 to 60 minutes.
