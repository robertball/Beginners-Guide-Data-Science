Ingredients:
1 fresh lemongrass stalk, outer leaves removed
2 quarts chicken stock
1/2 cup minced fresh ginger, divided
4 fresh kaffir lime leaves
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon Sriracha chile sauce
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1-inch strips
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, bundled
2 (14 ounce) cans coconut milk
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoon fish sauce
6 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles (exclude seasoning packets)
2 large carrots, shredded
1 cup chopped tomatoes
3 green onions, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Mince the lower 2/3 of lemongrass stalk. Bruise the remaining upper portion of lemongrass stalk by hitting it with the back of a knife.
Pour chicken stock into a large pot; add minced lemongrass, bruised lemongrass stalk, 1/2 the ginger, lime leaves, garlic, and Sriracha sauce. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer. Add chicken to simmering broth; cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Remove lemongrass stalk and lime leaves using a slotted spoon; discard.
Place cilantro bundle in the broth and simmer for 2 minutes. Add coconut milk, remaining ginger, brown sugar, lime juice, and fish sauce. Remove cilantro bundle using a slotted spoon; discard. Simmer broth, 5 to 10 minutes.
Fill a large pot with water and bring to a rolling boil. Add ramen and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Drain and portion noodles into serving bowls.
Mix carrots, tomatoes, and green onions into broth. Ladle broth over noodles; garnish with cilantro.

Description: 
I made this soup after trying it at a Thai noodle house in my area. I just kept playing around with ingredients until I got something similar. I have the seasonings adjusted to my liking, however there is an adjustment guide in the footnotes if you would like a slightly different flavor. This soup is also good with rice or pasta, but ramen seems to be the favorite. You can use any flavor of ramen noodles.
