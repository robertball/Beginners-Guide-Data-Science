Ingredients:
16 ounces Macaroni Pasta
1 pound ground beef (85/15)
1 pound mild Italian sausage
1 large chopped onion
3 chopped fine celery stalks
2 garlic cloves or 2 tbsp fresh garlic
1 minced green pepper
16 ounces diced mushrooms
2 tablespoon onion powder
4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons Soy Sauce
salt and pepper to taste
1 14.4 ounce can diced tomatoes
2 15.5 ounce cans of tomato sauce
16 ounces shredded Italian cheese blend
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
16 ounces shredded Sharp cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until just al dente, 6 to 7 minutes; drain.
Run cold water over the pasta to stop pasta from cooking further. Set aside.
Season the meat with salt, pepper and onion powder.
Add in sugar, worcestershire and soy sauce to the meat mixture.
Cook the ground beef, sausage, garlic, diced veggies (onion, celery, mushrooms and peppers) until completely browned and crumbled.
At the end of the cycle when beef and sausage are fully browned continue to cook on the highest heat to sear the meat and veggies.  Stir continuously while on high heat. This takes about 5 minutes. Be sure to stir rapidly or the mixture will burn.
Remove from heat and drain meat mixture.
Stir in diced tomatoes and tomato sauce. Allow to simmer covered on stove on low-med for 10 to 20 minutes.
Allow to cool 10 minutes.
In a large casserole dish, layer half of the macaroni, then half of the meat & sayce mixture, followed by half of the shredded Italian cheese. Repeat.
Cover dish with heavy aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes.
Remove foil and sprinkle Cheddar cheese evenly over the top of the casserole.
Put back into oven (without foil) and continue baking for approximately 3 to 5 minutes until Cheddar cheese has melted.
Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
