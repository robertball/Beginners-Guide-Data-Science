Ingredients:
1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup pine nuts
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
1/3 cup honey
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place Brussels sprouts facing up on a jellyroll pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
Roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add pine nuts and season with salt. Cook and stir until toasted, about 3 minutes. Set aside. Combine vinegar, honey, and rosemary in a large bowl.
Remove Brussels sprouts from the oven and transfer to the bowl with the vinegar glaze. Sprinkle toasted pine nuts and cranberries on top and toss to coat. Serve warm.
