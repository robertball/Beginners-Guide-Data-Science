Ingredients:
2 potatoes, thinly sliced
olive oil
1 pinch sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 mango - peeled, seeded, and diced
1 Spanish onion, minced
2 fresh chives, minced
1 tomato, chopped
1 small fresh red chile pepper, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
3 limes, juiced
1 tablespoon olive oil
12 scallops

Directions:
Arrange the potato slices on a large plate. Cook in microwave on High until tender about 3 minutes.
Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the potatoes to the skillet, season with the salt and pepper, and cook in the hot oil until golden on both sides, about 5 minutes. Set aside on a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
Stir the mango, onion, chives, tomato, red chile pepper, garlic, and lime juice together in a bowl.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the scallops in the hot oil until browned on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook for 1 minute longer.
Remove scallops and place each individual scallop on top of a potato chip as a base, then smother liberally with the salsa. They should be big enough to cut up with a knife or put into the mouth whole.

Description: 
A hint of Maya and a hint of the south Pacific combine to create a wonderful summer starter! You want lots of lime juice in there! It matches so well with chile pepper and mango. If you can't find mangoes, guava fruit also works well!
