Ingredients:
8	scallions, chopped
4	large garlic cloves, chopped
3	Scotch bonnet chiles, chopped
1	small onion, chopped
1/4	cup dark brown sugar
2	tablespoons chopped thyme
2	tablespoons ground allspice
Salt
1 1/4	teaspoons freshly grated nutmeg
1	teaspoon cinnamon
1/2	cup white vinegar
1/4	cup soy sauce
1/4	cup fresh lime juice
1/4	cup fresh orange juice
1/4	cup vegetable oil
Three 4-pound chickens, each cut into 8 pieces
Freshly ground pepper

Directions:
In a food processor, combine all of the ingredients except the chicken and process to a paste. Put the chicken pieces in a very large bowl and pour the marinade on top. Toss to coat the chicken thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Light a grill. Remove the chicken pieces from the marinade, leaving on a coating of spice paste. Grill the chicken over moderately high heat, turning often, until the skin is nicely charred and the chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a platter and serve.
MAKE AHEAD The jerk marinade can be refrigerated overnight.
