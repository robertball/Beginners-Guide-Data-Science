Ingredients:
Poppy Seed Dressing:
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup cider vinegar
2 tablespoons honey
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons poppy seeds
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground dry mustard
1/2 teaspoon grated onion
Marinade:
1/4 cup Italian-style salad dressing
3 tablespoons teriyaki sauce
2 medium boneless chicken breasts
Salad Ingredients:
2 cups baby spinach, torn into bite-sized pieces
2 cups torn romaine lettuce
2 cups hulled and sliced strawberries
1 ripe but firm avocado, pitted and sliced into bite-sized pieces
1/2 cup toasted pecans

Directions:
Combine olive oil, vinegar, honey, sugar, poppy seeds, salt, mustard, and grated onion in a blender. Transfer dressing to a bowl or jar and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.
Combine Italian dressing and teriyaki sauce in a sealable container and add chicken. Seal and marinate at least 30 minutes to 1 hour before grilling.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove chicken from marinade and grill until juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Remove from heat, let cool about 10 minutes, and cut into bite-sized pieces.
Toss grilled chicken, spinach, and romaine lettuce together in a large serving bowl. Gently stir in strawberries and avocado. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
Top salad with dressing and pecans when serving.
