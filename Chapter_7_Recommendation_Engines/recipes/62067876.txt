Ingredients:
1 - 1 oz. Packet Hidden Valley® Original Ranch Mix
8 oz. - Sour cream
1 – 8oz block cream cheese, softened
12 oz -Cooked salad shrimp, rinsed and drained (I used frozen, thawed shrimp.  You could also substitute canned crab or mock "Krab" for the shrimp)
5 – Green Onions, sliced (reserve 4-5 inches of green tops to dice for garnish)
1 – tsp Minced Garlic
1 – tsp Worcestershire Sauce
1 Cup  - Cocktail Sauce
1/2 tsp Prepared grated horseradish (optional)
2-Cups – Shredded Co-Jack Cheese, for sprinkling
Assorted Crackers (I use “Toasteds” variety pack)

Directions:
1. Using a hand mixer or food processor, combine ranch mix with sour cream, cream cheese, minced garlic and Worcestershire sauce.
2. Fold in green onion and spread on decorative platter, shallow pan or baking dish.
3. If you are using horseradish, combine with cocktail sauce in small bowl.
4. Spread Cocktail sauce evenly on top of cream cheese mixture.
5. Blot shrimp dry with paper towel and scatter on top of cocktail sauce.
6. Sprinkle with cheese and diced green onion tops
7. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 3 hours, until cream cheese sets and flavors meld.
8. Serve with crackers or sliced French bread.
NOTE:  Serves 8 – 10 ppl.  Batch doubles easily.  Just use larger platter or 9 x 13 pan

Description: 
Ranch dressing mix, garlic and green onion really perk up the cream cheese in this layered seafood dip.  I've taken it to many parties and the plate is always licked clean.
