Homemade Hemp Milk Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup hemp hearts or Â½ cup of shelled hemp seeds (also called seeds or shelled hemp nuts)
3 to 4 cups filtered or spring water (3 cups for thicker milk, and up to 4 cups for thinner)
1 Tbsp of coconut oil (optional)
2 Tbsp of raw honey or a few drops of stevia OR 1 tablespoon maple syrup (optional adds a little sweetness to it)
1/2 Tbsp of organic vanilla powder (optional adds a nice flavoring)
A pinch of Himalayan pink salt OR a pinch sea salt (or other unprocessed sea salt)

Directions:
I use a food process or blender to make this milk. I always strain my hemp milk using a fabric strainer bag purchased at my local whole foods store or on Amazon:
Place all ingredients into a high-powered blender and blend for 60 to 90 seconds or until ultra-smooth. Place your strainer bag into a pitcher, and pour your blended contents through the bag, squeezing out the milk, and leaving the pulp behind. I compost the leftover pulp. Store your hemp milk in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. Use it in recipes wherever milk is called for.

Description: 
Making your own hemp milk is easier than buying it! Plus by making your own, you don't get any extra added ingredients, just pure creamy goodness. However, since there are no added flavorings, this milk tastes a lot like hemp seeds (as it should) so the flavor might be a tad stronger if you are accustomed to store-bought hemp milk. Use this milk for baking, in pancakes, as a dairy-free milk base for smoothies, poured over whole grain breakfast porridge, or just for drinking. It stores best in the refrigerator in a sealed glass jar or pitcher for 3 to 4 days.
