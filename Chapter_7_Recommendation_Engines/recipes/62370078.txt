Ingredients:
2 tbs. vegetable oil
5 cloves garlic, 3 cloves thinly sliced crosswise and 2 cloves minced
1 shallot, minced
2 strips (each 1/2 in. by 2 in.) lemon zest
1 to 3 small hot chiles, such as Thai chiles or serrano or jalapeño peppers, stemmed, seeded, and minced (for hotter sauce, leave in seeds)
3/4 cup peanut butter
1 cup unsweetened coconut milk
2 tbs. sugar, or more to taste
2 tbs. soy sauce
1 tsp. fish sauce (optional)
1 tsp. fresh lime juice, or more to taste
1 tbs. finely chopped cilantro
Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground pepper

Directions:
1. Heat oil in wok or saucepan over medium-high heat. Add sliced garlic and cook, stirring, until golden, 2 minutes. Remove garlic with slotted spoon; place on paper towels to drain. Add minced garlic, shallot, lemon zest, and chile(s) to wok and cook over medium-high heat until fragrant and lightly browned, 2 minutes.
2. Stir in peanut butter, coconut milk, sugar, soy sauce, fish sauce, if using, lime juice, and ¾ cup water. Reduce heat and gently simmer sauce until thick but pourable, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in cilantro during last 2 minutes of cooking.
3. Just before serving, stir in fried garlic. If sauce turns thick and pasty, add 1 tbs. or so of water. Add salt and pepper to taste and more sugar and lime juice if needed.
