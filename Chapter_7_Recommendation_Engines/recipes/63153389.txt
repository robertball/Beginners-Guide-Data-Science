Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
1 C diced onion
3 cloves garlic
8 oz diced smoked Ham (about 2 C)
2 red potatoes, diced into bite-sized pieces (2-2 1/2C)
2 cans Great Northern Beans, rinsed and drained
1 1/2 t smoked paprika
1/2 t kosher salt
1/8 tsp black pepper
3 14 oz cans chicken broth (5 1/4 cups)
optional: 1/2-1 tsp liquid smoke

Directions:
Slice bacon into bite-size pieces.  Cook in a large stock pot until crisp.  Remove bacon to drain on paper towels.  Reserve 2-3 tea. bacon drippings in pan and discard the rest (dump it in one of those empty bean cans).   Add diced onion to pan and saute for about 2 minutes.  Add garlic and cook another minute.  Add diced ham, beans, smoked paprika and salt to pan and stir to combine.  Then add the broth and the potatoes.  Bring soup to a boil and then reduce to a simmer.  Simmer for 10-15 minutes or until potatoes are tender.   Remove from heat and  stir in  bacon.   Take  3 cups of the soup and place in the blender (leave the plug in the lid off to let steam escape and cover with a paper towel to avoid splashes while you blend)  Blend until completely smooth.  You could also use an immersion blender in place of a blender if you have one.  Add blended soup back to pot and stir to combine.  Add additional salt (and pepper if desired) to taste. The need for salt really depends on the ham and bacon you use so I kept it low on purpose.   Ladle into bowls and top with extra bacon if desired.  Great with some croutons too!  Makes about 8 cups of soup.
