Ingredients:
1 cup margarine
2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
4 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 pinch salt
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
In a large mixing bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar.  Add eggs and beat until fluffy.
In a separate bowl, mix together the flour,    baking powder, and salt. Dissolve the baking soda in the buttermilk and  add alternately to the margarine mixture with flour mixture.
Roll out dough and sprinkle with nutmeg. Cut with a biscuit cutter.  Dough will be very soft and delicate.
Bake until lightly browned around the edges.  A really soft, chewy  cookie.

Description: 
This recipe is over 75 documented years old as it has been passed down from generation to generation in my Kentucky family...a real reminder of the warm, comforting cookie a loving mother shares with her children on a cold, wintry day.
