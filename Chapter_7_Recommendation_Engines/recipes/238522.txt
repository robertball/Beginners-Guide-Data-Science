Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
4 large carrots, chopped
1 large white onion, finely chopped
2 teaspoons kosher salt
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 (16 ounce) package dry lentils
1 cup crushed tomatoes
2 quarts vegetable broth
1 (10 ounce) package spinach
1 large zucchini, cut into small pieces
1 pinch salt to taste
1 teaspoon olive oil, or to taste

Directions:
Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir carrots, onion, salt, parsley, black pepper, ginger, tarragon, and cumin in the hot oil until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir lentils and tomatoes into the carrot mixture. Pour vegetable broth over the vegetables, stir, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, place a cover on the pot, and simmer until the lentils are tender, 45 to 50 minutes.
Stir spinach and zucchini into the broth mixture; simmer until the zucchini is tender, about 7 minutes more. Remove pot from heat and season soup with salt. Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil over the soup before serving.

Description: 
My family and I have been trying to eat healthy, so I started adding veggies to all my soups. This recipe is easy to make, fun, and delicious. You can modify it in many ways; add your own favorite cooking oil, as well as your own greens. Serve with toasted rosemary bread. Yum!
