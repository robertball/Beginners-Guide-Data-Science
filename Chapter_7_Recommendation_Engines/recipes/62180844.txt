Ingredients:
2-3 large potatoes
1/4 cup grated Parmesean Cheese
1 tbl spoon Garlic Powder
1 tbl spoon chopped Basil
1 tbl spoon Coarse Black Pepper
1 tbl spoon Salt
2 tbl spoon oil

Directions:
Slice potatoes in to semi-thin fries (1/4"), coat with oil in a large bowl.
Add remaining seasonings, mix well, placed on baking sheet sprayed lightly with oil (or foil the sheet for EZ clean up).
If extra Garlic, Parmesean or Pepper kick is desired ( I do all 3!!) sprinkle a little on the fries now.
Bake @ 375 for 30-35 minutes
