Ingredients:
1 (8-ounce) package uncooked medium egg noodles
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 cup frozen petite green peas, thawed
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt and fat; drain and set aside.
While pasta cooks, heat a thick-bottomed skillet on medium heat. Add the sliced butter (sliced so that the butter melts more evenly) whisking frequently. Continue to cook the butter.
Once melted the butter will foam up a bit, then subside. Watch carefully as lightly browned specks begin to form at the bottom of the pan. Smell the butter; it should have a nutty aroma. Remove from heat and place on a cool surface to help stop the butter from cooking further and perhaps burning.
Once butter is off the heat add garlic and allow to sit until pasta is done.
Add cooked pasta, peas, and remaining ingredients; cook 2 to 3 minutes or until thoroughly heated.
Add fresh parsley before serving.
