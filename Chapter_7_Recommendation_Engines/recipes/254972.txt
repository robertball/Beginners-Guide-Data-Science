Description: 
A fantastic end-of-summer dish when you have lots of green garden tomatoes and zucchini. This is a nice side dish or even a tasty entree if you add a few more veggies. This is a very versatile recipe. Feel free to add lots of different veggies from the garden. I enjoy green beans, baby carrots, and/or fresh peas.
