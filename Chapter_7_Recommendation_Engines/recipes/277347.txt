Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 (2.5 pound) flank steak

Directions:
Combine oil, soy sauce, water, brown sugar, ginger, garlic, and pepper in a small bowl. Mix until combined.
Cut shallow slashes in a crosshatch pattern on both sides of the steak, being careful not to cut all the way through.
Place steak in a low, flat dish and pour marinade on top, covering meat completely. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours, or overnight, turning steak over once.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Remove steak from the marinade and place on a baking pan. Reserve marinade.
Broil, brushing occasionally with marinade, until browned and heated through, about 5 minutes per side. Remove steak to a platter and cover loosely with foil. Let rest for at least 5 minutes. Slice into 1- to 2-inch strips across the grain.
