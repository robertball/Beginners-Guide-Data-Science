Ingredients:
6 slices bacon, diced
2 cups fresh corn kernels
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Spread bacon into a large skillet and place over medium-high heat; cook and stir until bacon is crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel.
Stir corn into the bacon grease in the skillet to coat; saute until hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir bacon with the corn; season with salt and pepper

Description: 
A very simple, quick side dish of corn and diced bacon. The salty zing of the bacon with the freshness of the corn is very delicious. This is a favorite of mine to prepare due to the ease of cooking and the low-carb nature of the dish.
