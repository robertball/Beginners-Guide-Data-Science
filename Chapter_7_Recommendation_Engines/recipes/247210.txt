Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup chocolate wafers (such as Oreo®), filling discarded
2 (2.1 ounce) bars chocolate-covered crispy peanut butter candy (such as Butterfinger®)
1/4 cup melted butter, or more to taste
Filling:
11 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/3 cup lemon juice
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup crushed chocolate-covered crispy peanut butter candy (such as Butterfinger®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Combine chocolate wafers and 2 candy bars in a blender; pulse into fine crumbs.
Place about 1 cup of crumbs in an 8-inch pie pan. Pour in melted butter; press down with your fingers or a fork to make the crust.
Bake crust in the preheated oven until fragrant, 7 to 9 minutes. Let cool.
Blend cream cheese in a large bowl until almost smooth. Pour in condensed milk and mix until creamy. Add lemon juice and vanilla extract; mix until filling thickens slightly, 4 to 6 minutes. Fold in 1/2 cup crushed candy bars. Pour over crust and smooth the top.
Refrigerate cheesecake until set, at least 4 hours but preferably overnight.
