Description: 
This is a recipe I got from a friend with a diabetic husband.  Makes an excellent tasting cheesecake that is incredibly easy to prepare. You may use sugar substitute  and sugar-free yogurt if desired. The flavor of yogurt determines the flavor of the cheesecake, so feel free to experiment.
