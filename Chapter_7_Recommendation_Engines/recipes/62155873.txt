Ingredients:
3 egg yolks
2 Tbsp. lemon juice
2 tsp. worcestershire sauce
1/2 tsp. white or black pepper
3/4 cup butter
water as needed

Directions:
Place about 1 inch of water in the bottom of a double boiler and bring to a boil.  Do not place the top pot on, only boil the bottom pot.  If you don't have a double boiler, use any two pots that will fit together, but the top pot must not touch the boiling water in the bottom pot.
In a cold pot, whisk together the egg yolks, lemon juice (1 Tbsp. if you like less of a lemon flavour), worcestershire sauce, and pepper.
Place over the bottom of the double boiler, and add the butter gradually, about 1/4 cup at a time, while whisking constantly.  Sauce will appear dark yellow in colour.
Continue to whisk over boiling water until thickened and sauce has lightened to a nice buttery yellow colour.
If you find the sauce is too thick, thin down with water. Add one tablespoon at a time until it reaches the desired consistency.
Sauce can be kept warm over hot water until ready to be served.  Stir occassionally and thin if necessary.
