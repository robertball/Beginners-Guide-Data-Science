Ingredients:
1 1/2 # top round steak (strips) or beef stew meat
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 onion, chopped
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
8 oz sliced mushrooms
1 tablespoon chives (or green onions)
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 can beef broth
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
8 oz container sour cream
4 oz cream cheese
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Place the beef in the bottom of a slow cooker, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Place onion on top of beef, and then add mushroom soup, mushrooms, and water. Season with chives, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce
In a small bowl, mix together the broth with the flour. Pour over the beef.
Cover, and cook on Low for 6 to 7 hours. Stir in the sour cream, cream cheese and parsley.  If the sauce is not thick, add 2 T corn starch to about 1/2 C sauce (whisk), and stir into the rest of the dish.  Continue cooking for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

Description: 
Long, slow cooking (7 to 8 hours) renders top round steak tender enough to use in place of the cuts that are normally required for Beef Stroganoff.Modified from: Daria's Slow Cooker Beef Stroganoff
