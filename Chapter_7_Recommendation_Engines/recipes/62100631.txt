Ingredients:
1 medium onion, quartered
1 small green pepper, chopped
3 cloves garlic
2 tsp. peanut or olive oil
1 egg
1 tsp. ground cumin
dash cayenne pepper
1 packet taco seasoning
1 tsp. salt
2 tsp. baking powder
1 16oz can pinto beans, drained
hot sauce to taste
1 cup dry bread crumbs, plus more if needed
oil for frying

Directions:
Add first eleven ingredients to a food processor and process until smooth.  Add beans and pulse until broken up and integrated, but not smooth.
If a food processor is not available, add first eleven ingredients to a blender and process until smooth and mash beans in a bowl with a potato masher, then mix together.
Transfer bean mixture to a large bowl and add hot sauce to desired spiciness.  Add just enough bread crumbs to form a dough that holds together without being sticky.
Form dough into quarter-sized balls and deep-fry in oil at 375 degrees until a deep, brown color.
Serve with sour cream, guacamole or salsa.
