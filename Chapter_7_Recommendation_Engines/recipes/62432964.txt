Ingredients:
2 1/2 pound boneless ham
Whole cloves
1 1/2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
1 can of pineapple rings in pineapple juice
1/2 (6 fluid ounce) can or bottle of diet lemon-lime
flavored carbonated beverage
Maraschino cherries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C).
Place ham in a roasting pan. Score the rind of the ham with a diamond pattern. Press a clove into the center of each diamond. Drain half the juice from the pineapple rings into a medium bowl, and stir in the brown sugar and lemon-lime soda. Coat the ham with this mixture. Arrange the pineapple rings over the outside of the ham. Place a maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple ring, and secure with a toothpick.
Place in a brown-in bag and bake for the recommended time or until the internal temperature of the ham is 160 degrees F (72 degrees C). Remove toothpicks before serving.
