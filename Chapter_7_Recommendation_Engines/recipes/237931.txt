Description: 
VOSKOS® Nonfat Honey Greek Yogurt adds a hint of sweet to these lean meatballs dressed up with marmalade barbecue sauce. For easy shaping, use a small scoop to form the meatballs, then bake them off in the oven. To party with ease, transfer meatballs and sauce to a slow cooker set on warm or low heat setting to serve. Serve with crunchy pretzel sticks as a fun substitute for wooden picks.
