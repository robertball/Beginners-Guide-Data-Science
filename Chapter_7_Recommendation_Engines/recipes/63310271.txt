1 0.25 ounce package dry yeast
2 cups warm water (115 degrees)
1/2 cup melted butter

Combine the yeast and the warm water in a large bowl and let stand for 5 minutes.  Add beaten egg and sugar and mix well.  Add flour and mix well again.  Place covered in the refrigerater overnight.  If you have a time crunch it may be chilled for a little as 4 hours and will still turn out well.  Put in greased muffin cups and bake at 375 degrees for 25 minutes until golden.
