Description: 
Tender pork stewed all day in a crockpot with rosemary, mushrooms, onions, sherry, and potatoes. Simple and delicious, it's easy to make and easy to customize. If you're in a hurry and don't want to chop potatoes, or if it all doesn't fit in the crockpot, you could serve the dish with mashed or boiled potatoes later instead.
