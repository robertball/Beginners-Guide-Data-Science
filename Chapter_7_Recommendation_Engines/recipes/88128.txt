Description: 
Shrimp, red beans (or kidney), tomatoes with chiles, and cream of mushroom soup make this soup an easy-to-make crowd pleaser that looks and tastes like soup from a fine restaurant. Serve with Garlic Toast to make it a complete meal. I created this completely by accident and it turned out great!
