Ingredients:
4 ears fresh corn, shucked
1 Hatch chile pepper
1/3 cup crumbled goat cheese
1 tablespoon lime juice

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Cook corn and chile pepper on the preheated grill until corn is slightly charred and chile pepper is blistered, about 20 minutes.
Place chile pepper in a resealable plastic bag. Let steam until softened, about 5 minutes. Peel skin off chile pepper and chop.
Cut corn kernels off the cob into a large bowl. Stir in chopped chile pepper, goat cheese, lime juice, salt, and black pepper.
