Ingredients:
1 (12 pound) whole turkey
6 tablespoons butter, divided
4 cups warm water
3 tablespoons chicken bouillon
2 cups white wine
3 tablespoons dried parsley
3 tablespoons dried minced onion
1 tablespoon granulated garlic powder
2 tablespoons lemon pepper seasoning salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rinse and wash turkey. .
Place turkey in a Dutch oven or roasting pan. Separate the skin over the breast to make little pockets. Put 3 tablespoons of the butter on both sides between the skin and breast meat. Put 1 tablespoon under skin of each leg.
In a medium bowl, combine the water with the bouillon. Sprinkle in the parsley, garlic and minced onion. Pour over the top of the turkey. Sprinkle seasoning salt over the turkey.
Cover with foil, and bake in the preheated oven 3 1/2 to 4 hours, until the internal temperature of the turkey reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). For the last 45 minutes or so, remove the foil so the turkey will brown nicely.
