https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 large cans chunk white albacore tuna
1 cup (about 5) egg whites - decrease egg whites if too runny
1/3 cup old fashioned oats or bread crumbs
1/2 cup celery, chopped
1/2 cup fresh cilantro OR parsley, snipped
1 cup onion, chopped
1 tbsp. flax seed, ground
2 tsp. Grey Poupon mustard
1 cup spinach, snipped
1 clove garlic, diced
3 tbsp. olive oil

Directions:
1. Drain ALL liquid from the canned albacore tuna. In a large mixing bowl, mash the tuna chunks into small flaky pieces.
2. In a separate bowl, whip egg whites and then all other ingredients except olive oil. Add this mixture and any seasonings or spices to the tuna.
3. Divide the mixture into 6-8 patties and fry in a pan with olive oil. (To save calories, you can use cooking spray.) Flip when lightly brown, and cook the opposite side.
Tips and Success Notes:
I own the Pampered Chef version of the "Slap Chop" and use it to chop up my tuna as well as the onion. It works like a dream!
