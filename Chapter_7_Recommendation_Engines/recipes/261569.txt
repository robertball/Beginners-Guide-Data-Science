1  cucumber, chopped

Description: 
I took the base of Martha Stewart's cucumber radish slaw and changed it up. This is great on top of tacos or with pork. You can use it like any other coleslaw. It's super tangy if you like a vinegar in-your-face tangy-type taste. I wanted to make a slaw without mayo to make a lower-fat version.
