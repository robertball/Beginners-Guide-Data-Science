Description: 
This is a very nice, light, and healthy!! salad, that is great on a hot summer's day.  I encountered it while traveling in Kazakhstan for business.  I was searching for something that wasn't heavy.  The cabbage, beets and carrots are all shredded and finished with a light vinaigrette which sort of pickles them. It’s a salty/sour combo you don’t want to miss!
