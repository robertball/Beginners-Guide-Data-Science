Ingredients:
12 unfrosted cupcakes, cooled
1 (16 ounce) package vanilla frosting
1 (10 ounce) package candy-coated milk chocolate pieces (such as M&M'sÂ®)

Directions:
Frost each cupcake with a thin layer of frosting and refrigerate for 30 minutes to make decorating easier.
Remove cupcakes from refrigerator and apply a second layer of white frosting. Separate candy-coated milk chocolate pieces by color.
Place 1 brown or black candy-coated milk chocolate piece in the middle of one half of the cupcake for the eye. Add 2 red candy-coated milk chocolate pieces for the mouth on one side of the cupcake. Place candy-coated milk chocolate pieces in vertical rows by color on the other half of the cupcakes to resemble fish scales. Place 3 candy-coated milk chocolate pieces opposite the mouth as the tail.
