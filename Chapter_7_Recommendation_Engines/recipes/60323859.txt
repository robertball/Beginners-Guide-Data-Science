Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, room temperature
3 cups white sugar
6 eggs
1 large lemon, juiced and zested
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1.5 t ground cardamom
1 cup buttermilk
Glaze:
1 c powdered confectioner's sugar
Fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease one 9 or 10 inch tube pan.  Mix together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, use a wooden spoon to beat butter with sugar. Mix in the eggs, one at time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the lemon, cardamom and the vanilla extract.  Gently mix in flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 90 minutes. Do not open oven door until after one hour. When cake begins to pull away from the side of the pan it is done. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
For glaze:
Add lemon juice into sugar until mix has the texture of Elmer's glue.  Gently pour over the cake.
