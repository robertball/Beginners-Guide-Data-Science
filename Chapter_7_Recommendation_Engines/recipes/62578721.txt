Ingredients:
2 TBSP butter
1/2 cup chopped mushrooms
1 TBSP minced garlic
1/3 cup all purpose flour
1/2 TSP dried sage
1/4 TSP dried thyme
1 1/2 cups prepared turkey gravy
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup fat free milk
1 (14 ounce) package frozen peas and carrots, thawed and drained
3 cups cooked turkey, cubed
3 cups cooked semi-cooked potatoes, cubed
salt to taste (optional)
1 pastry for a 10-inch pie crust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the mushrooms, and garlic; cook until tender, but not browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the flour, sage, and thyme until blended. Pour in the gravy, water, potatoes and milk, stirring to blend. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; cook 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the turkey and vegetables, and cook until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.
Pour in the turkey mixture into a round or 9 x 13 pan. Cover with the top crust. Seal and crimp the edges. Pierce top crust in a few places with a fork. Cover the edges of the pie with strips of aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. Remove foil strips, and bake until crust is golden, about 20 minutes more. Remove from oven, and rest 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
My grandmother makes this every year after Thanksgiving. I've modified slightly from her recipe as I've added mushrooms, garlic, and herbs. This savory main dish is a great way to prepare a meal if you have a lot of turkey leftovers.Modified from: Left-Over Turkey Pot Pie
