Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs lean ground beef
1 cup dry green lentils
1 whole carrot
1 stalk celery
1 small yellow onion
1 small red bell pepper
1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs
1 egg
2 1/2 cups water
1 tsp each salt and pepper
8 oz can of tomato sauce OR 1 cup of ketchup
Parsley for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F.
In a heavy pot, combine the water and lentils, cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Remove lid, but do not drain. Set aside.
Add the carrot, celery, onion, and bell pepper to a food processor and pulse until veggies are in very small pieces. Remove and set aside.
Add lentils into food processor and puree.
In a large mixing bowl add ground beef, veggie mixture, lentils, egg, bread crumbs, and salt & pepper. Mix with your hands to incorporate very well.
Shape meat & veggie mixture into a loaf form and place in the middle of a 13x9 dish.
Cover with aluminum foil and bake for one hour. Remove foil and bake an additional 5 minutes to brown the top.
Top with sauce or ketchup and bake 5 minutes more. Garnish with parsley if desired.
