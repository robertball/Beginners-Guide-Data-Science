Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups water
1 cup farro
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine water, farro, and salt in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure naturally according to manufacturer's instructions for 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure through the vent. Unlock and remove the lid. Drain any excess liquid that was not absorbed.

Description: 
Farro is probably my favorite grain. I love it in salads, pilafs, and soups! I find the Instant Pot® gets it to the perfect texture and I don't have to worry about overcooking it on the stove.
