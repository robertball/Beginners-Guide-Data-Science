Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons fennel seed
1 1/2 pounds carrots, peeled and diced
1 pear - peeled, cored, and diced
1 sweet potato, peeled and cubed
1 small russet potato, peeled and cubed
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 teaspoon curry powder
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
3 (14 ounce) cans vegetable broth
2 tablespoons uncooked brown rice
1 tablespoon flax seed
3 bay leaves
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Lightly toast the fennel seed in the hot oil until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the carrots, pear, sweet potato, russet potato, mushrooms, curry powder, and turmeric to the fennel seed; cook and stir until everything is evenly coated in oil, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the vegetable broth over the mixture. Stir the rice, flax seed, bay leaves, and parsley into the broth; bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the rice and vegetables are very tender, about 30 minutes.
Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway. Hold the lid of the blender in place with a towel and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the mixture moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot and return to heat.
Stir the lemon juice and white pepper into the mixture; cook until thoroughly reheated, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
The mystery here is all the yummy goodies hidden in the soup. I cook for a lot of picky eaters and they've never been the wiser; they love this soup! I'm sure you can add other things as well; be creative! Use an apple in place of the pear, if you wish.
