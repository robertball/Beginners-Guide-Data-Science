Ingredients:
8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs.
1 each red, yellow, orange, green medium sized bell peppers, cleaned and chopped
1 large white onion, chopped
2 cloves of garlic, diced
1 small box of either cherry or grape tomatoes.
Freshly ground black pepper
salt, to taste.
olive oil as needed.

Directions:
Pound the chicken thighs to flatten and trim any fat.
Add a little olive oil to a oven proof deep pot on medium heat. Add the chicken thighs  a few at a time so as to not over crowd and brown until golden, about 2 minutes on each side.
Take the thighs out and keep warm, in the same pan add more oil if needed and add the bell peppers, onion, garlic, salt and pepper,  saute for 5 minutes, stir so they don't stick. Add the tomatoes, stir and leave for about 3 minutes, they will start to burst.
Add the thighs back in the pot with the sauted veggies and put in a 350 degree oven for 30-40 minutes until the thighs are cooked.
