Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup chopped fresh mushrooms (optional)
1 1/2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
2/3 cup ready-to-serve creamy tomato soup, divided
1/4 cup ketchup, divided
1/4 cup barbeque sauce, divided
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, divided
chili powder to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a bowl, mix the turkey, eggs, mushrooms, bread crumbs, soup mix, 1/3 cup creamy tomato soup, 2 tablespoons ketchup, 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce, and 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce. Mold the mixture into a loaf shape, and place in a baking dish. Sprinkle with chili powder.
In a separate bowl, mix the remaining creamy tomato soup, remaining ketchup, remaining barbeque sauce, and remaining Worcestershire sauce. Set aside.

Description: 
This is an alternative to the regular meatloaf. It's a pretty popular request at home. Ground beef can be substituted; it's just as yummy.
