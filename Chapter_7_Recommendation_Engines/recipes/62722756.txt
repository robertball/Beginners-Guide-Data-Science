2 C flaxseed meal
1 T baking powder
1 t salt
1-2 T Splenda
5 beaten eggs
1/2 C water

Preheat 350 degrees. Prepare pan (10 x 15-in pan w/sides best) w/parchment paper or silicon pad.
Mix dry ingredients well. Add wet to dry and combine well (just add to bowl of dry ingred)
Let batter sit for 2-3 min. to thicken up some (will get too thick and hard to spread if left longer).
Pour batter onto baking sheet. Spread it away from center to even thickness but not to edge.
Bake 20 min, until springs back and golden.
