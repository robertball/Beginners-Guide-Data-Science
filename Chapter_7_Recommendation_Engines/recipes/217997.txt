Ingredients:
4 pounds yellow summer squash, sliced
1 small onion, chopped
1/4 cup butter, cubed
1/4 pound processed cheese food (such as VelveetaÂ®), cubed

Directions:
Place the squash and onion into a pot, and pour in enough water just to cover. Bring to a boil, cover the pot, and simmer the vegetables until tender, about 10 minutes. Do not stir. Drain the squash and onion in a colander set in the sink.
Gently layer the cooked squash and onions, cubes of butter, and cheese food cubes in a slow cooker. Set the cooker on Low, and cook until the squash are very tender and the butter and cheese have formed a creamy sauce, about 1 hour. Do not stir.
