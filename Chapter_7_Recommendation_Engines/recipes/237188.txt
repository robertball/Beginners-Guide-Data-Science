Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped green pepper
1/4 cup chopped celery
1 1/2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef to the skillet and break into smaller bits with a spatula as it cooks; cook until browned on one side, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn beef and add onion, bell pepper, and celery. Put a cover on the skillet and continue to cook until beef is completely browned and crumbly, 2 to 5 minutes more.
Stir vinegar, mustard, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic powder into the beef mixture; season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer mixture, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are completely tender, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This my personal sloppy joe recipe. I have tweaked it to have all my favorite ingredients. Not one of them overpowers the other. I hope you like it, as it makes a great lunch or game-day sandwich for the family. I generally serve it on a better quality hamburger bun with KettleÂ® potato chips.
