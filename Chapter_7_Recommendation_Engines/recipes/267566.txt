Ingredients:
For Crust:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 stick unsalted butter, cut into cubes and chilled
1/4 cup ice water
For Filling:
1/2 cup unsweetened pumpkin puree
1/4 cup Stevia In The Raw® Bakers Bag
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 large egg, beaten
1 tablespoon Sugar In The Raw®

Directions:
Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl. Add butter and work into flour with your fingers until butter is in pea-sized chunks. Stir in about 1/4 cup ice water to form a shaggy ball of dough. If still too dry, add 1 to 2 tablespoons more ice water. Flatten into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate 1 hour.
Whisk pumpkin, stevia, maple syrup, and pumpkin spice together in a small bowl.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Using a 2-1/2 to 3-inch pumpkin cookie cutter, cut out dough. Place half the dough rounds on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Press a lollipop or popsicle stick into the center of each dough round, 1 inch from the edge.
Place a heaping teaspoonful of the pumpkin mixture in the center of each piece of dough. Brush the edges of the dough with egg and place a second piece of dough on top. Use the tines of a fork to seal the edges.
Brush tops of pops with egg and sprinkle with sugar. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool on baking sheet.
