Ingredients:
2 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup unsalted sweet cream butter
2 eggs, room temperature
1 cup heavy cream
2 cups all purpose flour
1 cup Special Dark Hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 tablespoon almond extract
1 cup strong hot coffee

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350.
Whip eggs, sugar, oil and vanilla until fluffy. Add in heavy cream and mix until incorporated.
In separate bowl sift flour, cocoa, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Add slowly to batter and incorporate. Do not over mix or cake will be tough.
Add in coffee last. Batter will be very thin. Pour into prepared pan.
Bake at 350 for 30 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean. Wait 10 minutes before attempting to remove it from the cake pan. Cover while warm to trap the moisture and let cool.
