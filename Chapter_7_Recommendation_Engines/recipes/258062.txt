Ingredients:
5 cups chicken stock
5 cups water
1 cup white rice
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons fish sauce
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
2 (6 ounce) fillets lean white fish, sliced
1/4 cup pickled Chinese vegetables
1/4 cup sliced Chinese roast pork
2 tablespoons chopped scallions
2 tablespoons crushed peanuts
1/2 teaspoon vinegar, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Combine chicken stock, water, rice, 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, fish sauce, ginger, salt, and sesame oil in a large stockpot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until congee has thickened to the consistency of a light porridge, about 3 hours.
Stir fish into congee and simmer until cooked through, about 10 minutes.
Serve congee in bowls topped with pickled vegetables, roast pork, scallions, and peanuts. Drizzle 1/2 teaspoon vinegar and soy sauce over toppings.
