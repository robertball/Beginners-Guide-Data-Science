Ingredients:
2 tablespoons McCormick® Gourmet Collection® Wasabi Powder
2 tablespoons water
3 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon McCormick® Gourmet Collection® Sesame Seed, toasted
2 cups coarsely chopped Chinese (napa) or savoy cabbage
1 cup chopped red radishes
1/2 cup chopped cucumber
1/2 cup roasted, salted sunflower kernels
1 1/4 pounds salmon fillet or 4 small salmon steaks

Directions:
In 1-cup glass measure or small jar, combine wasabi with water; let stand 10 minutes. Add vinegar, oil, brown sugar and sesame seeds. (This can be made ahead to allow flavors to blend.)
Reserve 2 to 3 tablespoons dressing. Toss remaining dressing with cabbage, radishes, cucumber and sunflower kernels.
Grill or broil salmon 8 to 10 minutes per inch of thickness or until fish flakes easily with a fork, brushing with reserved dressing during last 2 minutes of cooking. Serve salmon with slaw.
