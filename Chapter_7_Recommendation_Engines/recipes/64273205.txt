1 small carrot, peeled & chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 28-oz can stewed tomatoes
1/2 cup fresh Italian parsley, chopped
6 cups ham stock, or ham drippings (all fat removed) augmented with broth or water to equal 6 cups

1 10-oz can black beans, drained & rinsed
1 tsp dried basil
1 tsp dried oregano
1 1/2 cups small shell pasta
chopped leftover ham - 1 cup or so

Directions:
Heat oils in soup pot, and add onion & celery. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until starting to brown.
Add carrot and garlic, and continue cooking 2 minutes longer.
Pour tomatoes into blender and blend until no large pieces remain.
Add tomatoes, parsley, stock, beans, basil and oregano to pot.
Simmer over medium heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add pasta shells and ham, and cook 8 minutes longer until pasta is al dente, stirring often. Add more stock or water if soup becomes too thick.
