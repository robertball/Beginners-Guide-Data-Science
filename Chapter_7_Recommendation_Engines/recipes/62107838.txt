Ingredients:
1 bag refrigerated pizza dough
1 tbsp olive oil
1/2 bag Quorn brand Chk'n Tenders (or other chicken substitute, about 1/2 lb)
3/4 cup BBQ Sauce
1/2 cup chopped white onion
5 oz. chopped pineapple
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzerella/provolone mix
Gas grill

Directions:
Turn on the grill and let it warm up while you prepare the ingredients.
Knead out pizza dough to about 1/2 inch thickness.  Using a piece of foil underneath it, coat each side with olive oil. Set aside.
Place chicken substitute and pineapple in grill-top skillet (or just make a foil packet).  Grill on med-high until pineapple starts to brown and chicken substitute has thawed, 5-7 minutes. Set aside.
Turn flame to medium and use foil to flip dough directly on to the grill.  Don't put it in on the foil!
Cook approximately 3 minutes or until browned.  Using spatulas, flip dough.
Turn flame to low. Distribute BBQ sauce, onions, pineapple, chicken substitute, and cheese on to cooked side of dough.
Close grill lid and cook additional 3-5 minutes.
Use spatulas to remove pizza from the grill, cut, and eat.

Description: 
This yummy pizza is vegetarian but can be made with chicken.  Instead of being baked in the oven, it is cooked directly on the grill!  This makes it crispy and fast. You will need a gas grill, as you need to be able to change heat levels during cooking. If you like crispy pizza, this is for you.
