Ingredients:
3/4 cup(s) heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup xylitol
4 bags green tea
1/2 pound chocolate, bittersweet, (~65% cocoa)
1/4 cup cocoa powder, unsweetened

Directions:
Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium heat. When it comes to a simmer, add xylitol and stir to dissolve.
Remove from heat and add tea bags, allow tea to steep 5 minutes.
Gently squeeze bags over cream to extract extra flavor and discard.
Return to a simmer then pour over chopped chocolate in a medium bowl. Stir to combine.
Place bowl in freezer until set, about 20 minutes, removing and stirring a couple of times. Chocolate is ready to roll into truffles when it is no longer a pudding-like consistency and is starting to harden.
If you have disposable rubber gloves, it really helps in the next step. Scoop out about 2 teaspoons chocolate mixture and roll in the palms of your hands to form a small ball. Repeat with remaining chocolate. Return to freezer to let chocolate setup a little more - about 5 minutes.
Next, place cocoa powder in a shallow dish. Roll balls in the cocoa powder to coat. Shake off any excess cocoa powder.
Serve or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
