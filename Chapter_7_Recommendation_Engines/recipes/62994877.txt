Description: 
My Mother-in-law made this for every family reunion. Everyone always asked for her pizza. You can also add any preferred topping to personalize it to your liking. 
This pizza will not taste anything like a delivered or store bought pizza. It has a unique and addictive flavor. Hope you enjoy as much as we do.
