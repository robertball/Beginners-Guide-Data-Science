Ingredients:
5-10 pound Pork Roast
Crock Pot or oven
Sticky Sweet Spice Rum Sauce

Directions:
Season roast with garlic powder, onion powder and seasoning salt.
Fill the crock pot or roasting pan ½ to ¾ full of water or chicken broth or vegetable broth.
Cook meat at 175 to 200 degrees for 16 hours.
When the meat is easy to pull apart, drain off the liquid.
Using two forks pull the port apart.
Add the Sticky Sweet Spiced Rum Sauce and cook for 30 to 60 minutes.
Letting the sauce cook until it starts to caramelize is the key to infusing the meat with Sticky Sweet Spiced Rum Sauce.
