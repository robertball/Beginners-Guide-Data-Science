mintconditionherbfarm's Hot Crab Artichoke Spread Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
8 oz marscapone or cream cheese, softened
1 cup Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated (finely grated Parmesan can be substituted)
½ cup mayonnaise
1 Tablespoon fresh lemon zest, grated
1 teaspoon garlic pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 14 oz can artichoke bottoms, drained and diced
8 oz. lump crabmeat
Buttery crackers or toast rounds to serve

Directions:
Blend marscapone, Pecorino and mayonnaise until well incorporated.  Stir in the lemon zest, garlic pepper and cayenne pepper.  Fold in the diced artichoke bottoms and lump crabmeat, stirring gently so as to not break up the crabmeat lumps.   Check for seasonings; add salt if needed.  If you are using the Pecorino instead of Parmesan it is usually salty enough that more salt isn’t needed.
Bake in preheated 350 degree oven 10-15 minutes until bubbly and lightly golden on top or heat on low in a small crock pot (4 cup).  Serve with crackers or toast rounds.
And IF there are any leftovers: scoop a couple of tablespoons of the spread into the center of an omelet before you fold it over!  Perfect for breakfast the morning AFTER you’ve given a party or dinner!

Description: 
You can either bake this in an oven until golden brown on top or for an even easier buffet serving, I put it in a small crockpot so that it stays warm throughout the party. This can also be partially made a couple of days in advance.  Just don’t add the artichoke bottoms or crab until you get ready to heat it or the mixture will be very watery.
