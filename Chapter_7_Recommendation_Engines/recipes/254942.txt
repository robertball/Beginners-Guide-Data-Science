Ingredients:
1 pound pork tenderloin
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons orange juice
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Place pork in a large shallow dish. Sprinkle black pepper over both sides; press gently into the surface.
Whisk soy sauce, honey, olive oil, orange juice, and ginger together in a bowl to make marinade. Stir in garlic and red pepper flakes.
Pour marinade over pork; turn to coat both sides. Cover with plastic wrap; let marinate in the refrigerator, 6 hours to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove pork from marinade, reserving marinade in the dish. Grill pork, covered, basting occasionally with 1/4 of reserved marinade, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 12 to 15 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board; let rest, about 5 minutes.
Pour 3/4 of reserved marinade into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until reduced by 1/2 into a thick sauce, 3 to 5 minutes. Discard garlic slices.
Slice pork into 1-inch thick slices. Arrange on serving plates. Drizzle thickened sauce over pork.
