Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1-1/2 cups unsalted butter, at room temperature
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup poppy seeds
2 tablespoons lemon zest
Icing:
1 cup icing sugar
3 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line two 8 x 8-in. metal baking pans with parchment paper. Stir flour with salt in a medium bowl
Beat butter with granulated sugar in a large bowl, using a wooden spoon, until smooth, 1 min. Gradually stir in half of flour mixture, until just combined. Add remaining flour mixture, poppy seeds and lemon zest kneading with your hands, until dough forms a ball
Divide dough in half, then roll each portion into a 2-in.-wide log. Wrap each log in waxed paper and twist ends. Chill until firm, 2 hours. Slice dough into 1/4-in. rounds and arrange 2 in. apart on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets
Bake in top and bottom thirds of oven, switching sheets halfway through, until lightly golden, 15 to 19 min. Leave on sheet for 5 min, then transfer cookies to a rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough. Stir 1 cup icing sugar with 3 tbsp lemon juice until combined. Drizzle over cookies. Makes 40 cookies.
