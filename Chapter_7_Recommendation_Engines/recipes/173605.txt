Ingredients:
3/4 cup shredded Kerrygold Dubliner Cheese
1/2 cup corn kernels (drained if canned)
1/4 cup chopped red or green bell pepper
2 tablespoons chopped green onion
1/2 teaspoon Southwest seasoning*
1/4 teaspoon hot sauce (optional)
2 (10 inch) tortillas (chipotle, sun-dried tomato or whole wheat)
1/2 cup vegetarian refried beans
2 cups shredded green or red leaf lettuce
4 ounces cooked skinless, boneless chicken sliced (from leftover rotisserie chicken or grilled the night before), optional

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine cheese, corn, red pepper, onion, seasoning and hot sauce if used.  Mix. Set aside.
Spread each tortilla with half the refried beans, leaving a 1-inch edge without beans.  Top each tortilla with lettuce, chicken (if used), and cheese-corn mixture, dividing equally.
Fold each tortilla about 1 inch on two opposite sides toward the inside, then roll. Wrap well in plastic wrap, and pack to carry.
