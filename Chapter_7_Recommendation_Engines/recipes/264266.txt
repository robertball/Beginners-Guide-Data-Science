Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 yellow onion, chopped
2 carrots, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 1/2 cups red lentils
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
4 cups vegetable broth
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Heat olive oil; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add carrots and celery and cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Combine lentils, diced tomatoes, vegetable broth, garlic, thyme, salt, paprika, and black pepper in the pot. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 15 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Serve in bowls and sprinkle with parsley.
