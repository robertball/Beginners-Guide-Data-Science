Ingredients:
4 7oz. fileted and deboned grouper
chili oil or olive oil and chili pepper
butter
herbs and spices your choice
CITRUS BURBLANC:
3-4 cups white wine
1/3 cup dice shallots
1 lb butter cubed
1/3 cup of heavy whipping cream
1 lime juiced
1 lemon juiced
zest from both lemon and lime
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
For the sauce you need white wine(your preference).  I use mountain chalis.
CITRUS BURBLANC:
-In a small pot reduce the wine and the shallots until there's about 2 tbs of wine left.
-Add the cream, mix well, and let it come to a soft boil.
-Quickly add the butter and wisk the sauce until all the butter is melted.
-Take the pot off the stove and use a hand blender to mix the sauce for about 2 minutes.  Add the rest of the ingredients while mixing.
-Set the sauce aside but keep warm.
-Cover both sides of the filets with chili oil.  If you don't have chili oil, use olive oil and then sprinkle chili powder on the fish.
-In a covered hot skillet or pan with generous amounts of butter, cook the filets skin side first for about 4-5 minutes.  Uncover and flip onto the other sides cooking them covered for 2-3 minutes more.
-Plate the fish and add the sauce all over the fish.
