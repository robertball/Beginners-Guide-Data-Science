Ingredients:
1 pound bacon
1/2 cup butter
1 cup finely chopped onion
1 cup chopped celery
2 tablespoons Bell's seasoning
2 large loaves white bread (day old, torn into pieces)
2 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Slice bacon into 1/2 inch pieces, cook in frying pan, just until bacon is cooked through, not until it's crispy. Drain the bacon and set aside. Keep bacon drippings.
Melt butter in a separate frying pan, saute, onion and celery just until soft. Add bacon and Bell's seasoning.
Toss the onion, celery, bacon mixture with the bread pieces. Fold in the eggs.  If you think the dressing is too dry, you can add bacon drippings (or milk or chicken stock) until you get the right consistency.
Stuff bird and bake according to turkeys directions. OR, place stuffing in muffin tins and bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes or until tops are crispy.
