Ingredients:
3/4 cup vegetable oil
2 cups sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 eggs
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup baking cocoa
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup crushed peppermint candy, divided
GLAZE:
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon shortening

Directions:
Line a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan with foil; grease the foil and set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat oil and sugar. Stir in vanilla. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Combine the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Set aside 2 tablespoons peppermint candy for garnish; stir remaining candy into creamed mixture. Spread into prepared pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. For glaze, melt chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave or heavy saucepan; stir until smooth. Spread over brownies; sprinkle with reserved candy.

Description: 
My grandmother encouraged me to enter these mint brownies in the county fair some years ago-- and they earned top honors! They're a great chewy treat to serve during the holidays.
