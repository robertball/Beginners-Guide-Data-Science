Ingredients:
3 tablespoons melted butter
1 cup bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 pinch garlic powder
4 small zucchini
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pinch fresh-ground black pepper
3 tablespoons sour cream
1/2 cup bacon bits
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Stir together the melted butter, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder in a small bowl; set aside. Slice the zucchini in half lengthwise, remove the seeds with a spoon and rinse under cold water.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the zucchini halves in the boiling water until slightly tender but still mostly firm, about 5 minutes; drain and pat dry with paper towels.
Preheat your oven's broiler. Place the zucchini on a broiler pan, hollowed-side facing up. Season each zucchini with the olive oil and pepper
Roast the zucchini under the broiler until sizzling, about 5 minutes; remove from oven. Layer the sour cream, bacon bits, mozzarella cheese, and the breadcrumb mixture in the center of the zucchini halves in equal amounts. Return the zucchini to the oven until the breadcrumbs are brown and the cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes.

Description: 
While trying to find a good recipe for zucchini I decided to imitate a potato skins recipe. My husband gave these rave reviews. Don't be afraid to jazz these up with your favorite toppings.  I think the variations are endless. This is a recipe you can easily increase or decrease depending on the number and size of zucchini you wish to use.
