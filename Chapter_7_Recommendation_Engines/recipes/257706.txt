Description: 
This is a layer salad. Just add the ingredients as listed and then toss at the table. I tend to change things up based on the ingredients I have in the house so the ingredients can vary. I use whatever lettuce, cheese, and beans I happen to have on hand. I could eat this salad every day and not get tired of it! You may want to reserve some of the dressing for individuals to add as desired.
