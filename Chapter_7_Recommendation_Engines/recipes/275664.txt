Ingredients:
CAKE:
Cooking spray
2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 cup roughly chopped toasted macadamia nuts
1/2 cup roughly chopped dried apricots
1/2 cup roughly chopped candied ginger
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
6 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 cup Sugar In The Raw®
1/2 cup Stevia In The Raw®
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 large eggs
1/2 cup spiced rum
HARD SAUCE ICING:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup Stevia In The Raw®
1 tablespoon spiced rum

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray and line with parchment so it extends over the 2 long sides of the pan.
In a medium bowl, toss 1/4 cup of the flour with macadamia nuts, apricots, and ginger.
In another medium bowl, whisk to combine remaining 1 3/4 cups flour, baking powder, and salt.
In a large bowl or a stand mixer with the paddle, beat butter, sugar, and stevia until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in vanilla, then beat in eggs one at a time just until combined. Gently mix in flour, then fold in fruit and nut mixture.
Scrape batter into prepared pan, smoothing the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in the pan for 20 minutes, then poke cake all over with a skewer. Very slowly pour rum all over cake and let sit 10 minutes before transferring cake to a rack to cool completely, at least 1 hour.
Beat butter and stevia in a medium bowl or a stand mixer until smooth. Beat in rum. To serve, spread top of cake with icing, then slice.
