Ingredients:
10 fresh jalapeno peppers
2 tomatoes
1 white onion, quartered
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste
2 cloves garlic, smashed
1 lime, juiced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Place jalapenos in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Simmer until jalapenos soften and begin to lose their shine, about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the jalapenos with a slotted spoon, chop off the stem, and place them in a blender. Add the tomatoes and boil for 2 to 3 minutes to loosen the skin. Peel the skin from the tomatoes and add tomatoes to the blender.
Place the onion, cilantro, garlic, lime juice, salt, and black pepper in the blender with the jalapenos and tomatoes. Blend to desired consistency.

Description: 
I wanted a verde style salsa, but living in Germany, I was not able to find tomatillos. This green salsa is great on eggs, used as a marinade, or just eaten with tortilla chips. Its heat is somewhere in the middle between mild and hot. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
