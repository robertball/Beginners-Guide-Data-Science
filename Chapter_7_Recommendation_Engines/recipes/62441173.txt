Ingredients:
4 frozen or thawed chicken breasts
1 can of corn drained
1 can of black beans drained
1 diced onion
2 diced peppers any color
1 can of enchilada sauce
8 oz of salsa
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Throw the frozen chicken breasts in the bottom of your crockpot.
Dump all the ingredients in the crockpot and put it on high for 4 hours (It's as easy as that!)
I like to put 5 baked potatoes in the microwave for 5 minutes on each side then I put them on top of everything in the crock pot and then serve this over the baked potato or you could serve it over cous cous too :)

Description: 
Love to just dump a bunch of things in a crock pot and leave it.  This is a great stew like dish with a zing! Beans, corn, onions, peppers hum!
