Ingredients:
CHICKEN
1 1/2 cups corn flakes, crushed
1 tsp. smoked paprika
1 tsp. poultry seasoning
1/2 tsp. thyme
salt and pepper to taste...just a bit
2 eggs
3 butterflied skinless, boneless chicken breasts or three butterflied boneless pork chops
GRAVY
2 tbsp. butter
2 tbsp. flour
1 cup evaporated skimmed milk
1/2 cup fat free, reduced sodium chicken stock
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. white pepper
3 tbsp. chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Mix corn flakes, paprika, poultry seasoning, thyme, salt and pepper in a shallow bowl. Beat eggs in a separate bowl. Dip meat in egg to coat and then dredge in corn flake mixture. Place in a 11x7x2-inch baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes, turning halfway.  To make gravy, combine butter and flour in a medium saucepan on the stovetop. Cook over medium heat for about two minutes, reduce heat. Add milk and broth, stirring until smooth and cooking until thickened. Add salt and pepper and remove from heat. Spoon over cooked meat and top with chives. Serve immediately

Description: 
My adaptation of a recipe from Butter Busters, The Cookbook by Pam Mycoskie. This cookbook was all the rage around my town when our kids were little...the author is from the Dallas area. I use real butter and eggs instead of the fake stuff, and this is wonderfully easy and tasty.
