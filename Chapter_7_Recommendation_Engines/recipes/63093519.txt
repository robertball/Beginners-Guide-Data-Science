Ingredients:
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 Cup coarsely chopped yellow onion
1/2 Cup diced celery
1 and 1/2 cup chopped bell pepper,  (I like to use red and green for the color)
1 lb. smoked Andouille sausage, finely diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tsp. cayenne powder
3 cups corn, fresh or frozen (thawed)
2 bay leaves
2 tsp. dried thyme
6 cups low-sodium chicken broth
3-4 medium Yukon Gold or other boiling potato, cut into 1/2" cubes
1 cup heavy cream
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup chopped cilantro

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large stock pot over medium-high heat. Saute the onion, celery and bell pepper until softened. Stir in the garlic, cayenne and sausage and continue to saute another minute or two. Add the corn and the herbs and continue to saute for a minute. Stir in the broth and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add potatoes and cream and simmer gently, covered, about 20 minutes until the potatoes are tender.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove bay leaves and garnish with cilantro to serve.

Description: 
This is a slightly spicy, smoky, hearty corn chowder.  The recipe was given to me by a dear friend many years ago and the original source is unknown. I have adapted it to suit my family's tastes. Serve this with cornbread or a crusty french loaf for a lovely meal, enjoy!
