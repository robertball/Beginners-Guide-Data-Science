Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 Cornish game hens
2 tablespoons butter, melted, divided
1/4 cup apricot preserves
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon grated onion
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Combine the salt and cayenne. Rub a third of the mixture inside hens. Brush 1 tablespoon butter over hens; sprinkle with remaining seasoning mixture. Place on a rack in a shallow baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine the preserves, honey, onion, nutmeg and remaining butter. Cook and stir until preserves are melted. Brush over hens. Bake 35-40 minutes longer or until golden brown and a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F. Cover and let stand for 5-10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I found this easy recipe for Cornish hens and prepare it often for my family. The glaze keeps the hens tender and moist, and the skin roasts to a golden glow. It's tasty, too.    When the children are gone for the weekend, my husband and I enjoy this meal-perfect for two.
