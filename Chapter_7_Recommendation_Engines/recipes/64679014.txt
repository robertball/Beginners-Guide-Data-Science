Description: 
I usually around the holidays use one of them to cook a ham dinner. I always like to cook my ham with pineapple slices glazed with the reserved pineapple juice and brown sugar.  Ham dinner goes great with a cheesy potato casserole. I always like to make a spit pea ham soup with leftovers.
