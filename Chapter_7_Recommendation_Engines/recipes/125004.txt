Ingredients:
2 (1 pound) loaves frozen white bread dough, thawed
1/2 pound mild pork sausage
1/2 pound hot pork sausage
1 1/2 cups diced fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup chopped onion
3 eggs
2 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
1 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Allow dough to rise until nearly doubled.
Meanwhile, in a skillet over medium heat, cook and crumble sausage. Add mushrooms and onion. Cook and stir until the sausage is browned and vegetables are tender; drain. Cool. Beat 1 egg, set aside. To sausage mixture, add 2 eggs, cheese and seasonings; mix well. Roll each loaf of dough into a 16-in. x 12-in. rectangle. Spread half the sausage mixture on each loaf to within 1 in. of edges. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting at a narrow end; seal edges. Place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes; brush with beaten egg. Bake 5-10 minutes more or until golden brown. Serve warm.

Description: 
Any time we take this savory, satisfying bread to a potluck, it goes over very well. We never bring any home. My husband generally makes this bread and prides himself on the beautiful golden loaves. -Shirley Caldwell, Northwood, Ohio
