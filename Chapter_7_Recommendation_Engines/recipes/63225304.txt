Ingredients:
1 (8 oz) tomato sauce
1 (6 oz) can tomato paste
2 tsp. white vinegar
2 1/4 pounds lean ground beef
2 eggs
1/2 cup parmesan cheese
1/4 cup red onion, diced
1/4 cup red bell pepper, diced
2 T. chopped fresh parsley
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 t. dried oregano
1/2 t. dried basil
1 t. sea salt
1/2 t. ground black pepper
1/4 lb. black forest ham
1/4 lb. sliced provolone cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix together the tomato sauce, tomato paste and vinegar.
In another bowl, mix together the beef, eggs, parmesan cheese, vegetables, herbs and seasonings.
On waxed paper, form meatloaf mix into a 10 by 8 inch rectangle.  Place a layer of the black forest ham on top followed by a layer of provolone slices.  Roll up the meatloaf mix like a burrito and seal the edges all around by pinching the meat together.
Place the meatloaf, seam side down, into a pan.  Spread the tomato topping to completely cover the top and sides of meatloaf.  Place in oven and bake for 1 hr. and 25 minutes or until temperature on a meat thermometer registers 165 degrees.
