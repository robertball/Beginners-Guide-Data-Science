Ingredients:
3 cups unsalted cashews (such as Stock & BarrelÂ®), divided
1/3 cup vegetable oil, or more as needed
1 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Put 1 cup cashews in a food processor bowl and begin to process while drizzling vegetable oil into the mixture to keep it moving. Add cashews to food processor, alternating with oil, and process. Once all cashews are added, add sea salt and continue to process until your preferred texture is attained, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
Just like peanut butter. Store cashew butter in a sealable container and keep refrigerated to keep oil from separating.
