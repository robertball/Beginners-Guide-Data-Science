Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) package uncooked rotini pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup tasso ham, cut into matchsticks
2 tablespoons minced garlic
3/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1/4 cup chopped celery
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning blend (such as Tony Chachere's®)
1/4 teaspoon hot sauce (such as Tabasco®)
2 cups heavy cream
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 pound peeled crawfish tails
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a rolling boil. Stir the rotini into the boiling water. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the tasso, and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, onion, green pepper, green onion, and celery. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the basil, thyme, Cajun seasoning, and hot sauce; cook 1 minute.
Pour in the cream, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in the Parmesan cheese. Cook and stir until the sauce begins to thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. Add the shrimp and crawfish tails, and cook until hot, then toss with the rotini pasta. Sprinkle with parsley to serve.

Description: 
This recipe is one of my family's all-time favorites!  You may substitute crawfish for the shrimp and it turns out just as delicious. The tasso gives the sauce its wonderful smoky flavor.  You can substitute smoked ham for the tasso but the smoky flavor may not be as intense.
