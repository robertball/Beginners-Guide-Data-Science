Ingredients:
1 head romaine lettuce, rinsed, patted dry and chopped
4 ounces arugula, washed and dried
4 ounces sliced mushrooms
1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
1 shallot, thinly sliced
1 cup fresh red currants
1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese
4 ounces honey ham, chopped
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Toss together the romaine, arugula, mushrooms, tomatoes, shallot, currants, Swiss cheese, and ham in a large salad bowl. Whisk together the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl until mixed. Pour over the salad and toss to coat.

Description: 
The sweetness of the ham is a nice complement to the tartness of the currants. I couldn't find one recipe that used fresh red currants that wasn't a jam or dessert so I made this one up.
