Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) butternut squash, halved and seeded
salt to taste
tossed in olive oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Use a sharp knife to carefully cut away the peel from the squash. Cut the squash into sticks like French fries. Toss in olive oil. Arrange squash pieces on a baking sheet and season with salt.
Bake for 20 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, turning the fries over halfway through baking. Fries are done when they are starting to brown on the edges and become crispy.
