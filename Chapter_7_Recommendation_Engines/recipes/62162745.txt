Title:
Homemade Blueberry Pie Filling Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
4 Dry Pints Blueberries
1/4 Cup Sugar
1 1/2 Tablespoons Cornstarch or Tapioca
1/4 Cup Water
2 Tablespoons Chilled Butter (cut into pieces)
1 Teaspoon Cinnamon (Optional)

Directions:
Some blueberry pie filling recipes call for you to blend the dry ingredients, mix with water, bring to a boil, and then add the blueberries.  I prefer the following (I think this results in having to add less of the binder, cornstarch or tapioca):  Add 3 Dry Pints of blueberries along with the remainder of the dry ingredients, and mix together in a saucepan.  Add the water, and cook over low to medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring as needed so sugar doesn't carmelize, until mixture is clear and thickened.  Stir lightly so blueberries stay fairly whole.  Remove saucepan from heat and add butter.  Fold in butter lightly until blended.  Cool and use in recipes calling for blueberry pie filling.
