Ingredients:
2/3 cup ketchup
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons yellow mustard
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/3 cup milk
1/3 cup ketchup
1 teaspoon yellow mustard
2 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 cup regular or instant rolled oats
1/3 cup finely chopped onion
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 tsp worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. For the glaze, combine the 1/3 cup ketchup, brown sugar, and the 2 teaspoons mustard in a small bowl. Set aside until ready to use.
Combine eggs, milk, the 1/3 cup ketchup, and the 1 teaspoon mustard in a large bowl. Stir in ground beef, rolled oats, onion, salt, and pepper; mix well. Gently press mixture in an ungreased 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Bake for 30 minutes. Drain off fat.
After 30 minutes of baking, spoon the glaze evenly over the meatloaf. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes more or until a thermometer registers 160 degrees F. Let the meat loaf stand for 15 minutes. Drain off fat. Carefully slice meatloaf and use a spatula to transfer to a serving platter.
