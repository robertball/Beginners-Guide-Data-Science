Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons Grapeseed Or Peanut Oil, For Frying
1 pound Chicken Livers And Hearts
1 cup Flour
4 pinches Sea Salt
4 ounces, Hard Cheese, Like Manchego

Directions:
When choosing chicken organs, please make sure they’re organic and from a farm you trust. Rinse them in a colander and let them dry slightly while making the dredge.
Heat 2 Tablespoons of grapeseed or peanut oil in a large skillet. These oils can withstand higher temperatures and won’t burn as quickly. You will know the oil is ready when it thins and spreads out in the pan.
In a shallow dish, combine flour, salt and finely grated cheese. I’m sure any hard cheese will do. I love Manchego, but you can use Comté, Gruyere or Parmesan if you prefer. Thoroughly coat the livers and hearts in the flour mixture and spoon them onto the skillet. The oil should sizzle, but not sputter. If it is sputtering, please turn the heat down to a sizzle. Cook about 5 minutes on each side, or until browned to your liking. Let them dry on paper towels and taste before adding any extra salt.
