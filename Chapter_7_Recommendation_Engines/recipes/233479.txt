Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 red onion, cut into large chunks
1 cup chopped celery
4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
2 pounds ground beef
2 (28 ounce) cans tomatoes, undrained and tomatoes chopped
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 cup water
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 (16 ounce) cans kidney beans, rinsed and drained

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or large soup pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, celery, and garlic in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir ground beef into onion mixture; cook and stir until ground beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain grease.
Stir tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and pepper into ground beef mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend, about 1 1/2 hours. Add kidney beans; simmer for 10 more minutes.

Description: 
My family loves this recipe. Kid-friendly, great for sleepover nights. The key is to chop all veggies big so the flavors get incorporated but they're able to be picked out by the picky eater. Pair with honey cornbread and call 'come and get it!'
