Ingredients:
1 can (15-ounces or 440 g) or 1 1/2 cups (246 g) cooked chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon salt (I used 1/2 teaspoon fine grain sea salt  AL)
2 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons (30 g) tahini
1 tablespoon (15 ml) hot sauce (I used Frank’s Hot Sauce  AL)
1 tablespoon (15 ml) lemon juice
1/2 cup (90 g) jarred roasted red pepper
2 tablespoons (28 ml) olive oil or liquid from can (I used water- AL)
Cayenne pepper, to taste, for serving

Directions:
1. Combine all the ingredients except the oil (or water) and cayenne. in a food processor. Pulse a few times to combine and then scrape down the sides. With the motor running, stream in the oil (or water) through the feed tube.
2. Continue to run the motor until you reach the desired consistency; I like to let it for for 5 minutes to get it really smooth.
3. Add more salt, lemon juice, or hot sauce, to taste, and then sprinkle with cayenne pepper before serving. Angela’s note: I also sprinkled it with cumin, smoked paprika, and more hot sauce
