Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) can asparagus tips, drained
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
1 pinch seasoning salt
1 (1 pound) loaf soft, sliced white bread

Directions:
Set asparagus spears onto paper towels to absorb excess liquid. In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, onion and seasoning salt. Remove crusts from bread slices, and spread mayonnaise mixture thinly on each slice. Place a spear onto the slice and roll up. Cut each roll in half, and arrange on a serving tray. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until serving.
