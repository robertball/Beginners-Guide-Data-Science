Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups whole almonds
3 cups white chocolate melting wafers
3 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Roast almonds on 1 baking sheet in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until toasted, about 10 minutes.
Microwave white chocolate melting wafers and butter in a microwave-safe bowl on medium-high for 1 minute 30 seconds; stir. Microwave until completely melted, 20 to 30 seconds more. Add almond extract and stir until smooth. Stir in toasted almonds.
Spread chocolate mixture evenly onto the second baking sheet. Chill in the refrigerator until hardened, about 1 hour. Break into small pieces by hand.

Toasting the almonds and adding almond extract is what make this recipe stand apart. It is a great treat to give out during the holidays. Substitute broken up candy cane for the almonds for a change.
