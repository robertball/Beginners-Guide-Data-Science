Ingredients:
3 cups unbleached spelt flour
2 T ground flax seed
1 T baking powder
1/2 t baking soda
1/2 t sea salt
1/2 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup natural honey
1 egg
Juice and zest of one fresh lemon
1 1/2 cups fat free or low fat plain organic yogurt (you can also substitute low fat buttermilk, or low fat plain kefir)
1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 and spray muffins tins or line with paper muffin cups.
In a medium bowl, whisk together first 5 dry ingredients. Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk honey and coconut oil well. Whisk in yogurt (or buttermilk or kefir.) Add egg, lemon zest and juice. Mix well.
Add dry ingredients and blueberries all at once. Fold until well blended and all dry ingredients are incorporated. Batter will be very stiff.
Fill muffins cups with mixture to the top. Bake 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown.

Description: 
The end product is well worth the pricey spelt flour and coconut oil! If you can afford it, buy organic extra virgin coconut oil. There are many uses for it, and it's a super healthy fat! I buy mine from Nutiva.com.
