Description: 
We. Love. Squash. Simple, with only 3 other ingredients, besides salt and pepper, this recipe sets off the delicious, slightly sweet flavor of crookneck or summer squash. Mom used to stew squash, but this vegetable releases a lot of water when it cooks, so I don't add any water. The long, slow cooking helps to release the natural sugars in the onion and the squash. You can add additional herbs or seasonings, if you like, or cook it for less time to make it firmer, but this is how we do it. Just squash.
