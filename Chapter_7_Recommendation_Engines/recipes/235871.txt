Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
1/4 teaspoon onion powder, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 pounds cubed beef stew meat
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 (16 ounce) package baby carrots, quartered
1/2 yellow onion, quartered and sliced
4 red potatoes, quartered
2 stalks celery, roughly chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
3/4 cup red wine
1/4 cup beef broth
1/4 cup tomato paste
1 teaspoon dried rosemary

Directions:
Whisk flour, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl. Add beef to seasoned flour and toss to evenly coat; shake off any excess flour.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook beef in hot oil until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer beef to slow cooker; add carrots, onion, potatoes, celery, and garlic.
Whisk red wine, beef broth, tomato paste, and rosemary together in a bowl until smooth; pour over beef and vegetables.
Cook on Low until beef and vegetables are tender,  4 to 6 hours.

Description: 
Best beef stew I've ever made! I apologize for the vague instructions, the ingredient amounts are approximate as well as I did this over the weekend but did not note amounts. It turned out so good I wanted to save what I did so I could make again! Chicken broth can be used instead of beef broth if desired.
