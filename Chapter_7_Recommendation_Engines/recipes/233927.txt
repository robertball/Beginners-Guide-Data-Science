Ingredients:
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups warm water, or as needed
2 tablespoons melted butter
2 cups oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Whisk 3 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt together in a bowl.
Whisk water and butter together in a separate bowl; pour into flour mixture and stir until mixture comes together to form a ball and is slightly sticky and elastic. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Cover bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Punch down dough and turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in 1/4 cup flour, if necessary. Shape into 10 balls.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large cast iron skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll each dough ball out on a lightly floured surface into an 8-inch round.
Place each round into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove fry bread to a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Repeat with remaining dough rounds.

Description: 
Each tribe has their own recipe for fry bread. This is a recipe that I came across as a teenage girl while staying at my great-grandma's house. Grandma was Native American, and I found that this recipe creates a delicious fry bread for Indian tacos. Fry bread is commonly used for making Indian tacos, but is also good with honey butter or cinnamon-sugar and butter for a dessert. Warm milk can be substituted for the water.
