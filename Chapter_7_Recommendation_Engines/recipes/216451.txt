Ingredients:
1 cup cranberry-raspberry juice
1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries, rinsed
1 cup pure maple syrup
1 orange, zested
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Pour the cranberry-raspberry juice into a saucepan. Add the cranberries, maple syrup, and orange zest. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until the cranberries pop, about 10 minutes.
Remove from the heat, and stir in the chopped walnuts. Let cool for 30 minutes, then scrape into a serving bowl. Cover, and refrigerate overnight before serving.
