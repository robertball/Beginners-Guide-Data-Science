Ingredients:
15 oz. can white beans or chick peas
2-3 tbsp. water

Directions:
Rinse and drain the beans and put in the bowl of your food processor.  Pulsing in on/off turns, puree the beans with 2 tbsp. of water until smooth, scraping sides of bowl as needed.  The goal is a smooth, but not wet, puree (about the consistency of peanut butter).  If necessary, thin with a little more water until there are no flecks of whole beans visible.
Store in refrigerator for 3 days or freeze in 1/4 cup portions.
