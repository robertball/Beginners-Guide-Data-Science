Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes, halved and stems removed
1 cup white sugar
1 cup finely chopped fresh basil
1/2 cup finely chopped sweet onion
1/2 lemon, juiced
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Inspect 2 pint jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water until jam is ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water.
Combine tomatoes, sugar, basil, onion, lemon juice, vinegar, salt, pepper, coriander, and cumin in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened and reduced by half, 2 to 3 hours. Remove from heat.
Divide jam between jars. Allow to cool slightly before covering with lids. Refrigerate jam for up to 2 weeks or freeze for up to 4 months.

Description: 
A great sweet and savory way to use up any extra cherry tomatoes you might have! Tastes great on crackers with either goat cheese or cream cheese! This makes about a pint and a half of jam when all is said and done.
