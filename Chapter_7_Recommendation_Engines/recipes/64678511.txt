Ingredients:
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 large onion, diced
1 large green bell pepper, diced
1 tsp garlic, minced
Salt and pepper, to taste
Paprika, to taste
1 pound spaghetti noodles, uncooked and broken in half
2  (14.5 oz) cans diced tomatoes, with juice
1 (2 oz) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1 pound Cheddar cheese, 3/4 diced and grate the rest
1 pound cooked ham, diced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and generously grease a large casserole dish; set aside.
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, then add the onion, bell pepper, garlic and seasoning; saute until golden brown. Add the diced ham to the onion mixture and allow to brown.
Mix in the tomatoes, and when heated through, add the broken spaghetti noodles along with the drained mushrooms. Allow this mixture to cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes; reduce heat if needed, do not let the mixture boil.
Remove from heat and lightly mix in the diced cheese; pour mixture into prepared casserole dish and sprinkle with shredded cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and bubbly, about 25 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
