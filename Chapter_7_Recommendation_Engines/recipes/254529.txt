Ingredients:
Bitter Melon Jelly:
1/4 piece bitter melon, halved and flesh and seeds removed
1 pinch salt
5 (3 ounce) packages lime-flavored gelatin mix
2 cups hot water
Optional Topping:
1/2 cup pearl sago
1/2 (14 ounce) can condensed milk

Directions:
Place the bitter melon and salt into a bowl; toss until melon is covered. Let sit until bitterness is extracted, about 40 minutes. Rinse melon under cold running water. Run the melon through a juicer to collect 1/2 to 1 fluid ounce of juice.
Combine the melon juice and lime-flavored gelatin mix in a glass bowl. Pour in hot water; stir until gelatin is dissolved. Allow to cool, 3 to 5 minutes. Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours.
Combine 2 1/2 cups of water and pearl sago in a pot; bring to boil. Cook until sago becomes translucent, about 10 minutes. Strain the sago through a sieve. Place sago in a bowl; add condensed milk. Mix together until the milk coats the sago, stirring continuously so that they mixture does not clump. Top the chilled jelly with sago mixture.

Description: 
I had this dessert a number of years ago at a Chinese restaurant and it has taken me a while to perfect this recipe. This dessert is very different, and I would say people who do not have a very sweet tooth will love this Asian dessert.
