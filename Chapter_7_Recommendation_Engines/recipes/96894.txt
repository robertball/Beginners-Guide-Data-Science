Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
6 cloves garlic, minced
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 carrots, chopped
4 medium roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and quartered
1 (15.5 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
1 quart low-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
1 teaspoon lemon juice
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat, cook the onion until translucent.  Stir in the garlic and chili flakes; cook until the garlic has begun to soften, about 1 minute.  Add the carrots, tomatoes, artichokes, garbanzo beans, and chicken broth.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer until the carrots are tender.
Season with sage, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste.  Cook for 5 to 10 minutes more to meld the flavors.
