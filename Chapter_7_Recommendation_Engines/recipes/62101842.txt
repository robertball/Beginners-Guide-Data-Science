Ingredients:
1 cup white rice, uncooked
2 cups water
1 cube chicken bouillon
1/2 pkg. your choice frozen veggies (I like a mix of corn, green beans, peas, and carrots), uncooked and still very frozen
1/2 tsp. salt
2 Tbspoons butter or margarine
1/2 tsp. garlic powder (optional)

Directions:
Put everything together in a med. sized pot. Give a little stir with a spoon if you want.
Bring to a boil, turn heat down to low, cover pot with a lid and let simmer for 15-20 minutes.
Remove from heat, lift lid and give a much better stir, enjoy with a chicken main dish.

Description: 
My favorite side dish---quick, easy, and goes well with chicken dishes. This side lends itself to a variety of vegetables you can use (I like a mixture of corn, green beans, peas, and carrots).
