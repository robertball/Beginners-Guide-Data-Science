Corn & Potato Salad Recipe

Ingredients:
3 ears of fresh corn
2 pounds small waxy potatoes (such as Yukon Gold); *do-not peel or cut potatoes*
Kosher salt
1 medium red onion (I like to buy large and cut in half because the larger they are the milder the red onions are)
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
black pepper
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 cup finely chopped fresh basil
1/2 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Shuck corn, then place the corn on the cob in a large pot with the potates.  Add water to cover potatoes and corn by two inches.  Add 1 tablespoon salt; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat; cover and low boil for 2-4 minutes until corn is tender.  Remove corn.
Continue to cook potatoes on a low boil until very tender.
Meanwhile finely chop onion while potatoes are cooking.  In a large bowl combine onion, vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Cut kernels from ears of corn and add to the onion bowl.
Drain cooked potatoes when tender.  Place potatoes on a cutting board and press with hand or potato masher to break up each potato.  Add potatoes to the bowl with corn.  Add the oil and gently stir to combine.  Let the potato salad come to room temperature; add the herbs & season to taste with salt & pepper.  If desired, cover and chill up to 24 hours.  To serve let stand at least one hour before serving.
If needed toss with additional olive oil and vinegar before serving.

Description: 
No mayonnaise in this potato-corn salad.  
This  different presentation is pretty with small skin-on whole potatoes that you smash to place the bowl.
