Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
2/3 cup plain sour cream or yogurt
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 ½ cups mashed ripe bananas*
4-6 Baker’s Semi-Sweet Chocolate squares, broken into pieces with a small amount of shavings. Set aside 12 chunks and 1-2 tablespoons of shavings.
1/2 cup packaged, dry coconut** (sweetened or unsweetened)

Directions:
Mix together all dry ingredients in a large bowl using a fork.
In a separate, smaller bowl, mix the egg, unsweetened applesauce, sour cream and vanilla.
In a different bowl or large measuring cup, mash up the bananas with a fork.
Using a spatula, gently blend in the wet ingredients to the flour mixture. Try not to over mix, it should only take a 1-2 minutes.
Gently fold in mashed bananas and then the chocolate chunks. Set aside 12 chunks and 2 tablespoons shavings that will be put on top of the muffins.
Spoon batter into a greased muffin tin.
Sprinkle coconut on top.
Place one chocolate chunk (on each muffin) and leftover shavings on top of the coconut.
Bake at 350F for 20-22 minutes. Overbaking will cause dryness. Watch for the edges to turn a light golden brown. Try not to bake beyond that colour.
