Description: 
Summer citrus salads are always a must in our Texas heat. This spinach and grapefruit salad is a quick and easy fix that can be whipped up easily with most items you already keep in your pantry/kitchen. I can easily have this as a meal in itself but it works great as a side salad with a cool cucumber/alfalfa/tzatziki 1/2 sandwich. The options are endless and yours to create. Add some sliced strawberries for sweetness and bright, festive color.
