Ingredients:
3 c all-purpose flour
1/4 plus 2 Tbsp sugar
1 Tbsp baking powder
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp salt
1 3/4 c buttermilk (Milk plus 2 Tbsp vinegar, 5 min)
9 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted
1 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
4 large eggs, separated
1 large egg white

Directions:
Place flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda,and salt in a mixing bowl and stir to combine. In a separate bowl, whisk together buttermilk,melted butter, vanilla, and egg yolks and stir into dry ingredients until mixture resembles a smooth batter. Add extra white to bowl of whites and whip to firm, but not dry, peaks using an electric mixer. Preheat your Cuisinart® Waffle Maker.
Carefully fold whites into batter in three additions using a large rubber spatula, until the whites and batter are completely incorporated.
When the iron is ready, the audible signal will sound and green indicator light will illuminate. Pour 11/2 cups batter onto the center of the lower grid; spread batter using a heatproof spatula to within 1/2 inch of the edge of the grid. Close lid of waffle iron – green indicator light will turn off. When audible signal sounds and green indicator light turns on again, waffle is ready. Open lid and carefully remove baked waffle. Repeat with remaining batter.
