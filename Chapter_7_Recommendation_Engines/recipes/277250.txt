Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups milk
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 eggs, separated
1 cup lemon juice
3 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided
1 (9 inch) baked pie shell
2 tablespoons brown sugar

Directions:
Combine milk, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir constantly until mixture thickens to the consistency of pudding, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
Whisk egg yolks in a bowl until smooth. Add lemon juice and whisk until smooth.
Return pudding to the heat; slowly stir in egg yolk mixture. Increase heat to high and boil, stirring constantly, for at least 2 minutes. Stir in butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Pour thickened custard into the pie shell.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine egg whites, remaining vanilla extract, and brown sugar in a large bowl. Whip with an electric mixture until a fluffy meringue forms. Spread meringue over the custard.
Bake pie in the preheated oven until meringue is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving.
