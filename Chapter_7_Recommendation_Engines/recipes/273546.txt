Ingredients:
cooking spray
Filling:
4 cups fresh blueberries
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
Crumb Topping:
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/3 cup cold butter, cut into small cubes
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste (optional)
1/4 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat an 8-inch square baking dish with cooking spray.
Combine blueberries, sugar, and flour in a bowl. Toss gently until berries are coated. Pour into the prepared baking dish.
Mix brown sugar, flour, oats, butter, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in another bowl with 2 knives or a pastry blender. Sprinkle over the blueberry mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and bubbly, about 30 minutes.

Summer never tasted so good. I highly recommend serving this blueberry crisp hot with ice cream.
