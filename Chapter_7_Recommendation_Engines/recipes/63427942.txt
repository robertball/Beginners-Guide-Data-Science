Ingredients:
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
12 slices extra-thin whole wheat bread
1/2 pound prosciutto or Serrano ham, thinly sliced
12 medium eggs
Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup heavy cream
Chopped fresh chives, for garnish
1/2 cup grated Parmesan or Manchego cheese, for garnish

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
2. Butter a 12-cup muffin tin. Butter one side of each slice of bread. Press each slice of bread, buttered side up, gently into the bottom of a muffin cup. Transfer to oven and bake for 3 minutes.
3. Gently press ham into each bread cup. Carefully, crack one egg on top of ham. Repeat process until all bread cups are filled. Season each with salt and pepper; top with 1/2 teaspoon cream.
4. Carefully transfer muffin tin to oven and bake eggs until whites are just set, 10 to 15 minutes. Using an offset spatula, remove bread cups from muffin tin and transfer to a serving plate. Garnish with chives and cheese; serve immediately.
