8 medium red potatoes
1 (1 ounce) package ranch salad dressing mix
1 (12 ounce) jar pickled jalapeno pepper slices, drained

2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Place potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat; cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or just until tender.  Drain; cool slightly.
Cut potatoes into 1/4-in.-thick slices.  Place in a single layer in three greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pans.  Top each with salad dressing mix, a jalapeno slice, cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack cheese.  Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until cheese is melted.  Top with sour cream and green onions.
