Butterscotch Waffles Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup milk
6 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large egg, separated
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup butterscotch chips

Directions:
Heat the oven to 200Â°F and heat the waffle iron.
Mix the flour, cornstarch, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a medium bowl.
Measure the buttermilk, milk, and vegetable oil in a Pyrex measuring cup; mix in the egg yolk and set aside.
In another bowl, beat the egg white almost to soft peaks.
Sprinkle in the sugar and continue to beat until the peaks are firm and glossy.
Beat in the vanilla.
Pour the buttermilk mixture into the dry ingredients and whisk until just mixed.
Add the butterscotch chips.
Drop the whipped egg white onto the batter in dollops and fold in with a spatula until just incorporated.
Pour the batter onto the hot waffle iron (mine takes about 2/3 cup) and cook until the waffle is crisp and nutty brown (follow the manufacturer's instructions for timing at first and then adjust to your liking).
Set the waffle directly on the oven rack to keep it warm and crisp.
Repeat with the remaining batter, holding the waffles in the oven (don't stack them).
When all the waffles are cooked, serve immediately.

The original recipe was adopted from the RecipeZaar account. After making it, I had to agree with the first reviewer. They had a good flavor but they were soft and stuck to the waffle iron, even with spraying with non-stick cooking spray. So after playing around with it, here is the new REVISED recipe as of 6/05/06. I hope you like it.
