Ingredients:
1 tablespoon steak sauce
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon sesame oil, or to taste
1/4 cup sliced onion
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 (4 ounce) boneless beef sirloin steak, thinly sliced
1/2 cup broccoli florets
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 clove garlic, minced (optional)

Directions:
Mix steak sauce, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until sauce is smooth.
Heat sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat; saute onion and ginger over medium-high heat until onion is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add steak, broccoli, mushrooms, and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until steak is cooked through and vegetables are soft, about 8 minutes.
Pour sauce over steak mixture; cook and stir until evenly coated, about 2 minutes.
