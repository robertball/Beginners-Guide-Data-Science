Description: 
I have been making this for almost 40 years. The original recipe calls for all ketchup, it was my idea to make that half ketchup and half BBQ sauce. I do love spicy. I have never had a baked bean recipe that was this good and also this easy. Nobody will know you didn't spend all day on it.
