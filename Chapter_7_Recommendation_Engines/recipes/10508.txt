Ingredients:
1 cup margarine, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup raisins
1 cup black walnuts, coarsely ground
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
3 cups rolled oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat margarine and sugars, until creamy. Add eggs and vanilla; beat well.  Combine flour, baking soda, salt, and spices. Sift and add to the egg mixture. Stir well.
Grind the raisins up with 1 teaspoon of sugar until they are in small pieces--not mush!  Stir in oats, nuts, raisins and mix well, drop by tablespoonful onto ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until light brown. Cool 1 minute and remove to wire rack. When cool store in airtight container.  NOTE:  You can add butterscotch or chocolate pieces in place of the raisins.

Description: 
I give these as Christmas gifts and take them  to showers. They are a hit every time.  Pecans will work, too, if black walnuts aren't available.
