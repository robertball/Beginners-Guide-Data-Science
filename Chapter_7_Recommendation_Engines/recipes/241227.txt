Description: 
I found a recipe similar to this one years ago on Allrecipes and haven't been able to find it again. Luckily, I remembered the basics of it. After some trial and error, I have it figured out! 

This basic recipe is a creamy comfort food that is very versatile, in that you can add any meat and veggies combos you want to make it your own.
