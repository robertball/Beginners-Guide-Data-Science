Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, broken into florets
2 tablespoons water, or as needed
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
Place cauliflower florets into a food processor and blend into rice-like bits. Transfer to a saucepan and add water. Cook over medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer cauliflower rice to a bowl and refrigerate until completely cooled, about 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Spread cooled cauliflower rice onto a clean kitchen towel. Wrap it up tightly and squeeze out all the water. Transfer to a large bowl and add eggs, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, paprika, oregano, and salt. Mix well.
Transfer cauliflower mixture to the baking sheet and spread and shape it into a pizza crust shape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Allow to cool completely before carefully flipping crust over and adding toppings, if desired.
