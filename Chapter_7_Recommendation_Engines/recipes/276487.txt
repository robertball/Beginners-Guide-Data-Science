Ingredients:
cooking spray
Polenta:
2 1/2 cups water
1 cup cornmeal
1/3 cup diced oil-packed sundried tomatoes
1 teaspoon dried garlic
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
Bruschetta Topping:
4 medium tomatoes, chopped
1/2 red onion, minced
4 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Line a pie pan with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.
Bring water to a boil in a pot over high heat. Stir in cornmeal slowly. Add sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and pepper. Reduce heat to low and let simmer until thick, about 10 minutes. Pour into the prepared pan; smooth out evenly. Chill in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.
Mix tomatoes, onion, basil, garlic, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Chill bruschetta until ready to use.
Heat olive oil in a medium frying pan over medium-high heat. Remove polenta from the pie pan and slice into 8 triangles. Brown slices in hot oil until golden, about 6 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels; transfer to a serving plate. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve with bruschetta topping on each slice.
