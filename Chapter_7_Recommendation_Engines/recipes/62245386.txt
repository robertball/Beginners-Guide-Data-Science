Ingredients:
3 T. Extra Virgin Olive Oil
2 1/2 lbs. ground sirloin
1/4 cup dark chili powder
2 T. grill seasoning
1 T. ground cumin
2 T. Worcestershire sauce
1 to 3 T. Hot sauce
1 large onion
4 garlic cloves
2 large bell peppers, chopped
1/2 bottle beer (about 1/2 cup)
1-14 oz. can tomato sauce
1/2 c. smokey bbq sauce
Garnish:
Shredded sharp cheddar
sour cream
scallions, thinly sliced

Directions:
In a large stock pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add olive oil followed by ground sirloin. Season meat with chili powder, grill seasoning, cumin, Worcestershire, and hot sauce. Break up the meat into small crumbles as it cooks.
Add onion, garlic, and bell peppers and cook until onions are translucent and soft, about 10 minutes more. Add beer and deglaze the pan, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan and allowing the alcohol to cook off. Add tomato and barbecue sauces and bring to a bubble. Let chili simmer 15 minutes. Adjust seasonings and heat level to your taste. Remove from heat and serve with your favorite garnishes.
