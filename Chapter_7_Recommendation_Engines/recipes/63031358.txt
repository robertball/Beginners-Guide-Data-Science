1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 3/4 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (divided)
2 cups hot water
2- 1/4 oz pkgs. active dry yeast
5-6 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 egg, beaten lightly

Directions:
Preheat oven 375 degrees.  Lightly grease two loaf pans.
In a large bowl, combine butter, sugar and 11/2 cups of oats. Stir in hot water and let mixture stand until lukewarm or 110 degrees.  Sprinkle yeast over mixture and let stand, about 5 minutes.
Stir in 5 cups of flour and salt, mixing until a dough is formed.  Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes, adding as much of the remaining cup of flu r as necessary for a smooth and elastic consistency. Cover dough with inverted bowl and let rest for 15 minutes.
Divide dough into two loaves and transfer to oiled pans. Brush surface with egg and sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup of oats over the top. Cover pans with damp cloth and place in warm spot.  Allow dough to double in size.
Bake for 45-50 minutes or until browned loaves sound hollow when tapped or until 190 degrees.
