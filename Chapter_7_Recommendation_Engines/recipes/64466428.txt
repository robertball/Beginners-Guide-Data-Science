3 Cups Fresh kale, 1/2 Cup four cheese blend(grated),  1/8 Tablespoon spices, 1Tablespoon Yeast,  2 Tablespoons Oil, 2 Cups Water, 1/8 teaspoon salt, 2 Tablespoons Sugar,  4 cups Flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F
Start mixing the water and the 2 Cups flour.  Add 2 Tbsp sugar, 2 Tbsp oil,  1 Tbsp Yeast,  1/8 teaspoon salt.
Let sit 5-10 minutes. Add 2 cups flour and knead the dough. After it feels firm enough, cut the dough into pieces. Roll the pieces into balls(big enough to put ingredients into).
Cut the kale finely and add about 1/2 tablespoon to each ball.
Add 1/2 tablespoon cheese to each ball as well.
Sprinkle red pepper flakes into the mix.
Fold the dough over so the ingredients are inside.
Bake 10-15 minutes or until golden brown
