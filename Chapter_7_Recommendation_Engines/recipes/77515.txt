The foods in this easy recipe are powerhouses of nutrition. Why these foods are good for you: high omega-3 fat in salmon; antioxidants in orange rind, scallions and garlic; anticoagulant activity in ginger; and eating fatty fish could prevent an astounding 80% of sudden deaths from heart attacks, Harvard investigators say.
