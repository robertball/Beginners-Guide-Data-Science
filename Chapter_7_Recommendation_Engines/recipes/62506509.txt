Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup cornmeal (coarse)
1 T baking powder
1/2 t salt
3/4 cup milk
4 oz butter
1 egg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Line 10 muffin cups with paper liners.
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix the flour, sugar, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt.
In a separate bowl, combine the milk, melted butter, and eggs.
With the mixer on the lowest speed, pour the wet ingredients into the dry ones and stir until they are just blended.
Spoon the batter into the paper liners, filling each one to the top.
Bake for 30 minutes, until the tops are crisp and a toothpick comes out clean.
Cool slightly and remove from the pan.

Description: 
Using coarsely ground cornmeal makes these muffins wonderfully rustic - the perfect side for a hearty stew or pot of beans and ham.  Batter is extremely thick and rises little, so fill to top of muffin pan.
