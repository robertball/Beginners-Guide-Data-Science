1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onions
1/2 cup sun dried tomatoes

Directions:
Cook ravioli according to package directions.
While the ravioli are cooking, prepare the sauce.  Place bacon in a medium skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.
In a medium nonstick saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon oil over a medium high flame.
Add onions and Cook 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onions start to brown around the edges.  Turn flame down to medium.  Add sun dried tomatoes, evaporated milk and cream of mushroom soup. When warm, add the nutmeg and cheddar cheese and cook until cheese has melted.
