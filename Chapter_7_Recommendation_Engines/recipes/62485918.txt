Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter
2/3 cup sugar
2 Tsp. Baking Powder
2 eggs
1/3 cup diced candied ginger
2 Tbl. Orange Liquer
1 Tsp. finely grated orange peel (zest)
2 cups flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.Mix all ingredients together with floured hands. Shape into a rectangle about 1 1/2 " thick. Place on a lightly greased cookie sheet or a sil pad.  Bake for 15-20 minutes until lightly brown. Allow to cool and then cut into 1 1/2" wide pieces. Lie the pieces flat side down on your sheet pan and bake again at 350 degrees for another 5 minutes or until lightly brown. Remove from pan and cool on racks.
If you like you can add icing but I prefer plain.  Make a simple powdered sugar icing and add some diced candied ginger.
