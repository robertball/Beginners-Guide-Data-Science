Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
3 yellow squash, sliced
1 pound lean ground beef
1 onion, chopped
3 jalapeno peppers, seeded and diced
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup crushed buttery round crackers

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute squash in butter until tender, about 10 minutes. Set aside.
In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, onion, and jalapeno, stirring until beef is evenly browned. Drain off grease. In a large bowl, mix together the squash, eggs, and mayonnaise. Stir in the ground beef mixture and Cheddar cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Pour into a 9x13 inch baking dish, and sprinkle cracker crumbs evenly over the top.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until heated through, and the top is nicely browned.
