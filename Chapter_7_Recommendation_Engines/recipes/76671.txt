Ingredients:
Apricot Sauce:
2/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup water
1 cinnamon stick
8 apricots, pitted and roughly chopped (fresh or canned)
Pain Perdu:
1 cup whole milk
4 eggs
6 thick slices egg bread (Challah is best)
Pinch of salt
4 tablespoons Butter Flavor CRISCO® All-Vegetable Shortening
Powdered Sugar

Directions:
Apricot Sauce: In a heavy saucepan, stir together the sugar, water and cinnamon stick; cook over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Bring to boil; simmer until syrupy, about 3 minutes. Add apricots and cook until apricots soften, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Cover and keep warm. (Note: sauce can be made ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Re-warm over medium-low heat before using.)
Pain Perdu: Whisk milk, eggs and salt in 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking dish; add bread in single layer. Let stand until liquid is absorbed, about 1 minute per side.
Heat 2 tablespoons CRISCO(R) Butter Flavor All-Vegetable Shortening in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat; add 3 bread slices to skillet and cook until golden, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to warm platter. Repeat with remaining 2 tablespoons Butter Flavor CRISCO(R) and 3 bread slices.
Divide pain perdu among 6 plates. Spoon warm apricot sauce over, discarding cinnamon stick. Dust with powdered sugar and serve.
