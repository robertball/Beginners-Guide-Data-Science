Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 pounds round steak, cubed
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup chopped onion
4 habanero peppers, seeded and minced
1/2 cup tomato sauce
1 cup water
2 tablespoons finely grated raw horseradish
1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup cold water

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Brown the beef cubes in the hot oil until well browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic, onion, and minced habanero peppers, cook and stir for a few minutes until the onion has begun to soften.
Stir in the tomato sauce, 1 cup o water, horseradish, hot pepper sauce, vinegar, mustard, seasoned salt, and black pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the beef begins to turn tender, about 2 hours. Stir occasionally.
Dissolve the flour into 2/3 cup of cold water, and stir into the simmering meat. Cook until the meat is very tender, and the sauce is thick and smooth, about 30 minutes more.
