Ingredients:
1 tsp. dried Italian seasoning
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. ground black pepper
1 lb. skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1/2 large onion, sliced
8 oz. mushrooms, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes, undrained
2 Tbsp. red wine vinegar
1 medium zucchini or yellow summer squash, sliced
1 red or yellow pepper, sliced
1/3 cup mayo
2 Tbsp. pesto
Ciabatta or kaiser buns

Directions:
Place chicken in slow cooker and rub with spices.
Add onion, mushrooms, and garlic. Pour vinegar and tomatoes over chicken mixture.
Cook on low for 3-4 hours.
Once chicken is cooked, add zucchini and sweet pepper and turn slow cooker to high for an additional 30 min (may also saute zucchini and pepper and add at last second). Then transfer chicken to cutting board (thinly slice chicken or pull apart with a fork). Vegetable mixture should be put into a bowl with chicken (discard cooking juices).
Next, combine mayo and pesto. Spread pesto mayo on buns and top with chicken & vegetable mixture.
