Ingredients:
4 sweet potatoes (medium, peeled & cubed)
2 tbsp milk
4 cups kale (chopped)
1 clove garlic (minced)
1/4 yellow onion (chopped)
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 cup black beans (drained & rinsed)
pepper
salt
ground flaxseed (for topping)

Directions:
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Boil cubed potatoes for about 15 minutes until fork tender.
2. Drain potatoes and mash them in a large bowl with milk.
3. Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat.
4. Add olive oil, garlic, onion and red pepper and saute for about 1 minute.
5. Add kale and saute until wilted.
Once kale is wilted, add to the bowl with sweet potatoes.
6. Season liberally with salt & pepper to taste.
7. Fold in black beans until incorporated.
8. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
9. Grease a mini muffin pan.
10. Scoop potato mixture into a mini muffin tray until filled to the top.
11. Sprinkle tops with ground flax seed.
12. Bake for 20-25 minutes, turn oven to hi-broil and broil for an additional 5 minutes until tops are golden and crunchy.
13. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes.
14. Carefully remove from muffin tin with the help of a spoon or knife. Bites will be soft but should retain enough structure to stay in mini muffin form.
