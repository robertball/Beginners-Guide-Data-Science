Ingredients:
4-6 garlic cloves (left whole or cut in half)
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 pound of eggplant (Sicilian or standard variety are fine)
½ cup white vinegar
½ cup water
1 teaspoon salt
fresh basil leaves
fresh hot pepper(s)
1 whole bay leaf (optional)
Extra Virgin Olive oil (enough to cover contents of the glass jar)

Directions:
1.Peel eggplant and cut into long strip (about three inches long and a quarter inch wide) – thick of hand cut french fries.
2.Place the eggplant strips in a large metal colander and sprinkle liberally with Kosher salt. Place a weight on top of the eggplant and let the salt, eggplant, and weight do its magic for 2-3 hours (viz., remove the moisture).
3.Remove the eggplant from the colander and squeeze any remaining liquid out of the eggplant by hand.
4.In a large pot, bring the vinegar and water to a boil and add the eggplant. Cook for 2-3 minutes (any longer and the eggplant will lose it’s crunch).
5.Drain via a colander (with a weight, again) and lit sit for 12-24 hours (in the fridge if you’d like).
6.Remove the eggplant strips and squeeze any excess water/moisture by hand. In a very clean glass jar fill with the remaining ingredients: eggplant, garlic, hot pepper(s) – chopped or un-chopped, basil, oregano, and extra virgin olive oil (the olive oil should completely submerge the ingredients – do this slowly).
7.Put eggplant in glass jar with fresh garlic cloves , fresh cut into big chunks hot peppers, fresh mint and good drizzle of olive oil. Shake up and refrigerate. Makes 1 quart. Enjoy!
