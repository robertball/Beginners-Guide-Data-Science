Ingredients:
130.5 Oz of French Style Green Beans (9 regular size cans)
4 cups of cremini mushrooms (sliced)
4 Shallots (sliced thin)
2 garlic cloves (crushed)
4 tbsp butter
1/4 cup Sherry
24 oz of Sour Cream
1/4 cup Half and Half
1/2 cup green chilies (chopped & optional)
Salt
Pepper

Directions:
Saute the mushrooms in 2 tbsp of butter until about half done, add in shallots & garlic with another 2 tbsp of butter.  When shallots start to soften, add in sherry to deglaze pan and cover with lid for about 2 to 3 minutes (just to let mushrooms steam in sherry a bit).  Add to the crock-pot with drained green beans and stir to mix.
In separate bowl, combine sour cream with half & half, salt & pepper to taste.  Add in the green chilies if using.
Fold in cream sauce (just gently enough not to smash the green beans).
Cook on high for 4 hours.  Top with French Fried Onions or Jalapenos

I didn't like many of the recipes I had tried, so made up my own for my family this Thanksgiving.  Can be scaled up or down - I made mine in crock-pot, as is prefect for potlucks
