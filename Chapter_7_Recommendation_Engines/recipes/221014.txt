Description: 
Everything you love about carrot cake - the spices, the sweet and nutty flavors, the cream cheese frosting, and of course, the carrots! - is in this fast and simple lunch. I came up with this recipe while brainstorming new ways to use peanut butter (one of the staples of my vegetarian diet.) This grown-up alternative to the standard PBJ is a sandwich that thinks it's dessert!
