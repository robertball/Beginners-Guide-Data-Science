Ingredients:
1 cup ditalini pasta
1 cup mayonnaise, or more to taste
4 ribs celery, finely chopped
4 green onions, thinly sliced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste
6 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and sliced
12 ounces frozen cooked small shrimp, thawed, or more to taste
3 sprigs fresh parsley, or as desired

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook ditalini pasta in the boiling water, stirring frequently, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and rinse pasta under cold water.
Combine pasta, mayonnaise, celery, green onions, red bell pepper, lemon juice, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until macaroni salad is well combined.
Set a few egg slices aside for garnish and stir remaining egg slices into macaroni salad. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
Stir shrimp into macaroni salad, adding more mayonnaise if salad is dry. Garnish salad with reserved egg slices and parsley sprigs.
