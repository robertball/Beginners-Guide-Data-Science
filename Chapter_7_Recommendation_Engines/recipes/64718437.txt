Ingredients:
•	3/4 cup polvilho doce (sweet manioc starch such as Yoki®?)
•	3/4 cup povilho azedo (sour manioc starch Yoki®?)
•	1/4 cup whole milk
•	1/4 cup water
•	1/4 cup olive oil
•	1 tsp salt
•	2 eggs, lightly beaten
•	1/2 cup finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano
•	3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
1.	Preheat an air fryer to 165°C. Mix together the two starches until fully combined.
2.	In a saucepan, bring the milk, water, olive oil, and salt to a boil. Turn down the heat and add the starches. Stir until the liquid is absorbed. The mixture will be very dry. Turn off the heat. Wait for the mixture to cool, just enough to touch.
3.	Add the eggs and mix until smooth and the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan. Add the cheeses and mix.
4.	Using gloves or lightly oiled hands, pinch off a golf ball sized piece of dough. Roll into a ball. Do this with the rest of the dough. Line the air fryer with a piece of parchment paper. Depending on the size of your air fryer, put them into the basket where they will have approximately 1 inch between each. Bake for 8-10 minutes until browned outside.
5.	Bake in batches or freeze uncooked dough balls. Cook unthawed dough for 10-12 minutes at 165°C.

Description: 
Two types of naturally gluten free manioc starch (not tapioca) mixed with cheeses are a traditional recipe for Brazilian cheese rolls but these are made in an air fryer instead of the oven. This cuts down baking time but still gives you soft, chewy rolls. It is important to use both types of starches for the right flavor. They can be found in most Latin or South American grocery stores or even online.
