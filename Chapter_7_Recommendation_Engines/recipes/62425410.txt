Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups Whole Wheat Pastry Flour
1/2 cup Oat Bran
1/2 cup Wheat Bran
1/4 cup Ground Flax
1/4 cup Nutritional Yeast
1/2 cup dry Buttermilk Powder (can use any powdered milk)
2 1/2 T Baking Powder
1/2 T salt (or less)
3/4 cup Canola Oil - start with less, add more if you think you need it, I didn't need the full 3/4 cup

Directions:
Combine dry ingredients very well in a large bowl. Cut in oil with fingers to make a fine crumb. Store in a freezer bag (well marked) in the freezer. The recipe actually says to store in the fridge.
To make biscuits - 3 cups of mix, 2/3 c. milk or water, optional to add in cheese, herbs or spices.
Stire milk into mix just until moist. Knead briefly on floured surface; roll or pat out to 1/2" thick and cut into biscustions. Bake at 450 for 10 minutes.
