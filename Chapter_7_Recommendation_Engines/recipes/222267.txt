Ingredients:
3 cups chopped rhubarb
1 (3 ounce) package strawberry-flavored Jell-OÂ® mix
1 1/2 cups cold skim milk
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
2 cups sliced fresh strawberries (optional)
1 prepared graham cracker crust

Directions:
Combine rhubarb and strawberry gelatin mix in a large microwave-safe glass bowl. Cover bowl and cook rhubarb mixture on high until rhubarb is very soft and has cooked down into threads, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir every 2 minutes. Let mixture cool.
Stir skim milk and vanilla pudding mix in a bowl until moistened. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until thickened, about 2 minutes; stir cooled rhubarb mixture into pudding mixture.
Spread strawberry slices into the bottom of prepared graham cracker crust. Spoon rhubarb pudding mixture over strawberries and refrigerate dessert until firm, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This is the best cold rhubarb dessert recipe I've found, and it's so easy. I have to give thanks to Nikki for adapting this recipe! Even my son who dislikes rhubarb loves this one. Adapted from the diabetic/diet version (Rhubarb Rumble). I like to make this in an 11x7-inch (2-quart) glass pan, making my own graham cracker crust. The addition of fresh strawberries adds an extra layer of lusciousness. It ends up being a very PRETTY IN PINK dessert. The hard part is waiting for it to chill.
