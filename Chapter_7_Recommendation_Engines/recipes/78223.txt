Ingredients:
1 (20 ounce) loaf French bread, sliced
1 cup olive oil, divided
1 tablespoon crushed garlic
1/2 cup cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
1 pinch salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat your oven's broiler. Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil.
Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a skillet over low heat. Add garlic; cook and stir for a few minutes until fragrant.
In a medium bowl, stir together the cream cheese, garlic, oregano, basil, parsley, salt and pepper. Mix in about half of the remaining olive oil until smooth. Spread 1 tablespoon of this mixture onto each slice of bread, and place them on the foil-lined cookie sheet. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over each slice, then drizzle with remaining olive oil.
Broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and golden brown. Watch VERY carefully, it will brown fast.
