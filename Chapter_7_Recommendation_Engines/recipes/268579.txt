1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups low-fat milk
1/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Beat eggs and vanilla extract together in a medium bowl until combined; set aside.
Whisk milk, sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch, brandy, and salt together in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until boiling and thickened, 6 to 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low.
Slowly pour 1/2 of the milk mixture into the beaten eggs while stirring; pour mixture back into the saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, until thick, 2 to 3 minutes. Do not boil.
Let custard cool to room temperature, at least 10 minutes. Refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours.
