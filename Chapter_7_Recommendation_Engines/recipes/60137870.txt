Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets. Roll out cookie dough 1/4 inch thick on floured surface. Cut with 3 inch cookie cutter, and arrange on prepared cookie sheets.  Sprinkle cookies with additional sugar (optional).
Bake for 10 to12 minutes.  You need to leave cookies on cookie sheet for 2 minutes after baking to keep them from breaking.
