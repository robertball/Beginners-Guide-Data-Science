Kirsten's Ginger Cookies Recipe

Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
scant 1 cup sugar
1 cup brown sugar (original recipe called for 2 cups granulated sugar, and that works okay, too)
2 eggs
1/2 cups molasses (I use a little more in Torrey when it's really dry)
4 cups flour
4 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
1 TBS ginger--I buy freeze-dried ginger from Savory Spice Shop online and grate the ginger as needed
2 tsp cinnamon--I use Saigon cinnamon, and have become a believer in fresh is best: use w/in 6 months or toss
sugar for coating

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Cream butter and sugars; beat in eggs and molasses.  Stir together dry ingredients in separate bowl then blend into creamed mixture.  (Original recipe called for refrigerating for 1 hour, but I rarely do and it works fine.) Form dough into balls. Roll each ball in sugar to coat and bake on ungreased baking sheet 6-8 minutes (I have a convection oven and 6 minutes is plenty).  Do not overbake.  Cookies will be puffy when removed from oven, but will flatten as they cool.  Tops will look cracked.  Cool on rack.  Makes 4-5 dozen depending on size.  Enjoy!
