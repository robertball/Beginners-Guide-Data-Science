Ingredients:
1 pound salmon fillet, skin removed
1 lemon, zest
1 1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
2 scallions, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, chopped
2 tablespoons lime juice
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil

Directions:
Season salmon with lemon zest, paprika, salt, and pepper.
Combine cilantro, scallions, garlic, lime juice, and extra virgin olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. (I used about 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper)
Prepare your grill to a medium high heat.  **note for pan below  If using a grill pan put on the grill for about 5 minutes to get it really hot.  (I close the lid for 5 minutes).  Add about 2 tablespoons of olive oil on the hot pan then place the grill (carefully) skin side up.  Let it cook for about 7 minutes.  When you flip you will have a beautiful seared fish.  Cook the other side for another 5 minutes.  Remove the pan (using pot holders) Let sit for about 5 minutes.
Place salmon on a serving platter and put cilantro vinaigrette in a small bowl.  Enjoy
