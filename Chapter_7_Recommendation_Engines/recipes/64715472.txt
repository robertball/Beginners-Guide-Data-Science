Ingredients:
4-5 chicken breasts (pounded to even thickness)
1 can diced tomatoes with green chilies
1 onion sliced and quartered
1 cup loosely packed cilantro (leaves and stems)
4 garlic cloves ( I used minced roasted garlic)
3 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tsp each: chili powder, ground cumin, onion powder
1/2 tsp each: smoked paprika, pepper, sugar
1/4 tsp cayenne

Directions:
Add marinade ingredients to food processor and pulse until finely chopped.
Use enough marinade to coat chicken and save the rest to add to cooked white rice for mexican rice or to use for salad dressing.
Marinade at least 30 minutes and let come to room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking.
Heat one tablespoon olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium high heat.
Once very hot, add chicken to skillet, then onion and cook undisturbed  3-4 minutes and brown on each side. Cook for approximately 4-6 more minutes (depending on thickness of chicken), or until chicken is cooked through. Once chicken & onion are brown, add can of tomatoes to get golden bits off bottom.  Simmer 5-10 minutes until tomatoes reduce.  Remove chicken from pan, shred and stir back into tomatoes & onion. Ready to add to salad or filling for chicken enchiladas.
