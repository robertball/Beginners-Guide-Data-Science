Ingredients:
3 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups margarine or butter, softened
5 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lemon juice
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup evaporated milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch tube pan.
In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and margarine until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and lemon juice. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; mix into the batter alternating with the milk just until blended. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the crown comes out clean. Cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I searched and searched for this recipe on the web.  Never did find it.  Luckily, I found a scrap of paper with the instructions scribbled on it!  This is the best cake!  Mom used to make it all the time as we were growing up.
