Ingredients:
4 (8 ounce) pork chops
1 lime, juiced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Toss the pork chops with the lime juice in a bowl until evenly covered. Toss with garlic and basil. Season the chops to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside to marinate for 30 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Cook the pork chops on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
