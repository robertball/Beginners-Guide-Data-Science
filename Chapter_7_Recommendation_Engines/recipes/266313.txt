Ingredients:
Pastry:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup cold butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1/4 cup cream cheese
1/4 cup sour cream
Filling:
2 ripe peaches, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
3 1/2 tablespoons white sugar, divided, or more to taste
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1/2 egg, beaten, or as needed

Directions:
Place flour in a medium bowl. Whisk in sugar and salt. Cut in butter using 2 knives or a pastry cutter. Gently work in cream cheese and sour cream until dough is combined.
Turn dough out onto your working surface. Quickly gather crumbs together into a square; fold square in half. Flatten dough out into a larger square using a rolling pin; fold in half again. Roll out one more time and fold into thirds, like a letter. Wrap dough in plastic wrap. Chill until firm, about 1 hour.
Mix peaches, 3 tablespoons sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Let sit for about 15 minutes. Transfer filling mixture into a strainer over a bowl to drain the excess juices for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Roll pastry dough onto a floured surface to about 3/8-inch thickness. Cut out 15 to 20 circles about 4- to 6-inches in diameter. Place 2 teaspoons of filling into the middle of each circle. Fold dough in half over the filling and seal edges together with your fingers. Press edges together with the tines of a fork to make a decorative seal, if desired.
Place empanadas on the prepared baking sheet; brush with egg and sprinkle with remaining sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
