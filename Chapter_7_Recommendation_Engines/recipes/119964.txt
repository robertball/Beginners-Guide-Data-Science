Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) bottle chili sauce
1/3 cup white wine or chicken broth
1/4 cup olive or vegetable oil
10 cloves garlic, minced
4 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
8 chicken thighs

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first seven ingredients; mix well. Remove 1/3 cup for basting; cover and refrigerate. Add chicken to bag; seal and turn to coat. Chill for at least 2 hours.
Drain and discard marinade from chicken. Grill, covered, skin side down, over medium heat for 20 minutes. Baste with some of the reserved marinade. Turn; grill 10 minutes longer or until the chicken juices run clear, basting frequently.
