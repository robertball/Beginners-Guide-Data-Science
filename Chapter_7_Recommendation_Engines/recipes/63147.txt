1/2 pound thick sliced bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
3 Bosc pears, cored and cut into quarters
1 quart water
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until partially cooked but not brown, 5 to 6 minutes; drain on paper towels.
Combine the drained bacon, green beans, and pears in a large saucepan; pour enough water over the mixture to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce the heat to low and simmer until cooked and tender, about 30 minutes.
Remove from the pan to a serving dish with a slotted spoon, draining excess water. Season with salt and pepper to serve.
