Ingredients:
1 large sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 tablespoon water
1 pound ground beef
1 medium onion, chopped
1 can (15 ounces) black beans, rinsed and drained
1 can (10 ounces) enchilada sauce
2 teaspoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
3 flour tortillas (8 inches)
2 cups (8 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a large microwave-safe bowl, combine sweet potato and water. Cover and microwave on high for 4-5 minutes or until potato is almost tender.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the beans, enchilada sauce, chili powder, oregano, cumin and sweet potato; heat through.
Place a flour tortilla in a greased 9-in. deep-dish pie plate; layer with a third of the beef mixture and cheese. Repeat layers twice. Bake at 400Â° for 20-25 minutes or until bubbly.
