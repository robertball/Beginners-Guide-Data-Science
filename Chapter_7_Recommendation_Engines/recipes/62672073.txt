Ingredients:
2.5 cups all purpose flour, sifted
2.5 tsp baking powder
1  tbs sugar
1/2 cup (one stick) cold salted butter, cubed into 1/4" squares
3/4 cup milk
2 eggs
(if you use unsalted butter, add 1/2 tsp of salt to recipe)

Directions:
PREHEAT OVEN TO 400.  Combine flour, baking powder and sugar in a large mixing bowl, mix well with a wire wish to incorporate the baking powder evenly.  Add cubed butter and chop with hand held pastry blender until butter is like small flakes.  Mix well into flour.  Beat one egg and add to milk, pour into flour and mix until all flour is wet.  DO NOT OVER MIX.  The least amount of mixing the better.   I use my hands after the first minute or so, and as soon as the mixture is smooth, STOP.  Lightly flour the counter top and knead no more than 4-6 times.  Flatten out by hand until dough is 1/2 inch thick.  Cut with 2.5 inch biscuit cutter, place on large greased baking pan.  This recipe makes 10 biscuits.  When arranged on pan, make a mixture of 1 egg and 1 tbs milk, beat well, and then brush on to the tops of the biscuits.  Bake for 12-15 minutes, until tops are starting to brown.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
Why buy canned biscuit dough when these are so easy.  From start to oven in about 10 minutes.  Another 15 in the oven and you have a great batch of biscuits in under 30 minutes.  Besides, they are WAY better than canned.
