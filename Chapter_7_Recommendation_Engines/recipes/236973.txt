Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, or more to taste
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (such as KraftÂ®)
2 cups milk
1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; saute garlic until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Lower heat to medium and gradually stir flour into garlic-butter mixture until dissolved and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes.
Gradually stir Parmesan cheese into garlic-flour mixture until cheese is melted and mixture is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly pour milk into cheese mixture, stirring constantly, until smooth, about 5 minutes; season with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until sauce reaches desired consistency, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great quick and easy recipe that your family will love! You may add more Parmesan, garlic, and salt to taste. You can easily add anything you like (i.e. grilled shrimp, chicken, etc.). I also love pouring this sauce over pasta with sauteed peppers.
