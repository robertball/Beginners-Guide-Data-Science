Ingredients:
Dry Rub:
4 pork chops(11/2" thick, bone-in)
1 tbs brown sugar
2 tsp onion powder
1 1/2 tsp baking cocoa (I use Hershey's)
1 1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp ground Chipotle pepper, depending on heat desired
1/4 tsp ground paprika
dash ground cinnamon
dash ground allspice
salt to taste
pepper to taste
Slice lime for garnish
MANGO SALSA:
1 large mango, peeled, pit removed, cubed
juice of 1 fresh lime
1 tbs finely chopped red onion
1 to 2 tsp snipped fresh cilantro
1/4 tsp salt

Directions:
Salt and pepper pork chops to taste. In small bowl, combine dry rub ingredients, rub onto both sides of pork chops. Set aside 30 minutes.
Preheat grill 400 to 450 degrees F. When ready to cook, spray light coat of cooking spray on pork chops to keep them from sticking to the grill. Place on hot grill. Cover; cook for 10 minutes/side.  Let rest for 5 minutes.
Combine all mango salsa ingredients together and serve on side with mole pork chops. And warmed corn tortillas.

Description: 
Chocolate on pork chops? What? Try it! Don't knock it until you try it. If you can't find chipotle peppers, use the canned chipotles in liquid or maybe try another chili pepper of your liking like ceyenne. This is another recipe where you can tweak it all you like! You don't even necessarily have to use a grill, sometimes, I brown the meat on a non stick skillet and it comes out just as good. You can even slice up the meat and stuff it into soft corn tortillas for tacos.
