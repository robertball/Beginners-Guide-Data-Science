Ingredients:
HONEYCOMB CANDY:
5 tablespoons sugar, preferably organic evaporated cane sugar
2 tablespoons wildflower honey, preferably organic
1 teaspoon baking soda
HONEYCOMB ICE CREAM:
3 cups heavy whipping cream, preferably organic
1 (14-oz) can sweetened condensed milk, preferably organic
1 tablespoon vodka
Pinch of salt

Directions:
HONEYCOMB CANDY:
Cook the sugar and honey until the sugar is melted and the mixture has turned a caramel color.
Remove from heat and add the baking soda all at once, quickly stirring to evenly distribute the soda.  Be careful, as the soda will cause the sugar mixture to bubble and increase in volume dramatically.
Pour the honeycomb into a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment and set aside until cooled and hardened, about 30 minutes.
Break the honeycomb into pieces, and store in an airtight container until needed.
HONEYCOMB ICE CREAM:
In a large bowl, whip the cream to soft peaks.
Stir in the condensed milk and whip again to soft peaks, then whisk in the vodka and salt.
Gently fold in the honeycomb, careful not to overmix.
Transfer to a smaller container and put in the freezer until firmed, 1 to 3 hours.

Description: 
The Los Angeles Times' reporter Noelle Carter printed this recipe from the Rustic Canyon in Santa Monica in response to a request from a reader.  You don't need an ice cream maker to finish the dish.  Just stick the dessert in the freezer long enough for it to become firm!
