Ingredients:
DOUGH
1 cup margarine or butter - melted
1 cup whipping cream
1 cup sugar
1 cup milk
3 eggs
¼ tsp peppermint extract
1 tsp salt
1 tsp lemon flavor
dash of cinnamon
3 tbls baking powder
8  9 cups flour (approx  to make a stiff dough for rolling)
Filling (use for all pie choices)
4 eggs  lightly beaten
8 cups light cream
1 ¼ cups white sugar
5 tsp vanilla extract

DOUGH

Dough can be made ahead, even the day before.  Cover with plastic wrap but do not refrigerate.
Freeze individually and then layer with waxed paper in freezer bags or containers.
Makes approximately 15 kuga.
FILLING
Blend together in large bowl until smooth and sugar is dissolved.
ORIGINAL PIES
Fill crust with crumbed bread – approximately ½ cup to fill bottom but not overfill
(Day old white bread works best.  This should be course crumbs / chunks that you prepare yourself, not fine breadcrumbs or packaged dried bread cubes.)
Sprinkle generously & evenly with ½ cup white sugar.
Top with filling (above), approximately ½ cup to moisten all ingredients but not too liquid.  Do not overfill.
Sprinkle generously with cinnamon.
Drizzle with 1 tbls melted butter.
Bake @ 375 on lowest rack in oven for 20 to 22 minutes until golden and filling is set.
COTTAGE CHEESE PIES
Fill crust with ½ - ¾ cup dry curd cottage cheese (I whirl mine in the food processor for a minute or so to chop the cheese curds finer.)
Sprinkle generously & evenly with ½ cup white sugar.
Top with filling (above), approximately ½ cup to moisten all ingredients but not too liquid.  Do not overfill.
Sprinkle generously with cinnamon.
Drizzle with 1 tbls melted butter.
Bake @ 375 on lowest rack in oven for 25 to 30 minutes until golden and filling is set.
VARIATIONS
SWEET:  Add any chopped fruit or berries before the sugar on either the plain or the cottage cheese.  Blueberries, Peaches or Saskatoon Berries are all great choices.  Continue recipe as usual.
SAVORY:  Add chopped green onion tops before the sugar on either the plain or the cottage cheese for a savory choice. Continue recipe as usual.

Description: 
This recipe has passed through generations of my family.  It was created during the depression years when people found a way to make “something out of nothing”.  It still receives rave reviews and calls for the recipe.  My mother handed the recipe to my sister Brenda, who perfected it and taught me so the tradition continues.
The recipe seems long but once your mixtures are ready & oven is heated it moves quickly.  It’s a great reason to get together with your sisters and have a “Kuga-making” day.  
I am not sure where the name Kuga originated but that’s how it’s always been known. ENJOY!
