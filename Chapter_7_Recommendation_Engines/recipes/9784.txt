Ingredients:
1/3 cup shortening
1/3 cup butter
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon milk
1 teaspoon orange zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
25 maraschino cherries, halved

Directions:
In large bowl beat shortening and butter or margarine until butter is softened.     Add the sugar and beat until fluffy.
Add the egg, milk, orange peel, and vanilla and beat until well mixed.  Add flour and baking powder and mix well.
Cover and chill about 30 minutes or until easy to handle.
Shape dough into two 8-inch long rolls.  Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for several hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Cut rolls into 1/4-inch slices.  Place on ungreased cookie sheet.
On the bottom half of each slice, place a cherry for the bell clapper.  Fold in the sides of the slice, overlapping at the top and slightly covering cherry.  Pinch in the sides to form a bell shape.
Bake for 12-14 minutes or until done.  Remove and cool on wire rack.
