Ingredients:
1/2 lb. bacon (10 or more slices)
4 large brown onions, chopped
1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1-1/2 teaspoons dry mustard
1/2 cup cider vinegar
2 cans (1 lb. each) dry butter beans (California limas)
1 can (15-1/2 oz.) green lima beans
1 can (15 oz.) kidney beans
1 can (28 oz.) New England style baked beans
1 can (16 oz.) black beans

Directions:
Fry bacon over medium heat until crisp. Lift, drain on paper towel & crumble.  Set aside.  Discard all but 1/4 cup of the drippings; add onions, separating into rings.  Stir in brown sugar, mustard and vinegar.  Cook over medium heat, string occasionally untl juices are reduced by half and onions are tender(about 10 minutes.
Drain all beans except baked.  Combine in a casserole dish.  Add onion-vinegar mixture and all but 2 teaspoons of the bacon.  Stir gently to blend.  (At this point you may cover and refigerate up to a day).
Bake, covered,in a 350 degree oven until hot and bubbly (1 to 1-1/2 hour).  Garnish with reserved bacon.  (Emily slow-cooks this in a crockpot for hours, until she's ready for them.)
