Ingredients:
1 lb. roasted Hatch green chiles
1/2 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tbl vegetable oil
1 quart chicken or vegetable stock
1/4 cup flour
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a soup pot, heat the oil and saute the onion and garlic until soft.
Rinse the chiles in a colander, removing the charred skin and core.  Chop coarsely, then add to the pot.  Saute a few minutes.
Add the stock.
Sift in the flour, whisking well so it doesn't clump.
Let it come to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer for 20 minutes.
Last, blend with an immersion blender in the pot, or remove small amounts at a time and puree in a blender, being careful of the hot liquid.
Taste and adjust salt and pepper and serve with tortillas.

Description: 
This is what is known in New Mexico as a Bowl of Green.  The heat depends on how hot your chiles are, and fresh late summer Hatch chiles are the best ingredients.  It is easily made with or without meat and the Vegan version loses nothing in terms of flavor.
