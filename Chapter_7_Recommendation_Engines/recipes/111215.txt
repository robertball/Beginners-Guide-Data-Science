Ingredients:
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
1/4 cup prepared yellow mustard
1/3 cup ketchup
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1 pinch dried cilantro
1 pinch dried sage
black pepper to taste
6 pork chops

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk the mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, garlic powder, cayenne, cilantro, sage, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Dip the pork chops into the sauce to coat thickly.  Place chops in a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Bake chops in the preheated oven until the juices run clear, about 50 minutes.
Place a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pan fry the baked chops in the hot skillet, basting chops with sauce from the baking dish. Cook until glazed, about 3 minutes per side.

Description: 
I made these chops for my family and they could not believe I had made the recipe up from the condiments in the fridge. They are spicy, zingy and delicious. The entire family could not stop raving and my nine year old called them marvelous.
