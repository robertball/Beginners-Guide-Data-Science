Ingredients:
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, thickly sliced
6 pounds pork butt roast
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, chopped
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1/2 cup molasses
1/4 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Pour 1 teaspoon olive oil into a slow cooker and arrange sliced onion over oil. Place pork roast over onion.
Cook on Low until pork is very tender, 8 to 9 hours. Transfer roast to a platter and discard onion and liquid. Shred pork with two forks.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a stock pot over medium heat; cook and stir chopped onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shredded pork, tomato paste, molasses, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, balsamic vinegar, salt, and black pepper; stir well. Cover and simmer until sauce is thickened, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.
