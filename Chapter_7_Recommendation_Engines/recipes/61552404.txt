Ingredients:
1 cup white whole wheat flour
2 eggs
1/2 cup milk 1% milk
1/2 cup water
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter, melted
Non-fat plain Greek yogurt
Maple syrup
Blueberries

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.
Warm blueberries in maple syrup and fill crepes with yogurt and blueberry mixture.

Description: 
I love this recipe because it is so simple to make. I have made it healthier by substituting whole wheat flour and 1% milk. I like to fill them with non-fat plain Greek yogurt and blueberries warmed in maple syrup. Yum!Modified from: Basic Crepes
