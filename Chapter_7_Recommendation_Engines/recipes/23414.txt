Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup yellow cornmeal
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, well beaten
1 cup canned unsweetened pumpkin puree
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/4 cup canola oil
1 cup coarsely chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
In a large bowl, stir flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and make a well in the center. In a small bowl, stir together the eggs, pumpkin, sugar, and oil.
Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the egg mixture. Stir just until blended; do not over mix. Fold in pecans. Divide the batter evenly among prepared muffin tin cups.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 18 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean.
