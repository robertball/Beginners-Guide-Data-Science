Ingredients:
1 box lasagna noodles
3 Tbsp olive oil
1 yellow onion, diced
1 green pepper, cubed
4 garlic cloves, diced
1 (12 oz) bag Morning Star Farms crumbles or Boca crumbles
2 (26 oz) jars spaghetti sauce
16 oz. Ricotta cheese
8 oz. shredded mozzarella cheese
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Cook lasagna noodles el dente, according to package instructions.
Heat olive oil over medium heat in a deep skillet.  Add the onion, peppers and garlic.  Cook until soft, stirring occassionally.  Add the crumbles, cook for an additional 3 minutes.  Turn off the heat, and stir in the jars of spaghetti sauce.
Meanwhile, stir together Ricotta cheese and all but a handful of the mozzarella cheese.  Stir in the two eggs.
Spoon approximately 1 cup of the spaghetti sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9 x 13" lasagna dish (enough to coat the bottom of the pan).  Top with a layer of lasagna noodles.  Use 1/3 of the remaining sauce mixture to layer on top of the noodles.  Using half of the cheese mixture, add a layer of cheese.  Continue layering the noodles, the sauce mixture, and the cheese mixture until all the cheese mixture is used; end with the sauce on top.  Take the handful of shredded mozzarella cheese that was saved, and sprinkle it over the top.
Bake, uncovered, for 40 minutes.

Description: 
This vegetarian lasagna smells fragrant from the sauteed onions and peppers, and the taste is out of this world, too!  I frequently serve it when my parents or in-laws come over for dinner, and they never miss the meat!
