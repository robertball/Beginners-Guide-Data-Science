Description: 
Italian-style coffee-flavored gelato. True gelato does not contain eggs and it will melt fairly quickly when removed from the cold. On the plus side, it's far lower in cholesterol than ice cream. It is recommended to eat when ready, but you can store for up to 3 days in an airtight container in the freezer.
