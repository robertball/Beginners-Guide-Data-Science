Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts cut into strips
1 green pepper cut into strips
1 medium onion cut in to rings
FOR MARINADE:
2 tbsp canola oil (or good olive oil)
2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
1-1/2 tsp kosher salt
1-1/2 tsp dried oregano
2 tsp cumin
1 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
FOR SERVING:
Flour tortillas
Shredded cheese (optional)
Light Sour cream

Directions:
Place strips of chicken in a zip lock. Make marinade using ingredients listed and pour over chicken to coat. Let marinade in fridge anywhere from 20 min to 3 hours.
Heat 1tbsp of olive oil in pan on stove top over medium heat. Once oil is nice and hot add green peppers and onions (at this point I add extra seasoning to the veggies that I don't have marked in the ingredient list; about 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp garlic powder). Cook until veggies are soft. Remove veggies from pan. Keep the pan on stove.
Add marinaded chicken to pan and cook for about 4-6 min or until cooked through, stirring often. Add veggies back into pan and for another min.  Remove from pan and serve with tortillas and sour cream and cheese.
