Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup nonfat milk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons applesauce
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Topping:
1/4 cup margarine, melted
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups.
Combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Mix the eggs, milk, oil, applesauce, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture until the batter is just moistened.
Combine the melted margarine or butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and pecans; divide it into each prepared muffin cup. Portion about 1/4 cup muffin batter into each muffin cup, on top of the pecan mixture.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Invert pan onto a piece of aluminum foil; let stand 2 minutes then remove pan.
