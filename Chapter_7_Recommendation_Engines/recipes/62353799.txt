Ingredients:
2 whole medium zucchini
18 tsp butter (for greasing muffin tins)
1/2 c. (1 stick) butter - seriously, use butter ;)
1/2 c. white sugar
2 eggs
1/2 c. molasses (I use the Grandma's brand - it's sweet not bitter)
3 bananas - very ripe (way too ripe to eat)
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
3/4 c. oatmeal
1 3/4 c. whole wheat flour
1 1/2 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1/2 to 1 c. pecan or walnut pieces
1 c. frozen blueberries

Directions:
Finely grate the zucchini and set in a strainer. It should shed about 2 or 3 tbl of liquid.
Very liberally butter 18 muffin pan holes.
Preheat oven to 350.
Combine oats, flour, soda, powder, salt in a bowl and sift together with a fork.
Cream butter with mixer, until it is very light in color.
Add sugar to butter and beat until light and fluffy.
Add molasses and vanilla and beat again.
Add the bananas and beat until the mixture is fairly even and mostly lump free.
Mix in the dry ingredients.
Beat in the pecans.
Stir in the frozen blueberries.
Divide batter into 18 muffin pan spaces.
Bake 35 minutes, or until sides begin to pull away from the pan and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let muffins cool in the pans on wire racks for 10-15 minutes before turning out.

Description: 
This muffin is a variation on a very traditional Southern banana bread. For a low-fat version substitute applesauce for the butter in the mix, but don't skimp on the butter in the pan!
