Ingredients:
3 tablespoons canola oil
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, pounded 1/2-inch thick
salt and pepper to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 onions, sliced
1/2 cup white wine
1/2 cup chicken stock
3/4 cup heavy cream
1 1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour

Directions:
Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the chicken breasts with salt and black pepper. Arrange the chicken in the skillet and pan fry until golden brown, no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer the chicken to a large platter, and cover with aluminum foil.
Return the skillet to the stove and reduce heat to medium. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the white wine and scrape up any brown bits from the skillet with a spatula. Add the chicken stock, and continue to cook and stir until the liquid has reduced, about 5 minutes. Stir in the heavy cream and flour; cook and stir until thickened. Top the chicken with the sauce before serving.
