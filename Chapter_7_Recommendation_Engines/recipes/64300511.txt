Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
1/4 cup ground flaxseed
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup orange juice
2 eggs
1/3 cup sunflower oil
2 tablespoons honey
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
Zest of 1 orange

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, flaxseed, baking soda, salt and orange zest together in a small bowl.
Beat orange juice, eggs, sunflower oil, and honey together in a large bowl until smooth. Stir flour mixture into the orange juice mixture just until the dry ingredients are moistened completely. Fold walnuts through the batter. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
