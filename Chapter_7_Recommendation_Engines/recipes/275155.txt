Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package Neufchatel cheese, softened
3 tablespoons low-fat milk
1 tablespoon light mayonnaise
2 slices onion, minced
1/2 stalk celery, finely chopped
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon yellow mustard
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®), or to taste
1/2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1 pinch seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
8 ounces cooked crab claw meat, drained
2 sprigs fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place Neufchatel cheese in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Heat until cheese softens to a creamy consistency, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and mayonnaise, reduce heat to low, and stir until blended. Add onion, celery, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and seafood seasoning; stir frequently until onion has softened slightly, 5 to 6 minutes.
Transfer cheese sauce into a ceramic or glass baking dish. Mix in all but a small handful of mozzarella cheese. Carefully fold crabmeat into the dip, making sure it's evenly distributed. Top with remaining mozzarella and sprinkle with additional seafood seasoning.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.

Description: 
This is a skinnier version of classic Maryland crab dip. We tend to use crab dip as a condiment in Maryland, we put it on anything! Try using veggies instead of bread to dip to keep the calories down. This is a great way to use up those loose crab claws!
