Ingredients:
2 pounds green tomatoes, chopped
1 pound cauliflower, chopped
1 1/2 pounds onions, chopped
2 1/2 pounds brown sugar
3 cups distilled white vinegar
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric
2 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard powder
2 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 cup distilled white vinegar

Directions:
Place the tomatoes, cauliflower, onion, sugar, and 3 cups of vinegar into a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir until the sugar has dissolved, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir the flour, turmeric, mustard, curry, nutmeg, clove, and ginger together in a bowl. Stir in the remaining cup of vinegar to create a thin paste. Blend this mixture into the simmering tomatoes. Cook and stir until the mixture thickens, then simmer an additional 10 minutes. Cool completely and store in the refrigerator.
