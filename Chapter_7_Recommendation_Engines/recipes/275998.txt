Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
1/3 cup finely chopped pecans, toasted

Directions:
Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit an air fryer basket.
Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add brown sugar, white sugar, baking soda, and salt; beat on medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Beat in egg and vanilla extract until combined. Add flour, beating in as much as you can. Stir in any remaining flour, chocolate chips, and pecans.
Drop dough by teaspoonfuls 1 inch apart onto the parchment paper. Carefully transfer the parchment paper to the air fryer basket.
Turn the air fryer to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and cook until golden brown and set, about 8 minutes. Remove parchment paper to a wire rack to cool. Repeat with remaining cookie dough.
