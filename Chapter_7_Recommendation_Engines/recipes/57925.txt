Description: 
Being from New Orleans, and being a true 'Cajun cook' I create a lot of my own recipes simply by experimenting.  This dip recipe came to me when I decided that adding crab boil to almost anything will make it taste incredible.  Everyone that tastes it agrees! It's best when prepared a day ahead of time and reheated. Serve with chicken flavored crackers.
