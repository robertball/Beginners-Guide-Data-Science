Ingredients:
1-2 lbs chicken breast - cubed
1/2 onion - sliced
1 tbsp minced garlic (I use the jar variety)
1 head broccoli - cut up
1 large (or 2 small) yellow zucchini squash - diced
2 stalks celery - diced
2 handfuls shredded carrots
2 medium hot peppers - diced (optional)
2 cans coconut milk
1 cup water
3 tbsp red curry paste
2 tbsp ground cardamon
1 tbsp garam masala
1 tbsp cumin
2 tsp  cinnamon
Coconut oil
Salt/Pepper to taste

Directions:
Brown the cubed chicken in coconut oil, along with sliced onions and minced garlic.
While browning the cubed chicken, mix red curry paste in some of the coconut milk, just to blend it well.  Add to crockpot, along with rest of coconut milk and water.
Add all vegetables and seasonings to crockpot, and stir well.  Add cubed chicken mix to crockpot, salt and pepper to taste.
Cook on High for 4 hours, or Low for 6 hours. It smells like Heaven, and serves approximately 6, as a soup/stew type of dish.

Description: 
This is how we clean out the vegetable bin!  You can add pretty much any veggies that you like.  We've made this with shrimp vs chicken, added apples, used spinach and zucchini ... have fun!  Also, the seasoning quantities are on the light side.  If you like your seasonings as we do ... double them!  It's the seasonings and coconut milk that make it :-)
