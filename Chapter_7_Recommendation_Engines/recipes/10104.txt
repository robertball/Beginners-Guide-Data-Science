Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 cup milk
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
1 teaspoon salt
5 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1 (12 ounce) can poppyseed filling
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon cold water

Directions:
Soften yeast in 1/4 cup warm water.  Heat milk, sugar, butter or margarine and salt until the sugar dissolves; cool to lukewarm.  Stir in 2 eggs.  Stir in yeast mixture and 2 cups of the flour, beat well.  Stir in enough of the rest of the flour to make a moderately stiff dough.
Knead on floured surface till smooth, and shape into a ball.  Place dough into a greased  bowl  and cover with a towel.  Let rise until doubled, then divide in half.
To make Filling:  Combine the poppy seeds with the lemon peel and lemon juice and mix well.  Set aside.
Roll each half of the risen dough into a 17 x 12 inch rectangle.  Cut into 4 inch circles.  Put about 1/2 Tablespoon of the filling on each circle.  Moisten the edges, bring the sides together and pinch, forming a triangle.  Place on a greased cookie sheet and cover.  Let the dough rise again until doubled.
Brush with egg yolk mixed with water, then bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for  15 to 20 minutes.
