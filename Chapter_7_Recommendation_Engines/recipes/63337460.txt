Ingredients:
Rack of Pork Ribs
Your favorite dry rub
Your favorite BBQ Sauce

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 425.  Line a large cookie sheet with aluminum foil.  Wash ribs and lay backside up on paper towels.
At one end of the rack, using your finger or a sharp knife, loosen membrane from bone slightly. Grasp with a paper towel, "peel" off and discard.
Dry ribs to remove remaining moisture.  Season liberally with dry rub, patting it firmly into the rib.  Place, bone side down on cookie sheet using center rack, in hot oven. Cook 15 minutes at 425 then lower heat to 325, cook another hour, turn once.
Remove ribs from oven and pour off pan juices.  Apply BBQ sauce, liberally to all sides and put back into the oven, bone side down. Crank oven up to 350 and continue cooking an additional 20 minutes.  Remove ribs from oven and let rest 10 minutes before serving.
