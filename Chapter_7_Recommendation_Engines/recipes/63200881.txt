Ingredients:
This is enough marinade for 8 chicken thighs.
1 large onion, quartered
2 large cloves garlic, or more to taste
1 jalapeño or scotch bonnet pepper, sliced and quartered (I use 5 slices jarred jalapeños)
2/3 cup low sodium soy sauce (I use Braggs liquid Aminos)
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
3/4 cups brown sugar
1.5 teaspoons (heaping) ground black pepper
3/4 teaspoons (heaping) ground cloves
3/4 teaspoons (heaping) ground ground ginger
3/4 teaspoons (heaping) ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoons (heaping) ground thyme (I used thyme leaves by accident)

Directions:
Process onion, garlic, jalapeño, soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, pepper, cloves, ginger, cinnamon and thyme in food processor or blender until smooth.
Marinade over meat for at least one hour (5-6 hours or overnight is best).
For lamb shoulder or arm steak, bake at 350 for 40 minutes.
For chicken wings, bake at 350.
For boneless skinless chicken thighs, grill on indirect medium heat for around 40 minutes.
