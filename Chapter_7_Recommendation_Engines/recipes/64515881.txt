Description: 
This recipe has been passed down from my grandmother, who was born in the southern part of Germany.  It is a great bring-along to a covered dish since it does not require refrigeration and can be served at room temperature.  It is also wonderful the next day, heated in a skillet or the oven and served for breakfast.  Enjoy.
