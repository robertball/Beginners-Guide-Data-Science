Ingredients:
2 lbs. cubed chicken, shrimp, or crawfish, etc.
Pasta of your choice
1 packet white or country gravy mix
1-2 cups water
1 packet of onion soup mix
1 lb velveeta, in slices
Frozen Broccoli - optional

Directions:
Start your pasta.
In a wok or large skillet add some olive oil and your meat and broccoli. Cook through.
Sprinkle your onion soup mix on the meat and veggies - continue stirring it.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl stir your gravy mix in with about a cup to a cup and a half of water.
Your water for the pasta ought to be boiling about now, so go ahead and throw your pasta in and set the timer for it.
Once the meat is cooked, pour your gravy mix/water into the wok. Once everything's boiling, place your velveeta slices around the wok. Turn the heat down to about medium and keep stirring the sauce until the velveeta melts in. Stir constantly - cheese, even velveeta, is bad about sticking and giving you a tough brown skin on the bottom of the pot if you don't watch it.
Your pasta ought to be ready about the time the velveeta is melted into your sauce. Drain the pasta, remove sauce from heat. Serve.

This recipe is just something I came up with the other night.  I needed to go to the grocery store in the worst way and so I raided odd items from my pantry.  It came out really delicious, though.  Super quick and easy!
