Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package chopped frozen broccoli, thawed
1 (6 ounce) package chicken flavored dry stuffing mix
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese
1 medium onion, chopped
6 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Place broccoli in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover. Cover, and bring to a boil. Cook 5 minutes. Uncover, and continue cooking 2 to 3 minutes, until tender. Remove from heat, drain, and cool.
In a large bowl, mix broccoli, stuffing mix, Parmesan cheese, onion, eggs, margarine, pepper, and garlic salt. Cover, and chill in the refrigerator approximately 1 hour, until moisture has been absorbed.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Roll the chilled mixture into 1 inch balls, and arrange on a medium baking sheet.
Bake 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until browned.
