Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
2 eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1/2 Tbsp vanilla
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup butter or margarine, cubed

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the dry cake mix, eggs and oil and vanilla. With floured hands, press two-thirds of the mixture into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan.  Set remaining cake mixture aside.
In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the milk, chocolate chips and butter. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 45 seconds; stir.  Microwave 45-60 seconds longer or until chips and butter are melted; stir until smooth. Pour over crust.
Drop by teaspoonfuls of remaining cake mixture over top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool before cutting.
