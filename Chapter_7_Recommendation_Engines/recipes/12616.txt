Ingredients:
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
4 cups elderberries
1 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix cornstarch in a little bit of water and add to berries and sugar. Cook, stirring constantly until desired thickness.  Add more cornstarch if not thick enough. Add lemon juice.
Pour into bottom crust. Dot with butter. Put on top crust or make a lattice.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) until browned and berries are bubbling through holes in the crust, approximately 40 minutes.
Note: It is a good idea to put a pan or foil under the pie as it bakes since it might bubble over.

Description: 
This is my favorite fruit pie of all.  Wish I could find the berries in our area. Tapioca can be used in place of cornstarch if desired.
