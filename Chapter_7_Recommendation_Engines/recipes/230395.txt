Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (16 ounce) package yolk-free egg noodles
1 (16 ounce) container low-fat sour cream
1 (16 ounce) container low-fat cottage cheese
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple in juice, undrained
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup orange juice
1/2 cup dried cranberries
5 tablespoons butter, melted
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup applesauce
1/2 orange, zested
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Gently stir egg noodles, sour cream, cottage cheese, pineapple with juice, eggs, orange juice, cranberries, melted butter, sugar, applesauce, orange zest, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Spoon the noodle mixture into prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until kugel is set and browned on top, 60 to 75 minutes.

Description: 
This noodle kugel is a sweet casserole that feels like comfort food (especially if you are of Jewish heritage) yet is low fat and lower sugar than the average sweet kugel. I use the low-fat dairy and egg substitute to give it a richer flavor, but it tastes great made with nonfat ingredients as well. Enjoy! I developed it in honor of my beloved Grandma Sylvia.
