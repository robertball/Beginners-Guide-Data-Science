Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1 3/4 cups pureed strawberries
3/4 cup vegetable oil
4 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups self-rising flour
3 drops red food coloring, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Beat sugar, pureed strawberries, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Add flour, mixing until just incorporated. Stir food coloring into strawberry batter until color is even. Divide batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

A great strawberry cake recipe that I use for cupcakes. I use the cream cheese icing from this site as a topper. Top with blueberries for a 4th of July theme. Endless possibilities.
