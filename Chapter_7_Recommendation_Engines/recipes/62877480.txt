Ingredients:
2 heaping tbs tomato paste
2 cups water
3 Tbs olive oil
4 Skinless/Boneless chicken breasts, pounded 1/4" thin
1 medium onion, diced
1 red pepper, diced
5 cloves garlic, crushed
2 tbs red wine
2 tsp oregano
1 1/2 tsp basil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Whisk the water into tomato paste until well-combined and thin, set aside.
Heat 2 tbs oil in a large s/s skillet then saute the chicken, turning when it releases easily, about 6 minutes. Brown the other side, about 4 minutes.
While the chicken browns, heat the remaining oil in a medium s/s skillet over medium-high heat, then saute the onion and red pepper until lightly browned. Add garlic, continue sauteing for another 30 seconds. Transfer to bowl.
Deglaze skillet with red wine and 1/2 cup tomato sauce, pour wine/sauce over onion mix in bowl.
When chicken is done, transfer to a plate. Deglaze chicken skillet with remaining tomato sauce, stir in oregano and basil. Return the chicken to the skillet, spoon onion mix over the chicken and bake in oven for 20 minutes.  Serve with rice.

Description: 
I cobbled this together from several other recipes here on AR. I use stainless steel skillets in order to develop fond in both the onion/pepper pan and the chicken pan. Dicing the onion and red pepper turns the sauce into a hot salsa that my husband loves.
