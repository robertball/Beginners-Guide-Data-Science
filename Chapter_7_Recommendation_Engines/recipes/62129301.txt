Ingredients:
1/2 cup cooked rice
1 cup frozen spinach
1/2 cup Parmesan (or mild/salty cheese)
1 cup milk (I used 1%)
1/3 chicken bullion cube (or to taste)
Pepper
1 Chicken breast or cutlet
2 tsp Mustard (I used Trader Joe's mustard aioli)
1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup bread crumbs, crushed crackers or cereal
Spices to taste (salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, etc)

Directions:
Microwave spinach and rice together covered for one minute.
Add 1/4 of the milk, sprinkle half the cheese on top, stir and microwave again for 30-40 seconds.
Add more milk, the rest of the cheese, boullion, stir, microwave again for 30-40 seconds.
Microwave and stir in increments until most of the liquid has absorbed. Set aside, covered.
Mix the flour with the spices and pour onto a plate. Put the mustard and bread crumbs on separate plates.
Cut chicken into cubes, coat with flour mixture, coat with mustard, then coat with bread crumbs.
Using a non stick spray on medium heat cook/stir chicken in a pan until the outside turns golden-dark brown.
Eat with the rice.
