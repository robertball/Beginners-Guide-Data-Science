Ingredients:
3 cups Brown Sugar (I used light brown)
1 cup Milk (I used regular whole milk)
2 tbsp Butter (salted or unsalted)
1.5 tsp Vanilla
1 cup sliced Almonds (original recipe called for Pecans but I didn't have any)

Directions:
Place sugar and milk in medium saucepan and heat slowly, stirring until sugar is dissolved; then boil, without stirring, until mixture forms a soft ball (I used a candy thermometer until it reached 236 degrees) when tested in cold water.
Removed from fire, add butter; cool to lukewarm, then beat until thick and creamy; add vanilla and nuts and mix thoroughly.
Pour into buttered pans and when cold, cut into squares.

Description: 
This came to me from my Great-grandmother's Purity cook book published in 1936.  It is a simple, quick and delicious candy that I made for gifts along with my Mom's Chocolate Fudge (see my other personal recipe).  Enjoy!
