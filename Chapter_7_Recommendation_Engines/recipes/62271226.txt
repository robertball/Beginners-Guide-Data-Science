Ingredients:
1 to 2 lbs. of ground lean beef
2 medium yellow onions
1 package of taco seasoning mix
3 tablespoons of cilantro
1 1 litre/1 quart jug or 2 large jars of chunky salsa (hot or mild)
1 box of oven-ready lasagna noodles
1 can of beans (red, black -- whichever you prefer)
1 big bag of shredded mozzerella
1 jar of salsa verde

Directions:
In a frying pan, cook 1 to 2 lbs of beef with sliced onions and taco seasoning mix. Add cilantro. Cook until beef is crumbly.
In a large rectangular pyrex dish, coat bottom with red chunky salsa (this will help the oven-ready lasagna noodles cook better). Line the bottom of the pan with oven-ready lasagna noodles.
Add layer of salsa to coat layer of noodles. Add layer of beans.
Add layer of cooked beef mixture, then add generous layer of shredded mozzerella.
Add another layer of lasagna noodles, then coat the noodles with some salsa verde.
Add another layer of beef mixture, then add another generous layer of mozzerella.
Place final layer of lasagna noodles, then add a generous layer of salsa to coat the noodles. Top with a final layer of mozzerella.
Cover dish with tin foil and bake in oven about 35 minutes at 375 degrees. Remove foil and bake another 10 to 15 minutes -- until cheese turns golden brown on top. Let cool on stove top for 15 minutes before serving.
