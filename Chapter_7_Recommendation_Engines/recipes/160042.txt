Ingredients:
1 canned chipotle pepper in adobo sauce
2 tablespoons adobo sauce from the can
1/4 cup salsa
1 tablespoon lime juice
4 tilapia fillets
1/2 (8 ounce) package tortilla chips, crushed
1 small avocado - peeled, pitted, and cut into large chunks
1/4 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon lime juice
3 tablespoons milk
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Combine the chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, salsa, and 1 tablespoon lime juice in a blender and blend until smooth; brush the mixture over both sides of each tilapia fillet.
Spread the crushed tortilla chips into the bottom of a deep dish; dredge the coated fillets in the chips to coat. Arrange the fillets on the prepared baking pan.
Bake the fillets 15 minutes; turn and lightly spray with cooking spray. Continue to bake until golden brown, another 10 to 15 minutes.
While the fish bakes, place the avocado, sour cream, and 1 tablespoon lime juice and blend until smooth. Stir in the milk 1 tablespoon at a time until the consistency is similar to ranch dressing. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon the sauce over the baked fillets to serve.

Description: 
My husband loves this zesty Southwestern-style fish. You can make it with any of firm whitefish--like cod or halibut--if tilapia isn't available. You can even use boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I usually make a package of red or black beans with rice to serve with it while the fish cooks. If you have any leftovers, they make great fish tacos.
