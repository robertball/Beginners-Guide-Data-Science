Ingredients:
2 1/2 cp Flour - All Purpose
1/2 cp Flour  - For finishing and handling dough
2 tsp salt
1 tbsp. Coconut Oil
1 cp warm water (110 - 120 deg)
2 tsp Active Dry Yeast

Directions:
Combine yeast and hot water and set aside
Add flour and salt to processor bowl.
Using the S-Blade or Dough Blade (if available) Pulse a few times
Begin adding the yeast mixture to the flour and pulse to begin combining.
Once it's become formed, add the coconut oil
Mix in short intervals (adding a tsp at a time) until dough forms a smooth and mildly sticky ball.
Turn out and knead a few times and form into a ball. It should no longer be sticky and feel soft and pliable.
Place in a floured or lightly greased bowl and cover
Set aside for 1 hour to double in size.
Turn out dough, cut into 8-10 pieces (depending on size you want)
Roll out pieces,  turning over frequently making sure to dust enough flour so it does not stick to rolling pin.
Roll out to a thickness of about 1/4 " (again, that is YOUR choice)
Heat skillet to med-hi and simply brown on each side.
If you want pockets, you will need the higher end of heat and a heavy (preferably cast-iron) skillet.
If you want "gyro shop" style just cook on each side till it reaches your desired color.
Store cooked pitas in ziplock for a few day.
Prepared dough good for about a week, stored in refrigerator.  Allow to return to room temp before rolling out.

Description: 
Once you've made these, you will NEVER buy commercial again.  Serve these fresh off the griddle or re-heat them later to enjoy a pita like you can only get when it's made at home from scratch.
