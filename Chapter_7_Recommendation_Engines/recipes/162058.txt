Ingredients:
1/4 pound bacon, minced
1 1/2 cups fresh sugar snap peas
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon turbinado sugar, such as Sugar in the Raw
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook the minced bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the fat has rendered out and the bacon has begun to crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside, leave the bacon fat in the skillet. Add the sugar snap peas, and toss to coat with the fat. Cook and stir until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Pour in the balsamic vinegar, sugar, and cooked bacon. Continue cooking until the balsamic has reduced, and the sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
