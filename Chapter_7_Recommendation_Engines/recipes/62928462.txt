1 tablespoon water
3 to 4 cups cooked bowtie pasta

Directions:
Boil water for pasta.  Add in pasta and cook for about 10 minutes while the vegetables cook.
In a non-stick skillet with a small amount of oil on medium-high heat, cook onions, mushrooms, peppers and peas until al dente, about 10 minutes.  Add in tomato soup and soup can of water and season with salt and pepper.  Add in basil (rub between palms to release flavours).
In small glass, mix together cornstarch and water.  Stir well into pan.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce thickens to desired consistency.  Turn off heat and stir in pasta to combine.
