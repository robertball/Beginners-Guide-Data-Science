Ingredients:
2/3 cup raisins
1 cup hot water
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup cold butter, cut into pieces
1 cup milk
1 egg
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Soak raisins in water for 10 minutes; drain and set aside. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl. Cut in the butter with a knife or pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir milk into the flour mixture until moistened. Add the drained raisins. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll the dough out into a 3/4 to 1-inch thick round. Cut dough with a biscuit cutter and place onto the prepared baking sheet. Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. Brush egg mixture on each biscuit.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
Moist, lightly sweet biscuits are just perfect for breakfast or a cup of tea in the afternoon.  This is as close as I could get to the store bakery version. My husband and kids loved these just as much as the store bought biscuits.  We make a lactose free version with vanilla soy milk  and margarine, but have made the milk variety for others.  Recipe works perfectly in both options.
