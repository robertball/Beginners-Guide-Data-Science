Ingredients:
Stew:
1/4 cup butter
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth
2 tablespoons poultry seasoning
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
2 (10.5 ounce) cans cream of chicken soup
2 cups chopped cooked turkey
2 cups chopped cooked carrots
1 cup turkey gravy
1 cup frozen peas
2 stalks celery, chopped
cooking spray
Dumplings:
2 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup shortening
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Melt butter in a pot over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Whisk in 1/4 cup flour gradually. Pour in chicken broth slowly; add poultry seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt, and pepper. Whisk in cream of chicken of soup; bring to a boil.
Stir turkey, carrots, turkey gravy, peas, and celery. Reduce heat to low; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a large casserole dish with cooking spray.
Pour turkey mixture into the prepared dish.
Place 2 cups flour, milk, shortening, baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender. Blend until mixture forms a ball, adding pinches of flour if too doughy. Roll dough into small balls by hand; place balls 1/2-inch apart on top of the turkey mixture.
Bake until top is lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Let cool until dumplings are set, 5 to 10 minutes.
