Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package beef ramen noodles
2 cups boiling water
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
3 tablespoons granular no-calorie sucralose sweetener (e.g., Splenda Â®)
1 (16 ounce) bag coleslaw mix
6 green onions, chopped
1/2 cup sunflower seeds

Directions:
Place ramen noodles in colander; break into quarters.  Pour boiling water over noodles to soften slightly.  Use a fork to separate noodles.  Rinse quickly with cold water; drain.
Make a dressing by whisking together the flavor packet from the ramen noodles, olive oil, vinegar, and sweetener in a bowl. Place the ramen noodles, coleslaw mix, green onions, and sunflower seeds in a large bowl; toss to combine. Drizzle dressing over the coleslaw mixture and continue to toss until entire mixture is coated with dressing. Chill for 2 hours before serving.

Description: 
This Asian coleslaw is lightened up a bit by using only 3 tablespoons of olive oil and a sugar alternative like Splenda to make this kid friendly, flavorful crunchy salad.  Try it with white or balsamic vinegar, too.
