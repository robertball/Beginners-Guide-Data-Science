Description: 
This is a traditional South American chocolate drink, but to market it well I made it hot chocolate, even though in the old days, South Americans didn't drink it hot. The recipe uses chili powder, and I used red bell pepper to match the sweetness of the chocolate. This is a good way to bring an old recipe into today.
