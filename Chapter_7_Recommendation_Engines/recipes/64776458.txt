Ingredients:
6 ounces grated carrots
3.5 ounces raw cane sugar
1.75 ounces almond meal
5.3 ounces buckwheat flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp ground cinnamon
2 eggs
1/4 vegetable oil
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup whole milk
1/4 tsp vanilla extract
6 tbsp finely chopped raw almonds

Directions:
Line a 12-well muffin tin with 12 liners. Preheat oven to 355°F.
Mix the grated carrots with the sugar. Set aside. This will allow the carrot to release its liquid, which helps create a soft texture.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, buckwheat flour, baking powder, and cinnamon. In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, oil, unsweetened applesauce, milk, and vanilla extract.
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Fold in the carrot/sugar mixture. Pour approximately 1/4 cup batter into each muffin well. Top with 1/2 tsp chopped almonds. Bake at 355° until the tops have slightly browned and a toothpick comes out clean. About 20-23 minutes Turn off the oven. Leave the muffins in the oven without opening the door for 5 minutes. Remove and cool on a wire rack before serving.
