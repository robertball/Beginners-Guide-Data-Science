Ingredients:
2 cups cranberry juice
3/4 cup grape juice
1 (2 ounce) package dry pectin
3 1/4 cups white sugar

Directions:
Pour the cranberry and grape juices into a heavy pot. Add the pectin and stir until dissolved. Bring the juice mixture to a full rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the sugar, and return to a full boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat, and skim off any foam. Pour jelly into hot, sterilized jars, leaving 1/4 inch headroom. Adjust lids. Process for 10 minutes in a boiling-water bath.
