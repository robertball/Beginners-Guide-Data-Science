Image:

Ingredients:
2lbs cube steak, beef or venison
1.5 cups flour, separated
2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp black pepper
2 tsp salt
Cooking spray
3 large yellow onions, sliced
2 cups sliced mushrooms
1 quart low sodium beef broth

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.
Mix 1 cup flour, cumin, pepper and salt, set aside.
Put sliced onions and mushrooms in bottom of sprayed 13 x 9 x 2 glass casserole dish, completely covering the bottom. (this prevents the steak from sticking to the bottom and browning too rapidly)
Dredge cube steak through flour mix and arrange on top of onions and mushrooms in single layer.
Put 1/2 cup of flour into 4 cup glass measuring cup and whisk in the broth until smooth. You can add some of the same spices that you used in the flour at this point to get a more savory gravy.
Carefully pour the broth mix over the steaks, being careful not to blast the flour off of them.
Cover with aluminum foil and place in middle of large cookie sheet to catch any drips.
Cook at 375 in center of oven for 45 minutes to an hour or until meat is done and gravy is thick.
I usually serve this with either rice or mashed potatoes.

Description: 
We try to avoid fried foods so I wanted to come up with a cube steak recipe that could be baked and I came up with this. You can use venison instead of beef with the same results, I have many times! You can substitute spices in this to whatever you like with beef, I have used steak seasoning with good results, also.
