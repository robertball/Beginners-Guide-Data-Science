Ingredients:
1 pound fresh tuna fillet
1/2 pound fresh salmon fillet
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon purchased pickled ginger, finely chopped
1 tablespoon chili sauce
2 teaspoons wasabi paste
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
6 soft flatbreads, such as Afghan bread, naan, lefsa, or split rolls
Yellow tomato slices (optional)
Aquavit Green Cabbage Slaw:
1/2 cup plain low-fat yogurt
1 clove garlic, chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 cups finely shredded Napa cabbage

Directions:
Finely chop the tuna and salmon. In a large mixing bowl combine tuna and salmon with cilantro, lime juice, garlic, 4 teaspoons of the extra-virgin olive oil, the ginger, chili sauce, wasabi, salt, and pepper. Shape into 6 patties about 3/4 inch thick.
Place burger patties on the lightly oiled rack of the grill directly over medium heat. Grill for 10 to 12 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in centers registers 160  degrees F, turning burgers once halfway through grilling. Brush the flatbread with remaining olive oil. Toast on grill rack for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden brown.
Serve burgers folded in flatbread and topped with Aquavit Green Cabbage Slaw and, if desired, yellow tomato slices.
