Ingredients:
2 slices bread, torn into bite size pieces
1 egg, beaten
1 pound ground beef chuck
1 pound ground beef sirloin
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup steak seasoning sauce (such as Dale's Steak SeasoningÂ®)
3 tablespoons hot pepper sauce
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 (18 ounce) bottle barbeque sauce

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Place the torn-up bread into a large bowl, and mix with the egg. Lightly mix in the ground chuck, ground sirloin, onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, steak seasoning sauce, hot sauce, and salt and pepper. Form the meat mixture into 6 large patties, 6 inches across by 1 inch thick.
Place the burgers on the preheated grill, and cook 10 to 15 minutes per side, until the burgers are browned and no longer pink in the middle. Brush each burger with barbecue sauce, flip them and grill for 5 minutes to slightly char the sauce. Brush the other sides with sauce, flip, and grill for 5 more minutes to cook the other side.

Description: 
These burgers got their name from their colossal size. They are absolutely delicious! My family makes them at almost every game day cookout. Top with desired toppings (lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheese, onion, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, if desired) and serve on sesame buns.
