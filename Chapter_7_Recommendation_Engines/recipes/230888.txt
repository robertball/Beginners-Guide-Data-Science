Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 (1/2 inch thick) pork chops
1 cup white rice
1 large tomato, thinly sliced
1 green bell pepper, cut into thin strips
1 onion, cut into rings
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
salt and pepper to taste
2 (10.5 ounce) cans beef consomme

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear pork chops until browned on each side, about 3 minutes per side.
Pour rice into prepared baking dish. Layer half the tomato slices, bell pepper strips, and onion slices onto rice. Top with 2 pork chops. Add remaining tomatoes, peppers, and onions in layers; top with remaining 2 chops. Sprinkle with marjoram, thyme, salt, and black pepper to taste. Pour consomme into the baking dish; cover.
Bake in preheated oven until rice and vegetables are tender and pork is cooked through, about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
