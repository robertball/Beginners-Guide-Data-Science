Pumpkin Truffles II Recipe

Ingredients:
•	2 1/2 c crushed vanilla wafers
•	1 c ground almonds
-       1 tsp vanilla
•	2/3 c sifted powdered sugar
•	2 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
•	2/3 c LIBBY'S® 100% Pure Pumpkin
•	1/3 c apple juice (or cider for more spice)
At least 2 bags of semi-sweet chocolate morsels

Directions:
You will definitely need a food processor for this recipe.
Crush/grind the vanilla wafers into a fine powder and measure out the 2 1/2 cups.
Grind the almonds as fine as you can and measure out 1 cup.
Combine the vanilla wafers, almonds, pumpkin pie spice, and powdered sugar.
Lightly mix the dry ingredients.
Add vanilla, pumpkin, and apple juice/cider. Mix well.
Use a melon baller or a cookie scoop (be sure to lightly spray the scoop with non-stick spray) and form into 1" balls.
Place balls on a foil covered (spray with non-stick spray) rack, cover with plastic wrap, and put in freezer (works better) or fridge to harden.
Once hardened, use a double boiler to start melting the chocolate (add 1 tsp oil to make a smoother chocolate and prevent it from burning).
Once chocolate is melted, remove pumpkin centers from fridge or freezer, use a fork (a fondue fork worked fairly well to pierce the centers) and cover each center in chocolate.
Put the truffles back onto the covered racks and put back in the fridge to harden and dry the chocolate.
Enjoy!

Description: 
This is a recipe with personal rave reviews on pumpkin truffles by using some basics from the Rich Chocolate Pumpkin Truffles. My main goal was to make these like Godiva's Pumpkin Truffles, and they are pretty close. This is a fairly easy recipe, and it always turns out great.
