Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups potato starch
1 cup almond flour
1 cup sorghum flour
1/2 cup tapioca starch
2 tablespoons baking powder
2 teaspoons xanthan gum
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups water, or more as needed
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
Sift potato starch, almond flour, sorghum flour, tapioca starch, baking powder, xanthan gum, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl; whisk until well combined.
Whisk water, olive oil, honey, and apple cider vinegar in a small bowl.
Pour honey mixture into flour mixture; stir briefly with a wooden spoon until batter is very thick and evenly mixed. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed.
Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan; spray top lightly with cooking spray. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake until top is brown, about 10 minutes more. Cool in pan briefly, before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
