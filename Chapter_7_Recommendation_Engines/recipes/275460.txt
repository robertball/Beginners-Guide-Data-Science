Ingredients:
2 large potatoes, peeled and sliced
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 zucchini, sliced
1 large onion, finely chopped
8 eggs
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add potatoes and boil for 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Heat oil in a deep cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini and onion; saute until golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Add drained potatoes and stir gently to incorporate.
Beat eggs in a bowl with oregano, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Pour egg mixture into the skillet until evenly distributed; stir gently with a fork. Cook until eggs are set, 5 to 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Transfer skillet into the broiler and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes.
