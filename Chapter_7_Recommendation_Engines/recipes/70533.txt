Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) round Brie cheese
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated crescent roll dough
1 1/2 cups honey
1 1/2 cups pecan halves

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Unwrap the wheel of Brie, and crescent rolls.
Unroll the crescent roll dough, and wrap around the Brie. Press seams together to seal in the cheese. Place in a 9x9 inch baking dish. Sprinkle pecan halves over the top, and drizzle honey over the whole thing.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown and cheese is soft. Serve with apple slices or cornbread crackers.

Description: 
Better titled as 'Bedroom Brie'! This is our favorite food after the kids have gone to sleep. A wheel of Brie is wrapped in pastry, then topped with pecans and honey, and baked to golden perfection. Best paired with a Sauvignon Blanc.
