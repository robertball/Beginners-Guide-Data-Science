3/4 cup brown sugar
1 orange, zested and juiced

Directions:
Boil sweet potatoes until tender.
Peel and mash until more or less lumpless. Add brown sugar, orange juice and zest, bourbon, butter or margarine, and pumpkin pie spice. Mix well. Spread in shallow dish (10 inch deep dish pie plate works well).

Description: 
Sweet potatoes with orange and bourbon. I use 1/2 cup sugar but if you prefer candied sweet potatoes, use the whole cup. Orange juice can be substituted for the bourbon if you are serving to small children. Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com.
