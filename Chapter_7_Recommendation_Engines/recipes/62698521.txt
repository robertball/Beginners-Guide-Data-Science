Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, diced
1 medium onion, diced
1/4 cup water
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground chipotle
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 16-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup shredded reduced fat Mexican cheese blend
8 8-inch whole wheat tortillas
1 cup salsa
1/2 cup low-fat sour cream (optional)
Non-stick cooking spra

Directions:
Heat oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, add chicken and saute 3-4 min. Add onions and continue to cook until just translucent, remove from heat.
Add water, spices and beans and continue to cook until all the moisture is evaporated. Assemble burritos with tortillas, chicken and bean mixture and 2 tabldespoons cheese. Whole wheat tortillas are notoriously stiff. Before assembly, I wrap them in paper towel and microwave them for 30 to 45 seconds to slightly steam them.
Heat a clean skillet over medium-high heat and spray with non-stick. Brown both sides of burritos, folded side first.
Serve topped with salsa and/or light sour cream.
