Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries
3/4 cup fresh or frozen blueberries
1/2 cup fresh or frozen raspberries
1 cup water
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to a boil. Let boil 5 minutes or until cranberries start to pop. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Squish any cranberries that haven't popped against the side of the pan with the wooden spoon but try to leave the blueberries somewhat whole. Transfer into a large glass mixing bowl and let cool completely to room temperature.

I sometimes get my best ideas while I'm just starting to doze off...this one came to me and I knew I would have to try it for Thanksgiving. The trio is cranberries, blueberries and raspberries.
