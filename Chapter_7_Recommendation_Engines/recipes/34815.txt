Ingredients:
3 cups water
1 cup powdered milk
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 eggs
4 teaspoons butter
1 cup milk
3 tablespoons honey

Directions:
In a large saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Combine the powdered milk, oats and cinnamon; quickly stir into the boiling water. Return the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the mixture is the desired thickness.
Remove from heat and mix in the raisins and vanilla. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. The hot porridge will  cook the eggs completely. Divide the porridge between 4 bowls.  Top each one with a teaspoon of butter, 1/4 cup of milk , and drizzle with honey.

Description: 
My Mama Bear made this for us all the time! Even oatmeal haters might like this version.  It's sweet and custardy, and keeps you full 'till lunchtime.  By the way, don't balk at the 'raw eggs' that get stirred in - the hot porridge cooks them completely. Bears prefer honey, but brown sugar can be used instead.
