Ingredients:
Rice:
1 1/8 cups water
1/2 cup dirty rice mix (such as Zatarain's® Dirty Brown Rice)
Shrimp:
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoons paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons cumin
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
Corn Salad:
1 (15 ounce) can corn, drained
1 red bell pepper, diced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 lime, juiced
1 tablespoon olive oil
Greek Yogurt Avocado-Cilantro Dressing:
1 avocado
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt (such as Chobani®)
1 clove garlic
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 avocado, sliced
1 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Combine water and dirty rice mix in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cover. Cook until water is absorbed, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork and set aside until needed.
While rice is cooking, combine shrimp, chili powder, paprika, cumin, onion powder, salt, and black pepper in a bowl.
Heat oil in a medium cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook until no longer pink, about 2 minutes per side.
Mix corn, red bell pepper, cilantro, lime juice, and olive oil together in a bowl to make corn salad.
Combine avocado, cilantro, yogurt, garlic, olive oil, salt, and black pepper in a food processor. Pulse until dressing is smooth.
Assemble bowls by dividing cooked rice, cooked shrimp, corn salad, black beans, and sliced avocado evenly. Drizzle with dressing and garnish with lime wedges.

Description: 
This blackened shrimp salad bowl is big and bold in flavor and makes for a low-calorie meal packed with shrimp, brown rice, corn, crisp bell pepper, black beans, and avocado. Easy to create with ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen/pantry. If you prefer to serve burrito-style, just heat up some flour tortillas and wrap it all up. Either way, it's delish!
