Ingredients:
1 pkg. Low fat mozzarella cheese strings (8-10 sticks)
1/2 cup flour
2 large egg whites, lightly beaten
1 cup dry bread crumbs or Italian style panko (seasoned)
marinara sauce for dipping
5 Ham Steaks
5 Steaks

Directions:
Cut mozzarella string cheese pieces in half and put in freezer for 15 minutes (so they ooze less while baking)
2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
3. Place flour, egg whites, and breadcrumbs in three separate shallow bowls for dipping. If using bread crumbs, season with salt and pepper to taste (Italian style panko is already seasoned)
4. Dip each mozzarella stick, one at a time, into the flour to lightly coat, then into the egg whites, and finally into the bread crumbs, completely covering the cheese. Pat crumbs on to help them adhere to egg whites layer.
5. Place each completed mozzarella stick onto a baking dish.
6. Fill the inside of each of the battered mozzarella cheese sticks with 2 handfuls of sliced ham and steak.
7. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until mozzarella sticks are a golden color. Serve with marinara sauce or dip of choice.
