1-3/4 to 2-1/4 C. All purpose flour
3 Tbs olive oil
1 tsp Sugar
3/4 tsp salt

1 envelope yeast; pref. pizza crust yeast if you can find it

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 deg. Combine 1 cup flour and remaining dry ingredients until well mixed. Add water and oil; mix well, about 1min. Gradually add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Dough should form a ball and be slightly sticky. Knead on a well floured surface, add more flour as needed, until smooth and elastic; approx. 4-5min. Pat dough our with floured hands in a greased pizza/backing pan. Form a rim by pinching the head of dough. Add desired toppings and bake on lowest rack for 12-15 min or  until cheese is bubbly and crust is golden
