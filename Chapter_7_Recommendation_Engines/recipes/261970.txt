Ingredients:
2 teaspoons canola oil
1 1/4 pounds ground turkey
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup roughly chopped red bell pepper
6 cups water
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 cup lentils
1 cup sliced carrots
3/4 cup pearl barley
6 cubes chicken bouillon
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add turkey, onion, and red bell pepper. Saute until pepper is soft and turkey is no long pink, 6 to 8 minutes.
Combine water, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, lentils, carrots, barley, bouillon, salt, Italian seasoning, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the sauteed turkey mixture. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until lentils are tender and flavors are blended, about 1 hour.

Description: 
A warming stew with ground turkey and lentils that's low in fat. I like to serve this with a nice whole grain roll or bread.
