Ingredients:
3 tbsp smooth peanut butter (I use a brand with no added salt or oils)
3 tbsp cocoa (unsweetened)
1 tbsp Milo (choc-malt drink mix)
4 tbsp margarine
1 tin condensed milk

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together, scoop into jar and refrigerate until needed.
If you wish/need to make your own condensed milk rather than using a store-bought can, combine one heaped cup of milk powder with half a cup of warm water and three quarters of a cup of sugar. Gently heat this mixture in a saucepan until simmering, stirring constantly for approximately five minutes, until the mixture thickens slightly. It will thicken more on cooling and will give you the right consistency for a spread. Allow to cool before mixing with the other Peanutella Spread ingredients.
