Ingredients:
3 pounds rib roast
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
2 tablespoons curry powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Trim excess fat from rib roast, place on a medium baking sheet and cover with foil. Bake approximately 30 minutes in the preheated oven.
In a medium bowl, whisk together vegetable oil, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic and curry powder.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
Drain juices from ribs and cut into 4 separate pieces. Place on the prepared grill. Basting frequently with the vegetable oil mixture and turning often, cook ribs 15 to 20 minutes, or until richly glazed.
