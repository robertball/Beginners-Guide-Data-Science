1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
2 cups sour cream
1 1/2 cups flaked coconut

1 pint strawberries, hulled and sliced
1 pint fresh blueberries
3 cups miniature marshmallows

Directions:
Combine the heavy cream and confectioners' sugar in a large bowl. Whip with an electric mixer until thick but not grainy. Mix in sour cream.
Use a rubber spatula to fold in the flaked coconut, pineapple, strawberries, blueberries and marshmallows until everything is evenly distributed. Cover and chill for at least 4 hours before serving. It tastes best if chilled overnight.
