Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 quart buttermilk
2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon paprika
salt and ground black pepper to taste
vegetable oil for deep frying

Directions:
Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt and pepper, and place them in a deep-sided baking dish.
Whisk together the buttermilk, hot pepper sauce, and 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper in a bowl. Pour the mixture over the chicken, stir to coat all sides of the chicken pieces, and cover the dish with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for about 2 hours to marinate.
Remove the chicken pieces from the buttermilk mixture, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining buttermilk mixture.
Place the flour, 1 tablespoon of cayenne pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and salt and pepper to taste in a large plastic zipper bag, and shake well to combine. Place 2 or 3 pieces of chicken at a time into the plastic bag, and shake well to coat the chicken pieces with seasoned flour.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Gently place chicken pieces into the hot oil, and fry until chicken is cooked through and golden brown, 8-10 minutes (breasts and wings) or 13 to 15 minutes (thighs and drumsticks). Drain the fried chicken on paper towels.
