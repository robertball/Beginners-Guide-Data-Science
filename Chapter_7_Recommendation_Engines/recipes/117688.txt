Ingredients:
2 cups cream-filled chocolate sandwich cookie crumbs
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups heavy whipping cream, whipped
2 tablespoons instant coffee granules
1 tablespoon hot water
1/2 cup chocolate syrup

Directions:
Line a 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan with heavy-duty foil. In a small bowl, combine cookie crumbs and butter. Press firmly onto the bottom and 1-1/2 in. up the sides of prepared pan.
In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until light and fluffy. Add milk and vanilla; mix well. Fold in whipped cream. Spoon half of the mixture into another bowl and set aside. Dissolve coffee granules in hot water; fold into remaining cream cheese mixture. Fold in chocolate syrup.
Spoon half of the chocolate mixture over crust. Top with half of the reserved cream cheese mixture. Repeat layers (pan will be full). Freeze, uncovered, for 6 hours or until set. Cover and freeze until serving. Use foil to lift out of pan; cut into slices.

From Carmel, Indiana, Andy Heavilin writes, I received a recipe from a friend, and it's the greatest dessert I've ever had. I'm sure that it's loaded with fat and calories, though. Can you help?
