Ingredients:
Broth:
10 cups vegetable stock
4 tbsp soy sauce
8 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped coarsely
1 onion, peeled and halved
2 tsp ground ginger
2 3-inch cinnamon sticks
2 pods of star anise
2 bay leaves
Soup:
1 lb thin rice noodles
2 packages firm tofu, drained, sliced 1/4" and fried
1/2 cup cilantro, coarsely chopped
4 scallions, thinly sliced
8 oz fresh enoki mushrooms, rinsed
1 lime, cut into wedges
1/4 cup mung bean sprouts
1/4 cup Thai basil leaves, torn into bite-sized pieces
2 jalapenos, sliced into rounds
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Add all broth ingredients to a large pot and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30-45.  Remove solids with a slotted spoon or strain, squeeze excess liquid from solids, and return to pot.  Keep broth hot until soup is ready to be served.
Prepare rice noodles as directed on package.  Drain and divide noodles into 6 large bowls.
Simmer fried tofu and mushrooms in broth until heated through, about 5 min.  Remove tofu and mushrooms from broth and divide evenly between bowls.
Top noodles, mushrooms, and tofu with scallions and cilantro.  Divide hot broth evenly among the bowls.
Serve with basil, bean sprouts, lime wedges, and jalapeno rounds on the side for toppings to each person's  taste.
