Ingredients:
Refrigerated bread stick dough
prepared pesto (basil-based is the best)
grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Lay out bread stick dough.  Use the back of a spoon to spread a layer of pesto on top.  About 2 Tablespoons should cover the entire dough from 1 can.  Sprinkle with about 2 Tablespoons of parmesan cheese.  Separate the dough into individual strips at the perforations using a knife to help.  Twist the dough while stretching it a little and place on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake at 375 degrees for about 12 minutes, or until done.
