Ingredients:
3/4 cup Jamaican jerk marinade, divided
5 tablespoons lime juice, divided
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste
2 cups pressed and cubed extra-firm tofu
cooking spray
2 cups diced jicama
1 cup diced pineapple
2 cups prepared rice
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
8 (8 inch) low-fat flour tortilla
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 cup salsa
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Whisk 1/2 cup marinade, 1/4 cup lime juice, garlic, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Add tofu, coat with the marinade, squeeze bag to remove air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Drain tofu, discarding marinade.
Prepare a large skillet with cooking spray and place over medium-high heat. Cook tofu, turning frequently, until it starts to brown, about 4 minutes; transfer to a bowl. Return skillet to medium-high heat.
Cook and stir jicama, pineapple, remaining 1/4 cup marinade, and 1 tablespoon lime juice in the skillet until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Return tofu to the skillet; cook and stir until heated through, about 2 minutes more.
Spoon 1/3 cup tofu mixture evenly down center of each tortilla. Top each with even portions of rice, black beans, and cheese.
Fold 2 opposing ends to overlap the edges of the filling. Wrap 1 of the opposing edges of the tortilla over the filling and roll to form a burrito. Top each burrito with salsa and sour cream.
