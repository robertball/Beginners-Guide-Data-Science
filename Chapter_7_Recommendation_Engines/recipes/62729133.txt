Vegan Strawberry Gelato Recipe

Ingredients:
Soy Milk, 2 cup
Strawberries, frozen, unsweetened, 16oz
Granulated Sugar, 2/3 cup
Cornstarch, 1 heaping teaspoon
Lemon Juice, 1/4 cup
Sucralose (like Splenda), to taste
Sour Salt, to taste (available in some supermarkets. if you can't get it, use more lemon juice, but remember that that adds more water that will become ice in the finished product)

Directions:
Mix the cornstarch with the lemon juice, and combine that and all the other ingredients in a blender.
I used liquid sucralose drops instead of granulated Splenda, so sweeten to taste. I also tweaked the tartness with citric acid crystals (sour salt). You want the mix to be a little too sweet at room temperature, because you'll taste the sweetness less after freezing.
Blend until smooth.
After you have a homogeneous puree, pour the mixture into a pot and heat over a medium flame, stirring every so-often to keep from burning, until mixture comes to a boil and starts to thicken. Cover and chill thoroughly, preferably overnight.
Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions, in two batches if necessary. Mix will come out like soft-serve, and can then be either served, or decanted and frozen. To serve it from the freezer, you'll need to let it stand at room temperature for a bit before it will scoop, but it will nicely.

What resulted when I had a new gelato machine to play with and soymilk left over from a recipe. Mix needs to be refrigerated for several hours before churning, so allow time.
