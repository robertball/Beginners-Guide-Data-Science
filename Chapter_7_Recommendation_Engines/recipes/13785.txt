½ cup butter flavored shortening

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9x5 inch loaf pan.
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder and salt. Mix in the shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center, and pour in eggs, milk, pumpkin and vanilla. Mix well, then stir in nuts.
