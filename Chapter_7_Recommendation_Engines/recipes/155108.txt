Ingredients:
1 pound bulk hot Italian sausage
1 loaf Italian bread, cut in half lengthwise
1 beefsteak tomato, sliced
1 cup roasted red bell pepper strips
1 (8 ounce) package mozzarella cheese, sliced
1/4 cup sliced green olives
1/4 cup sliced black olives
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 tablespoon dried basil
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
2 tablespoons diced red onion
1 tablespoon chopped garlic

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Crumble the sausage into a saucepan over low heat; cover and cook until sausage is completely browned, stirring every 30 seconds; drain.
Place the bread on a baking sheet with the crust sides down. Arrange the cooked sausage evenly over both halves of bread. Top each with tomato slices, red bell pepper strips, mozzarella slices, green olives, and black olives.
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes.
Whisk together the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, onion, and garlic in a bowl. Drizzle over baked bread halves.
Bake another 5 minutes. Cut into 2 inch slices to serve.
