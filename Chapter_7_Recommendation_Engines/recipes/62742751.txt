Ingredients:
2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
2 lbs baby carrots
Coarse kosher salt
2 tbsp (1/4 stick) butter
1 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary
1 1/2 tbsp honey

Directions:
Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrots and sprinkle with coarse kosher salt and pepper. Saut√© until carrots are beginning to brown at edges, about 12 minutes. (I covered them so the heat would "steam" them and cook them through. Just be sure to check on them and make sure they don't burn).
Add butter, rosemary, and honey to vegetables. Toss over medium heat until heated through and carrots are glazed, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with more salt and pepper, if desired.

Description: 
Super easy and super delicious side dish. I named these Confidence Carrots because my mom didn't believe me when I told her what I was doing with this recipe. I had to trust my gut and see how they would turn out. The carrots were raved about by my relatives, many who are not huge fans of carrots. The honey/butter/olive oil combo makes this dish rich. Great served with meat.
