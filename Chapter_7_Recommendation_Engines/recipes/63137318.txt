Ingredients:
2 quarts apricots, peeled, cored and crushed
1/4 cup lemon juice
6 cups of sugar

Directions:
Prepare jars & lids by cleaning & sterilizing either in dishwasher or boiling water bath. Leave lids in simmering water until ready to seal jars.
Combine apricots & lemon juice in a large saucepan, add sugar. Slowly bring to a boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Cook rapidly until mix turns into gel, about 25 minutes. As mixture thickens, stir frequently to prevent sticking. Remove from heat, and skim foam if necessary. Ladle hot jam into hot jars, leaving 1/4 inch head space. Add caps and lids. (Make sure lids are dried thoroughly to allow sealing) Process 15 minutes in a boiling water bath.

Description: 
I Love to save money, especially with my big family. So making my own Jams and jellies is a favorite hobby of mine to share with my kids. This Jam is not only fun to make, but it is also very delicious. There's nothing like your own fresh jam on toasted Italian bread.
