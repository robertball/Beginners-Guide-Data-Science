1/2 cup cooked kidney beans
2 tbsp finely minced red pepper
1/2 tbsp minced red onion
1 heaped tbsp fresh cilantro
1/2 a clove of garlic minced
1/4 – 1/2 tsp chili powder
1/4 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp maple syrup
1/4 tsp Dutch processed/unsweetened cocoa powder
Pinch or two of sea salt and black pepper
1 tbsp ground flaxseed
Sauce
1/3 cup passata
1/2 a clove of garlic minced
1 tsp tomato paste
1/4 tsp Dutch process cocoa powder
1/2 – 1 tsp chili powder
1/4 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp ground coriander
Sea salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Saute onion and garlic in water for 3-5 minutes over a medium heat. Add in red pepper and saute for a further 4-5 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350F.
Puree half of the kidney beans in a mini chopper, using a stick blender or small food processor.
Combine all bean ball ingredients. Set aside for 5 minutes before molding into 3-4 medium or 5 golf ball sized balls.
Place on a non stick baking tray and bake for 15 – 17 minutes; until starting to brown and crisp up on the outside.
While the bean balls cook make your sauce. Saute garlic in the same pan used previously for 3 minutes. Add in all other ingredients, bring to the boil and simmer until the meatballs are done.
Serve meatballs with sauce, a dollop of vegan yogurt and fresh cilantro.
