Ingredients:
1 cup almond milk
1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats
1 ripe banana, mashed
1 tablespoon ground flaxseed (optional)
1/4 cup fresh blueberries
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Combine almond milk, rosemary, and salt in a saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Stir in oats, banana, and flaxseed. Reduce heat to medium and cook until most of the liquid has been absorbed, 4 to 5 minutes.
Add blueberries and lemon juice to the pan. Continue to cook until desired consistency is reached, 1 to 2 minutes more.

Description: 
Fresh rosemary and lemon add a unique burst of flavor to this blueberry oatmeal. A ripe banana adds sweetness, so there is no added sugar. Top with nuts, seeds, or toasted coconut if you would like some crunch.
