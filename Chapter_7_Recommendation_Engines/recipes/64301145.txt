Ingredients:
8 small birds such as Cornish Hens or very small chickens.
4 oz. of pancetta or bacon
1 bunch of sage
8 slices of polenta(recipe to follow)

Directions:
Thread the birds onto skewers, alternating them with pieces of pancetta  or bacon and the sage. Salt lightly and cook on the rotisserie placing a pan underneath to catch the juices.
You can also roast the birds in the oven at 350 degrees till juices run clear.
Fry the polenta in this fat(or a bit of olive oil) until a bit on the crisp side and serve with the cooked birds.
For the POLENTA
6 and 1/4 cup water or chicken broth(i use chicken broth)
2 cups yellow cornmeal
couple of pinches of salt
In a large saucepan bring the broth or water to boil and add the salt. When the water  or broth is boiling add the cornmeal stirring continuously with a long wooden spoon.
Turn the heat to medium, cook the polenta stirring frequently for about 15 minutes until it comes away from the sides of the pot. Rinse a deep plate or pie pan in cold water and when the polenta is cooked pour it into the plate or pie pan and leave to cool. *SEE NOTES*

Description: 
This is a dish from Northern Italy called the Veneto Region.
My dad would make these on special occasions such as Easter or special birthdays. With the ploenta, roast potatoes and a salad this makes for a lovely meal. Of course you must have some good Italian bread to mop up the juices.. Enjoy!!
