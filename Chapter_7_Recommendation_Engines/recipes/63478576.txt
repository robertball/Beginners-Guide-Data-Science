Ingredients:
1½ lb chicken meat, cut into small 1” chunks
4-5 Tbsp extra virgin coconut oil (more if you use breast meat, less if you use thigh meat)
5 cloves garlic, finely chopped
3 Tbsp Fish Sauce
1 Tbsp Coconut Aminos (or use 1 more Tbsp fish sauce)
4 Tbsp fresh lime juice (or use a good quality bottled Lime Juice)
½ Tbsp Coconut Vinegar (Apple Cider Vinegar would work too)
5 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro
4-5 green onions, finely chopped
1 12oz package of broccoli slaw
2 medium carrots, cut into thin julienne strips

Directions:
1.    Heat a wok over medium-high heat.  Add oil and garlic, cook about 1 minute.
2.    Add chicken and cook 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, until lightly browned.
3.    Add fish sauce, coconut aminos, lime juice and vinegar.  Cook at a rapid simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 5-8 minutes.
4.    Add broccoli slaw and julienned carrot.  Cook, stirring frequently, until soft but still firm, about 3-4 minutes.
5.    Toss or garnish with green onion and cilantro.  Enjoy!
