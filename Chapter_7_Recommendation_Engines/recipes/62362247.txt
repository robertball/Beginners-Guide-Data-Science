Description: 
When we moved to a city that didn't have my favorite cupcake shoppe, I was forced to come up with a recipe that is as close as possible. This is it! Super-moist, and an amazing frosting, which of course I pile on thick. Makes 24 oversized (my favorite) or 36 regular sized. Enjoy! Thanks!Modified from: Red Velvet Cupcakes
