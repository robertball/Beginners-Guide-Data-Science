Ingredients:
Chocolate Granola (oil free)
1.5-2 cups quick oats
1 cup unsweetened coconut
¼ cup pure cocoa
½ cup raw honey
½ tsp. pure vanilla
Pinch sea salt

Directions:
Mix everything together. Spread it out on a pan and bake until done (keep turning it over and stirring it). This took about over an hour on a low oven temperature (150-200 degrees). I prefer to just dehydrate it overnight and not bother about it.
