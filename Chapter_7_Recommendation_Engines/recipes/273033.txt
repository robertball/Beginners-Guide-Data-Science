Ingredients:
1 shortcrust pastry crust
6 1/2 ounces 70% dark chocolate, chopped
1 1/2 cups ground almonds
2 eggs
1/2 cup superfine sugar
6 1/2 tablespoons butter, softened
3 pears - peeled, cored, and quartered

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Roll pastry out to 1/4 inch thickness and use it to line a 9-inch tart dish. Prick the pastry with a fork and then place into the freezer for 20 minutes to prevent pastry from rising during baking.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Set crust aside. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Heat a saucepan about 1/3-full of water to a low simmer, about 5 minutes, then reduce heat to lowest setting. Place a heat-proof bowl over the pan in such a way that it does not touch the water. Add chocolate to the bowl and allow to melt. Limit stirring to an absolute minimum to prevent chocolate from separating.
Mix ground almonds, eggs, sugar, and butter together in a bowl. Add warm melted chocolate and stir to combine. Pour chocolate mixture into the baked pastry crust.
Arrange pears on top of the tart by pressing them into the chocolate mixture.
Bake in the hot oven until pastry is golden and mixture is firm, 35 to 45 minutes.

My version of a recipe found on a free supermarket recipe card! It's chocolaty, juicy, and scrumptious. The tart is best served warm with creme fraiche.
