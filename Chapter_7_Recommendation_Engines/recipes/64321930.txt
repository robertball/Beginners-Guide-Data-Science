Ingredients:
1/8 cup(s) peanut butter, creamy, natural
1 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce, less sodium divided
1 tablespoon vinegar, rice wine
1/2 tablespoon oil, canola divided
8 ounce(s) tempeh (1 packages), cut into 1" pieces
2 clove(s) garlic minced
1/2 pounds mushroom, white sliced
1/2 bunch(es) scallion(s) (green onions) cut into 1" pieces
1 medium pepper(s), red, bell cut into thin strips

Directions:
Whisk together peanut butter, 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce, and vinegar in a small bowl until smooth.
Heat 1/4 tablespoon of the oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over high heat. Add tempeh and cook, stirring frequently, until golden, about 4 minutes. Add remaining soy sauce and toss to coat. Transfer tempeh to a plate.
Heat remaining oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat; add garlic and cook 30 seconds. Add mushrooms, scallions, and bell peppers; cook until the vegetables are crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Add tempeh and peanut butter mixture, toss until all ingredients are well coated, and serve.
Each serving is 2 cups.
