Ingredients:
4 cups heavy cream
1 cup confectioners' sugar, divided
1/2 cup sour cream, at room temperature
1/8 teaspoon almond extract
2 pints fresh blackberries
8 strips of lemon zest, for garnish
8 sprigs fresh mint

Directions:
Pour the heavy cream into a large bowl with half of the confectioners' sugar and almond extract. Whip until stiff. Fold in sour cream. Refrigerate.
In a separate bowl, toss blackberries with the remaining confectioners' sugar. Let stand at room temperature for about 15 minutes.
In 8 parfait glasses, layer whipped cream and blackberries, beginning and ending with whipped cream. Garnish each parfait with a strip of lemon zest, a few blackberries and a sprig of mint.

Description: 
I strongly recommend using fresh blackberries in this recipe for best flavor. Raspberries, strawberries or a combination of all three may be used, but they should all be fresh.
