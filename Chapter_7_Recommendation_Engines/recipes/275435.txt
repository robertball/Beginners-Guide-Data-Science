Ingredients:
8 ounces chanterelle mushrooms
4 tablespoons butter
2 cups diced shallot
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 drizzle olive oil
4 cups chicken stock
1/2 cup half-and-half

Directions:
Rinse mushrooms and pat dry. Slice in half. Rinse off any bugs or dirt and chop.
Melt butter in a deep, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add shallots and cook until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir mushroom pieces into the shallots and toss in a generous pinch of salt to help draw out their juices. Add pepper. Drizzle with olive oil. Continue to cook until mushroom pieces shrink in size and brown slightly, about 5 minutes.
Pour chicken stock into the pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly, 10 to 20 minutes.
Ladle soup into a high-powered blender. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; blend on high until pureed, 1 to 2 minutes. Add half-and-half and blend for 1 minute more. Return blended soup to the pot. Heat until warmed through, 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.

Description: 
This is a lovely French version of cream of mushroom soup using chanterelles, which can be a bit pricey, so if you find wild ones while foraging, use them with this recipe! Serve with croutons or crostini.
