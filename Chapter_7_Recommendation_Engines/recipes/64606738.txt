Croutons Recipe

Ingredients:
bread
butter
spices/seasoning of your choice

Directions:
Remove crusts (optional)
Butter both sides of bread (or brush with melted butter, but I find buttering is more even distribution)
Sprinkle with whatever variety of spices you'd like to enjoy.
Cube each slice individually (in the name of efficiency, I tried stacking to slice, but then had to peel the pieces apart = no time saved! + more stress haha)
For a twist, you can cut your croutons in diamond (or other) shapes
Arrange in single layer on ungreased baking sheet.
Bake @ 350 x about 15 minutes, until browned.
Cool.
Store in plastic bag or covered container.
