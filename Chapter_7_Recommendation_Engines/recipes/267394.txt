Ingredients:
1 large tomato, chopped
2 slices crusty bread
1 clove garlic, halved
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Place tomato in a blender; blend until smooth.
Toast the bread until browned, 1 to 3 minutes. Rub each slice of toast with garlic; this is easier to do if the peel is left on.
Top each slice of toast with pureed tomato. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt.
