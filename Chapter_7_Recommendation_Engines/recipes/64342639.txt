Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 cups lukewarm water or milk
enough oil to fry in
1 lb ground beef
chilli seasoning package
1 can kidney beans
2 cups iceburg lettuce chopped
2 cups cheddar cheese shredded
1 cup sour cream
2 chopped tomatoes

Directions:
For fry bread: Heat oil to 375 degrees. Mix dry ingredients together. Stir in water or milk. Dough will be fairly sticky, be careful to not over mix.  Allow to sit in bowl while oil is heating.  Divide dough 6 equal portions and flatten out into round discs the size of your palm.  Dip into bowl of flour if too sticky to work with.  Fry in hot oil until browned on one side then flip.  Start with one, to time how long it takes for fry bread to cook all the way through. Drain on paper towels. Optional: Cut the cooked fry bread into small pieces, large crouton size and portion onto plates for easier eating (picnics where utensils would be difficult).
For chilli: Brown ground beef, add seasoning and drained kidney beans. Set aside, keeping warm.
To assemble, place fry bread on bottom of plate, top with chilli, shredded cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream.
