Ingredients:
3  cups flour
1  teaspoon salt
1  tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2  cups water
1  tablespoon shortening
oil (for frying)

Directions:
Combine dry ingredients in a bowl.
Cut in the shortening until it resembles crumbs.
Slowly add water and mix thoroughly until you have a good dough.
Knead the dough for a few minutes.
Use flour when needed and break off pieces about the size of a golf ball.
You flatten these balls to about pancake size and fry in hot oil.
I don't remember the reason why but the Indians poke a hole in the center of the dough before frying.
When they are golden, drain on paper towels.

Description: 
I first made this on 06/04/02. Very tasty and easy to make. Fluffier and more bread-like than versions I've tried before. I like to add 1 more tbsp. of shortening and about 1/4 cup of white sugar. I like to use these when I make something for dinner that has a sauce like curry or something. Try different things like adding spices to the dough that's similar to your main dish. My family loves these!
