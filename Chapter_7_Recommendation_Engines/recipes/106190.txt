Ingredients:
4 boneless pork chops, 1-inch thick
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pinch salt
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup apple juice
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons water
freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
Brush chops with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper; set aside.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring sugar, juice, soy sauce and ginger to a boil. Dissolve cornstarch in water and whisk into sauce until smooth. Simmer until slightly thickened.
Place chops on hot grill. Cook, continuously brushing with sauce until grill marks form, about 5 minutes per side. Brush with sauce once more and continue to grill, turning once, until glaze sets or until internal temperature is 160 degrees F( 70 degrees C).
