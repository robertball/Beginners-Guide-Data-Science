Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
½ tsp Kosher salt plus more to taste
¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper, to taste
16 ounces baby red potatoes, halved
4 boneless,skinless chicken breasts,5-6 oz each, pounded to even thickness if necessary so that they cook evenly
20 ounces broccoli florets

Directions:
1. Whisk together 1 Tbsp of the olive oil with the honey, Dijon, garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.
2. Reserve half of the sauce for later, then marinate the chicken in the rest of the sauce for an hour.
3. Preheat the oven to 400F.
4. Toss the potatoes with the second Tbsp of olive oil and a pinch of salt. Place them on a foil-lined half sheet pan and lay the chicken breasts on top. Add the broccoli to the pan, then drizzle the reserved sauce over top.
5. Bake 35 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are tender.
*If you prefer your broccoli to still have some crispness to it, don’t add the broccoli to the pan until 15 minutes into the cooking time.
