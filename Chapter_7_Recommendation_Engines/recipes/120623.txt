Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter (no substitutes)
3 cups flaked coconut
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup half-and-half cream
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 teaspoons shortening

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper; set aside. In a saucepan, cook butter over medium-low heat until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in the coconut, sugar and cream. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate until easy to handle, about 25 minutes.
Roll mixture into balls, then shape each into a cone. Return to baking sheet; refrigerate for 15 minutes. In a microwave or heavy saucepan, melt chocolate chips and shortening. Dip bottoms of cones into chocolate. Return to waxed paper to harden. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

Description: 
I found this gem on a slip of paper in a cookbook I got at a yard sale. The candies get great flavor from browned butter. I've received many requests for this recipe over the years.
