Ingredients:
- 2 salmon fillets, skinned, 150 to 175 gms each (5 or 6 ounces), and 2 cms thick (3/4 inch)
- Juice from a quarter of a lemon (lime juice also works)
- Salt and freshly milled black pepper
- 2 Tablespoons of fresh pesto (Phil has an excellent recipe up for this!) but see also the Footnotes
- 2 Tablespoons fresh breadcrumbs
- 1 heaped Tablespoon of finely grated Pecorino cheese
***
You will also need a baking try 10 x 14 inches (25.5 x 35 cms), covered in foil and lightly greased.

Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 230°C (450°F).
Trim the fillets neatly if required, and lightly run your fingertips across the meat to be sure no bones remain.
Place the fillets on the prepared baking tray and drizzle the lemon juice over them. Lightly season with salt and pepper.
In a small bowl place the fresh pesto (see Footnotes!) and then add 1/3 of the breadcrumbs, mixing well to make a paste. Spread this paste over the upper side of the fillets evenly.
In another small bowl, mix the remining breadcrumbs with half the cheese, then scatter this mix over the pesto surface of the fish.
Finally, scatter the remaining cheese on top of that.
Bake in the oven for 10 minutes until the top is golden brown.
Serve immediately.
