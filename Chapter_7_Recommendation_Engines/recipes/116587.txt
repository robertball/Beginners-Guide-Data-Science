Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
1 egg
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce, divided
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, divided
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 pound ground beef
3/4 cup chopped onion
1 (4 ounce) can mushroom stems and pieces, drained
1/3 cup chopped stuffed olives
1/4 cup chopped green pepper
1 tablespoon butter, melted
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add egg, 1/4 cup tomato sauce, oil, sugar, salt, chili powder and 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce; beat until smooth. Add 1 cup flour; beat for 1 minute. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Meanwhile, in a lARGE skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Remove from the heat; stir in onion, mushrooms, olives, green pepper and remaining tomato sauce and hot pepper sauce.
Punch dough down; turn once onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 14-in. x 9-in. rectangle. Place in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Brush with butter. Top with meat mixture; sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes or until crust is lightly browned and cheese is melted.
