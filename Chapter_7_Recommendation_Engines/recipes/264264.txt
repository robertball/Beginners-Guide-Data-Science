Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter, softened
4 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup low-calorie natural sweetener (such as SwerveÂ®)
1 egg white
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups blanched almond flour
1 pinch salt
4 tablespoons dark chocolate chips, melted

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Whisk butter, cream cheese, and sweetener together in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add egg and vanilla extract; whisk until smooth.
Combine almond flour and salt in a bowl; whisk into butter mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, until a crumbly dough is formed. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets; flatten with a spoon.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 15 to 17 minutes.
Remove and let cool on a wire rack. Once completely cool, drizzle with melted dark chocolate.
