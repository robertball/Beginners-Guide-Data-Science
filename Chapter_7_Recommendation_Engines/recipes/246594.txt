1 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
1 1/2 pounds beef, thinly sliced

Whisk 1/4 cup soy sauce, 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 teaspoons sesame oil, 1 clove garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper together in a large bowl; stir in beef. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator, at least 30 minutes and preferably overnight.
