Ingredients:
1 Tbsp butter
2 Tbsp slivered almonds
1 Granny Smith Apple, cored, thinly sliced, and peeled
1 Tbsp brown sugar
A pinch of sea salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/3 cup Amaretto liqueur

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the almonds and apples.  Saute, stirring often, for 5-10 minutes, until the apples are soft (to your liking).  During that time, add the brown sugar, the sea salt, the cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Once the desired softness has been reached, pour in the Amaretto.  Cook until the desired syruppy consistency has been reached - a minute or two.  Serve with a dollop of whipped cream, or over ice cream.
