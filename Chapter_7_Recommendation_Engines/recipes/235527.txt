Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup powdered milk
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups apple cider
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Sift flour, powdered milk, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and baking soda together in a bowl. Whisk apple cider,  1/4 cup vegetable oil, and eggs together in a separate bowl. Stir apple cider mixture into flour mixture until batter is just combined.
Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
I had some cider that was getting sour (hardening?) and I always use powdered milk for cooking and thought why not give it a try? So we had pancakes made with powdered milk and apple cider instead of liquid milk. Surprisingly yummy!
