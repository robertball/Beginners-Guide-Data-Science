Ingredients:
1/4 cup granulated  sugar
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
2 Tbsp brown sugar
2 8.25 oz sheets puff pastry, thawed
10 marshmallows
2 Tbsp butter, melted

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees. In a small bowl, combine the granulated sugar an 1 tsp cinnamon. In a second bowl, combine the brown sugar ad the remaining 1/2 tsp cinnamon.
Sprinkle 1 Tbsp of the sugar mixture onto a clean work surface and place 1 sheet of puff pastry on top. Sprinkle with another Tbsp of the granulated sugar mixture. Using a rolling pin, roll over the pastry once to help the sugar stick. Cut the pastry into 5 equal strips. Repeat with the remaining sheet of dough.
Working with 1 strip of dough at a time, dip a marshmallow in the butter, then coat in the brown sugar mixture. Place on one end of the pastry strip and roll up. Pinch the pastry together on one end to create a seam, covering the marshmallow. Repeat with the remaining strips.
Place the rolls, seam-side down, in the holes of a nonstick muffin pan and bake until golden brown and puffed, 30 to 35 minutes. Immediately remove the sugar buns from the pan and transfer to a serving dish or wire rack (for easiest cleanup, remove any melted marshmallow on the pan with it's still warm).
Canned biscuits or cressant rolls could be used instead of puff pastry.
