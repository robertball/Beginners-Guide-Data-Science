Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs. round baby potatoes
3 tbsp salt
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
2 tbsp finely chopped fresh dill
2 tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Place potatoes and 3 tablespoons of salt in a medium saucepan. Cover with water, and bring to a simmer. Cook until a knife pierces through potatoes with a little resistance, about 10-15 minutes. Drain; transfer to a bowl.
Heat oil, garlic and crushed red pepper in a small skillet over medium-low heat until garlic is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Pour over potatoes. Add lemon juice and herbs, and toss. Season with salt & pepper.
