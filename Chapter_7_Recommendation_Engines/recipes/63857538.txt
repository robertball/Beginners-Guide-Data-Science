Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
½ cup red bell pepper
½ cup green bell pepper
6-8 green jalapeno peppers (1/2-3/4 lb)
2 cups apple cider vinegar
6 cups sugar
6oz (2 packets) Certo or liquid pectin

Directions:
Remove stems, veins and most of the seeds of the bell and jalapeno peppers. Chop very fine. USE GLOVES with jalapenos! Drain pepper juice (red peppers have a lot of moisture and will color the jelly red).
In a 5-quart pot over medium-high to high heat, combine bell peppers, jalapenos, sugar and vinegar. Bring to a rolling boil; boil for 10 minutes.
Stirring constantly, add the pectin and let mixture boil for 1 minute more, or until jelly passes the spoon test (cool a bit on a spoon to see if the texture is right). This may take up to 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
Pour into hot, sterilized jars and top with sterilized lids. Process jars in water bath for 10 minutes (sea level).
Makes 6-8 1/2 pint jars
