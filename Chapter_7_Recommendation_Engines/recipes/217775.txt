Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, chopped
1/4 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp (30-40 per pound)
1/4 pound walleye fillets, cut into pieces
1/4 pound cooked lobster meat, broken into chunks
1/4 pound cooked crabmeat
2 tablespoons dry sherry
1/2 cup dry white wine (such as Chenin Blanc)
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of shrimp soup (such as Campbell'sÂ®)
1 cup half-and-half cream
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 pound shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup cold butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Melt 1/2 cup of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the green onions and mushrooms, and cook until the mushrooms have softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the shrimp and walleye; cook and stir until the shrimp have begun to turn opaque, about 2 minutes. Add the lobster and crab, and cook a few minutes to heat.
Stir in the sherry and white wine. Bring to a simmer, and cook for 2 minutes. Once the shrimp and walleye are no longer translucent in the center, stir in the cream of shrimp soup, half-and-half, 1 cup bread crumbs, and Cheddar cheese until the cheese has melted, and the mixture is bubbly. Pour into a casserole dish, and sprinkle evenly with 1/2 cup breadcrumbs and the Parmesan cheese. Dot with the pieces of cold butter.
Cook under the preheated broiler until the butter has melted and the bread crumbs are golden brown.

Description: 
Use crab or lobster, or mix it up with some fish. I use individual au gratin dishes to serve. The sauce can be frozen before the topping is added.
