https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/859280.jpg
Ingredients:
2 Roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
2 cups arugula, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 large portobello mushroom caps
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
4 slices fontina cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet. Combine tomatoes, feta, arugula, and garlic in a small bowl.
Arrange mushroom caps, stem side up, on the prepared baking sheet.  Drizzle each with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast in preheated oven until mushrooms begin to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from oven.
Sprinkle caps with Parmesan cheese; divide tomato mixture evenly between each mushroom cap. Season with salt and pepper; drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Top each mushroom with 2 slices of fontina cheese.
Return to oven until cheese is melted, but tomato mixture is still cool in the center, about 3 minutes.

Description: 
I used a portobello mushroom cap instead of the traditional ciabatta bread. I added cheese to enhance the main-course appeal.
