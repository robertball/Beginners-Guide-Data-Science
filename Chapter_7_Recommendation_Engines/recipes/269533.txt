Description: 
This recipe is for a bone-in, spiral-cut, pre-cooked ham. When you buy a spiral ham at the grocery store, it's almost always already fully cooked which means most of the time you just need to heat it through. The ham's packaging comes with suggestions about how long to cook or heat the ham and those suggestions always recommend using an oven. I'm here to tell you that I don't think I'll ever use an oven to warm a bone-in, spiral ham ever again after using an Instant Pot®!
