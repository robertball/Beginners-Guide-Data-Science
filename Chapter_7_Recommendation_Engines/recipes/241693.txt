Ingredients:
6 egg yolks
3/4 cup white sugar
1/3 cup evaporated milk
1/3 cup chocolate milk
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (8 ounce) container mascarpone cheese
1/2 cup strong brewed coffee, room temperature
1 1/2 teaspoons coconut-flavored rum (such as Malibu®)
1 1/2 teaspoons coffee-flavored liqueur (such as Kahlua®)
10 ladyfingers, split lengthwise
1 tablespoon Marsala wine (such as Cremovo®)
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder (optional)
1 tablespoon 70% cacao chocolate shavings (optional)

Directions:
Whisk together egg yolks and white sugar in a saucepan off heat until well blended. Whisk in evaporated milk and chocolate milk; place pan over medium heat. Stir constantly until boiling, about 5 minutes. Boil for 1 minute; remove from heat and cool slightly. Cover tightly with plastic wrap; chill in refrigerator for 1 hour.
Beat heavy cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until stiff peaks form.
Remove yolk mixture from refrigerator; whisk in mascarpone until smooth.
Combine coffee, coconut-flavored rum, and coffee-flavored liqueur in a small bowl. Place ladyfingers in a bowl; drizzle coffee mixture over ladyfingers.
Arrange half of the soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9x5-inch baking pan. Spread half the mascarpone mixture over ladyfingers, then half the whipped cream. Repeat with remaining ladyfingers and whipped cream; end with a layer of mascarpone mixture.
Sprinkle the tiramisu with cocoa powder and chocolate shavings. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate until set, 4 to 6 hours.
