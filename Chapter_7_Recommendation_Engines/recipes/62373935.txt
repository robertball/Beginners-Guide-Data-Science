1/4 Cup Vegetable Oil

Directions:
Heat oil in pan.  Once oil is warm add garlic and poblano pepper, fry about 2 minutes.  Add rice to pan, stirring constantly for about 5-7 more minutes.  Rice will begin to brown; watch carefully so it doesnt burn.
While frying rice place 2 cups of water in a microwave safe bowl and heat for 2 minutes until water is hot and boiling.
After rice has fried 5-7 minutes carefully remove bowl from microwave (will be hot) and pour into pan with rice; carefull for splattering.  Add chicken cube and butter stirring.  Cover pan with lid and let stand 5-7 minutes until water is absorbed.
