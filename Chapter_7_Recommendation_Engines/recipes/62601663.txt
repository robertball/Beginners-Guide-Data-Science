Ingredients:
1 1/2 C. Crushed graham crackers
1/2 C. white sugar
1/2 t. ground cinnamon
1/4 C. butter, melted
Filling:
4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 1/2 cups white sugar
4 eggs
1 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch springform pan.
In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs with sugar, and cinnamon. Pour melted butter over and mix. Press onto bottom of springform pan.
Make sure all ingredients are at room temperature to start.
In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth.Mix in the eggs one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off, and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for 2-3 hours; this prevents cracking. Chill in refrigerator until serving.
Top with fruit topping if desired, cherries or blueberries.
