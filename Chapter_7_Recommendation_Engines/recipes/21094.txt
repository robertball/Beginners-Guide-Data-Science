Ingredients:
1 egg
1/3 cup 1% milk
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon crushed garlic
salt and pepper to taste
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl whisk together egg, milk, cheese, garlic, salt and pepper.  Fold in spinach.  Place in a small casserole dish.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until lightly set.
NOTE:  If you are in a hurry, use a microwave safe casserole dish, cover with plastic wrap, and cook on high for 3 minutes.  Release the steam, recover, and cook on high for another 3 minutes.  Enjoy!
