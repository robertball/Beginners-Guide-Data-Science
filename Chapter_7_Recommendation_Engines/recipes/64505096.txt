Ingredients:
3 ounces dried porcini mushrooms
2 cups Diamond Crystal Kosher salt
3 tablespoons red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons dried thyme
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Place your dried mushrooms in a food processor or high-speed blender. Pulse a few time to get them to a semi-uniform size, then process until they are a fine powder. Be careful opening the lid as the powder may plume out. Add pulverized mushrooms to the rest of your spices and throughly mix. Use immediately and/or store in an airtight container.
