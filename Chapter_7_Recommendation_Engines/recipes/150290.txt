Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups margarine, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
2 1/4 cups packed brown sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons almond extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
3 cups regular rolled oats
1 1/2 cups sweetened flaked coconut
4 (1 ounce) squares white chocolate, chopped
1 (3.5 ounce) jar coarsely chopped macadamia nuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two cookie sheets.
Cream the margarine together with the white sugar and brown sugar in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time until thoroughly blended. Mix in the vanilla and almond extracts.
Stir the flour, baking soda, salt, and rolled oats together in a mixing bowl until well blended. Stir the flour mixture into the sugar mixture. Mix in the coconut, white chocolate, and macadamia nuts until evenly blended. Drop by tablespoonfuls 1 inch apart on prepared cookie sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until centers are set and edges are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool 3 minutes on baking sheets before removing to cool on a rack.

Description: 
These cookies are reminiscent of a white chunk macadamia nut cookie but better. Using slivered almonds instead of macadamia nuts is a more economical alternative. Follow baking directions. The cookies can be a little tricky to get right on the first pan. Unless the oven is preheated, they might not turn out. Note that these cookies don't bake well on airbake pans.
