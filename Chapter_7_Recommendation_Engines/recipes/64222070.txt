Ingredients:
1.5 lbs fresh green beans
7 slices prosciutto
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1-2 minced fresh garlic cloves
1 teaspoon beef bouillon
4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Put 2 quarts of water on to boil in a medium pot.
Fill a large bowl with ice and water.
Combine the brown sugar, butter, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, beef bouillon and garlic with one cup of water in a small pot on the stovetop.  Stir over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved.  When water has come to a boil, add the green beans, and cook for 3-4 minutes.
Drain beans in a colander, then plunge green beans into the cold water for a few minutes.
Place the par-boiled green beans in a gallon storage bag.
Pour the butter mixture over the green beans.  Shake until everything's coated.
Take a bundle of green beans (5-7) and wrap them with a piece of prosciutto. Secure with a toothpick if necessary. Place the bundles in a shallow baking dish.
Pour remaining sauce over the bundles.
Cover and marinate the bundles in the refrigerator overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and remove bundles from the refrigerator.
Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes, checking at 20 and 30 minutes for doneness.
