Ingredients:
1 (8 pound) fully-cooked, bone-in ham
1/4 cup whole cloves (optional)
1/2 cup apricot preserves
3 tablespoons honey mustard

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Score the fatty side of the ham with a sharp knife in a diamond pattern, spacing the lines about 1 inch apart. Insert whole cloves at the intersections, if desired. Place the ham in a shallow roasting pan and cover with aluminum foil.
Bake the ham in the preheated oven for about 90 minutes. About 10 minutes before the ham is finished, measure the apricot preserves into a small saucepan. Warm over medium heat until liquid, then remove from the heat and stir in the honey mustard.
Brush the glaze onto the ham, and return to the oven, uncovered, and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, or until the glaze is nicely browned. Let the ham stand for about 10 minutes before carving and serving.
