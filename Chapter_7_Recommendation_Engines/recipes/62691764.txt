Ingredients:
1 lb. ground beef, cooked and drained
1 15 oz. can refried beans
2 t. oregano
1 t. cumin
3/4 t. garlic powder
Lasagna noodles, uncooked
2 1/2 c. water
2 1/2 c. salsa
2 c. sour cream
3/4 c. sliced green onions
1 small can black olives, sliced and drained (opt)
1 1/2 c. shredded Jack cheese or Mexican cheese

Directions:
Oven to 350.  In medium bowl mix cooked and drained ground beef (I rinse my beef), the refried beans, oregano, cumin, and garlic powder.  Mix well to ensure all spices are evenly mixed throughout.  In a 9 x 13 pan place a layer of uncooked lasagna noodles on the bottom to cover the whole pan.  Spread half of the meat and bean mixture over the noodles.  Repeat process.  Top 2nd layer of meat and bean mixture with another layer of lasagna noodles.  In a medium bowl mix the water and salsa.  Pour over the top of the mixture. I try to move the pan around to get the liquid to seep in a little.  Cover with foil and bake for 1 hour.  After it is cooked mix the sour cream, chopped green onions and olives together in a small bowl. Spread over the top of the hot dish. Top that with the cheese.  Put foil over the pan again and let stand for 30 minutes to set and complete the process.  Cut as desired.
