Description: 
I originally called this Haitian Hot Sauce, but have found, in my travels, similar sauces on many Caribbean Islands.

This is a refrigerator recipe (canning implements optional) and may be kept in an airtight jar for about a month.

White vinegar is more authentic, but we like cidar vinegar better.

Serve it as a condiment at your next picnic.
