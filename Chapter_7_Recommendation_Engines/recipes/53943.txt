Ingredients:
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
3 leaves fresh basil, minced
2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons cold water
2 eggs, beaten
3 cups oil for frying
12 pumpkin or zucchini blossoms

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, basil and Parmesan cheese. Mix in water and eggs until smooth.
Heat 1/2 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, dip blossoms in the batter to coat, and gently place a few at a time into the hot oil. Fry on each side until crisp and golden. Drain on paper towels.

Description: 
My Italian grandmother makes these every year when the zucchini in her garden start to blossom. She is Sicilian and calls them 'cripelli.' It's sort of like a fritter and so yummy. As an alternative, you could also chop up the blossoms and mix them up in the batter and drop by teaspoons into the hot oil.
