Ingredients:
2 cups tri-color rotini pasta
2 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and diced
2 fresh figs, chopped
1/2 cup diced red onion
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
3 tablespoons sliced black olives
3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
1 clove garlic, minced
Dressing:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
2 tablespoons sour cream
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 lime, zested and juiced
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Mix apples, figs, onion, basil, black olives, mint, and garlic together in a large bowl.
Whisk mayonnaise, Pecorino Romano cheese, sour cream, sugar, vinegar, lime zest and juice, salt, and pepper together in a separate bowl.
Add cooked rotini to apple mixture, stir, and pour dressing on top. Mix well and refrigerate, covered, for at least 30 minutes. Serve chilled.
