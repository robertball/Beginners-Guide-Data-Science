Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups butter
3/4 cup HERSHEY®'S Cocoa or HERSHEY®'S Dutch Processed Cocoa
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 eggs, separated
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 (8 ounce) package HERSHEY®'S MINI KISSES™ Milk Chocolate Baking Pieces
2 teaspoons HERSHEY®'S Cocoa or HERSHEY®'S Dutch Processed Cocoa, sifted

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 F.  Grease bottom of 9-inch springform pan.
Melt butter in medium microwave-safe bowl; add 3/4 cup cocoa and 1 cup sugar, stirring until well blended.  Cool 5 minutes.
Stir in flour and vanilla; add egg yolks, beating well after each addition.  In medium bowl, beat egg whites with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar until soft peaks form; gradually fold into chocolate mixture with baking pieces.  Spoon batter into prepared pan.
Bake 15 to 18 minutes or just until edges are firm (1-inch circle in center will be soft).  With spatula, loosen cake from side of pan.  Cool completely on wire rack; remove side of pan.
