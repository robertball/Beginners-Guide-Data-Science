Ingredients:
16 ounces dry fettuccine pasta
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 pounds medium shrimp - peeled and deveined
salt and pepper to taste
2 teaspoons paprika
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 green bell pepper, sliced
1 tablespoon minced shallots
1 teaspoon chopped garlic
2 tablespoons brandy
1/2 cup sour cream
1 cup plain yogurt
4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain and set aside.
Heat butter or margarine in a large skillet.  Add the shrimp, salt and pepper to taste and paprika. Stir with a wooden spatula. When the shrimp become pink (it should take 2 to 3 minutes), remove them with a slotted spoon, leaving the cooking liquid in the skillet.
Add red and green bell peppers, shallots, garlic and salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring, about 3 to 4 minutes over medium high heat. Add cognac and shrimp. Cook over medium heat for 2 more minutes.
Add sour cream and yogurt and blend all together. Add cilantro and bring to a simmer for about 30 seconds. Do not boil or sauce will separate. Serve over cooked fettuccine.
