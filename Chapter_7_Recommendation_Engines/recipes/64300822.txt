Ingredients:
1 cup of whole wheat flour
1/2 cup of oat bran
1/3 cup of Organic cold-pressed canola oil (Can use safflower oil OR Coconut Oil as well)
1/2 cup of organic no sugar added applesauce
2 ripe bananas
1 cup of shredded carrots
1 small zucchini
2 eggs
1 tsp of baking soda
1 tsp of cinnamon
1/4 tsp of ground nutmeg
1/4 tsp of ground ginger
1/4 tsp of salt

Directions:
1. Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees F.
2. Mix together canola oil, applesauce and eggs in a large mixing bowl.
3. Put carrots, zucchini and bananas in a food processor and chop fine. (I did this, because if Els found a long shred of carrot in the muffin, that would have been the end of the muffin.)
4. Once chopped, pour into mixing bowl with the applesauce, oil and eggs.
5. Stir in dry ingredients: whole wheat flour, oat bran, baking soda, cinnamon, ground nutmeg, ground ginger and salt.
6. Spoon in muffin batter 2/3 full. And bake for 15 minutes.
