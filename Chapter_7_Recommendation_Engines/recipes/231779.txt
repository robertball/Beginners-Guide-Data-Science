Ingredients:
Chocolate syrup:
2 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons water
1 1/2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tiny pinch salt
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup nonfat dry milk powder
2 teaspoons nonfat dry milk powder
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon cream of coconut (such as Coco Lopez速) (optional)
1 2/3 cups Irish whiskey (such as Jameson速)
1 cup half-and-half
1 teaspoon instant coffee (such as Folgers速)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Stir sugar, 2 1/2 teaspoons water, cocoa powder, and salt in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar and salt. Let cool and stir in 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract.
Whisk confectioners' sugar, both amounts of dry milk powder, and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer mixture until smooth and thick, stirring often, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool and stir cream of coconut into milk mixture.
Combine chocolate syrup, milk mixture, Irish whiskey, half-and-half, instant coffee, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and almond extract in a blender; blend on high speed for 30 seconds. Bottle mixture and refrigerate. Liqueur will stay fresh in refrigerator at least 2 months. Shake bottle well before serving.

Description: 
This end product is a little lighter, and the recipe is a little more in-depth then some of the other recipes available. It will allow you to tailor some of the ingredients more to your taste. There have been many variations of this liqueur, but this one is the most accurate to store brands of Irish cream. It is also the most flexible. Store brands do not use Hershey's速 chocolate syrup in their recipe. This one should have a better consistency and taste a little more proper to the famous brand 'B' from Ireland if followed directly. You be the judge.
