Description: 
The time we first wandered into the Ginza district of Tokyo, we found a 'hole-in-the-wall' restaurant with a lunch special of shabu shabu. Didn't know what we were in for, but by ordering and waiting until the table next to us had also been served, we learned the approach to this Japanese beef and vegetable fondue. The name is supposed to be the sound made by the cooking tidbits in the broth.
