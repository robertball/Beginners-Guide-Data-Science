Ingredients:
1 pound hamburger
3 carrots, sliced
1/2 onion, diced
Salt & Pepper to taste
Water (about 1/2 C)
5 or 6 large red potatoes, peeled and diced
Water for boiling
1-2 C milk or cream
3 T butter
Salt to taste

Directions:
Start by making the tatties. Boil water for potatoes. When the water is boiling, cook the potatoes until soft.
While the potatoes cook, brown hamburger in a large skillet.
When only a little pink still remains in the meat, add onion and carrots. Continue cooking until onion is translucent and carrots are slightly softened and bright orange.
Drain potatoes, mash, and stir in butter to melt and combine. Add milk or cream a little at a time, letting it soak into the potatoes before stirring - drier potatoes will need more milk; mealier ones will need less.
Salt potatoes to taste.
Back to the mince: When carrots are starting to soften, add a small amount of water (just enough to barely cover bottom of pan), cover, and let steam until the carrots get soft, adding water as needed.
Salt and pepper mince to taste.
Place tatties in center of plate, and spoon mince on top.

Description: 
Mince and Tatties is like Scotland's answer to paella: everyone makes it differently, and everyone is convinced they have the real recipe. This is how my Granny made it, and how I make it today when I need a quick, soothing meal. I've tried to dress it up in various ways, but in this case simple really is best. It's not real healthy, but it is comforting as all get out!
