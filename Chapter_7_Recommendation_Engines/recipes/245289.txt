Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup walnuts, chopped (optional)
1 cup eggnog
1/3 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup rum
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners or grease.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl; mix in walnuts.
Combine eggnog, melted butter, rum, egg, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until just moistened, forming a lumpy batter.
Pour batter into prepared muffin cups and bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.
