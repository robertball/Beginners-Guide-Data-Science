1.  Mix dry ingredients well.
2.  Add wet to dry, and combine well.  Make sure there aren't obvious strings of egg white.
3.  Let batter sit for 2 to 3 minutes to thicken up some (leave too long & it gets to thick to spread)
4.  Pour batter onto pan and spread it in roughly a rectangle an inch or two from sides of pan.
5.  Bake for about 20 minutes or until it springs back when you touch the top and/or is visibly browning.
6.  Cool and cut into what size slices you want.
