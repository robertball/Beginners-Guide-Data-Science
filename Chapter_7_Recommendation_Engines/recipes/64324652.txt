Ingredients:
1/4 pounds beans, green, halved
1/8 pounds peas, sugar snap, strings removed
1/2 tablespoon basil, fresh, finely chopped
1/2 tablespoon parsley, fresh, finely chopped
1/2 tablespoon onion(s), red, minced
1 teaspoon vinegar, sherry, (or red wine vinegar)
1/2 teaspoon mustard, Dijon
1/2 clove(s) garlic, minced
1 tablespoon oil, olive, extra-virgin
salt, to taste
peppercorns, black, freshly ground, to taste
2 cup(s) salad greens, baby, lightly packed (about 1 1/2 ounces)
1/2 small cucumber(s), peeled, halved, seeded, and thinly sliced
1/2 small pepper(s), red, bell, diced

Directions:
Bring a medium saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the green beans, return to a boil, and cook for 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or skimmer, transfer the beans to a colander and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking. Transfer to a plate.
Add the snap peas to the boiling water and cook for 30 seconds. Drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking. Halve the snap peas lengthwise. Pat the beans and snap peas dry.
In a cup, whisk together the basil (and/or other herbs), parsley, onion, vinegar, mustard, and garlic. Drizzle in the olive oil and whisk to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
In a large serving bowl combine the beans, snap peas, lettuce, cucumber, and bell pepper. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat.
