Description: 
This incredible creamy soup was the surprise favorite at our 2000 Halloween party.  Better yet, it's really easy to make - and beautiful, served in its own attractively carved pumpkin-bowl, with a seasonal ribbon tied through the 'hat' to make a handle.  This 'definitely' belongs on the holiday table again! If you're going to multiply the recipe but want to serve in one bowl, get a bigger pumpkin rather than more little ones.
