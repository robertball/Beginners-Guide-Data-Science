Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh tomatillos - husked, peeled, and halved
1/2 cup cilantro leaves
1/4 cup chopped white onion
1 jalapeno pepper, diced
1 serrano pepper, diced
1 lime, juiced
1/8 teaspoon white sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Place tomatillos cut side down on a baking sheet.
Broil in preheated oven until slightly charred, about 5 minutes.
Transfer tomatillos to a food processor with cilantro, onion, jalapeno pepper, serrano pepper, lime juice, and sugar; pulse until well mixed.

Description: 
Broiling the tomatillos gives this salsa a subtly smoky taste. If you are sensitive to spicy food, remove the seeds from the peppers. This salsa is perfect as both a dip for taco chips and to top enchiladas suizas.
