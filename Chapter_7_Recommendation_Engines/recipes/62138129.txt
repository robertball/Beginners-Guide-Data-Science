Ingredients:
1 box Red Velvet Cake Mix
3 Eggs
1/2 cup Butter or Margarine
8 oz Cream Cheese
2 1/4 Cups Powder Sugar
1/2 tsp Vanilla
1 cup Chopped Pecans (optional)

Directions:
Heat over to 350 degrees and spray a 9x13 cake pan with non-stick spray.
Mix butter, one egg, and cake mix together.  Press the mixture into bottom of cake pan.  If using the pecans, sprinkle the nuts over the cake mixture.
Combine cream cheese, vanilla, remaining two eggs, and 2 cups of powder sugar with electric mixer.  Mix on medium speed for 3 minutes.  Pour cream cheese mixture over cake mixture.
Bake for approximately 35 minutes until the top is slightly browned.  Do not over cooked or the cream cheese topping will not stay gooey.
Once the dish has completely cooled, sift remaining powder over the top of the dish.  Do not try to cut the cake until after it has cooked.  The cream cheese mixture will deflat some as it cools...this is supposed to happen.
