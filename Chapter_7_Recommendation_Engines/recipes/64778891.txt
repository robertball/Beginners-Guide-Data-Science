Ingredients:
(3) Cups Water
(1/2) Cup Dried Elderberries
(2) Cinnamon Sticks or (1/2) Teaspoon Ground
(2) Whole Star Anise
(1/4) Teaspoon Cloves (Ground or Whole)
(1/2) Teaspoon Ground Ginger
(1) Tablespoon Orange Peel (Fresh or Dried)
(1/2) Cup Honey

Directions:
Pour water into medium saucepan and add berries and spices.
Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally (a spatula will come in handy for the next step), then reduce to a simmer.
Simmer uncovered for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally and smooshing the berries against the side of the pan, until the liquid has reduced by almost half (roughly 2 cups).
Remove from heat and let cool until safe to handle.
Pour through strainer or cheesecloth into a jar or bowl, add honey and stir well.
That's it!  Store in a 16oz glass bottle or jar (I reuse kombucha).  Store in refrigerator to keep it fresh for months.

Description: 
Easy to make, but very effective, syrup for coughs and colds.   Recommend taking (1) tablespoon daily during flu season and take (2) tablespoons once or twice a day if you're getting sick.  Take straight, add to tea or coffee or blend in a smoothie (my personal favorite).
