Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup water
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
2 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, combine brown sugar, cocoa and flour.  Stir in water, a little at a time, to make a smooth paste.  Stir in milk and butter.  Bring to a boil over medium heat and let boil 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.  Let cool completely at room temperature, stirring often to prevent a skin from forming.  Store in refrigerator after cooling.

Description: 
This is a great sauce for a fresh fruit dip, but also great over ice cream.  This  sauce thickens more as it cools. If it's too thick you can thin it with some milk or cream to the consistency you like.
