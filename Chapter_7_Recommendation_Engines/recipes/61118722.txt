Ingredients:
1 (16 oz) package pork sausagemeat
1 (17.25 oz) package frozen puff pastry sheets, thawed
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1 beaten egg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Unfold the puff pastry sheets, and cut along the fold lines of each sheet to form 6 equal squares for a total of 12 squares. Brush each square with mustard. Divide sausage into 12 pieces, and roll into small logs. Place one log on each square. Roll dough around the sausage, and seal with a bit of beaten egg. Place rolls onto an ungreased baking sheet, and brush the tops with the rest of the egg.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the rolls are puffed and golden. I usually watch after 10 minutes or so to make sure they don't burn.  These freeze (unbaked) very well.
>>  There's an Irish pub, here in Seattle, that makes these &#151; they cook the onion and sausage, first, then add the bread crumbs, some egg and herbs. They, then, wrap it in puff pastry dough and bake. This may make it a bit less greasy and, of course, cooked through in less time.
>>  I'm English and I think the secret of this recipe is the Dijon mustard. I added 1 Tbsp each of onion powder and sage to the sausage meat. Don't skip the Dijon!
>>  I cooked the sausage and drained the fat before filling the pastry dough. This cut down on the greasiness.
>>  This recipe is very easy and quick. I  added 2 shredded carrots, 1/2 finely chopped onion and 1/2 cup of finely chopped mushroom. Turned out wonderful. Also I made the rolls smaller so that I got 24 rolls out of the recipe.
>>  These were tasty, a little greasy, but good. Will definitely make again. Liked the puff pastry much better than using crescent rolls as we've done before.

I had never heard of these until I met my husband, Mark, who is English. They are simple and delicious! They freeze really well too.Modified from: Mark's English Sausage Rolls
