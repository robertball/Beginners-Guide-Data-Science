Ingredients:
3 garlic scapes
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
1/3 cup tahini
1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, or more to taste
1/8 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon snipped garlic chives (optional)

Directions:
Remove the blossom end and the opposite fibrous end of each garlic scape. Remove any fibrous skin by breaking the scapes into 1-inch pieces and peeling it off. Keep the skin on young and pliable scapes; chop coarsely.
Place drained garbanzo beans in the bowl of a food processor. Add chopped scapes, tahini, lime juice, and chili powder. Process until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if hummus is too stiff. Pulse until hummus has the desired consistency. Season with salt.
Transfer to a bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with snipped garlic chives.

Description: 
If you can get your hands on garlic scapes during the very short season, they make a very tasty garlic substitute in hummus. If not serving right away, transfer hummus to a container, drizzle with olive oil, and close tightly with a lid and refrigerate.
