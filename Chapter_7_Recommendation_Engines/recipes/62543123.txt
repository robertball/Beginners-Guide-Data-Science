Ingredients:
1 14.5 oz can of salmon
1/4 cup finely diced onion
1/3 cup finely diced red bell pepper
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 1/4 cup breadcrumbs, divided
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon red pepper (more if you like heat!)
For the Lemon-Dill  Cream:
1/3 cup sour cream
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons fresh or freeze dried dill (chopped if fresh)
a dash of red pepper
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
Extra virgin olive oil and butter for sauteing.

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the salmon, the onion, the red bell pepper, the egg, 1/4 cup of the breadcrumbs, the parmesan cheese, the Dijon mustard, 2 tablespoons of the mayonnaise, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1/8 teaspoon red pepper.  Stir to combine.  Cover and refrigerate while you prepare the Lemon-Dill Cream.
In a small bowl, combine the sour cream, 1/3 cup of the mayonnaise, the fresh lemon juice, the dill, a dash of red pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder.  Stir to combine.  Refrigerate until serving time.
Spread the remaining 1 cup of breadcrumbs in a shallow baking dish.  Create 8 equal patties out of the salmon mixture, and coat with breadcrumbs on both sides.
In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and 1/2 tablespoon of butter over medium heat.  Add the salmon cakes and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until lightly browned.  You may have to cook them in two batches.  Add a little extra oil and butter between batches.
When finished cooking, remove the salmon cakes to a pan lined with paper towels.  Keep warm in the oven until ready to serve.  Serve with the Lemon Dill Cream.

Not your average salmon patty!  The quality of the salmon makes a difference; buy the best quality you can find.  Serves 4 as an entree, or for an appetizer you can make 16 mini cakes and serve 8.
