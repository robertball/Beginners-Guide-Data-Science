Ingredients:
1/2 cup fat free butter flavored granules
2 (14.25 ounce) cans fat-free, reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 1/2 cups diced celery
1 large onion, chopped
1 1/2 cups diced fresh mushrooms
8 ounces Italian-style dry bread crumbs
8 ounces dry bread crumbs
3 tablespoons salt-free herb and spice blend

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, combine the fat free butter flavored granules and 1 cup chicken broth. Heat until boiling. Mix in the celery, onion and mushrooms. Slowly cook and stir 5 minutes, or until vegetables are soft.
Place the Italian-style bread crumbs and regular bread crumbs in a large bowl. Blend in the chicken broth mixture. Pour in remaining chicken broth and salt-free herb and spice blend. Mix thoroughly.
Stuff the Thanksgiving bird or bake in a cake pan at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for approximately 15 minutes.

Description: 
Cooking low fat is important to me.  I developed this stuffing recipe when my father had surgery and needed to go on a low fat diet. Chicken broth and fat free butter flavored granules provide traditional holiday flavor and keep the stuffing moist.
