Ingredients:
1 pound fresh cranberries
2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups water
2 (3 ounce) packages cherry-flavored gelatin (such as JELL-O®)
1 1/2 cups chopped celery
1 1/2 cups chopped, peeled apple
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Stir cranberries, sugar, and water together in a saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring often, until most of the berries have popped open, about 20 minutes.
Remove saucepan from heat. Stir gelatin into the cranberries mixture until dissolved completely; add celery, apple, and pecans and stir. Pour into a glass 13x9-inch dish.
Refrigerate until set in the center, 10 to 12 hours.

Description: 
This is a recipe my grandma made for a local JELL-O® contest. She won first place! It is a delicious salad like nothing I have ever seen. I grew up eating this cranberry salad every year at Thanksgiving. It reminds me of my grandma, who I loved so much!
