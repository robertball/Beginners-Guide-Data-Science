Description: 
There is an outdoor country-style restaurant in Havana, Cuba that serves only white rice, French fries and a delightful chicken with all the sauce you want. Someone gave me this recipe, and it's similar to the one served at that restaurant. The orange juice and lemon juice give it a sweet, pungent flavor.
