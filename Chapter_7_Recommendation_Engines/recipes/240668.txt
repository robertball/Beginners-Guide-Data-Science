Ingredients:
1 pound bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1/2 cup butter
1 cup finely chopped onion
1 cup chopped celery
2 tablespoons poultry seasoning (such as Bell'sÂ®)
2 loaves day-old white bread, torn into small pieces
2 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat until cooked through but still slightly soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels, retaining bacon drippings in the skillet.
Melt butter in a separate skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion and celery until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir bacon and poultry seasoning into onion mixture.
Mix onion-bacon mixture and bread pieces together in a large bowl; fold in eggs. Spoon bread mixture into muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are crispy, about 25 minutes.
