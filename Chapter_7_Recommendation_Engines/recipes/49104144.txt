Ingredients:
2 lbs.		spinach (4 bunches)
1 lb.		bacon, diced
1/2 cup 	salad oil
2 large 		cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 cup 	red wine vinegar
1/2 cup 	lemon juice
4 tsp 		Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp 		dry mustard
1/4 cup 	Amaretto
to taste 	Salt and pepper
1/4 lb.		mushrooms, sliced
1 		small red onion, sliced

Directions:
Wash spinach. Remove large stems and tear into bite-size pieces. Store in plastic bags in refrigerator until ready to use.
To make dressing:
Place bacon in a large skillet. Cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until bacon is crisp and all fat is rendered. Remove bacon, reserve 1/8-cup bacon fat, discard rest. Return bacon fat to skillet and add oil, garlic, vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, amaretto, salt and pepper. Simmer until blended.
When ready to serve, place spinach, mushrooms, onion and reserved bacon in large salad bowl. If you like a wilted salad, pour the dressing over very hot; if not, let cool a bit before serving; toss well.
