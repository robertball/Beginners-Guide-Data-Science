In a large pot heat canola oil. Add onion, garlic, jalapenos & Anaheim peppers. Saute until aromatic (About 8 minutes). Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, cilantro, mango, sugar, cinnamon, salt, pepper, brother/stock, pasilla, cumin, lime zest & juice, and shredded chicken.
Bring to a boil. Lower heat to low and simmer at least 45 minutes. While this chicken filling is simmering I fry my corn tortillas until they are nice and crispy!
