1/3 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided

Stir in ground beef and pancetta, and cook until browned and crumbled; drain off any excess liquid, and return to heat. Add marinara sauce, wine, and red pepper flakes, and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in cream, half of the Parmesan cheese, and rice. Simmer 5 minutes more, or until most liquid has absorbed.

Description: 
This Bolognese filling is spicy, meaty, and creamy. If you're in a hurry you can serve it over pasta instead of filling the peppers; just omit the rice or orzo.
