Ingredients:
1 large orange, juiced
3 tablespoons dark French mustard
3 tablespoons olive oil
4 teaspoons dried oregano
salt and pepper to taste
10 potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
1 (3 pound) half leg of lamb, bone-in
5 cloves garlic

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In large bowl, whisk together the orange juice, mustard, olive oil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Stir the potatoes into the bowl to coat with orange juice mixture. Remove potatoes with a slotted spoon, and place them into a large roasting pan.
Cut slits into the lamb meat, and stuff the garlic cloves into the slits. Rub remaining orange juice mixture from bowl all over the lamb, and place the lamb on top of the potatoes in the roasting pan. If there's any remaining orange juice mixture, pour it over the lamb.
Roast in the preheated oven until the potatoes are tender and the lamb is cooked to medium, about 1 hour. A meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Check every 20 to 30 minutes while roasting, and add a bit of hot water if you find the potatoes are drying out. If the lamb finishes cooking before the potatoes, remove the lamb to a cutting board or serving platter and cover with foil while the potatoes continue to bake in the oven.

Description: 
In Greece, meat (lamb, beef, chicken) and potatoes in the oven is an ubiquitous dish throughout the winter. Upon my most recent visit to Athens, my aunt let me in on a secret that takes this traditional dish to another level. Instead of the usual lemon juice, she said, add the juice of one orange. I tried this upon my return home and it is absolutely delicious! It may be awhile before I go back to lemons -- and this dish is as delicious as it is simple.
