Ingredients:
2 beaten eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup flour
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
2 tablespoons vanilla flavoring

Directions:
Heat a lightly greased skillet on medium heat.
Combine all ingredients and beat until well mixed.
For each crepe, remove skillet from heat and spoon 2 tablespoons of batter onto pan. Roll around until bottom of pan is evenly coated. Return skillet to heat and lightly brown one side only. Place a paper towel on one hand and invert the crepe onto it, then stack onto plate.
