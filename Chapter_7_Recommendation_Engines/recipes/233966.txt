Ingredients:
4 medium apples
4 caramel apple sticks
1 (9 ounce) package Werther's Original Caramels, unwrapped
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray.  Wash apples by gently rubbing with an abrasive scrub sponge and a few drops of dish detergent.  Rinse and dry well; remove stem.  Push sticks into tops of apples; set aside.
Microwave caramels and milk in a tall deep microwave-safe bowl or 2 cup glass measure on HIGH for 2 1/2 minutes or until melted, stirring after 1 1/2 minutes.
Dip and swirl apples in melted caramel mixture, using a spoon to spread evenly.  Place on prepared pan and refrigerate at least 15 minutes or until caramel sets.
