That's the Best Frosting I've Ever Had Recipe

Ingredients:
5 Tbsp. flour
1 C. milk
1 tsp. vanilla
1 C. butter, softened (not too soft)
1 C. superfine (Baker's Sugar) granulated sugar (not confectioners sugar)

Directions:
In a small saucepan, whisk flour into milk and heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens. You want it to be very thick, thicker than cake mix, more like a brownie mix. Stir in vanilla, mix well.
Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature. It must be completely cool before you use it in the next step, place a piece of saran wrap directly on top of the mixture while cooling so it doesn't form a skin on top. While the mixture is cooling, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. You don’t want any sugar graininess left. Then add the completely cooled milk/flour/vanilla mixture and beat the living daylights out of it. If it looks separated, you haven’t beaten it enough! Beat it until it all combines and resembles whipped cream.
Grab a spoon and taste this wonderful goodness. If there is any left after your taste test, spread it on a cooled chocolate cake.
Cut yourself a piece and put it on a pretty plate. Grab a fork and prepare to experience the most divine pairing you can imagine. This frosting on chocolate cake is to die for. Sure, the recipe sounds strange — it has flour in it — but it’s sublime. Try it, you’ll see. You’ll love it so much you won’t go back.
