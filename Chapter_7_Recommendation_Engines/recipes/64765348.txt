WW Mexican Rice Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup long grain brown rice
1 can no salt added diced tomatoes
1/2 cup cooked onion (cook with non stick spray)
1 TBS garlic powder
1 tsp cumin
1 TBS extra virgin olive oil
1 1/4 low sodium beef broth OR vegetable broth
1/2 cup chopped green chilis
cilantro for garnish

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. In a food processor or blender, combine the tomatoes, onion and garlic, and blend until smooth. In a liquid measuring cup, measure out 1 cups of the tomato mixture and discard the rest.
2. Warm the olive oil in a medium Dutch oven* over medium heat until shimmering. Add the rice and green chilis and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Add the beef broth (watch out for splatters), tomato mixture (add a little extra if you’re using fresh tomatoes that aren’t super flavorful), and salt. Stir to combine, then increase the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a boil.
4.  Cover the pot with the lid and carefully transfer it to the oven. Bake until the liquid is absorbed (the rice will look dry when you take off the lid, but don’t worry) and the rice is tender, about 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking.
5.  Stir in the cilantro and season to taste with additional salt, if necessary (I often add another ¼ to ½ teaspoon). If you’d like spicier rice, add a pinch of red pepper flakes and stir again. Serve with lime wedges on the side.
