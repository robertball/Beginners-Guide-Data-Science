Ingredients:
1 bottle dry white or rose wine (I used a white zinfandel)
2 cups strawberries, hulled and halved
1 cup blueberries
1 jar maraschino cherries, drained and stems removed
1/2 cup pomegranate schnapps
1/4 cup sugar
Club soda

Directions:
Add the strawberries, blueberries,and cherries to a pitcher.
Pour in the wine and the pomegranate schnapps.
Gently stir in the sugar.
Cover and let sit in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours - or, preferably, overnight.
To serve, fill a glass about 2/3 of the way full with ice cubes. Pour the sangria in about 2/3 full, and add a few pieces of the fruit. Top off with club soda.
*For the Fourth of July we sliced apples into the shape of stars for a festive touch.  You could also use star fruit if available.
