Ingredients:
sour cream
brown sugar, to taste
Kahlua, vanilla or other similar flavoring, optional (I usually don't use any flavoring)

Directions:
Stir together sour cream and enough brown sugar for your taste & desired level of sweetness.
The sugar dissolves quite quickly, so it's ready to use within minutes.
Refrigerate leftovers (if you have any!)

Submitter: 
Deena Kordt
Description: 
Carmelly, creamy and not too sweet, this 2-ingredient dip is great for last minute fresh fruit enhancement.
