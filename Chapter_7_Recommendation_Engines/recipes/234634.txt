Ingredients:
1 (30 ounce) package cheese ravioli
1/2 cup mascarpone cheese
2 tablespoons butter
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups skim milk
1 cup pumpkin puree
1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon nutmeg
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/3 cup pine nuts

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in ravioli and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until ravioli float to the top and filling is hot, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain.
Melt mascarpone cheese, butter, and a pinch black pepper in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir milk, pumpkin, Pecorino Romano cheese, brown sugar, cinnamon, 2 teaspoons salt, and nutmeg into mascarpone cheese mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until sauce thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Add cooked ravioli into sauce and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Top each serving with pine nuts.

Description: 
This recipe was inspired by a delicious ravioli I had at a restaurant (Cactus Club's butternut squash ravioli). I converted it into a pumpkin sauce and incorporated some of the same ingredients found in pumpkin pie. It's easy to make and takes only 20 minutes from start to finish. Perfect autumn comfort food.
