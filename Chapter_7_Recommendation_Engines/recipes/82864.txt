Ingredients:
4 slices SARA LEE® Soft & Smooth™ Whole Grain White Bread, cubed
1/4 cup chicken broth
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
salt and pepper to taste
1 (3 pound) whole chicken
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 lemons
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon dried sage

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread bread cubes evenly on a baking sheet, and toast until browned.
In a mixing bowl, stir together toasted bread cubes, chicken broth, egg, and lemon juice. Season with 1/2 teaspoon rosemary, and salt and pepper to taste. Spoon into bird. Don't overstuff; depending on the size of your bird, you may not need all the stuffing.
Rub the outside of the chicken with the olive oil. Cut 1 lemon in half; cover the opening of the bird with a lemon half and stuffing (save the other half for garnish). Pour the juice of the second lemon over the bird. Season the bird with the salt, paprika, 1/4 teaspoon rosemary, and sage. Place in a roasting pan.
Cover, and cook in preheated oven for 1 to 2 hours. Remove the cover after 45 minutes to brown. Baste often. The chicken is done when the thigh meat reaches an internal temperature of 180 degrees F.  The stuffing should be 165 degrees F.
