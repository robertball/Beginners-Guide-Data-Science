Ingredients:
For the Salt Wipe:
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 cup cold water
1 (10 pound) bone-in prime rib roast
1 1/2 cups coarse sea salt, or as needed
1/2 cup Himalayan pink salt, or as needed
kosher salt to taste

Directions:
Dissolve kosher salt in water and use it to wipe down the prime rib. Pour enough sea salt over a rimmed sheet pan to cover it completely; sprinkle pink salt on top. Place a roasting rack over the salt. Place prime rib on the rack and refrigerate at 34 to 38 degrees F (1 to 3 degrees C), uncovered, 30 to 40 days.
Remove prime rib from the fridge. Trim off fat as needed. Transfer the rack into a roasting pan and place prime rib on top. Spray the surface with water and season generously with kosher salt. Refrigerate 24 to 48 hours to let meat absorb salt.
Remove prime rib from fridge and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let warm up slightly, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Insert a probe thermometer into the prime rib.
Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Reduce temperature to 300° F (150° C). Bake for about 90 minutes, or until desired doneness is reached, 125° F (52° C) for rare, 130° F (54° C) for medium-rare, or 135° F (57° C) for medium. Let rest for 30 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
If you're thinking about dry-aging your own prime rib of beef for the holidays, start here. After lots of research, I decided I'd have to age the beef at least 30 days for any noticeable change in flavor; it ended up going for 42 days before baking. The meat came out extremely juicy and tender but somehow never developed that funky fermented flavor I wanted. It might've tasted a bit more concentrated, though, after having lost 2 pounds of water weight.
