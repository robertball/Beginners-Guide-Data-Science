Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 garlic clove, coursely chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 zucchini, chopped
1 yellow squash, chopped
2 carrots, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 cup sliced mushrooms
4 cups vegetable broth
1 teaspoon paprika
4 teaspoons dried basil
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
2 cups dry couscous
1 (16 ounce) can chickpeas, drained (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in large pot over medium-low heat. Place onion, garlic, zucchini, yellow squash, and carrot in pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions begin to soften and turn translucent, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the red and yellow peppers and mushrooms; cook another 3 minutes. Vegetables should still be firm.
Pour in the vegetable stock and season with basil, paprika, cardamom, salt and pepper. Add chickpeas.  Bring mixture to a boil; reduce heat to low. Slowly pour in the couscous; stir. Cover pot immediately and remove from the heat. Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork. The couscous should have absorbed about half the cooking liquid.
Serve at slightly warmer than room temperature.
