Ingredients:
2 BL/SL chicken breast halves
6 ounces cream cheese, softened
5 ounces frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
4 ounces canned mushrooms, drained and chopped
4 to 6 sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, chopped
¾ tsp garlic powder
¾  tsp dehydrated onion
½ pound bacon
Toothpicks

Directions:
Combine cream cheese, spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, garlic powder, and onion powder and let sit 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, butterfly chicken breasts and pound out so they are equal in thickness.
Spread cream cheese mixture over chicken breasts and fold over.  Wrap ½ of the bacon over each of the breasts and secure with toothpicks.  Place in a prepared baking dish.
Refrigerate at least 1 hour to allow filling to set.
Do not add water to the pan before baking.  The bacon grease will provide moisture for the chicken.
Bake at 350 for 1 hour or until juices run clear.

Description: 
I came up with this one day when I was tired of the same old baked chicken.  The creamy filling really gives a great kick to the chicken.  My husband, who is a very picky eater, went back for seconds.
