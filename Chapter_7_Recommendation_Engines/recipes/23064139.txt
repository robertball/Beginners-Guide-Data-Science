Ingredients:
1 11-lb(ish) less sodium fully cooked bone-in ham
24 whole cloves
cooking spray
1-1/2 cup Champagne or sparkling wine, divided
1 2-inch piece vanilla been, split lengthwise
1 cup apple jelly

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
If you aren't using a cooked ham, cook according to directions.
Trim fat and rind from ham. Score outside of ham in a diamond pattern, and stud with cloves. Place ham, bone end up, in a roasting pan coated with cooking spray.  Pour 1 cup Champagne over ham.  Bake at 350 for 45 minutes.
Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into small saucepan.  Add vanilla bean and 1/2 cup Champagne to pan. Bring to a boil; cook 2 minutes. Stir in apple jelly; cook 3 minutes or until jelly dissolves, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Discard vanilla bean. Pour half of Champagne mixture over ham. Bake 30 minutes; pour remaining Champagne mixture over ham. Bake an additional 30 minutes or until ham is thoroughly heated. Place ham on a platter; cover loosely with foil. Let stand 15 minutes.
Place a zip-top plastic bag inside a 2-cup glass measure or bowl. Pour drippings into bag; let stand 10 minutes for fat to rise to the top. Seal bag; carefully snip off 1 bottom corner of bag. Drain the drippings into a bowl, stopping before the fat layer reaches opening; discard fat. Serve sauce with ham.
