Ingredients:
3 large eggs
1 cup canned pumpkin
1 cup almond butter
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon pumpkin spice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1.5 teaspoon agave nectar

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 350F, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, combine all of the ingredients and mix until a smooth batter forms. Use a 1/4 cup to scoop the batter on the parchment-lined baking sheet, forming about 4 pancakes per baking sheet. (I use two pans, to bake them all at once!)
Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the pancakes are fluffy and golden. No need to oil a frying pan, and no need for flipping. It doesnâ€™t get much easier than that!
