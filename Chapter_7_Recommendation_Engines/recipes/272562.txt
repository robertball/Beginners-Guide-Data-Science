1 pound soba noodles
1/2 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
1 (1 1/2 inch) piece ginger root, minced

2 tablespoons miso paste
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon mirin
3 green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Bring lightly salted water to a boil in a large pot. Add soba noodles; cook, stirring occasionally until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Set aside.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ginger and garlic until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
Mix ginger, garlic, miso paste, lime juice, and mirin together in a small bowl. Pour salad dressing mixture over soba noodles. Top with green onions, sesame seeds, and cilantro. Chill until serving.

Description: 
Traditionally, this soba noodle salad is served cold. Mirin is a sweet wine that can be found in most Asian grocery stores. I do not know of any substitute.
