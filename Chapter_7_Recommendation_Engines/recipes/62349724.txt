Ingredients:
- Groundnut oil; 2 Tablespoons, for frying
- Scallops; queen sized, 12, halved
- Butter; unsalted, 3 Tablespoons
- Onion; medium, 1, finely chopped
- Garlic; medium clove, 1, crushed
- Lemongrass; 2 stalks, finely sliced (can soften it first by hammering it, or plunging it in boiling water for 30 secs)
- Flour; plain, 2 Tablespoons
- Fish stock; 250 ml (1 cup)
- Coconut Cream, 250 ml (1 cup)
- Red chilli; 1, finely sliced (more if YOU want)
- Kafir Lime Leaves; 4, torn rather than halved with a knife
- Thai fish sauce (Nam Pla); 2 teaspoons
- Fresh lime; juice from 1 lime
- Coriander (cilantro) leaves to garnish

Directions:
Pre-heat somewhere to keep the scallops warm.
In a small skillet or wok or chef's pan, heat the oil, then sear quickly the scallops on each side. Remove and keep warm. (The pan is no longer required, nor the oil!)
In a saucepan, melt the butter, then gently fry, almost sweat, the onion, garlic and lemongrass for 2 or 3 minutes.
Add the flour, stir well to mix thoroughly, and cook for 1 or 2 minutes.
Add the stock, the coconut cream, chilli(es), lime leaves, fish sauce and lime juice. bring to the boil then turn the heat down and simmer gently for 20 minutes.
Plate up the scallops, 6 each for a main, 2 or 3 for a starter, and strain the sauce over the top.
