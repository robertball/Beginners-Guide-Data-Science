Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup corn syrup
2 tablespoons corn syrup
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups quick cooking oats
1/2 cup chopped strawberries
1/4 cup white chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 13x9-inch glass baking dish with cooking spray.
Place butter in a large microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 1 minute. If butter has not melted, microwave 30 seconds longer. Pour 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons corn syrup, brown sugar, and vanilla extract into melted butter; stir until combined. Add oats and mix to combine; mixture may be a bit thick but do not add additional liquid.
Stir in strawberries and white chocolate chips. Spoon batter into the prepared baking dish and lightly press mixture into the dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden on top, about 25 minutes. Allow to cool before slicing into bars.

This is a fast recipe using basic ingredients. The beauty of this recipe is how customizable it is. A favorite of mine is using peaches, pecans, white chocolate, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon.
