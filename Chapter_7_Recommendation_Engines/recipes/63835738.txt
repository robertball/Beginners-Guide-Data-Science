Description: 
This recipe from the Florida Keys is a great marinade for chicken, and it only takes 30 minutes from prep till you can grill! It's a great blend of flavors with honey, soy sauce, and lime juice. If you have time, try marinating overnight for the fullest flavor.Modified from: Key West Chicken
