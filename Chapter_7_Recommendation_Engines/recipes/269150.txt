Ingredients:
1 cup ketchup
7 3/4 ounces chipotle sauce (such as La Costena®)
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
1/4 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons finely diced white onion
3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro
1 (16 ounce) package cocktail sausages

Directions:
Combine ketchup, chipotle salsa, orange zest, orange juice, Worcestershire sauce, onion and cilantro in a bowl. Mix chipotle-orange sauce until thoroughly combined.
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Add the chipotle-orange sauce and cocktail wieners and stir to blend. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 1 minute. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 15 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Sprinkle cilantro on top and serve immediately, or switch the multi-functional pressure cooker to slow cooker mode to keep warm.
