Ingredients:
1LB Large Shrimp P&D (Tail Off)
2Tbs EV Olive Oil
1Tbs fresh squeezed Lime Juice
1/4tsp fresh ground black pepper
1 Cup chopped onion
1 Cup chopped green pepper
1 med fresh minced Jalapeno pepper
1/4 tsp crushed red peppers
16oz Lime and Garlic salsa
1/2 Cup unsweetened coconut milk
1/2 cup fresh cilantro
8oz Risotto or 12oz Hot Cook Rice

Directions:
Peel and de-vein fresh shrimp - toss w/ 1 Tbs of Oil, Lime Juice, Salt, Pepper and Cilantro - set aside...
Heat remaining oil in skillet(I found a no-stick wok was easy) over med-med high heat, add onion, green pepper and Jalapeno pepper (remove seeds for less heat, Omit pepper for no added heat) - cook for 4-5 minutes until onion is tender.
Stir in Coconut Milk, Salsa and Red Peppers (omit for no heat) and heat to a boil, then simmer over low heat for approx 10 minutes stirring occasionally.
When reduced to a thicker sauce and flavor seems nice add shrimp "mix" and allow Shrimp to cook until done (approx 4-5 min depending on size)
Serve over rice or risotto and garnish with lime wedge and cilantro leaf if desired - serve immediately...
NOTE: I only found Garlic salsa so I added 1/2 of a limes juice to it

Description: 
Created by my Step Mom, Suzanne, this is a gentle spiced shrimp dish that looks and tastes phenominal - served over rice or risotto this is a family pleaser and not too tough on the budget...
