Ingredients:
For sauce
3 onions, chopped
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 T teaspoon fresh oregano
1 1/4 T  fresh thyme
7 garlic cloves, minced
3 (28- to 32-oz) cans organic crushed tomatoes in thick purée
1 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup fresh squeezed orange juice
For lasagna
18 (7- by 3 1/2-inch sheets) dry non gluten lasagna (1 lb)
2 lb fresh mozzarella (smoked or plain), chilled and coarsely grated (5 cups)
1 cup freshly grated parmesan
grape seed oil

Directions:
Make sauce:
Cook onions in 1 T olive or grape seed oil with oregano and thyme in a 4-quart saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until onions are softened. Add garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add tomatoes and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 18 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in parsley and fresh squeezed orange juice.
Preheat oven to 375°F. and rub 2 (13- by 9-inch) baking dishes with grapeseed oil.
Assemble lasagna:
Soak lasagna sheets in hot water to cover by 1 inch until softened and flexible, about 20 minutes.
Spread 1 1/2 cups sauce in each baking dish and top sauce in each dish with 3 drained pasta sheets, overlapping if necessary. Sprinkle 1 cup mozzarella and 1/4 cup parmesan evenly in each dish. Top with 3 drained pasta sheets per dish, overlapping if necessary. Repeat layering with 1 cup mozzarella, 1/4 cup parmesan, 1‚ cups sauce, and 3 drained pasta sheets in each dish. Finish assembling lasagna by topping each with 1‚ cups sauce. (You will have leftover sauce and mozzarella.)
Bake lasagna, covered with foil, in middle of oven 30 minutes. Remove foil and sprinkle evenly with remaining 2 cups mozzarella. Bake until bubbling and cheese has melted, about 10 minutes more.
Serve lasagna with some of remaining sauce, reheated. Cooks' notes:
• Sauce may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered.
• You can make and bake lasagna 1 day ahead up to point of adding last layer of mozzarella. Cool completely, then chill, covered. Bring to room temperature before reheating with final layer of mozzarella, covered, in a 375°F oven until hot, 20 to 30 minutes.
