Ingredients:
2 tbsp chia seeds + 6 tbsp water
3 medium to large ripe bananas, mashed (the more ripe the better)
1 cup Silk unsweetened cashew milk (almond or coconut are great, too)
¼ cup creamy peanut butter
¼ cup pure maple syrup (optional for sweetness, I omitted and used 15 drops of liquid stevia)
½ tsp vanilla extract
1 scoop chocolate plant-based protein powder (I use Vega Chocolate Protein + Greens)
3 cups old fashioned oats (gluten-free if necessary)
2 tbsp cocoa powder
1 tbsp baking powder
pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Spray muffin tin with cooking spray.
In a small bowl, stir together chia seeds and water to make "chia eggs." Alternatively, you could use 2 large eggs. Set aside.
Place bananas in a large bowl and mash with fork. Add cashewmilk, peanut butter, optional maple syrup or stevia, and vanilla and stir until well mixed. Stir in chia eggs.
Add protein powder, oats, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Stir until combined.
Spoon mixture evenly into muffin tin. You can fill the tins to the top. You may have some leftover batter. Bake for 25 minutes.
Remove from oven and cool in pan on a wire rack. Once completely cool, store in an air-tight container in the refrigerator.
