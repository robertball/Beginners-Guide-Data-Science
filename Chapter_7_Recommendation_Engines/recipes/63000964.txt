Ingredients:
1 Cup Organic Apple Sauce
1 15.5 oz can Black Beans, drained and rinsed
1 1/2 cups Oat Flour
1 cup cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup agave syrup
2 eggs
1/4 cup coffee
1 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350^F.  In a food processor, blend the applesauce and black beans.  In a bowl whisk the oat flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt.  In an electric mixer, whisk the agave and eggs together until light and foamy.  Reduce mixer speed to medium low and add coffee until just combined.  Add bean and applesauce mixture and vanilla to the egg mixture until combined.  Add oat-cocoa mixture all at once and whisk on low until combined then increase speed and whisk until smooth (about 30 seconds).  Divide batter amongst 12 mini loaf pans or 16 small cupcake tins and bake 20-25 minutes or until loafs spring back when poked.
