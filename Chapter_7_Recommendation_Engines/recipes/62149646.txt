Ingredients:
2 cups instant white rice
1 can of mushrooms
1 can french style green beans
2 cups shredded cheese
Salt/Pepper to taste
1/4 pound ground beef (if desired)

Directions:
Drain mushroom juice into a 2 cup measuring cup.  Finishing topping the cup off with water until you have two cups.  Add to sauce pan, bring to boil, add two cups rice and cook until done.
In a loaf pan, add drained french style green beans and mushrooms and mix together.  Add cooked rice and cheese. Mixing well. Microwave until cheese is melted and dish is hot.
That is the original recipe, but if you have left over ground hamburger meat or chicken you can add this to the recipe for a one pan meal.  The original recipe will fill the loaf pan to the top so you might choose to go to a larger pan if you add meat to the original mixture.
Also, with the amount of of cheese in it, it is pretty salty. So you might want to make without seasoning on the first trip so you estimate seasonings based on your taste.

Description: 
My grandmother made this recipe on special occasions while I was growing up, and it still one of my favorites!  As an adult, I found you can make a one dish meal by adding left over ground beef or chicken.
