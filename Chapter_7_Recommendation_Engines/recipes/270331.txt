Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 pounds boneless chicken breasts, cubed
1 small onion, diced
2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, minced
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 1/2 cups picante sauce
1 cup long-grain rice, rinsed and drained
1 (15.25 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15.25 ounce) can corn, drained
1/2 lime, juiced

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Add oil, chicken, and onion. Cook until onion is soft and chicken is no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Add chipotle peppers, bell pepper, cumin, and oregano. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Turn pot off.
Add broth, picante sauce, rice, black beans, corn, and lime juice to the pot with the chicken. Stir to combine. Close and lock the lid. Select Manual function and set timer for 4 minutes. Allow 10 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Let mixture stand until thickened, about 2 minutes. Ladle into serving bowls and garnish with desired toppings.
