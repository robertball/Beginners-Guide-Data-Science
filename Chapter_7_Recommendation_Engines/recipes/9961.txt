Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups ground walnuts
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander seed
1/4 teaspoon anise seed
1 1/4 cups shortening
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
2 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate

Directions:
In a medium size bowl, combine the flour, walnuts, baking powder, and spices.  Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream the vegetable shortening with the sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients. Cover and chill for 8 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
On a floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Cut into rounds using a 2-inch round cookie cutter  and place 1-1/2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, until golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
Melt chocolate over low heat and drizzle over cooled cookies.
