Ingredients:
2 tablespoons curry powder
2 teaspoons seasoned salt
2 teaspoons onion powder
3 large skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into cubes
olive oil, or to taste
1/2 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 potato, chopped
20 ounces fresh spinach, torn
5 cups coconut milk

Directions:
Mix curry powder, seasoned salt, and onion powder in a bowl; add chicken and toss to coat chicken in seasoning mix.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes; add chicken, potato, and spinach and stir. Pour coconut milk over the mixture and stir. Place a lid on the skillet, bring the mixture to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potato is tender and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes.
