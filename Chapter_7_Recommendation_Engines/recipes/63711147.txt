Black Bean Burgers Recipe

Ingredients:
1 Sweet Potato, Washed and pricked with a fork
1 Can Black Beans, rinsed and drained
3 Scallions, green parts only, minced
2 tsp. garlic, minced, (about 2 cloves)
1 egg
3/4 cup breadcrumbs
Salt, to taste
Pepper, to taste
Minced jalapeno pepper and/or crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
2 Tbsp olive oil, for brushing
2 Dozen Slider buns

Directions:
Heat the oven to 375. Bake potato for 40 to 45 minutes. Allow to cool.
Peel the sweet potato. Mash the beans and sweet potato in a bowl with a potato masher until roughly half the mixture is pureed. Fold in the scalllions, garlic, and egg; stir. Stir in the breadcrumbs, adding more until the mixture is moist enough to bind together, but not so wet it sticks to your hands. Season with salt, pepper, jalopeno and red pepper flakes if using.
Shape the mixture into approximately 24 small balls of equal size. Flatten each one into a 2 1/2" patty and put on a baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray.
Brush each patty with olive oil.
Bake the patties for about 10-12 minutes. Remove pan from oven and use a thin spatula to carefully flip each patty. Brush them again with oil or keep cooking them until they are a little crispy around the edges, 2 to 3 additional minutes. Serve the burgers on buns with guacamole or condiments of your choosing.  Can be frozen for up to 6 months.
