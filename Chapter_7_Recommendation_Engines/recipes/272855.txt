Ingredients:
2 (6 ounce) lobster tails
2 slices lemon, plus more for garnish
2 teaspoons butter
1 pinch dried parsley
1 pinch granulated garlic

Directions:
Fill a large pot with warm water. Attach the sous vide cooker to the pot and set the temperature to 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54 degrees Celsius) and the time to 30 minutes.
Cutting the underside of the lobster tail with kitchen shears and remove the fins; carefully lift the meat out.
Place 1 slice of lemon in the bottom of a resealable zip-top bag. Place lobster tail over lemon and spread with butter. Season with a pinch of parsley and garlic. Seal the second half of the lemon, lobster, butter, and seasonings this way in a second bag.
Use the water immersion method to remove all air from the bags and place into the pot, securing with tongs so they are fully immersed.
When the time is up, remove the bags from the pot, open, and move the tails onto a warm plate.
