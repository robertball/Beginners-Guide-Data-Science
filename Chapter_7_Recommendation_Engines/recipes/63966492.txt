Ingredients:
1 1/2 to 2 p9ounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs (4 or one  thigh per family member)
3 garlic cloves smashed and chopped
1 tsp dried basil
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup ketchup
1/3 cup honey

Directions:
Use a 4 quart slow cooker ( if using a 6-quart, this will cook faster)
Put the chicken into the cooker.  In a small bowl, combine the rest of the ingredients, then pour evenly over the top.  Cook on low for 6 hours or high for 3-4 (I'd go with low)
Serve with basmati rice or quinoa and steamed or roasted vegetables.
