Ingredients:
4 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 onion, diced
3 carrots, diced
1 zucchini, diced
1 potato
2 cups spinach
3/4 cup bread crumbs, more as needed

Directions:
Heat a thin layer of oil in a medium sized skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the onion, carrots, and zucchini.  Cook for about 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft with a bit of color.
Cook the potato in the microwave, or any preferred method until fully cooked. Peel the potato.
Put the cooked onions, carrots and zucchini in a food processor, as well as the potatoes and spinach. Pulse until it is finely ground, but not puréed. Little chunks of vegetable should still be visible.
Put the breadcrumbs in a wide dish.
Take around 1/8 cup of the vegetable mixture, it can be eyeballed, and roll it into a shape similar to a chicken nugget. Roll it in breadcrumbs, and continue until all of the mixture is gone.
Freeze the nuggets for at least 15 minutes, or longer, until needed.
Once they are frozen, put a thin layer of oil coating the bottom of a skillet.  Heat the oil until sizzling hot.
Put the nuggets in to the hot oil, and do not over crowd the pan. This will have to be done in batches.
Do not touch the nuggets so they can develop a crust. Once the nuggets get brown on one side, flip them and do the same on the other side.
When done, take them out and drain on a paper towel.
Repeat until all of the nuggets are cooked.
An alternate method for cooking could be to bake the nuggets in a 400° oven for 15 minutes, or until crusty and golden brown.
