Ingredients:
1 Pizza Dough (See My Dough Recipe, Or At Walmart In the bakery)
2 oz pizza sauce, your choice Or see my recipe.
2 Ounces Of mozzarella cheese
1 Oz of pepperoni
1 Oz of onion, chopped (Optional)
2 small mushrooms, sliced (Optional)
1 oz of black olives, sliced (Optional)
1 oz of ham (Optional)
1 oz of sausage (Optional)
1 oz of bacon (Optional)
Red Pepper flakes to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 500F
Roll out 1/4th of the dough on a greased Crisco (not oiled) min pizza pan for each serving.
Add pizza sauce to top
Spread cheese out on the top
add onions, green pepper, mushrooms, ham, sausage, and pepperoni
Put in oven for 10 mins
The top should brown, And if you pick up the crust the bottom should be browned.
A Dark And Heavy Pizza Pan Is Better Since It Will Brown The Bottom Of The Crust Better Than A Cheap Aluminum Pan. The Pans I use are Pizza Hut pans that I bought from a wholesaler that supplies Pizza Hut with there pans (They are 20 or so years old now).
If you add meats like Sausage, Ham, Bacon, Peperoni, etc. It tends to be better if you use a low sodium pizza sauce, Spaghetti sauce, has a higher level of sodium than canned tomatoes, or pizza sauce. so when selecting a store bought sauce read the sodium levels.

Description: 
I remember when I was a Kid About 6 Years Old (About 50+ Years Ago) Going To A Pizza Joint In Newberg New York With My Family, And Having Pepperoni Pizza. Also my mom would make Appian Way Pizza. Later she started making her own crust, and it became a once a week meal for us. So I have some fond memories of Pizza from when I was a kid.
