Ingredients:
1 package onion soup mix, or equivalent homemade
I cup uncooked long grain rice
10-12 bone-in skin on chicken thighs, my "value packs" have 10 very large thighs

2 1/2 cups chicken stock or broth, I use low sodium.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
In a large bowl, combine Golden Mushroom soup and chicken broth, mix well.
Sprinkle dry soup mix on the bottom of a large (min. 13x9)  baking dish.
Sprinkle rice over the soup mix.
Place chicken on top of rice.
Pour soup mixture slowly over all.
Bake uncovered for 1 1/2 hours.

Description: 
This is super quick to put together for busy days and hectic schedules.
Freeze any leftover rice, it's good as a quick side for pork or beef too.
