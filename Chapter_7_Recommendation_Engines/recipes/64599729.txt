A creamy and delicious soup that tastes just like Panera Bread!
Author: Alyssa
Serves: 4
Ingredients
1 tablespoon melted butter
½ medium chopped onion
¼ cup melted butter
¼ cup flour
2 cups half-and-half cream
2 cups chicken stock
½ lb fresh broccoli (about 1 cup)
1 cup carrot, julienned
¼ teaspoon nutmeg
8 ounces grated sharp cheddar cheese
salt and pepper to taste
Instructions
Saute the onion in 1 tablespoon melted butter and set aside. In a large pot whisk together the melted butter and flour over medium heat for about 3-4 minutes.
Slowly whisk in the half and half and chicken stock. Let it simmer for about 20 minutes.
Add the broccoli, carrots, and onions. Let them simmer on medium low for about 25 minutes until the broccoli and carrots are tender.
Add nutmeg, salt and pepper and sharp cheddar cheese. Let the cheese melt and then serve. For a smoother soup puree it in a blender... but I love the chunks!
