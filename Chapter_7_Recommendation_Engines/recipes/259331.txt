Ingredients:
1 cup soy milk
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1/2 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste
1 1/2 cups sunflower oil, or more as needed

Directions:
Combine soy milk, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, and sea salt in a blender; blend until smooth. Slowly add oil while blender is running in a thin steady stream. Vegan mayonnaise should be thick, but still runny. If it is too thin, turn on blender again and add more oil.
