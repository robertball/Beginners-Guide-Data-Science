Ingredients:
8 cups vegetable oil for frying
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon water
2 tablespoons shortening
1/2 cup white sugar
2 egg yolks
1/2 cup Herman Sourdough Starter
1/4 cup buttermilk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup applesauce
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Heat deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  In a small bowl, dissolve baking soda in warm water.
In a large mixing bowl, cream shortening and sugar. Beat in egg yolks, Herman sourdough starter, buttermilk, vanilla extract, applesauce and dissolved baking soda.  Mix together cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder and flour. Stir flour mixture into the wet ingredients until smooth.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll out to 3/4 inch thickness. Cut out the doughnuts and let stand for 10 minutes before frying.
Heat deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Carefully slide doughnuts into hot oil. Fry until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.
