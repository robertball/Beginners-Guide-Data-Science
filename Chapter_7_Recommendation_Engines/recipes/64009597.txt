Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 packets sazon seasoning (about 2 teaspoons)
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
4 center-cut bone-in pork chops
(about 2 1/2 pounds)
1 14 .5-ounce can petite diced tomatoes
1 pound potatoes, peeled and sliced into 1-inch rounds
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
2 bay leaves

Directions:
Combine the flour, cumin, sazon, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl. Season the pork chops on both sides with some of the seasoned flour, then transfer to a 6-quart slow cooker.
Add the tomatoes, potatoes, onion, bell pepper, 1/4 cup cilantro, the garlic and bay leaves to the bowl with the remaining seasoned flour; toss. Pour the vegetables over the pork chops. Cover and cook on high, 4 hours.
Transfer the pork chops to a platter. Skim off the fat from the cooking liquid and discard the bay leaves. Stir the vinegar and the remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro into the slow cooker; season with salt and pepper. Serve the pork chops with the vegetables and cooking liquid.
