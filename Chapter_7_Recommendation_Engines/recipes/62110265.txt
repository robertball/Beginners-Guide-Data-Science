Description: 
This soup is modeled after a soup my grandmother raved about after coming back from San Antonio. After many trials, I've finally came up with the perfect soup. It is easily tailored to meet everyone's tastes. The cubes of cheese get very soft and are a bite of cheesy goodness in this wonderful soup.  By using corn chips instead of frying, a food processor to shred the chicken, and prepared stock makes the recipe ready in about 30 minutes. Wouldn't recommend canned chicken, as it gives it a different taste all together.
