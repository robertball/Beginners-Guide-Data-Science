Ingredients:
Chicken Taco Meat:
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
4 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon onion powder
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste
18 ounces boneless skinless chicken breast, sliced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
Broccoli Slaw:
1/4 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger
2 teaspoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon rice vinegar
1 teaspoon cider vinegar
1 teaspoon honey
1/2 lime, zested
1 1/8 cups broccoli coleslaw mix
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 green onion, chopped
Bang Bang Sauce:
1/8 cup sour cream
1/8 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®)
1/2 lime, juiced
4 low-carb flour tortillas (such as Mission® Carb Balance®)

Directions:
Set a slow cooker to High and add 1 teaspoon olive oil. Whisk brown sugar, soy sauce, ginger, onion powder, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes together in a small mixing bowl.
Place chicken and garlic into the slow cooker, sprinkle with sea salt, and stir. Pour in soy sauce mixture and combine. Turn the slow cooker to Low and cook until chicken is no longer pink, about 4 hours.
Whisk ginger, soy sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons oil, rice vinegar, cider vinegar, honey, and lime zest for slaw in a large mixing bowl. Add broccoli slaw mix, cilantro, and green onion. Toss to combine and chill in the refrigerator until serving.
Place sour cream, mayonnaise, garlic powder, onion powder, Sriracha, and lime juice into a small mixing bowl and whisk together.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Wrap tortillas in foil.
Cook in the preheated oven until warm, 3 to 5 minutes.
Place taco filling evenly on tortillas, top with broccoli slaw, and drizzle with sauce.

Description: 
A slow cooker allows the chicken to get so tender, it just shreds apart while soaking up the delicious marinade. These are a perfect combination of sweet, tangy, and spicy in a tacolicious bite! I use a microplane rasp grater for the ginger and lime.
 Makes 4 soft taco-sized portions or 8 fajita-sized portions! Enjoy!
