Ingredients:
1/2 cup quinoa
1/2 cup steel-cut oats
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1/2 cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as CraisinsÂ®) (optional)
1/2 cup raw sunflower seeds
1/2 cup raw pumpkin seeds
1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes
1/4 cup chia seeds
1/4 cup flax seeds
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder (optional)
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste (optional)
1/3 cup honey (optional)
1/4 cup coconut oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix quinoa, steel-cut oats, almonds, cranberries, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, coconut flakes, chia seeds, flax seeds, cocoa powder, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.
