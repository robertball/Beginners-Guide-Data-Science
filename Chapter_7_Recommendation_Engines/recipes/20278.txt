Description: 
Luscious copy of a very famous brand name ice cream! All my little monkeys love this one! I have tried this with aspartame sugar substitute (the blue packets) to lower the sugar, and no one could tell!  For best results, transfer frozen mixture to a plastic freezer container and freeze for at least one hour before serving (if you can keep your kids out of it for that long!).
