Ingredients:
Grace's sister Billie always made the best Turkey. It was very moist, and if you ask me, it was her specialty! She makes it the day before serving, and reheats it in the broth, resulting in a moist and flavorful turkey that doesn't even need gravy!

Directions:
Wash and rinse the turkey, and put it in a roaster pan. Generously salt all over turkey and inside cavity. Fill the cavity with water until there is about an inch in bottom of roaster. With heavy duty reynolds wrap, tent and seal. Put a cookie sheet under for drips.
Put the giblets in pan by themselves--after they are cooked, use these and the meat from the neck for a very rich gravy.
For a 15lb turkey, about 5-5.5 hours, at 325.
Pour liquids out, reserving for gravy. Cool the turkey and remove meat, putting it in tupperware. Here is the trick!! Morning of serving, dribble broth over meat, especially drier white meat. Put the turkey back in the microwave in a large Tupperware, WITH THE LID SEALED. Reheat in the juices.
