2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup chopped onion

salt and ground black pepper to taste (optional)
2 whole wheat tortillas

Place tortillas in a clean, dry skillet. Evenly distribute mushroom mixture onto 1 half of each tortilla. Top filling with mozzarella cheese and lime juice; fold each tortilla over filling. Turn burner to medium heat and cook until quesadillas are browned and crispy, about 2 minutes per side. Cut into wedges and serve with salsa.
