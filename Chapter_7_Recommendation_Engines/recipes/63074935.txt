Description: 
This is a quick and healthy casserole that makes use of extra beans, rice and chicken in a fun and delicious way. Kids love it and they can help make it because the tortillas are shredded rather than rolled. It is easy to make and freezes well and can be made in large quantities. We serve it at school as part of our healthy lunch program and the kids love it!Modified from: Chicken Enchilada Casserole
