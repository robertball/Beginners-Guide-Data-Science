Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
1 cup shortening
1 egg
2 teaspoons lemon extract
5 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup sour milk
1/2 cup water
5 drops yellow food coloring

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream sugar and shortening. Add egg and extract.  Combine flour, baking soda and salt; add to the creamed mixture alternately with sour milk. Mix well. Refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a round cookie cutter. If desired, cut some circles in half and form into half moon shapes. Place on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until the edges begin to brown. Remove to wire racks to cool. Combine water and food coloring; brush over cooled cookies. Allow to dry completely. Store in airtight containers.
