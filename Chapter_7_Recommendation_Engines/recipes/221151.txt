Description: 
I didn't start out trying to make a creamy zucchini recipe, but when I glanced in the fridge and saw the last crumbled remains of fresh cream cheese, I knew those green cubes sizzling away in the skillet were about to get enriched. While I'd normally have a hard time feigning such excitement over squash, I'm actually quite thrilled with how this came out.
