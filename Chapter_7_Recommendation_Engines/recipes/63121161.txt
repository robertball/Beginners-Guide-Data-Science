Description: 
I love Chuy's dip and wanted a recipe. I took all the recipes I could find, bought some of the real stuff and made a bunch of batches. This is the closest i could get. No one can beat the real thing. You can adjust the jalepenos according to your taste. Also if you want a smoother texture, everything can be thrown in the blender after step 1. The longer is sits, the hotter it gets.
