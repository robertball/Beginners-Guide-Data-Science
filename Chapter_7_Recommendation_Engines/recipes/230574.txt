Description: 
A favorite recipe from my friend Kathleen. This is a quick and easy way to make a flavorful appetizer or a tasty side dish. I take them to office gatherings or serve as a side with a main meal. Everyone loves them. I don't like pickles, but I love these pickled carrots! You can substitute sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ® for the sugar.
