Ingredients:
2 Tbsp of olive oil, divided
8 pieces of boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 2 lbs)
1 medium onion, diced
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 medium zucchini, cut into rounds
1/3 - 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 orange or yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 cup low sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley
3 Tbsp of fresh basil, chopped
1 tsp of dried oregano
Sea salt and black pepper to taste
1 lemon, sliced

Directions:
Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper or to taste
.
Heat 1/2 - 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, then add the chicken and brown for 6 minutes on each side or until medium brown.
Remove chicken and set aside on a plate. Add another 1/2 - 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Add the onion and garlic and saute for about 1-2 minutes until softened. Layer on pieces of sliced zucchini cooking until slightly golden brown, a few minutes on each side - working in batches. Push aside the zucchini to one side and add the sun-dried tomatoes, then bell peppers and stir-gently
.
Transfer the chicken back to the pan and add chicken stock. Turn heat to medium low and cover until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is slightly reduced - about 7-9 minutes. Add in dried oregano and fresh herbs (cilantro, basil, and parsley) and allow to simmer for an additional 2 minutes uncovered. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste as needed.
Remove from heat and garnish with additional herbs if desired and serve with favorite sides.
