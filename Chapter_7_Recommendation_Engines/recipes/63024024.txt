Ingredients:
1/2 cup Corn Starch
1/2 cup Icing Sugar
1 cup all purpose flour
3/4 cup butter, softened

Directions:
Sift together dry ingredients. Add the softened butter and mix till smooth dough forms. I used my flat beater on my stand mixer for about 30 seconds.
Shape into 1 inch balls. If dough is too soft to handle, cover and chill 30-60 minutes. Place 1 1/2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten with a lightly floured fork. You can also roll to dough 1/4 inch thick and use cookie cutters to form your cookie. Add things like cherries or nuts to the center for example.
Bake at 300 F for 15-20 minutes or until edges are lightly browned.
For Crescents add 1/2 cup ground almonds or hazelnuts to flour mixture. Shape into logs about 1/2 inch thick and 3 inches long. Twist into crescent shapes. When baked and cool, dip ends into melted chocolate.

Description: 
My neighbor shared with me a cookie recipe that she found in her mother's belongings. Her mother had been famously making these for years and now I will continue the tradition. These are amazingly easy to make and taste better than any shortbread I have tried.
