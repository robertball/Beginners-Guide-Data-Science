Ingredients:
2tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil
Vegetable Oil - for frying Aubergines (Egg Plants)
2 Aubergines (Egg Plants) - cut into rounds (neither thick nor thin)
1 small clove Garlic - finely chopped
1 Onion - finely chopped
1 Jar Tomato Passata (Triturado)
2 Eggs - lightly beaten
Plain Flour - for dredging
Fresh Basil Leaves - torn
8tbsp Parmesan Reggiano Cheese - grated
2tbsp Mozzarella Cheese - grated
Knob Butter - for greasing Oven Dish
Salt - for marinating Aubergines
Salt and freshly ground Black Pepper

Directions:
AUBERGINE PREPARATION
Coat the aubergines with salt, place in a colander and leave to marinade for minimum 1 hour;
Then wash off salt with cold water and pat the aubergines dry with kitchen paper.
NAPOLITANO SAUCE
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onions and cook gently, stirring occasionally, for some 5 minutes or so until softened a bit;
Add and stir in the passata, torn basil leaves and season with salt and pepper;
Increase the heat and, stirring occasionally, bring to the boil;
Decrease the heat and simmer the mixture gently for some 20 minutes or so until sauce thickens slightly.
COOKING METHOD
Preheat oven to 150c/300f/Gas 2
Grease a shallow oven dish with a little butter;
Heat, at medium heat, sufficient vegetable oil (donâ€™t be mean) to cook the aubergine slices in large frying pan;
Dredge the aubergine slices through the flour, coating each side well;
Dip in egg mixture, again coating both sides well;
Fry the aubergine slices, in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan, until golden brown on both sides;
Place and layer the cooked slices in the oven dish - 4 layers maximum - covering each layer with the tomato sauce mixture and grated parmesan;
Sprinkle grated mozzarella over top layer and bake in oven for some 20 minutes or so until golden brown.
