Traditional Mexican Beans Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1lb of dry beans Pinto or Black
1 large Yellow onion, diced
1 small Sweet onion, diced
1 tbsp cumin
2 medium Jalapenos, seeded and chopped
3 Cloves of Garlic, chopped
1 large tomato, chopped
2 large Poblano peppers, roasted and chopped
1 stick of butter
Salt & Pepper to taste
1 cup of chopped salt pork (or one store bought portion, chopped)

Directions:
Soak the beans for three days, refreshing the water every day. Every 24 hours the water will accumulate a foul smelling foam; as the water soaks into the beans the sugars inside each bean are released into the water and float to the top. These are the sugars that cause gas, which is why I like to get rid of them.
After three days drain the water and rinse the beans.
Add the chopped onions, and the cumin, the chopped jalapenos, the tomato, the chopped salt pork, the stick of butter and the garlic.
Seed the Poblano peppers and broil them until slightly blackened on both sides, when you take out the Poblanos they should be near mushy on the inside. Chop those as well and add them to the pot.
Cover the entire pot with water and boil, covered, for 3 to 4 hours or until beans are tender.
Add salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
This recipe can be made using black or pinto beans. They taste identical to the kind of beans you would find in any good taqueria,and are always a hit with the family. When the beans are done all the ingredients besides the beans will have boiled down and, basically disentegrated, so all you see is the beans while you get full flavor, which makes this recipe very kid friendly.
