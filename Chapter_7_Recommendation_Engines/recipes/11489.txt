Roll dough into 1/2 inch balls and place firmly on a well greased cookie sheet. Cover cookies with a tea towel and let stand overnight. Cookies will rise and spread.

Description: 
This is my favorite cookie of all the ones my Nana made and taught me to make for the family. In her memory I share this recipe with you. My Grandmother Nancy (Saccuzzo) Gama made these for me every year until her death. Now, I make them in honor of her every year. You will enjoy these. Serve with wine or your favorite ice cream. They are also a great accent to a good cup of coffee.
