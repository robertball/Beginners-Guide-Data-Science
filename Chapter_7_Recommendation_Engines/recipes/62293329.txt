Ingredients:
Lihapyorykoita (Finnish Meatballs)
1 pound lean ground beef
1 finely chopped medium yellow onion
1 egg
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 cup of plain bread crumbs
½ cup whipping cream
¼ cup butter
Gravy
2 tablespoons all purpose flour or gravy flour
2 cups of milk
½ cup whipping cream

Directions:
Mix the meat, onion bread crumbs, egg, salt, allspice and the whipping cream and mix it together well.  Roll portions of the meat mixture into golf ball sized balls.  Melt the ¼ cup of butter in a large skillet and place about half the meatballs in the pan.  You will want to roll them around to ensure they get brown all over.  Remove the cooked meatballs and repeat with the other half.  Remove them as well when finished.
Once you have cooked the meatballs it’s on to the gravy. Shake/sift the flour into the skillet drippings of the meatballs and brown the flour.  Slowly pour the 2 cups of milk into the skillet while whisking quickly then pour the ½ cup of whipping cream in and stir until the gravy is smooth. (If you aren’t good at making gravy and end up with some lumps you can pour the gravy through a strainer.)  Place all the meatballs back into the pan and stir them until they are coated with the gravy and simmer for about 15-20 minutes.
