Description: 
The walnuts in this salad are really what makes this recipe stand out.  They are sweet and spicy!  The sweetness of the dried cranberries balances out the spiciness of the walnuts, while the blue cheese rounds it out.  With a tangy balsamic vinaigrette, this salad is indeed memorable.
