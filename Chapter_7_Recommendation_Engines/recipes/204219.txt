Ingredients:
6 slices Wonder® Classic White Sandwich Bread
2 large, ripe tomatoes
2 thin slices red onion, halved and separated into rings
1/2 cup thinly sliced cucumber
2 tablespoons minced fresh basil
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 cloves garlic, minced
Salt and pepper, to taste
Torn romaine or crisp lettuce (optional)
Shredded Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Cut bread into 3 strips; cut each strip into thirds, making 9 cubes. Arrange bread cubes in a single layer on a tray. Allow to stand at room temperature several hours, or overnight, until dry and crisp. Stir cubes once or twice to be sure they crisp evenly. Set aside.
Cut each tomato into wedges about 3/4 to 1-inch thick. Combine tomato wedges, red onion rings and sliced cucumber in a large salad bowl. Sprinkle with basil.
Whisk together oil, vinegar, garlic, salt and pepper. When ready to serve, drizzle dressing mixture over salad. Top with bread cubes and toss to combine. Spoon onto salad plates lined with torn romaine and garnish with Parmesan cheese if desired.
