Ingredients:
1 large onion, chopped
4 bone-in chicken thighs, skin and fat removed
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can great northern beans, rinsed and drained
1 (4 ounce) can fire-roasted diced green chiles
1 quart chicken broth
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon chile-lime seasoning (such as Trader Joe's®)
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon cayenne powder
1 (12 ounce) bag black bean rotini (such as Trader Joe's®)

Directions:
Place onion in a slow cooker. Place chicken thighs on top of onion. Add black beans, great northern beans, and chiles. Pour chicken broth on top and gently mix in chili powder, cumin, chile-lime seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne powder.
Cover and cook on Low until chicken is falling off the bone, 6 to 8 hours. Remove chicken thighs to a plate; discard bone and joint and shred meat with 2 forks. Return meat to the slow cooker.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and place pasta in a large serving bowl. Ladle chicken and bean mixture over noodles.

Description: 
This is our go-to winter dinner. The black bean pasta adds fiber, taste, and a fun weird black color to the dish! Garnish with fresh cilantro and grated Parmesan cheese.
