Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork
3 red potatoes
salt and pepper to taste
8 taco shells
1 cup iceberg lettuce, shredded
1 cup chopped fresh tomato
1/4 cup sour cream

Directions:
Place ground pork into a large skillet. Lightly brown, but don't completely cook. Shred the potatoes like hash browns. Add shredded potatoes to pork, mix together and add just enough water to cover the bottom of the skillet. Cover skillet and let simmer until potatoes are soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon pork mixture into shells and garnish with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream and any other toppings desired.

Description: 
My son is allergic to beef so I adapted many traditional recipes for him. These tacos are creamy and not spicy unless you want them to be.
