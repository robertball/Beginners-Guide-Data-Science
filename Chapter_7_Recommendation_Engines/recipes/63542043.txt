Ingredients:
1 stick butter, at room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 1/2 cup all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup mashed very ripe bananas
1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup ground or chopped walnuts or pecans

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 9x5x3 inch loaf pan; set aside.  With an electric mixer, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Add eggs and beat to incorporate.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.  Add to the butter mixture and mix until just combined.  Add bananas, sour cream, and vanilla; mix to combine.  Stir in nuts and pour into prepared pan.
3. Bake until a cake tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour 10 minutes.  Let rest in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a rack to cool.
