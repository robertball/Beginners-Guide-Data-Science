Description: 
This is such an easy appetizer that never fails to impress!  People are familiar with feta, but this traditional Greek way of preparing is not as well known.  The salty/sour taste of the feta offsets the heat of the chili flakes - so don't be afraid to load them on! Serve with crusty bread or toast.
