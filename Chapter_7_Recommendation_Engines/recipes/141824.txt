Ingredients:
2 cups cake flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter
1 1/3 cups white sugar
1 tablespoon lemon zest
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
5 eggs
1 quart fresh strawberries, cleaned, hulled and sliced
1/3 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups yogurt
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Sift the cake flour and salt into a bowl. Cream the butter with 1 1/3 cups sugar in a large mixing bowl until light colored and fluffy. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla until well blended. Mix in the eggs, one at a time, alternating with the flour mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake cake in preheated oven until top springs back when lightly touched, or a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Cool cake 15 minutes before turning out of pan.
Meanwhile, place strawberries in a separate bowl. Toss gently with 1/3 cup sugar, cover, and refrigerate until needed.
Combine the yogurt, heavy cream, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a bowl, and stir until well blended. To serve, top slices of cake with strawberries and a dollop of the cream mixture.

Description: 
Bright and refreshing, this is not your ordinary strawberry shortcake. The lemon pound cake is sweeter than a biscuit with just a hint of citrus. Topped with fresh strawberries and tangy, sweetened yogurt, this dessert is truly addictive!
