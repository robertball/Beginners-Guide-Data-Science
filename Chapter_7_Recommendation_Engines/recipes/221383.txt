Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 1/8 cups warm milk
1/4 cup white sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
6 tablespoons butter, softened
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
3 large apples - peeled, cored, and sliced
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup sifted all-purpose flour
2 ounces candied lemon peel, chopped (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Grease the bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch baking dish or a 9-inch springform pan.
Beat 2 1/4 cup flour, milk, 1/4 cup sugar, yeast, 6 tablespoons butter, vanilla extract, and 1 pinch salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high until dough is smooth, about 5 minutes; spread into baking dish and press dough up the sides. Press apple slices into dough.
Mix 1 cup sugar, 3/4 cup flour, candied lemon peel, cinnamon, nutmeg, and 1 pinch salt in a bowl. Cut in 1/2 cup butter with a knife or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; sprinkle over apples. Allow dough to rise for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven until cake is golden brown and apples are tender, about 35 minutes.

Description: 
I fell in love with apfelkuchen when I was in 6th grade. Our teacher let us order from a local German bakery and eat our treats in class once a month. These flavors bring back wonderful memories.
