2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, cut into chunks
1 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

In large bowl, place chocolate and butter. Microwave until butter is melted (about one minute on high) Stir until the chocolate is completely melted.
Whisk in sugar and vanilla.
Beat in eggs, one at a time. (Be sure the mixture is not hot enough to cook the eggs. If it is, set aside for a couple minutes.)
Add flour mixture, in 3 parts, alternately with milk, in 2 parts. The batter will thicken as the chocolate cools. Pour or spoon batter onto hot, greased waffle maker and bake according to directions on your waffles maker.
