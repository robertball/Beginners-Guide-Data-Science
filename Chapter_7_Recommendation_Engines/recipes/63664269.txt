Ingredients:
1 block of bakers chocolate (almond bark)
2 bags of caramels
pecan halves (or pieces if preferred)
1 t crisco
coarse sea salt

Directions:
Unwrap caramels.  Using a few at a time, soften in the microwave (very briefly--10 seconds) and then insert a pecan half in each caramel.
Melt your chocolate block with 1 tsp of crisco either on the stove or in the microwave.  Cutting the block in smaller pieces will help the chocolate melt more evenly without fear of burning.
Dip your caramels into the chocolate and place on a  parchment paper covered baking sheet.  Sprinkle immediately with a few granules of coarse sea salt and allow to cool completely.
