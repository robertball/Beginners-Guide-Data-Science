Description: 
My husband spent part of his childhood in Germany and craves traditional German fare.  I found a simple recipe for pork schnitzel that was really delicious.  Unfortunately one of the times that I went to make for my husband I was missing some of the ingredients so I experimented and came up with this version.  My family enjoys this so much I no longer make  traditional schnitzel for them.  This recipe is definitely rich and is not for anyone worried about dieting....I hope any who try this will enjoy this recipe.
