Ingredients:
1 cup milk (whole is best)
4 square inches of dark chocolate (I used Moser Roth 85% dark chocolate)
1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar (or to taste, depending on what kind of chocolate you're using)
1-2 tablespoons heavy cream; pinch of cinnamon to taste

Directions:
Pour milk into a saucepan and wait until hot.
Add brown sugar and stir until dissolved.
Add dark chocolate. I like to put it in a spoon and hold it in the hot milk until it is soft.
Turn off stove. Add heavy cream and cinnamon immediately. Stir.
Pour into a mug and top with whipped cream or marshmallows if desired. Serve hot.

Description: 
I was messing around in my kitchen one day and was craving hot cocoa. Since I only had dark chocolate on hand, I used that, and for a festive touch, added cinnamon.
