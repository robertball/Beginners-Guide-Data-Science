Description: 
White beans, sausage and fennel melt together to bring a comfort soup at its finest! Soaking the beans is a pain, but it tastes so much better.  Feel free to use canned beans instead.  I use a little of the bean juice to thicken the soup.  I absolutely HATE the taste of Fennel, but it really compliments the sausage very well.  You can also use a spicy sausage as well, for a little kick.
