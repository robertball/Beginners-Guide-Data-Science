Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 green onions, chopped
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 (14 ounce) package coleslaw mix
1/2 pound cooked small salad shrimp
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil
1/2 cup sweet and sour sauce

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add green onions, ginger, and garlic; cook for 5 minutes. Add chicken and soy sauce. Cook until chicken browns on both sides, about 12 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Add coleslaw mix, shrimp, and water; stir until coleslaw is wilted and shrimp is heated through, 5 to 6 minutes. Drizzle sesame oil on top. Serve sweet and sour sauce alongside.
