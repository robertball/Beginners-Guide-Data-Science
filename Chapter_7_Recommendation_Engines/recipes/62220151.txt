Ingredients:
Graham Cracker Crust
1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup margarine, softened
1/4 cup sugar
Filling
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup heavy cream, whipped
1 (12.5 ounce) can cherry pie filling (or other filling of your choice)

Directions:
Mix together graham cracker crumbs, margarine, and sugar in a bowl until well incorporated and crumbly.  Press into a pie plate, going up the sides as much as possible.
Beat together the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a bowl until smooth and spreadable. Whisk whipped cream into cream cheese mixture until smooth.  Pour cream cheese into prepared crust.  Smooth the top with a spatula, and refrigerate until firm, about 2 to 3 hours.  Spread the cherry pie filling over the top, and refrigerate until serving.
