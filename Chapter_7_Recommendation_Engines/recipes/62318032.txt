Ingredients:
Brussel Sprouts (amount depends upon size)
(Additional water and salt to soak the brussel sprouts)
I fresh garlic clove per pint jar
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper per pint jar
5 cups water
5 cups vinegar
scant 1/2 cup pickling salt.

Directions:
Trim brussel sprouts of bad or damaged leaves.  Soak for 15 minutes or so in cold salted water.  (This will remove any bugs that might be hiding in them)
If using whole brussel sprouts, cut an X in the bottom of the stalk end.  I usually cut them in half.
Place 1 garlic clove and 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper into each pint jar.  Fill with brussel sprouts to within 3/4 of an inch of the top of the jar.
Place vinegar, water and pickling salt into a pan and bring to the boil.  Leave 1/2 inch headspace.  Remove any trapped air.  I use a bamboo skewer.  Place lid and ring on jar and tighten.  Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes.  Store in a cool dark place for 3 weeks before eating.
