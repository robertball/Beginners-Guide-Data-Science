Description: 
Cauliflower rice is a great low-calorie dish to have in your arsenal especially if you are eating low-carb. Super low in carbs, yet such a satisfying dish you will forget it's made from a vegetable and not a grain. 

There are two reasons I opted for roasted riced cauliflower in place of sauteed: 

1) more flavor and 

2) better texture.
