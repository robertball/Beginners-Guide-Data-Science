Ingredients:
1 lb package of frozen popcorn shrimp
2 cups shredded cabbage
2 medium tomatoes, diced
1/4 cup mayo
1/4 cup sour cream
splash of lime juice
dash of cayanne hot sauce (Frank's Red Hot works good)
9 small tortillas (room temp or warmed)

Directions:
Prepare the pop corn shrimp as package directs.
While shrimp are cooking mix together mayo, sour cream, lime juice, and hot sauce.
Top each of the tortillas with a small amount of cabbage and tomatoes.
When shrimp are done add about 5 to 8 to each tortilla & drizzle with the sour cream/mayo mixture.
Note: baja sauce will vary each time you make it.

Description: 
These shrimp tacos use pop corn shrimp and a baja sauce. A favorite restaurant dropped shrimp tacos from their menu, so I set out to cure my craving.
