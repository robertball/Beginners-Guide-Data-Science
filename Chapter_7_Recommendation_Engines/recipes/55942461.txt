Ingredients:
Wet Ingredients:
1 (10.75 ounce) Can Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup
1 Egg
Dry Ingredients:
Equal Parts Flour and Cornstarch
Seasonings (cayenne pepper, garlic salt, black pepper all to taste)
And of Course:
Oil for Frying
Choice of Food to Fry (mushrooms, pickles, cheese,etc.)

Directions:
In a bowl combine the soup and egg; mix together. Set aside.
In a resealable plastic bag mix together the flour, cornstarch, and seasonings.
Lightly flour item of choice then dip in soup mix and coat well. Then place items in cornstarch mix and coat well.
Place coated items on a platter covered in wax paper and allow to sit until it becomes doughy (this is critical, to ensure crispiness when fried). Heat oil in a deep skillet over medium heat; be sure to use enough oil to cover items and allow free movement. Once items are doughy, test oil by dropping a piece of the 'dough' into it; the oil is ready when it starts to fry immediately. Oil should be heated to approx. 350-380 degrees depending on item of choice.
Fry items until browned. Strain and let sit on paper towels. Then serve and enjoy! Careful items will be HOT!

Description: 
The best batter recipe to use when wanting to deep fry food. I have done mozzarella sticks, pickles, mushrooms, and much more with this batter and everything comes out amazing. I add cayenne pepper, Lawry's Garlic Salt, and black pepper to the dry mix but you can adjust to seasonings to your liking.Modified from: Better Than Best Fried Chicken
