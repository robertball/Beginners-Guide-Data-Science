Ingredients:
35 fresh tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped
3 fresh hot chile peppers, seeded and chopped
4 red bell peppers, cored, seeded and cut into 2-inch pieces
1 large onion, chopped
2 cups apple cider vinegar
1/3 cup fresh lime juice, or amount to taste
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon salt, or amount to taste

Directions:
Place the tomatoes in a large pot over medium heat, and simmer 1 hour. Skim off any excess liquid or foam. Stir in the chile peppers, bell peppers, onion, vinegar, lime juice, white sugar, brown sugar, and desired amount of salt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 3 to 5 hours until liquid reduces and thickens. Adjust seasonings to taste.
Remove chili sauce from heat, and skim off any foam. Pour into hot, sterilized jars, leaving 1/4 inch headroom. Adjust lids. Process for 10 minutes in a boiling-water bath.
