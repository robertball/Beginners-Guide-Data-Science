Ingredients:
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
1/2 teaspoon curry powder

1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 pound ground turkey
SAUCE:
1 cup honey
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first eight ingredients. Add turkey; mix well. Form into 1 in. balls. Place in a greased 13-in.x  9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until juices run clear. Meanwhile, combine sauce ingredients in a small saucepan; cook and stir until heated through. Brush meatballs with 1/4 cup sauce; return to the oven for 10 minutes. Serve remaining sauce with meatballs for dipping.

Description: 
Turkey gives a different twist to these slightly sweet and spicy meatballs. For the holidays, I serve them on a tray lined with parsley and garnished with red pepper or pimientos.
