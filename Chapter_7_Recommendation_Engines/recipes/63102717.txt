Ingredients:
3 lbs. ground beef
1 onion, chopped
10 slices jarred jalapeño, chopped (more if you like it hot)
1 heaping spoonful minced garlic
1/2 jar chili spices
2 tbsp. Cumin
1 tbsp. Coriander
1 tbsp. Oregano
Salt and pepper to taste
1 cans diced tomatoes, puréed
1 jar tomato sauce

Directions:
Put olive oil in pan and saute onions, jalapeños and garlic until onion is tender.
Add in spices and stir frequently for a few mins to mix the flavors.
Add in ground beef and cook until the beef is done.
Add in the tomatos and sauce.
Put in a crock pot or simmer on the stovetop for about an hour.  The longer it simmers (with cover off) the thicker it becomes.
