Ingredients:
¼ cup butter
4  bone-in chicken breast halves, with skin
1 ½ cups chicken stock, or as needed
1 cup dry white wine
4 cloves garlic, peeled
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts, and cook until nicely browned on both sides. Pour in chicken stock and white wine, using enough chicken stock so that the chicken pieces are covered halfway to two thirds by liquid. Add whole garlic cloves. Reduce heat to medium-low,  sprinkle flour over the top of the contents of the pan and cover with a lid. Simmer for 40 to 45 minutes, until chicken is cooked through.
When chicken is cooked through, remove to a dish, and keep warm. Boil the liquid in the skillet until it is reduced to about 1 1/2 cups. Whisk cream into the reduced liquid, breaking up the garlic cloves as much as you can. Return chicken to the pan, and heat through.
