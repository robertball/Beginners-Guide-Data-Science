Ingredients:
2 tsp. fresh thyme leaves
1 tsp. whole fennel seeds
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/3 cup olive oil
1 or more large lemons, cut into 1/4 in slices (need enough to cover the bottom of the 12-in cast iron skillet)
1 yellow onion sliced 1/4 in thick
2 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced
4-pound chicken, spatchcocked
1/2 cup dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio
Juice of 1 lemon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
Place the thyme, fennel seeds, 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper in a mini food processor and process until ground. Pour the olive oil into a small glass measuring cup, stir in the herb mixture, and set aside.
Distribute the lemon slices in a 12-inch cast iron skillet so they cover the bottom, then do the same with the onion and garlic. Place the chicken, skin side down, on top of the onion and brush with about half of the oil and herb mixture. Turn the chicken skin side up, pat it dry with paper towels (VERY IMPORTANT), and brush it all over with the rest of the oil and herb mixture.
Roast the chicken for 30 minutes. Pour the wine into the pan (NOT ON THE CHICKEN) and roast for another 10-15 minutes...until the meat thermometer registers 155-160 in the thickest part of the breast.
Remove the chicken from the oven, sprinkle with fresh lemon juice and serve with the hot pan juices, cooked lemon and onions.
