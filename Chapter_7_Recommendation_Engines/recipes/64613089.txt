Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped
1 (16 ounce) can chili beans
1 (15 ounce) can black beans
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Mexican style beer
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chilies
1 lg can crushed tomatoes
2 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning
Red pepper to taste
4 whole skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)
sour cream (optional)
crushed tortilla chips (optional)

Directions:
Place the onion, beans, corn, tomato sauce, beer, diced tomatoes, and crushed tomatoes in a slow cooker.
Add taco seasoning and red pepper, and stir to blend.
Lay chicken breasts on top of the mixture, pressing down slightly until just covered by the other ingredients.
Set slow cooker for low heat, cover, and cook for 5 hours.
Remove chicken breasts from the soup and shred, when cool enough to be handled.
Stir the shredded chicken back into the soup, and continue cooking for 2 hours.
Serve topped with shredded Cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and crushed tortilla chips, if desired.
