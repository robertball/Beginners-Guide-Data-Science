Ingredients:
1/2 cup uncooked quick-cooking brown rice
1 pound extra lean ground beef
1 (26 ounce) jar Prego® Heart Smart Traditional Italian Sauce
6 medium green peppers
1 cup shredded fat-free mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Cook the rice without salt or butter according to the package directions.
Cook the beef in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often. Pour off any fat. Stir 2 cups of the sauce and the rice into the skillet.
Cut each pepper in half lengthwise. Discard the seeds and white membranes. Place the pepper shells in a 17x11-inch roasting pan.
Spoon the beef mixture into the pepper shells. Pour the remaining sauce over the filled peppers. Cover.
Bake at 400 degrees F for 45 minutes or until the peppers are tender. Top with the cheese. Let stand for 5 minutes or until the cheese melts.
