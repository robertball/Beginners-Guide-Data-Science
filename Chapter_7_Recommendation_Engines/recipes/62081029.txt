Ingredients:
1 jar cherries with stems on
1 package chocolate bark
20 Hershey kisses
almond slices
gel tubes of black and red
20 oreo cookies (white chocolate covered, or an opened cookie)

Directions:
melt chocolate bark until creamy.  Dip cherry into chocolate while holding the stem (completly cover cherry, but not stem) place cherry on its side on top of the cookie(the stem of the cherry is the mice tail). Press a Hershey kiss to the opposite side of the cherry (mice head). Place two almond slices inbetween the cherry and the kiss (ears).  I use the gel tubes of decorating frosting to make a nose (black) and two eyes (red).
