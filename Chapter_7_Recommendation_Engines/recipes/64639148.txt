Ingredients:
1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans
1/3 cup thin sliced almonds (I used a 2 oz package)
1/2 cup unsweetened coconut shreds
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon cinnamon
2 teaspoons erythritol sweetener (I used swerve granulated)
1-2 packets of splenda (I found it balances the erythritol, can omit)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.
You can adjust sweetener to taste.
Mix all the nuts and coconuts together.
Melt butter and mix in cinnamon and sweetener
Taste cinnamon butter mixture, adjust as needed
Pour cinnamon butter mixture over nut mix and stir to coat evenly
Bake at 375 F for 8-10 minutes
Stir after removing and allow to cool.
Enjoy, try it by itself or use as cereal.
