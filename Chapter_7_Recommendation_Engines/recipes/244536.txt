Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose baking mix (such as BisquickÂ®)
1/2 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2/3 cup chocolate milk
3 eggs
1/3 cup heavy whipping cream
1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Heat about 1 inch of oil in a large skillet to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Combine baking mix, sugar, cocoa sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl; add chocolate milk, eggs, and cream and stir until batter is smooth. Pour batter into a funnel, placing your finger on the hole to keep batter from dripping.
Swirl batter into the hot oil; cook until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer funnel cakes to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
