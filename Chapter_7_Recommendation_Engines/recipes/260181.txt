Ingredients:
2 tablespoons Patak's Mild Curry Paste
4 eggs
7 ounces minced lamb
1 onion, diced

2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
4 flour tortillas or naan bread
Salt to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a pan and fry the diced onions for 2 minutes, then add the minced lamb and fry for 5 minutes.
Add the Patak's Mild Curry Paste and continue to fry for another 2 to 3 minutes.
Add the diced tomatoes and cook whilst stirring continuously on medium heat for 20 minutes.
When the lamb becomes tender scramble the eggs in a separate bowl, then mix in with the meat. Add the chopped coriander and remove from the heat.
Heat the tortillas or naan bread, place the lamb mixture along the centre of each and roll them up.
Optional: Place on the grill for 1 to 2 minutes on each side to add a bit of crisp to the tortillas or naan bread.
Serve hot, as a starter or as a main dish with a side salad.
