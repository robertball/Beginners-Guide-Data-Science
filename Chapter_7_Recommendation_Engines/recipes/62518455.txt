Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 large onion (chopped)
2 regular apples (chopped)
1 bunch celery and leaves (chopped)
1 cup pecans (chopped)
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
1 large family size cream of chicken soup
1 large family size cream of mushroom soup
1 large container of chicken broth
5 each eggs
1 teaspoon  vinegar
2 pans iron skillet cornbread
* 2 tablespoons sage (rubbed)
* 1/2 teaspoon thyme
* 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
* Halve these ingredients and cook them into your 2 pans of Iron Skillet Cornbread.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350ยบ.
Melt butter in skillet & saute onions & celery.
Melt butter in skillet and saute apples.
Be sure and cook the rubbed sage, thyme, and poultry seasoning into the iron skillet cornbread when your making the two pans full.
Process the cooked cornbread in a food processor to finely chop the cornbread. And place in a very large bowl. I use a one-time-use large aluminum turkey roaster from Wal-Mart. You can mix in this pan and then cook in it and throw it all away when you're completed.
In smaller bowl, blend soup, chicken broth, eggs, & vinegar.
Add celery, onions, apples, and pecans to cornbread mixture, toss lightly, then add liquid mixture & blend thoroughly.
Turn into large aluminum roaster and bake at 350ยบ for approx 2 hours, or until brown on top and cooked throughout. (Can also be used as a turkey stuffing.).
If desired, dressing may be prepared ahead of time, baked 1 hour, cooled and frozen, then baked about an hour and 15 minutes when ready to serve.
