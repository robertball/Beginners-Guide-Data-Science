Ingredients:
1 pound dry great Northern beans
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 carrots, chopped
1 large stalk celery, chopped
1 large onion, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon mustard powder
2 bay leaves
6 cups chicken broth
4 cups water
1 very meaty ham bone
Black Pepper

Directions:
Rinse the beans, sorting out any broken or discolored ones. In a large bowl or saucepan cover beans with water; water should be 2-3 inches above beans.  Let soak overnight.
The next morning add the olive oil to a large soup pot and return the pot to high heat. Place carrots, celery, and onion and stir until softened.
Add the garlic and mustard powder and saute for one minute.
Next add the rinsed beans, bay leaves, meaty ham bone, chicken broth, and water.  Stir well, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 60 minutes.
Remove ham bone, cool slightly, and cut ham from the bone. Stir the chopped ham into the soup and simmer for 60 more minutes. Discard bay leaves and season with black pepper to taste.
