Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds turnips, peeled and sliced
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup butter or margarine
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2/3 cup milk
4 eggs, separated
3 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled

Directions:
Place turnips, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and sugar in a saucepan; cover with water. Cover and cook until turnips are tender, about 15-20 minutes; drain well and mash (do not add milk or butter). Set aside.
In another saucepan, melt butter; stir in the flour and remaining salt until smooth. Add milk; bring to a boil. Cook and stir for 2 minutes. Beat egg yolks in a small bowl; gradually stir in 1/2 cup hot milk mixture. Return all to pan; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in turnips; remove from the heat. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form; fold into batter. Spoon into a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. glass baking dish. Sprinkle with bacon. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until golden brown.

Description: 
ALTHOUGH my grandmother lived in the city, she always tended a large vegetable garden. Toward the end of summer, we helped her pick the vegetables for our favorite dishes.    Like most kids, we didn't care much for turnips, but when Grandmother fixed them this way, we'd ask for seconds. -Dorothy Dick, St. Louis, Missouri
