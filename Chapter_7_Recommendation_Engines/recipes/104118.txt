Ingredients:
4 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2/3 cup SPLENDA® Sugar Blend
1 cup light sour cream or reduced-fat whipped topping
40 strawberries
Optional Garnish: fresh mint leaves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees  F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Beat egg whites, cream of tartar and vanilla at high speed with an electric mixer until foamy.
Add SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff peaks form and SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend dissolves.
Spoon heaping tablespoonfuls of mixture onto baking sheets.
Bake 1 hour and 15 minutes; turn oven off. (If meringues begin to brown, reduce oven temperature to 225 degrees ).  Let meringues stand in closed oven with the light on for 8 hours or overnight. Store in an airtight container.
Top each meringue just before serving with 1 scant teaspoon of sour cream and a strawberry. Garnish, if desired.
