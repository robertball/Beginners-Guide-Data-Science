Ingredients:
4 cups water
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
1 teaspoon dry mustard powder (such as Colman's速)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon hot sauce (optional)
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1/3 cup whole milk
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 cups shredded 2% milk Cheddar cheese (such as Kraft速)
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 cup diced cooked ham
1/2 cup frozen peas, defrosted
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine water, elbow macaroni, mustard powder, salt, and hot sauce in an electric pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Close and lock the lid. Set to high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions and cook for 4 minutes. Allow up to 10 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove lid. Switch to Low Saute function by pressing Saute once and Adjust twice. Stir macaroni to separate any clumps.
Stir evaporated milk, milk, and butter into the pot. Add Cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack cheese gradually, stirring constantly until melted. Stir in ham and peas. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Forget about the blue box (you know what I'm talking about) and make homemade mac and cheese for a weeknight dinner. The ham, peas, and optional hot sauce add some pizzazz to classic mac and cheese. Adjust the consistency of the mac and cheese sauce to suit your personal preference. I used Kraft速 2% Milk Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese to reduce fat with no negative effect on taste.
