Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups chocolate chips
1 cup of butter (2 sticks), chopped into large chunks
3 eggs, very lightly beaten
1 scant cup of packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup of flour for very fudgy, or 1 cup of flour for slightly cakey (the center of the pan will still be fudgy)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 310 F.
Line a dark 8x8 pan with two layers of parchment paper.
In a large, microwaveable bowl, melt the butter and the chocolate chips for 30 seconds at a time, stirring, until melted.
In a small bowl, gently combine the eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla.
Add the sugar mixture, the baking powder, and the salt to the melted chocolate and butter.  Stir a few times.  Add the flour in several installments and gently stir.  Do not overmix the batter!
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until the top is crackling and the sides are pulling away from the pan.
Allow to cool completely before removing from the pan (using the parchment 'handles') and cutting.
