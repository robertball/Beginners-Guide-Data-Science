Ingredients:
Marinade:
2 large onions, chopped
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1/2 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 pinch curry powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 pound beef flank steak, thinly sliced
Tzatziki Sauce:
8 ounces sour cream
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
1 clove garlic, crushed
6 pita bread rounds

Directions:
Place the chopped onions in a large ceramic bowl and crush with the bottom of a glass until juice is rendered and onions look translucent. Stir in 2 crushed garlic cloves, 1/2 cup olive oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, oregano, 1 teaspoon black pepper, turmeric, curry powder, and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix well; add the sliced beef and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.
Combine the sour cream, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, dill, and 1 crushed clove of garlic. Mix well; cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Remove the meat from the marinade mixture, brushing off extra onions. Spread the slices on a baking sheet without overlapping, and salt to taste. Broil about 3 minutes per side or until browned and crispy, turning halfway through cooking.
Divide the cooked meat between the pita breads, and drizzle with tzatziki sauce to serve.

Description: 
This is my version of Turkish kebabs which I made 'off the cuff' after searching unsuccessfully for a recipe online.  The original sandwiches are made from meat that is pressed into a loaf and grilled on a rotating spit. The meat is shaved off as it gets crispy and then put into a pita sandwich. My recipe calls for thin slices of meat to be marinated and then broiled to get the same effect without a huge rotating grill. Serve in a warmed pita with goat cheese, tzatziki sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pepperoncinis.
