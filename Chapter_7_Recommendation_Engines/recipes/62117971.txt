Ingredients:
4-5 lb brisket ( I use 1st cut)
½ cup vinegar
2 med. Onions, sliced		  1 cup ketchup
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup water
¾ cup brown sugar		  1 tbsp salt

Directions:
Brown brisket on all sides in Dutch oven or large spaghetti pot.
To make gravy, add remaining ingredients to pot and cook with cover on, between simmer and medium, on top of the stove until tender – approximately 2 ½  – 3 1/2  hrs. (It will depend on the thickness of the meat.)  I flip the meat every so often.
When tender, let cool on a rack and then slice brisket against the grain.
Put in 13 x 9 dish after slicing and pour gravy over it.
Cover and let sit in refrigerator until next day.
Take off any fat that may have formed overnight.
Serve heated and enjoy.
Freezes well.

Description: 
This is the BEST Brisket you will ever taste.  No matter who comes for dinner, they always make sure that I'll be making this brisket.  It is a very traditional dish for Rosh Hashanah and Passover but it certainly is a winner any time of the year for anyone who loves very tender beef.
