Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup flour
1 (8 ounce) package sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup dry sherry
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 quart milk
2 bunches fresh spinach, cleaned and chopped
4 green onions, chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
salt and pepper to taste
8 ounces cooked small shrimp

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour, and cook until the mixture turns a darker yellow color, about 5 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms, and cook for 2 minutes.
Whisk in the sherry, chicken broth, and milk, then add the spinach, green onion, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat, whisking constantly, then reduce heat to medium low, and simmer until the spinach is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Garnish with shrimp to serve.
