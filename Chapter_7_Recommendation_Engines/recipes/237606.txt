Ingredients:
2 pounds tilapia fillets, cut into cubes, or more to taste
2 small semi-firm avocados, cut into cubes, or more to taste
8 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 habanero pepper, minced
2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger (optional)
30 fluid ounces lime juice, or as needed
1/2 large red onion, finely chopped
20 small flour tortillas, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Mix tilapia, avocados, garlic, habanero pepper, cilantro, salt, pepper, and ginger in a bowl. Pour enough lime juice over tilapia mixture to cover completely. Arrange onions over mixture without submerging into the lime juice. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until fish is tender and opaque, at least 4 hours.
Spoon ceviche into tortillas.

Description: 
This is a twist on a simple Peruvian ceviche. The avocados add some bulk and a creamy texture, while tortillas make it quick and easy to eat. Save leftover juice as an excellent hangover cure.
