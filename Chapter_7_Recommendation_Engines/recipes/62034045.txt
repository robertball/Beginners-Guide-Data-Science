Atomic Canuck Chili - 2.0 Recipe

https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 lbs - Lean Ground Beef
1/2 - Large Onion, Diced
1 tbsp - Dry Crushed Red Peppers
3 tbsp - Garlic Powder
1 tbsp - Black Pepper, Ground
1 clove - Fresh Garlic, Diced
1/4 cup - Sugar
2 cans - Mushrooms (pieces & stems) 10 oz
2 cans - Baked Brown Beans (w/ molasses) 14 oz
2 cans - Kidney Beans 14 oz
2 - Celery Sticks, sliced
1 - Green Pepper, diced
1 - Red Pepper, diced
Optional Ingredients (use any or all to your taste):
2 - Jalapeno Peppers, diced
1/4 bottle - Canadian Beer
2 tbsp - Dry Crushed Red Peppers (yes more)
Dab or Two - Your Favorite Hot Sauce

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook the ground beef together with the Dry Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic powder, and Pepper.  Cook until brown, drain and put into slow cooker.
Drain Canned goods (don't drain the brown beans), and combine in the slow cooker.  Add the rest of the ingredients, stir well and cover.
Technically you only need to cook this in your slow cooker until everything is hot (about 2 hours - depending on your cooker).  But for Optimal flavour I recommend cooking for over 4-5 hours then let sit overnight.  This stuff actually gets better with age!
Don't be afraid to experiment... this is a BASIC chili that will knock your socks off, so feel free to add your own little flavors... and heat.
