Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups fat-free sour cream
3 tablespoons low-fat creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip LightÂ®)
1 teaspoon sweet pickle relish
2 teaspoons yellow mustard
1/8 teaspoon dried minced onion
2 (5 ounce) cans tuna in water, drained
2 avocados, cut into 1/4-inch dice

Directions:
Stir together the fat-free sour cream, creamy salad dressing, pickle relish, yellow mustard, and minced onion flakes in a bowl until well mixed. Add the drained tuna and mix well.
Add the avocado in small amounts and stir gently, just enough to distribute the avocado without mashing. Chill before serving.
