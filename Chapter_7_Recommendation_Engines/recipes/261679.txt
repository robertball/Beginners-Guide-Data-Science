Ingredients:
3 1/2 ounces dark chocolate (70% cocoa), chopped
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 egg
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 ripe pear - peeled, cored, and chopped
1/2 cup slivered almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place an 8-cavity heart silicone mold onto a baking sheet.
Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Cool for 2 minutes.
Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add melted chocolate, 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour, egg, and baking powder and mix in. Fold in pear and almonds into batter. Spoon batter into the prepared heart-shaped molds.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Cool completely, about 30 minutes, then unmold.
