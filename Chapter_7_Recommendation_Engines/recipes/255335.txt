Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 heads broccoli
4 teaspoons fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Whisk olive oil, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
Separate broccoli florets from stem. Trim and discard bottom off stem. Peel stem with a vegetable peeler or paring knife and slice cross-wise into 1/4-inch-thick pieces. Add florets and stems to oil mixture and toss to coat. Arrange broccoli mixture in a single layer on a baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle lemon juice over roasted broccoli.
