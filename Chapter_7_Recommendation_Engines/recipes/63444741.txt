Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
2 1/2 cups crushed butter-flavored crackers
1 small onion, chopped
2 eggs
3/4 cup ketchup
2 slices bacon
1/2 cup ketchup
1 tablespoons vinegar
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
1/4 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together ground beef, crushed crackers, onion, eggs, 3/4 cup ketchup, and 1/4 cup brown sugar until well blended. Press into a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Lay the two slices of bacon over the top.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until cooked through. While the loaf bakes, mix together the remaining 1 cup ketchup, vinegar, salt, mustard and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Spread over the top of the meat loaf for the last 15 minutes of baking.
