Ingredients:
1 (2 ounce) can anchovy fillets, undrained, or to taste
1 onion, chopped
1 teaspoon tomato paste
1 (7.5 ounce) can salmon, undrained, or more to taste
1/2 (7.5 ounce) can water
1/4 cup pine nuts, or to taste
1/4 cup raisins, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch saffron
1 (16 ounce) package spaghettini

Directions:
Pour about 2 teaspoons oil from anchovy can into a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion in the hot anchovy oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add anchovy fillets; cook and stir until fish dissolves, about 5 minutes.
Stir tomato paste into onion-anchovy mixture; add juice from canned salmon, water, pine nuts, raisins, salt, and black pepper. Cook and stir mixture until flavors have blended, about 15 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghettini in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Mix salmon and saffron into onion-anchovy mixture; cook until salmon is heated through, about 15 more minutes. Serve salmon sauce over spaghettini.

Description: 
This recipe was handed down from my husband's Sicilian grandmother to his mother and now to me. This is a wonderful recipe that is a favorite of the entire family. And it's easy, too. Not a 'traditional American' pasta sauce, but a real, honest to goodness Sicilian sauce. Don't leave out the saffron or pignoli!
