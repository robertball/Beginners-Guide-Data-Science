Ingredients:
8 cups applesauce
6 cups brown sugar
4 cups tomato sauce
1 1/2 cups apple cider vinegar
4 teaspoons salt
4 teaspoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
7 1-pint canning jars with lids and rings

Directions:
Stir applesauce, brown sugar, tomato sauce, vinegar, salt, garlic powder, cinnamon, liquid smoke, chili powder, paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and cloves together in a large pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until thickened, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes.
Pour sauce into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 20 minutes.
Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.
