1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 large onion, diced
1/2 pound shaved rib-eye, chopped

1 (8 fl oz) jar processed cheese spread (such as Kraft® Cheez Whiz®)
2 fresh jalapeno peppers, sliced

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Cook rib-eye in the same skillet, stirring occasionally, until browned and juices have evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir onion back into the skillet.
Place a handful of tortilla chips on each plate. Spoon rib-eye and onion mixture over chips; top with cheese spread and jalapeno slices.
