Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked white rice
2 ½ cups water
1 cup chicken blood with a dash of vinegar mixed in
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
4  chicken leg quarters
1 cup wine
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

Directions:
In small saucepan over medium heat, combine the rice and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and let simmer for 20 minutes, or until rice is tender. Remove from heat and stir in the chicken blood. Set aside.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic until tender and lightly browned. Add chicken legs to the skillet and brown on both sides. Stir in the hot pepper sauce and wine. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink, and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. Stir in the blood rice, and cook for a few more minutes before serving.
