Description: 
A sworn lover of parsnips, this is but one more way to fix them.  The use of celery root, aka celeriac, was an accident since I thought I was buying a rutabaga but it was an excellent addition.   I've served this to company with rave reviews and it's fairly healthy if you use the oil sparingly.  Great way to enjoy fall/winter produce.
