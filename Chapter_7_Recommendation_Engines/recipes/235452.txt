Ingredients:
1 pound pizza dough
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 1/2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 1/2 cups turkey gravy
2 cups chopped cooked turkey
1 1/2 cups mashed potatoes
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease or flour a pizza pan.
Roll dough onto the prepared pizza pan.
Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir mushrooms and garlic until mushrooms are tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
Spread gravy over pizza dough; top with mushroom mixture, turkey, and spoonfuls of mashed potatoes. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese and parsley over pizza.
Whisk remaining 1/2 tablespoon olive oil with garlic powder and garlic salt; brush over pizza crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until dough is cooked and cheese is melted, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly before serving, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
Using gravy as a sauce, this pizza is a one-stop shop for using all T-day leftovers. There are any number of topping combinations you can make depending on what your favorite leftovers are (stuffing, veggies, sweet potato casserole, etc., can also be used). Leftover cranberry sauce or spinach dip make a great dip for the crust as well!
