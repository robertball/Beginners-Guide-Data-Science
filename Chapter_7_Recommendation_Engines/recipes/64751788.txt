Ingredients:
1/2 pound 93% lean ground beef
1/4 cup mustard greens
1/4 cup diced red onion
1/2 cup pinto beans, drained
1/2 cup diced tomatoes
1/2 can (10 ounce) green enchilada sauce
2 burrito size flour tortillas
1/4 cup shredded cheddar
1/4 cup jalapeno slices
1 tsp minced garlic
1 tsp salt
1 tsp black pepper

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook ground beef completely.  Drain any excess fat.
Add beans, tomatoes, mustard greens, salt, pepper and garlic.
Simmer 10 minutes.
Heat oven to 400*F.
Warm tortillas slightly to help with rolling.
Spray 8x8 pan with olive oil.
Fill tortillas with meat and bean mixture and roll as you would a burrito and place them in the pan.
Spray the tops lightly with oil and bake 10 minutes.
Reduce oven temperature to 350*F.
Pour enchilada sauce over burritos and back 10 more minutes.
Turn off oven, top burritos with cheese and jalapeno slices, and let rest in the oven about 10 more minutes to melt the cheese.
Serve with sauteed tomatoes, sour cream, and shredded lettuce.
