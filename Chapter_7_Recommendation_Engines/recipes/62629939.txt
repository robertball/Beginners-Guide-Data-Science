Description: 
My family has enjoyed this hearty ham salad spread for years. It came to be an unexpected leftover every time we had ham for a special dinner. Recently, I decided to measure the ingredients, write down the recipe and pass it on to my daughter and daughter-in-law. They encouraged me to share it with Reminisce readers. -Marcella Kulp, Quakertown, PennsylvaniaModified from: Ham Salad Spread
