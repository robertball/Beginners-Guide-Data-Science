Ingredients:
4 cups cranberry juice (such as Ocean SprayÂ®)

Directions:
Bring cranberry juice to a boil in a non-reactive saucepan until juice has reduced by 75% into a syrup, about 20 minutes. Pour a spoonful of syrup onto a plate and drag a spoon through it. If the line holds, the syrup is done.
Transfer syrup to a jar with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate.
