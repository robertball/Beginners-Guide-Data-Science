Ingredients:
•1 large shallot, diced
•1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved lengthwise (quartered if large)
•1 tablespoon olive oil
•2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
•1 teaspoon minced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
•1 large clove garlic, minced
•1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt
•1/4 cup raw pecans, chopped

Directions:
•Preheat the oven to 400ºF. (I prefer 425 to get the brussels crispy)
•Add the shallot and Brussels sprouts to a rimmed baking sheet.
•In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, maple syrup, chipotle peppers, garlic and salt. Drizzle the mixture over the veggies on the baking sheet, mix to combine and spread in an even layer.
•Bake for about 15 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until tender. Sprinkle with the pecans.
