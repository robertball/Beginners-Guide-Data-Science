Ingredients:
16 ounces elbow macaroni
1 (10 ounce) can red enchilada sauce
1 cup half-and-half
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies
2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
2 cups shredded pepperjack cheese
2 cups cubed cooked chicken
Â¼ cup chopped cilantro

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Combine enchilada sauce, half-and-half, and green chiles in the same pot over medium heat and cook until warm, 5 to 10 minutes. Slowly add Cheddar cheese and pepperjack cheese and whisk continuously until melted, about 5 minutes. Return cooked macaroni to the pot. Add chicken and cilantro and stir until combined and heated through, about 5 minutes more.
