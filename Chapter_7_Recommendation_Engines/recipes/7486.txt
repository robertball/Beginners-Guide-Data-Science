Description: 
This is a pure white wedding cake frosting. You can double the recipe if you have a sturdy mixer.  Add milk according to purpose; you need less if you are making flowers or borders than if you are just covering a cake.  Remove what you need for decorating before you thin the rest down for frosting.
