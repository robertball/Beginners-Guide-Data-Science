Ingredients:
10 lbs. scrubbed red skin potatoes
3 Tbl olive oil
1 1/2 Tbl dijon mustard
Salt & Pepper to taste
5-6 scallions, mostly green part
4 slices cooked bacon
1/2 cup sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup rice vinegar
1/4 cup water
2 cups mayonnaise
1 tsp. Old Bay Seasoning

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cut scrubbed potatoes into bite sized pieces.  Place in gallon size ziplock back along with olive oil, dijon mustard, salt and pepper and shake well until covered.  Spread potato pieces in single layer onto a baking sheet. With quantity of potatoes I divided the potatoes and did two batches on two separate baking sheets.
Roast in the preheated oven about 40 minutes.
While potatoes are roasting combined the sugar, eggs, vinegar and water into sauce pan (mix well) and bring to boil, stirring continuously for one minute.  Remove from heat and allow to cool while potatoes roast.
Roast potatoes until tender and remove from oven, allowing them to sit for 5-10 minutes.  While they are resting combine the mayonnaise and Old Bay in the cooked sauce.  While still warm so that the flavors will absorb, thoroughly coat the potatoes with the mayo mixture and, sliced green onions and crumbled cooked bacon.  Cover and allow the salad to sit in refrigerator for good 2 hours so that the flavors will blend.
