Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 bananas, mashed
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup egg substitute
1/3 cup applesauce
1 tsp vanilla
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
dash allspice
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 10 muffin cups, or line with muffin papers.
In a large bowl, mix together 1 1/2 cups flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, beat together bananas, sugar, egg and melted butter. Stir the banana mixture into the flour mixture just until moistened. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour and cinnamon. Cut in 1 tablespoon butter until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Sprinkle topping over muffins.
Bake in preheated oven for 18 to 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean.

Description: 
A basic banana muffin is made light and extraordinary.  I reduced the amount of sugar from 3/4 cup to 1/2 cup and used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Instead of eggs I used egg substitute, and instead of 1/3 cup melted butter I used 1/3 cup applesauce.  I added vanilla, increased the cinnamon and added a little nutmeg and chopped walnuts.Modified from: Banana Crumb Muffins
