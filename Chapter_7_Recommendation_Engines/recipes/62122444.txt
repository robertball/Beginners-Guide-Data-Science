Ingredients:
-5 lb. ground beef chuck
-1 cup light brown sugar
-1/4 cup garlic, minced
-1 1/2 tsp. chipotle pepper
-1 tbsp. salt
-1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp. worcestershire sauce
-10 slices precooked bacon
-10 pineapple rings, juice reserved
-2 1/4 cups plus 2 tbsp. pineapple juice (if you don't have enough out of the cans, use water)
-1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp. soy sauce
-1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp. light brown sugar
-1 tsp. sesame oil
-2 1/2 tbsp. cornstarch
-1/2 tsp. garlic powder, or more to taste
-Cooking Spray
-10 onion rolls

Directions:
Spray the pineapple rings with cooking spray and mark on the grill on both sides.
Put the pineapple juice, soy sauce, light brown sugar, sesame oil, cornstarch, and garlic powder in a heavy bottomed saucepan.
Bring to a boil for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, to cook out the cornstarch.
Keep warm while preparing the burgers (or this sauce can be made the day before, but must be stirred because the sweetness sinks to the bottom.)
Mix the ground beef chuck, light brown sugar (1 cup), minced garlic, chipotle pepper, worcestershire sauce, and salt until well combined.
Form into 7 ounce portions and flatten into a patty.
Pour 1 cup of sauce into a casserole dish.
Brown the patties on the grill, on both sides and put them on top of the sauce in the pan.  Evenly top each with additional sauce.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes or until the internal temperatures reach 155 degrees.
Microwave the bacon for 10 seconds and top each burger with a piece.  Top with the pineapple and additional sauce out of the pan.
Serve the burgers on onion rolls.
No condiments needed!!
