Description: 
From Orleans, Ontario, Maya Whittier shares Salmon Dill Croissants. 'The original recipe made a cheese ball that my parents only served at Christmas parties,' she recalls. 'It was so delicious on crackers that I decided to try it as a filling inside croissants.    'These smoky salmon sandwiches taste so wonderfully rich that everyone assumes they're gourmet,' Maya writes. 'No one needs to know they're so fast and easy to prepare by using canned salmon.'
