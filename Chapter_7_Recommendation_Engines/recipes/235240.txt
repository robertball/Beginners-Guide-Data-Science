1 (15.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix
2/3 cup water
1/2 cup oil
2 eggs
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 28 to 30 minutes. Immediately poke holes in the cake using a skewer or straw.
Pour sweetened condensed milk, hot fudge, and caramel over cake. Allow cake to cool, about 1 hour.
Spread whipped topping over cooled cake and sprinkle with crushed peanut butter candy. Refrigerate until serving.
