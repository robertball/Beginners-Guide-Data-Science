Ingredients:
3 sun-dried tomato halves
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 yellow onion, minced
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup frozen chopped spinach
1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms with pieces, drained
3 ounces crumbled reduced-fat feta cheese
6 egg whites
1/4 cup skim milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch round pan.
Place sun-dried tomatoes into a bowl of warm water until rehydrated, about 10 minutes. Drain and chop.
Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Add spinach; cook and stir until thawed and water is evaporated, about 5 minutes. Stir in mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta cheese until well mixed.
Whisk egg whites, skim milk, salt, pepper, and basil together in a bowl until very frothy. Carefully stir spinach mixture and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese into egg mixture. Pour into the prepared pan; top with remaining Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until frittata is set and browned on top, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
I concocted this when I was trying to liven up an egg white frittata. It turned out deceptively decadent. The sun-dried tomatoes make all the difference.
