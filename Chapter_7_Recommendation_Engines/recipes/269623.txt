Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 medium onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup white wine
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 cube chicken bouillon
1 pound pork tenderloin, sliced into1/2-inch cutlets
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat butter over medium-high heat in a large pan. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is semi-translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in wine, heavy cream, and bouillon.
Heat a separate pan over medium-high heat. Season pork with salt and pepper. Sear pork slices in the hot pan, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer pork to cream sauce.
Let pork simmer in sauce until slightly pink in the center, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
I enjoyed this simple and delicious pork cutlet dish, (Zuri G'schnetzlets), in Switzerland in a home near Zurich. It was one of the few times I enjoyed a meal so much that I insisted on the recipe. Traditionally it's served on a bed of steaming hash browns.
