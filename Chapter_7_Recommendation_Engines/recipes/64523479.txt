Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 egg white
2 tablespoons sugar
1/3 cup finely chopped almonds

Directions:
In a small bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy; beat in almond extract. Gradually add 1-1/4 cups flour.  Knead in remaining flour.  Cover and chill for at least 2 hours
On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to roughly a 1/4 in. thickness; cut into strips about 1-1/2 to 2-in. and form into rectangle-shapes by hand; place on un-greased baking sheet lined with parchment paper or baking mat.  Beat egg white until foamy; brush over cut-outs.  Sprinkle with sugar and finely chopped almonds
Bake at 350 degrees for 7-8 minutes or until edges begin to brown; cool on wire racks. Yield: about 4 dozen
