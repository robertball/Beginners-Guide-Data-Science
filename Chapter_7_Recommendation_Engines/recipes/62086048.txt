Description: 
I love to experiment in the kitchen with different flavors.  I was cooking a beef roast one night and wanted to try something new, and came up with this delicious dish.  I've served it to others who have raved about how flavorful the sauce is. Sauce can be thickened after cooking to use as a wonderful gravy over mashed potatoes, rice, or pasta.
