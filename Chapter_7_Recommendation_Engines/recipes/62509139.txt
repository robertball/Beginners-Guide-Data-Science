In a pot heat up 1/2 cup of butter, can of condensed milk, bag of mozzarella cheese and half bag of cheddar cheese.  You can add an egg if you'd like to make the mixture thicker although sometimes I don't.
Taste mixture to make sure its cheesy enough for you and feel free to add more cheese depending on taste.
