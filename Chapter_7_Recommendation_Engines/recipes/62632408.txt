https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon tamari (soy sauce)
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoons grated gingerroot
3 tablespoons lime juice
1 teaspoon sugar
3-4 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound halibut filet

Directions:
Put tamari, 2 tablespoons of oil, gingerroot, lime juice, sugar, and garlic in a small mixing bowl; whisk together.  Place fish in a shallow pan and pour marinade over the top.  Allow to marinate Â½ - 1 hour in the refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in an oven-proof skillet, cast iron is good.  Place halibut in the pan, skin side up and sear for one minute, turn and sear second side for one minute.  Leave fish in the skillet and place in oven.  Bake until fish is almost cooked through, about 7-10 minutes.  Remove skillet from oven and place on stove over low heat (skillet will be very hot from the oven).  Add remaining marinade, letting the liquid heat and reduce before serving (we did this a bit too quickly in the video...).

This is a very easy way to prepare fish.  The pan-frying to start seals the juices in.  Serve this fish with Emerald City Salad or Mediterranean Quinoa Salad which are both available for viewing on Cookus Interruptus.  Three tablespoons of Lime Boost can be substituted for lime and sugar.  Slightly sweeter but works just as well.
