Ingredients:
10 Soft Shell Tacos
3 Tbs. Flour
3 Tbs. Butter
2 Cups Chicken Broth
1 Cup Sour Cream
1 Tsp, Ground Cumin
1 Can (4oz.) Diced Green Chiles
2 Cups Rotisserie Chicken
3 Cups Mexican Cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x13 pan. Mix chicken and 1 1/2 cups of cheese. In sauce pan, melt butter, stir in flour and cook one minute. Add broth and whisk until smooth. Heat over medium heat until thick and bubbly. Stir in sour cream, ground cumin and chiles. Do not bring to a boil as your sour cream will curdle. Pour over enchiladas and top with remaining cheese. Bake 22 minutes and then broil for 3 minutes to brown the cheese.
