Title:
Best Buffalo Wings Ever Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
(5.00    lbs) bag frozen chicken wings
2   bottles frank's hot sauce
1/2   lb margarine or butter
1   teaspoon crushed dried oregano
1   tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1   tablespoon minced onion

Directions:
1. Mix all ingredients except the wings in a small saucepan, bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes.
2. Cook the wings according to the package directions, either deep-fried or baked; my family prefers them baked at 425 degrees until the meat is tender and the skin is crispy.
3. Put the wings in a large bowl, pour the sauce over, toss to coat well; I like to place them back on a baking sheet at this point and bake for another 15-20 minutes in a 300 degree oven.
4. Serve with celery sticks, and either blue cheese or ranch dressing.
