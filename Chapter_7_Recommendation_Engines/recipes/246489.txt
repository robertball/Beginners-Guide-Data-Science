Ingredients:
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
4 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon Himalayan pink salt
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon salt-free seasoning blend (such as Mrs. DashÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup olive oil
1 pound lean ground beef
1 onion, diced
1 large potato, peeled and cubed
2 carrots, diced
2 (14 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
2 tablespoons water, or to taste (optional)
1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta

Directions:
Place cilantro and garlic in a food processor; pulse until finely chopped.
Toast cumin seeds in a small pot over low heat until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Allow to cool, 5 minutes. Grind into a powder.
Transfer ground cumin to a small bowl. Add Himalayan pink salt, turmeric, paprika, Italian seasoning, seasoning blend, and black pepper to make seasoning mix.
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add ground beef; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 of the seasoning mix. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add potato and carrots. Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
Stir tomatoes into the pot and bring sauce to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; stir in cilantro-garlic mixture and remaining 1/2 of the seasoning mix. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, 30 to 40 minutes. Thin sauce with water if it seems too thick.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain. Serve sauce over pasta.

Description: 
This is Somali-style spaghetti sauce with my own little twist. We make this once a week in our house (my daughter craves it!). I hope you enjoy this as much as we do!
