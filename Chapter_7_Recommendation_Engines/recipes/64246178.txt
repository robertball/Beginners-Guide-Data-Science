Ingredients:
4 cups chicken or vegetable stock
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 to 4 large eggs
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 inch of fresh ginger, peeled and cut into thin rounds
Salt and pepper
1 bunch baby bok choy, thinly sliced (optional)
1 cup sweet peas (optional)

Directions:
Add the stock to a saucepan and place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil
Add the soy sauce and ginger to the saucepan with the stock
Turn down the heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes
Remove the ginger with a slotted spoon
Taste and add pepper, salt or soy sauce as needed
Add bok choy and peas and simmer for 5 minutes
Remove approximately 1/4 cup  of the stock and whisk it with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch in a small bowl
Whisk this back into the stock and let it simmer for a minute or two until the broth is the desired consistency
Whisk the eggs together in a small bowl with the remaining teaspoon of cornstarch using a fork
With your soup at a bare simmer, hold a fork over the bowl and pour the eggs slowly through the tines while whisking the broth gently
Let the soup stand for a few seconds to finish cooking the eggs
Top it off with scallions if you like

Description: 
Next to Minestrone soup and Pasta Fagioli, Egg Drop Soup is a favorite go-to for my family during the cold, wintery days.  Add pasta, chickpeas, arugula and Parmesan cheese for a delicious Italian variant!
