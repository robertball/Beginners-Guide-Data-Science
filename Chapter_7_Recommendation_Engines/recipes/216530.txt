Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds beef cheeks
1/4 onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (10.75 ounce) can low-sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 green onions, cut into 2-inch pieces
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds
1/2 cup kimchi, or to taste
8 (6 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook beef cheeks until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Stir in onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes.
Stir chicken broth, soy sauce, green onions, sugar, and sesame oil into the pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer until beef cheeks are tender, about 2 hours.
Remove beef cheeks from the pot using a slotted spoon; cut into bite-size pieces. Arrange beef on a dish and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
Place a scoop of beef and some kimchi over each tortilla.
