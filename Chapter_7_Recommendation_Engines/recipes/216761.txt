Description: 
This is my friend Judy's sauerkraut recipe, and in my opinion, it's simply the best.  Great served with crusty rye bread, mashed potatoes, and freshly cooked apples. Combine the kraut with a meat entree and bake in the oven at a low temperature 1 to 2 hours.  Examples of meat entrees that work really well are small pork roasts, tenderloins, or chops, bratwursts, knockwursts, and kielbasa.  Slow cooker temperatures vary, so this may be done sooner than 8 hours.
