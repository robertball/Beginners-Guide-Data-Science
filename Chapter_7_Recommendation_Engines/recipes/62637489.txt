Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine the flour, baking soda and salt. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Beat in the egg. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients.
Divide the dough in half. Form each half into a log 1 ½-inches in diameter. Wrap in waxed paper and chill for 4 hours.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Lightly grease 2 baking sheets. Cut the logs into ¼-inch thick slices and place 1-inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes; until lightly colored.
Transfer to wire racks to cool.

These are really good! Buttery and crispy just like the name suggests! Since these are refrigerator cookies, this is a very handy recipe. These can keep in the freezer for up to 6 months.
