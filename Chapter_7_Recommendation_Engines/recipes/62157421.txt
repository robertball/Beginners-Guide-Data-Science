Ingredients:
1/2 cup (1 stick) real butter (do not substitute)
1/2 cup bland vegetable oil, such as canola oil
1/8 teaspoon salt (optional)
2 drops red tabasco (optional)

Directions:
Remove the wrapper from the butter while it is still cold.  This allows you to get the wrapper off without the butter sticking to the paper.  Put the butter in a small mixing bowl.  Let soften at room temperature, covered, until very soft but not melted.  Add remaining ingredients.  Mix well by hand or with a hand mixer, until the mixture is smooth.  Pour into a small covered container and keep refrigerated.

Description: 
This spread tastes like butter because it is butter, and it is spreadable right from the refrigerator.  It can also be used in recipes, since it has no added water.
