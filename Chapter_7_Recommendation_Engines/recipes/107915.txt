Ingredients:
2 tablespoons beef bouillon granules
2 tablespoons water
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 1/2 pounds beef sirloin, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
10 wooden skewers, soaked in water for 1 hour
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Dissolve bouillon in water.  Stir in the garlic, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper.  Toss the meat in the marinade, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Preheat a grill for high heat.
Skewer the beef cubes, using 6 to 8 pieces per skewer.  Pour the oil onto a plate, and roll the skewers in it to coat them on all sides.
Grill the skewers, turning frequently, until the beef has turned light pink, 12 to 15 minutes.
