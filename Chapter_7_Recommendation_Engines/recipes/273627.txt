Ingredients:
1 tablespoon avocado oil
2 tamales, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 tablespoons homemade Mexican tomato sauce
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add chopped tamales and fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce and season with salt; cover and cook until tamales are soft, about 3 minutes. Serve immediately.

Submitter: 
Crema
Description: 
The best and easiest way to use leftover or dry tamales without extra work or ingredients. I use pork or chicken tamales, but any savory tamales will work. Â If I feel like it, I serve them with a fried egg on top.
