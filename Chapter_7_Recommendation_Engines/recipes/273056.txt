Ingredients:
cooking spray
Shortbread Crust:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
Lemon Filling:
5 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
1/2 cup white sugar
2 large eggs, at room temperature
2 lemons, zested and juiced
Topping:
2 cups fresh mixed berries
4 sprigs fresh mint, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat a 9-inch tart pan with cooking spray.
Combine flour, butter, confectioners' sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until a soft dough forms. Press dough into the bottom of the prepared pan; prick with a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until edge of crust is golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool; do not turn oven off.
Place cream cheese in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add sugar; mix until combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Add eggs; blend for 1 to 2 minutes. Add lemon zest and juice; mix until incorporated. Pour mixture into cooled tart shell.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling has set, about 25 minutes. Chill thoroughly, at least 1 hour. Top with berries and garnish with mint.
