Ingredients:
For one glass of this deliciousness you'll need:
1) Freshly ground medium roast organic coffee beans (coarse grind! for French press method of preparation) = 3 tablespoons
2) Fresh water = 200ml
2) Organic, raw honey of your choice = 2 teaspoons
3) Scotch or Irish Whisk(e)y = 2 tablespoons;
4) Lemon juice = one teaspoon;
5) Lemon zest (to taste)
6) Egg white (or heavy whipping cream) = one egg white or 50 grams of heavy whipping cream. (Or you can combine the two, but then whip them separately and then fold in your egg white into your cream) I used only an egg white for the Celtic Coffee you can see in the picture.
7) Dried stevia leaves = a handful or to taste.

Directions:
Whip up the egg white or heavy cream until soft peaks form and mix in ground stevia leaves (Use the palms of your hands to grind the leaves), lemon juice and lemon zest. Set aside, or put it in the fridge.
Put the kettle on.
Grind up your coffee beans using a manual coffee grinder and put the coffee into your French press.
Pour the hot (but not boiling water) in the French press.
Put honey and whisky into your glass.
After 3-5 minutes, pour in the coffee and mix well.
Top it with your stevia-lemon flavored cream or egg white!
Happy St. Patrick's day !
