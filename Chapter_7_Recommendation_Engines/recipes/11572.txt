1 cup butter, melted
1 pound light brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 egg, beaten
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees (150 degrees C). Grease one 9x13 inch baking pan.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, white sugar, vanilla, and eggs. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the egg mixture until well blended. Spread mixture evenly into the prepared baking pan.
Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven. A toothpick should come out clean when inserted. Cut into squares and roll in confectioners' sugar while they are still hot.
