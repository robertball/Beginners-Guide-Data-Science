Ingredients:
1/3 cup sesame oil
1/2 soy sauce (low sodium is fine)
2 Tbsp crushed garlic (fresh or jarred)
4 New York Strip steaks

Directions:
Mix all ingredients and marinate in a plastic bag or container for at least 4 hours in refrigerator.  Turn occasionally for even flavor.  Grill on a hot bbq to desired doneness.  Changing the amounts drastically changes the flavor, which may not be a bad thing!  Experiment and see what you like.

Description: 
You can use New York strips or sirloin.  I don't measure ingredients, so these are guesses.  I find having a little more soy than sesame, and a lot of garlic works best for me!
