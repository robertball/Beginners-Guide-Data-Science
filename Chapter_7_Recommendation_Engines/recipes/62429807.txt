Ingredients:
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish, drained
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint leaves
dash Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 pound fillet salmon, skin on

Directions:
Whisk together the mustards, honey, horseradish, mint and 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper in a small bowl.
Let sit for at least 15 minutes before using. Can be made 1 day in advance and refrigerated but do not add the mint until just before using.
Bring to room temperature before using.
Heat the grill to high.
Brush the salmon with the oil and season with salt and pepper.
Place the salmon on the grill, skin side down, and grill until golden brown and slightly charred, about 3 minutes.
Serve on salad with red onion slices, watercress, and/or microgreens.
Transfer the salad to a platter, top with the salmon fillet and drizzle each fillet with the mustard sauce.
