Ingredients:
1-2 lbs fresh brussels sprouts
1/3 cup dried cranberries, such as Craisins
1 head fresh garlic
1/3 cup diced prosciutto
1/4 cup chicken broth (preferably low sodium or all-natural)
4 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
5 tablespoons olive oil
fresh ground pepper
1-2 tablespoons kosher or sea salt, to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Slice the top off of the garlic head so that the tops of the cloves are exposed. Place in an oven safe ramekin or dish and pour 2 tablespoons olive oil on top. Cover the dish with foil and place in the oven for 30-45 minutes, or until the cloves are browned (you will smell the garlic throughout your house). Take out and let cool.
In the meantime, wash the brussels sprouts and slice off the ends, and then cut them in half. Place in a baking dish. Add the diced prosciutto and cranberries, remaining olive oil, chicken broth, balsamic vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. When the roasted garlic cloves are cool enough to handle, squeeze the soft cloves into a dish and mash slightly. Add to the brussels sprouts and mix the ingredients together.
Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the sprouts are nicely browned.
