Ingredients:
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into chunks
1 onion, quartered and thinly sliced
2 large cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 (15 ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 pound turkey kielbasa, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1/3 cup dry white wine

Directions:
Place the chicken into the bottom of a slow cooker. Stir together the onion, garlic, parsley, salt, pepper, cannellini beans, and turkey kielbasa in a large bowl. Pour the mixture over the chicken in the slow cooker, and pour the wine over all the ingredients. Cover, set the cooker to Low, and cook until the chicken is very tender and the cassoulet is thickened, 5 to 6 hours.

Description: 
This is definitely a cheater version of cassoulet, but a nice change of pace for a weeknight crock pot meal!  Serve with French bread to sop up the lovely juices. You can substitute chicken broth for white wine.
