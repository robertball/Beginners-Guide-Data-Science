Ingredients:
8 eggs, lightly beaten
3 tablespoons water
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons bacon fat or cooking oil
6 small to medium potatoes, peeled
1 large onion
1 large red bell pepper
1 poblano chile, in rings
salt and freshly ground pepper
1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese, grated
2 tablespoons parsley, minced

Directions:
- Sliced potatoes, cover with cold  water and refrigerate for 30 minutes or so. Saute bell pepper and onion in 1 tablespoon butter and set aside. Drain and dry potatoes and sprinkle with salt. In a skillet with 2 tablespoons butter and bacon fat , fry the potatoes until crisp and medium brown. Remove and drain on paper towel as they brown.
-The tortilla can be cooked on the stove, but I prefer this method. Arrange the potatoes in a lightly-buttered non-stick pan, preferably a deep, slope-sided skillet. Arrange the onions and peppers over them. Beat eggs with water, parsley, salt, pepper and cheese and pour the mixture over the potatoes. Put the skillet in a larger pan with a half inch of water in it and bake in a 225 degree oven. When the eggs are set, (about 30-40 minutes)remove the tortilla, let cool, and loosen edges from the pan. Put a serving plate over the skillet and flip the tortilla over onto the plate. Cut into small pie-shape wedges.Chill until ready to serve; reheat if desired.
