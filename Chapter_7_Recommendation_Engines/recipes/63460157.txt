1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. Stir in chocolate chips and mashed bananas until moistened. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.

Description: 
I naively started baking without realizing I was out of eggs. I substituted extra bananas and baking powder instead and added chocolate chips.Modified from: Banana Banana Bread
