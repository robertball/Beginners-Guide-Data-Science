Ingredients:
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
½ teaspoon dried basil
½ teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
4  chicken thighs

Directions:
Whisk honey, olive oil, Dijon mustard, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
Place chicken thighs into a plastic zip-top bag; pour marinade over. Seal the bag and massage marinade into thighs until completely covered. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour the chicken thighs and excess marinade into a baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, uncover, and flip chicken thighs.
Return to the oven and continue to bake until thighs are no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bones reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 20 minutes more. Remove from the oven.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Broil thighs in the preheated oven until crispy and golden, 2 to 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve.
