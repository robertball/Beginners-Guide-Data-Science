Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
2 egg yolks
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
2 egg whites
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon rum flavored extract
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 inch round pans.
In a large bowl, cream butter and 1/2 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Add egg yolks and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Beat well. Stir together flour, baking powder, and salt. Add to butter mixture alternately with milk. Pour into two 8 inch round cake pans.
Wash and dry beaters and bowl thoroughly. In a large, bowl beat egg whites, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and the rum extract until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar.

Sprinkle pecans over meringue and press lightly into surface.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool cakes in pans for 10 minutes.
Carefully remove from pans. Turn cake layers meringue side up and let cool thoroughly. About 1 to 2 hours before serving, make the filling: Combine whipping cream, confectioners sugar, and the remaining vanilla. Beat until soft peaks form. Fold in pineapple.
