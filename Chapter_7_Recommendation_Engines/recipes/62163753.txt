Description: 
I have tried many recipes for zucchini patties, and have been trying many variations for a while, looking for something just a bit different.  I finally came up with this combination of ingredients...this is quite tasty!  It's also a good recipe for people who may not like zucchini, as it seems to transform it into a whole new taste.
