Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
4 ounces chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
Combine 1 cup all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, white sugar, brown sugar, pudding mix, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Beat milk, oil, and egg together in a separate bowl. Stir into flour mixture until combined.
Coat chocolate chips with 1 tablespoon flour and fold into the batter. Fold in pecans. Fill muffin cups 3/4 full of batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
