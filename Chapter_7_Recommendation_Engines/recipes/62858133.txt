Ingredients:
1 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1 package (3 ounces) Cream Cheese (softened or cubed), softened
6 green onions, chopped (optional)
1/3 cup crumbled cooked bacon (I use real bacon bits to save time)
1 envelope ranch salad dressing mix
2 packages (10 ounces each) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry. Make sure the spinach is very well drained the pin wheel spread will be to runny.
1 can of drained chopped water chesnuts (optional)
6 flour tortillas (8 inches), warmed

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, cream cheese, onions, bacon, water chestnuts and salad dressing mix. Stir in spinach until well blended. Spread over tortillas; roll up tightly jelly-roll style. Wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 5 hours.
With a serrated knife, cut into 1/2-in. slices. Refrigerate leftovers. Yield: 12-14 servings.
