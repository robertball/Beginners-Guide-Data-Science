Ingredients:
2 russet potatoes
1/4 teaspoon olive oil
salt to taste
2 sheets aluminum foil

Directions:
Warm up the grill to medium heat.
Wash and dry potatoes. Poke potatoes all over with a fork. Rub with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Roll each potato up in aluminum foil and fold the ends in. Place potatoes on the grill and close the lid. Grill until fork-tender, rotating every 15 minutes or so, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a recipe I use to throw a potato on the grill while I am grilling. I like how it makes the skin crispy and the center soft. Use whatever toppings you like, as in butter, sour cream, cheese, and bacon bits.
