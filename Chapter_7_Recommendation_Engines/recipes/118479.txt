Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 eggs
1 cup buttermilk
1/3 cup sugar
1/3 cup butter or stick margarine, melted
1 cup shredded peeled zucchini
1 tablespoon grated onion

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, Parmesan cheese, salt, baking powder and baking soda.  In another bowl, beat the eggs, buttermilk, sugar and butter.  Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.  Fold in zucchini and onion.
Pour into a greased and floured 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour or until a toothpick comes out clean.  Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.

Description: 
This loaf has a rugged, textured look that adds to its old-fashioned appeal. The mild Parmesan flavor nicely complements the zucchini, which adds bits of green color to every tender slice. -Christine Wilson, Sellersville, Pennsylvania
