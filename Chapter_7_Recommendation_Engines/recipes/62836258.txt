Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1/2 cup dry white wine
2/3 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup half & half
2 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
2 to 3 roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
6 white mushrooms chopped small
1 clove garlic minced
2 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the shrimp, garlic, and green onions. Cook and stir until the shrimp are pink on the outside, and no longer translucent in the center, about 5 minutes. Set the shrimp aside, and pour in the wine, cream, tomatoes, basil, and cayenne pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the sauce will coat the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes.
Stir the shrimp back into the sauce, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat through and serve.
