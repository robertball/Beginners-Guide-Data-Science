Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons chili powder
salt to taste
4 (10 inch) flour tortillas
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a deep dish pie plate; set aside.
In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef and onion until beef is no longer pink; drain fat. Return to the heat and push the meat and onion to the sides of the pan. Add the garlic to the center of the pan and cook briefly. Stir the beef and onion together with the garlic.
Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, cumin, chili powder and salt to taste. Mix well and allow to thicken slightly.
Spoon a thin layer of the beef mixture onto the bottom of the pie plate. Begin layering the tortilla, beef mixture, then cheese, ending with a final layer of cheese on the top.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and lightly browned.
