Ingredients:
2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
4 roma (plum) tomatoes, halved
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 bulb garlic, unpeeled
1 cup mostaccioli
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
2 ounces crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Heat oven to 300 degrees F. Place aluminum foil on cookie sheet; generously brush with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Arrange tomato halves, cut sides up, in single layer on foil; brush with 2 teaspoons of the oil. Sprinkle with sugar, salt and pepper.
Cut 1/2 inch off top of garlic bulb; drizzle 1 teaspoon of the oil over garlic bulb. Wrap in aluminum foil; place on cookie sheet with tomatoes. Bake 55 to 60 minutes or until garlic is soft when pierced with a knife and tomatoes have begun to shrivel; cool slightly.
Cook and drain pasta as directed on package.
Squeeze garlic into remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil and mash until smooth; toss with pasta. Add tomato halves and basil; toss. Top with cheese. Serve immediately.
