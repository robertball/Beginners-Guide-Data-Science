Ingredients:
--Biscuits--
3 cups flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces or grated
1 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1/4 cup turbinado sugar
--Strawberry Topping--
8 cups strawberries (about 2 pounds), rinsed, stemmed, and sliced
1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

Directions:
For the biscuits:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl.
Using a food processor, pastry cutter, or your fingertips incorporate the chilled butter pieces into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
Add the buttermilk and stir just until moistened. On the prepared baking sheet, drop 1/3 cup dough for each biscuit, spacing the mounds about 2-inches apart. Brush with heavy cream, and sprinkle with sugar.
Bake until the biscuits are golden brown on top, about 15 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
Place the sliced strawberries in a large bowl. Add the lemon juice, and sugar and gently toss. Let the berries sit for 30 minutes until the juices develop.
