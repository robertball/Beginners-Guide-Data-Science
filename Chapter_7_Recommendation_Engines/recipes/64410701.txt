Ingredients:
3 c.all-purpose flour
3 c.wholewheat flour
4 tbsp brown sugar
1 1/2 Tsp salt
2 Tbsp quick yeast
2 Tbsp vegetable oil
3 1/2 c. hot tap water (110-120f)

Directions:
In bowl of electric mixer, mix dry ingredients together.
Mix oil and hot water together and pour into dry ingredients.  Using dough hook, mix well, until dough pulls away from sides of bowl in a ball.
Remove from bowl, knead briefly - just enough to ensure a smooth ball of dough.  Shape in 2 or 3 balls - depends on how big you want your loaves, place on floured baking sheet.  Dust loaves with flour; cover with a dishtowel, and let rise 25-30 minutes.
While dough is rising, preheat oven to 375f.
Using a sharp knife, cut an X 1/4" deep in the tops of the loaves.  This allows the loaves to rise quickly.  Immediately place in oven - bake 25 minutes, or until loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped.  Cool on racks.
