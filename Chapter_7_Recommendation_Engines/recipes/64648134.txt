Description: 
I had some leftover kabobs and for a lunch used them in a Udon Noodle Soup. The noodles are firm yet pleasantly have a chewy texture. I added a couple other vegetables and some jalapeno. No matter what type of kabobs you have leftover use appropriate stock and vegetables for the dish.
