Ingredients:
2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1 inch cubes
1/3 cup Panko breadcrumbs
1/4 cup regular breadcrumbs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon powdered sugar
1/4 cup olive oil
butter spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Grease a sheet pan with olive oil. Combine the panko, regular breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, and powdered sugar in a pie plate or large plate. Drizzle some olive oil (about 1/4 cup) in another plate.
Toss the chicken pieces in the olive oil, then dredge them in the breadcrumb mixture, making sure each piece is coated evenly. Place the nuggets on the oiled baking sheet and spray the tops with butter spray. Bake for about 12-15 minutes, until golden brown. Serves 2-4.

These area baked version of the Chick-fil-a nuggets. They are not identical, and this recipe is combined after researching several ideas on the web. I had the most success with this one.
