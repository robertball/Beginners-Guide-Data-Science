Ingredients:
2 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 cup dried black beans or pinto beans (or 2 cans, drained and rinsed)
4 cups chicken broth
14 oz. mushrooms (finely chopped)
1 cup frozen corn
1 jar prepared salsa (16 oz)
1 1/2 tsp cumin

Directions:
Put beans in pressure cooker and fill half way with water.  Cook for 15 minutes from the time the pressure is up.
Add beans to slow cooker.  Top with chicken breasts.  Add remaining ingredients.
Cook on high for 6-7 hours.  (If you stir, be careful not to disturb the beans, you want them to stay at the bottom, closest to the heating element.)
Before serving, removed chicken breasts and shred with a fork, then return to soup.
