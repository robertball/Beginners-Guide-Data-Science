Ingredients:
3 cups self-rising flour
2 1/2 cups vanilla ice cream, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour the ice cream into a large bowl; fold the flour into the ice cream until the dough just begins to come together. Using your hands, gently knead the dough into a ball, adding flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a 9x13 inch rectangle. Cut the dough into 12 circles, 3 inches in diameter, and place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.
