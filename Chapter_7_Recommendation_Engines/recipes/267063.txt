Ingredients:
3 cups dry black-eyed peas
1 pound pork jowl, chopped into 1/4-inch cubes
1 large sweet onion, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
8 cups chicken stock
2 cups chopped ham
4 cups cooked rice
salt to taste

Directions:
Place black-eyed peas into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let soak, 8 hours to overnight. Drain.
Place pork jowl into a large soup pot over medium-high heat and cook until fat has rendered. Add onion and garlic and cook until onion is soft and pork has slightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
Add chicken stock and drained black-eyed peas to the soup pot. Add diced ham and stir. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer, covered, until beans are completely tender, 1 1/2 hours.
Remove pork jowl from soup using a slotted spoon and discard. Mix cooked rice into the soup. Simmer, covered, 30 minutes more. Season with salt.

Description: 
This a simple dish of rice, black-eyed peas, and ham that my grandmother made every year for New Year's Day. It is a southern tradition that goes along well with cornbread and collard greens.
