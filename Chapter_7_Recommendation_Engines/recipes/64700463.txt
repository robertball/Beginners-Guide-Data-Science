Ingredients:
For Beef:
5lbs Beef Chuck or Shoulder roast
3 tbsp Salt
1 onion chopped into 4 pcs
For chipotle sauce:
4 tomatoes
1 can 12 Oz Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
3 tbsp chicken bouillon
1 onion sliced (For the beef once cooked and shredded)
2 tbsp Olive oil
For the toppings:
Lettuce
Tomato
Onion
Jalapeño pepper
Sour cream
Queso fresco (Fresh Mexican cheese)
Avocado

Directions:
Cut the beef into large chucks, usually each roast about 3 chunks. Put to boil and add the onion. Once boiling add the salt. Cook for about 2 1/2 hrs. Add the tomatoes to the water to cook. Once tomatoes are cooked, put them in blender with the can of chipotle peppers and add about 1 1/2 cups of the water from the beef. Blend well and set aside.
Take out the beef chunks and shred, the beef should be tender enough you can shred with 2 forks. Discard any excess fat from the beef.
Add the olive oil to a medium pot and sauté the sliced onion. Add the shredded beef and sauté about 5 minutes. Add the blended chipotle sauce to the pot and bring to a boil. Add more water from beef if needed to the consistency you want. Once sauce is boiling, add the chicken bouillon. Simmer for about 5 minutes.
Slice up the toppings how you would like for the top of the tostada.
Prepare your tostada with your toppings and add sour cream and the queso fresco
