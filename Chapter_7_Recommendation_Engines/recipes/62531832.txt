Ingredients:
1 3/4 cup water
2 heaping tbsp pureed pumpkin
1/8 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
a pinch of ground cloves
a pinch of fresh grated nutmeg
1/8 tsp ground ginger
1 heaping cup  old fashioned oats
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup chopped walnuts
milk, to serve

Directions:
Bring water, pumpkin, salt, and spices to a boil.
Add oatmeal and brown sugar.  Turn down heat to medium and cook 5-7 minutes, or until most of the moisture has gone- stirring occasionally. (Oatmeal will still thicken in next step)
Cover the oatmeal mixture and remove from heat.  Let stand 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, toast your walnuts in a dry pan or in the oven until lightly toasted.
Serve your oatmeal topped with the toasted walnuts and milk to taste.
