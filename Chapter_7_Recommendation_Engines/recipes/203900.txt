Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
2 cups cubed cooked chicken
2 cups cubed fully cooked ham
2 cups cubed Swiss cheese
1 cup broccoli florets
¼ cup honey
1 ½ cups mayonnaise
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
2 tablespoons chopped onion
½ cup olive oil
¼ cup white sugar
½ teaspoon garlic salt
2 tablespoons chopped parsley
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the bow tie pasta and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Combine pasta, chicken, ham, Swiss cheese, and broccoli in a large bowl. Set aside. Blend honey, mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, onion, olive oil, sugar, and garlic salt in a blender. Stir in parsley. Stir dressing into the pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of dressing. Chill salad and reserved dressing in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Stir in the remaining dressing and Parmesan cheese before serving.
