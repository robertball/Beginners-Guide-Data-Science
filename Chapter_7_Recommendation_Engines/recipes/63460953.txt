Ingredients:
4 c chicken stock
2T unsalted butter
1T canola or grapeseed oil
3 large shallots
2 c wild rice or 2c short grain brown rice
1/2 c dried cranberries
1 bay leaf
2 fresh thyme sprigs or 1/4 t dried thyme crumbled
sea salt and white pepper
1/2 c pecans, toasted and coarsely chopped (optional)
1/4 c minced flat leaf parsley

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375.  In a saucepan over medium-low heat, bring the stock to a simmer.
In a heavy 2-qt flameproof casserole, melt the butter with the oil over medium heat.  Add the shallots and saute until translucent, 2 - 3 minutes.  Add the rice and stir until the grains are well coated, about 3 minutes.  Stir in the simmering stock, dried cranberries, bay leaf, thyme, 1/2 t sea salt, and 1/8 t white pepper.  Bring to a simmer, stir, and cover.  Transfer the casserole to the oven and bake until all the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender, 40 - 45 minutes.
Remove from the oven.  Remove and discard the bay leaf and the thyme sprigs, if used.    Taste and adjust the seasoning.  Stir in the pecans and parsley.  Serve hot or warm.
