Ingredients:
1/2 cup ricotta cheese
1 tablespoon granular sucrolose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a cereal bowl, stir together the ricotta cheese, sweetener and vanilla. Cover with plastic wrap, and poke a hole to vent steam. Heat in the microwave oven for 2 to 3 minutes, until hot. Remove plastic wrap, stir and enjoy.

Description: 
This is a warm and satisfying way to start the day - a nice change from bacon and eggs when you are on a low-carb diet.  It may sound odd, but give it at try - it's actually yummy. This can also be made using maple extract.
