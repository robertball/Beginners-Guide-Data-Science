Ingredients:
8-10 day old buttermilk biscuits (buttermilk tastes best)
2 tablespoons cocoa powder
3 eggs, slightly beaten
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp fresh grated nutmeg
1 cup milk (1% is ok, whole milk is better)
1/2 cup granulated sugar.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Break biscuits into 1/2 to 3/4 inch pieces into a 9" baking dish(pre-buttered)
Thoroughly mix together eggs, milk, vanilla, and sugar.
Add cocoa powder and nutmeg to wet ingredients. Mix well.
Pour batter over biscuits until mix is covering almost all of the biscuit pieces.
Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
Best served warm with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream.
