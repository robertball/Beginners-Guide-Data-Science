Ingredients:
1 13.5oz can coconut milk (about 1 3/4 cups)
1 1/4 cup half-and-half
2 eggs
3/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup flaked coconut, toasted
1/4 teaspoon coconut extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 9-inch pie shell, baked
1 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
1. In a medium saucepan, combine coconut milk, half-and-half, eggs, 3/4 cup sugar, cornstarch and salt.  Bring to a boil over low to medium heat, whisking constantly.  Remove from heat, and stir in 1 cup of the coconut, and the vanilla and coconut extracts.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill 2-4 hours until firm - for best flavor, chill overnight.
2.  At least one hour before serving, combine the whipping cream, sugar and vanilla and whip until soft peaks form.
3.  Spread filling into pie crust and top with whipped cream.  Sprinkle reserved 1/4 cup coconut over the top.
4.  Note: To toast coconut, spread on an ungreased pan and bake 5-7 minutes at 350 degrees F, or until golden, stirring occasionally.
