Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (the larger the better and easier to roll)
4 slices Swiss cheese
4 slices cooked ham
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Pound chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness.  Place each breast on a square of plastic wrap.
Place 1 cheese slice and 1 ham slice on top of each breast.  Tuck in the sides of the breast and roll up tight like a jellyroll inside the plastic wrap. Squeeze the log gently to seal and twist both ends tight to form a nice log. Repeat with remaining chicken.  Let chicken breast rolls rest in the fridge for 30 minutes up to overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Coat a 7x11 inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink. Remove from oven.

Description: 
Purchase your chicken breasts in bulk packs either fresh or frozen at your local grocer to ultimately save money on this recipe. Make your own bread crumbs out of bread you have on hand.  Purchase your ham and Swiss cheese from your grocers deli, buying only the amount you need.  The Swiss cheese can be switched out for a sale priced cheese.Modified from: Chicken Cordon Bleu I
