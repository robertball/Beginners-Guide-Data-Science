Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup bread flour
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1 cup water, or as needed

Directions:
Mix whole wheat flour, bread flour, olive oil, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Mix in enough water to bring dough together.
Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface. Let rest for 10 to 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Divide dough into 6 to 8 pieces. Roll out each piece to paper-thin thickness. Transfer pieces of dough to the lined baking sheets; cut into strips or squares.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and edges curl up, 15 to 20 minutes.
