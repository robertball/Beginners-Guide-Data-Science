Description: 
Spinach, beets, carrots, nuts, fruits, 1/4 cup egg whites, 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal, sunflower seeds, celery, half an apple...anything your heart desires! Tastes healthy but delicious, and a protein-packed drink that packs a wallop! Chill if desired. Great for starting your day or workout. I like to pre-slice and freeze fruits for convenience. Any milk substitute will do!
