Ingredients:
5 C vegetable stock
2 C dry white wine
3 Tbsp olive oil
1.5 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 C butternut squash, 1/4" dice
2 C arborio rice
Salt and Pepper to taste
1/2 C sharp cheddar cheese, grated
1 pound mushrooms, washed and sliced
1 tomato, diced
1/2 onion, sliced
1 Tbsp butter

Directions:
In a medium sauce pan, warm the stock and wine over medium heat.
In a dutch oven, sautee the onions, butternut squash and garlic in olive oil until the squash is soft - about 15 minutes.
Add the rice to the vegetables and sautee for 5 minutes until the rice is lightly toasted and well covered in olive oil.
When the rice is a pale gold color, add the broth and wine mixture in half cup increments, stirring with each addition.
Continue stirring every five minutes until all of the stock is absorbed, about 25-30 minutes.
Once the rice is a creamy texture, and all stock is absorbed, remove from heat and stir in cheese and salt and pepper to taste.
Cover, to keep warm while preparing the mushroom topping.
In a small skillet, heat the butter and add onion.
Sautee onion until soft and translucent on medium heat.
Add mushrooms, sauteeing until the mushrooms have thrown off their liquid.
Add tomato, and cook for several minutes, allowing the mushroom and tomato liquids to mostly evaporate.
Serve by spooning risotto onto a dish and topping with the mushroom and tomato mixture.
