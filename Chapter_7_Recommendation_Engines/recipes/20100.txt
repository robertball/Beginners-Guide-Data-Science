Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a medium or large baking dish.
Rinse and dry fillets. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.
In a skillet or frying pan, melt butter over medium heat. Saute onion in butter until golden. Stir in flour until completely incorporated. Stir in mustard, 1/2 teaspoon salt, light and heavy creams. Cook until thickened, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in cheeses. Pour sauce over fish and sprinkle with paprika.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, until brown and bubbly.

Description: 
Delicious and cheesy but definitely NOT low fat! The onion and mustard make this fish in cream sauce seductively flavorful.
