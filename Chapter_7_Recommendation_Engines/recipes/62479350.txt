Ingredients:
6 large egg yolks
1 cup pure maple syrup
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup light cream
1 1/2 heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup walnuts, chopped

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks with the maple syrup, flour, and salt; set aside.
In a saucepan, bring the light cream to a simmer.
Slowly beat the hot light cream into the eggs and maple syrup.
Pour the entire mixture back into the pan and place over low heat.
Stir constantly, using a whisk or wooden spoon, until the custard thickens slightly (be careful not to let the mixture boil or the eggs will scramble).
Remove from heat and pour the custard through a strainer into a large clean bowl.
Let the custard cool slightly, then stir in the heavy cream and vanilla and chopped walnuts; cover and refrigerate until cold or overnight.
Stir the chilled custard; freeze in 1 or 2 batches in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer?s directions.
When done, the ice cream will be soft but ready to eat; for firmer ice cream, transfer to a freezer-safe container and freeze several hours.
