Description: 
When I was about 14, this cake made me a hero to my 7 year old brother.  Normally I did no baking or cooking as in our cash strapped home my mother was afraid I would just waste the ingredients.  I made it anyhow from the Neilson's cocoa can and the icing recipe from Marjorie our neighbour.  The cake recipe has been altered.
