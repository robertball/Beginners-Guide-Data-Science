Ingredients:
8 large tomatoes, cored
1 small sweet onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
4 leaves chopped fresh basil
2 tablespoons dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut an "x" in the bottom of each tomato. Fill a large mixing bowl with ice water.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add tomatoes to the boiling water until skins start to curl, about 30 seconds. Remove tomatoes from the boiling water and submerge in the bowl of ice water. When tomatoes have cooled enough to handle, remove from ice water. Remove and discard tomato skins; transfer tomatoes to a blender.
Blend tomatoes until liquefied, and transfer to a medium saucepan. Add onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer over medium heat until sauce reduces to desired consistency, 60 to 90 minutes.
Puree sauce with an immersion blender until smooth. Use sauce immediately, or store in the refrigerator overnight to allow flavors to develop.
