Ingredients:
1kg fresh tomatoes, washed.
4 Tbsp olive oil
3 cloves of garlic, crushed
25 grams fresh basil leaves, chopped
sale, as needed
dried hot peppers to taste
450g Bucatini pasta
100g di pecorino, grated

Directions:
In a tall pot, boil water with a bit of salt. Once at a rolling boil, add tomatoes for about 30 seconds, long enough to loosen the skin. With a slotted spoon, remove the tomatoes from the water and place them in a colander. Allow the tomatoes to cool a bit then peel the skins off.
Cook the bucatini in the same water.
While the bucatini are cooking, chop the tomatoes into cubes and put them into a large serving bowl. Add oil, garlic, basil and hot peppers. Stir to mix and combine.
Drain the bucatini and add to the tomato mixture. Mix and serve topping with cheese once in the plates.

Description: 
This is the most wonderful pasta ever. Bucatini are tossed with blanched tomatoes, olive oil, fresh garlic and basil then topped with fresh grated pecorino cheese to create a favourite summer Italian treat. I used to eat huge bowls of this, day and night, when I was pregnant with my kids and still enjoy it now, just in smaller quantities. :-)
