Description: 
This great healthy snack is full of protein that will satisfy that salty craving without the guilt. I serve this as an appetizer, as a snack, or as a meal on its own. It's simple, easy and everyone loves it. I choose to microwave the edamame because it is easy, but boiling or steaming will both work.
