Ingredients:
6 small red potatoes, chopped
1 green apple, cored and chopped
1/4 cup all purpose flour, or more as needed
salt to taste
vegetable oil for frying
1 pinch white sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Shred potatoes and apple in a food processor, in batches if necessary. Combine shredded potatoes and apple in a bowl with flour and salt. Dough should be thick and not loose.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add heaping tablespoons of the dough and flatten slightly. Cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and brown the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining dough. Sprinkle sugar on top of latkes.

Description: 
Sometimes I like to jazz it up a bit and serve these vegan latkes (potato pancakes) for a dinner entree. Spread applesauce on top or serve with a salad or soup! Delish!
