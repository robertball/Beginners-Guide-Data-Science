Description: 
'When I made this moist and tasty loaf for my vegetarian friends one Thanksgiving, they all took the recipe home with them,' says Sherry Barber from Whittier, California. 'To save time, I chop many of the ingredients a day ahead and store them in resealable plastic bags until baking day. I can't tell you how wonderful this loaf is.
