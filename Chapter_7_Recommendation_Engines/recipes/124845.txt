Ingredients:
1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
8 bacon strips, partially cooked
1 tablespoon finely chopped onion
3 tablespoons butter, margarine or bacon drippings
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Cook the beans until crisp-tender. Wrap about 15 beans in each bacon strip; secure with a toothpick. Place on a foil-covered baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until bacon is done. In a skillet, saute onion in butter until tender. Add vinegar, sugar and salt; heat through. Remove bundles to a serving bowl or platter; pour sauce over and serve immediately.

Description: 
I found this recipe in a rural newspaper years ago and have made it often. The bean bundles are excellent with chicken or beef. Sometimes I'll arrange them around a mound of wild rice to make an appetizing side dish.
