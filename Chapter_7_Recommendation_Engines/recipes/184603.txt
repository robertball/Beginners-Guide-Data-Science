Ingredients:
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
3 (4 ounce) fillets tilapia fillets
1 tablespoon Creole seasoning
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 lime, juiced
1 tablespoon butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup chopped yellow onion
1 large Anaheim chile pepper - stemmed, seeded, and chopped
4 roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
1/4 cup dry white wine
1 cup chicken stock
1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with half the olive oil. Rub the tilapia fillets in the oil to coat both sides. Season with the Creole seasoning, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt; sprinkle with the cilantro. Drizzle the fillets with the lime juice and remaining olive oil; set aside.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the garlic, onion, and Anaheim pepper; cook and stir until the onion has softened and begun to brown around the edges, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes more. Pour in the wine and simmer 1 minute, stirring constantly. Pour in the chicken stock and olives; season with cumin, cayenne pepper, oregano, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, red pepper flakes, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer about 20 minutes.
Bake the tilapia in the preheated oven until the flesh turns white and is easily flaked with a fork, about 20 minutes. Spoon the sauce over the fish to serve.
