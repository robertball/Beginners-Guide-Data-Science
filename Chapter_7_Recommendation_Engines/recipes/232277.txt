Ingredients:
¼ cup butter
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 large zucchini, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
1  yellow onion, diced
½  red bell pepper, diced
2  carrots, shredded
4 cloves garlic, minced
¼ cup all-purpose flour
3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed
1 cup half-and-half
1 pint fat-free half-and-half
2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken meat
1 (16 ounce) package small gnocchi
2 cups torn fresh spinach
salt and ground black pepper to taste
½ teaspoon ground thyme
¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

Directions:
Melt butter with olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Cook and stir zucchini, celery, onion, red bell pepper, carrots, and garlic in the hot butter and oil until vegetables are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir flour into mixture, coating vegetables; cook 2 more minutes.
Stir chicken broth into vegetables, stirring until flour paste combines with broth and soup is thick and smooth, about 5 minutes. Pour in both kinds of half-and-half; bring to a simmer. Cook until slightly thickened, about 5 more minutes. Gently fold chicken, gnocchi, and spinach into soup. Season with salt, black pepper, thyme, and nutmeg. Adjust thickness by adding more chicken broth, if desired.

Description: 
This is a favorite for cool weather sports nights when we all eat at different times. After adding the chicken and gnocchi, throw it in a slow cooker on the lowest setting so it is ready when you are. Serve with pesto bread sticks.
