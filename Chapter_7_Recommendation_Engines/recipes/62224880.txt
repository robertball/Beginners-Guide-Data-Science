Ingredients:
8-10 medium red potatoes
water to cover potatoes
1 green pepper
1 large onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 package bacon, cut into 1" pieces
1 cup milk
1/3 package Velveeta, cut into 1" cubes
1 tsp celery seed
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Quarter and cut potatoes into small pieces. You can peel them or scrub and leave skin on. You may leave the skin on for red or new potatoes, and peel if using others.
Place potatoes in large pot and cover with water; add salt. Boil, covered until tender.
While potatoes are boiling, place bacon, onion, garlic, and green pepper in another large pot and sauté until bacon is cooked, green peppers are tender, and onions are clear.
Drain bacon fat, except for about 1 tablespoon. Add celery seed, salt, and ground pepper and sauté for 1 more minute.
Add sautéd ingredients to undrained boiled potatoes. Turn heat to medium.
Add Velveeta and stir soup until cheese melts. Add milk, and stirring constantly, heat until soup is hot.
Be careful not to burn it.
