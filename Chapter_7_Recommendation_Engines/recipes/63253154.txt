Ingredients:
6 cups whole milk
2 cups heavy cream or half and half
3 tbsp distilled white vinegar (not white wine vinegar, just plain old in a big jug same as you use to clean with vinegar)
1 tsp. Kosher salt

Directions:
Combine all in a saucepan, heat gently over medium heat, stirring often, until the milk is simmering (Do Not Boil).  Keep stirring, don't walk away now.  Simmer until  you see curds forming, maybe 5 minutes or longer.  Remove from heat, let stand  for 10 min. or so to make sure milk has curdled.  Pour thru several layers of slightly damp cheesecloth lined strainer.(place a bowl or receptacle under the strainer to catch the draining liquid).  Let drain for 15-20 minutes and then gently squeeze the cheesecloth.  If serving now as an appetizer, spoon into a small serving dish, drizzle with a premium olive oil and sprinkle with Kosher Salt and serve with toasted crostini bread.   Add to pasta dishes.  Refrigerate remainder .  Best used warm and use within 2-3 days.
