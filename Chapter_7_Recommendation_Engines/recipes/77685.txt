Ingredients:
1 tablespoon wok oil or peanut oil
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces
1 medium red bell pepper, chopped
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon sugar
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and chopped
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1 bunch cilantro, chopped
2 cups chopped dry roasted peanuts

Directions:
Heat the oil in a wok over medium heat. Place chicken in the wok, and cook until juices run clear. Mix in red bell pepper, and continue cooking until tender.
In a bowl, mix the broth, soy sauce, sugar, garlic, cayenne pepper, ginger, and cornstarch. Pour into the wok. Toss green onions and cilantro into wok (reserving some of each for garnish). Continue to cook and stir 5 minutes, until slightly thickened. Mix in peanuts, and garnish with reserved green onions and cilantro to serve.

Description: 
This wonderful recipe is a family favorite of ours - and we have 3 very young children! Everyone who enjoys this recipe always asks what restaurant we ordered it from! It is fast and simple to make. I would say it's a bit like a stir fry with a Thai flavor! Serve on top of cooked brown or classic white rice. Very good with a simple side like mandarin oranges to complete this meal
