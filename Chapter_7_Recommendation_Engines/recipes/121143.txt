Description: 
The idea of onion muffins came from a friend of ours who ate onion sandwiches every day. I felt they needed some extra flavor, so I experimented and came up with some simple additions. These muffins make a delicious lunch, which I find men and children especially enjoy. -Fran Skalisky, Sebeka, Minnesota
