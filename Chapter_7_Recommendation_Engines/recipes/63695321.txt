Ingredients:
12 Minced garlic cloves
3 Finely chopped jalepeno peppers (with seeds and veins)
3 Lemons, juiced
2 Cups extra virgin olive oil
30 Bone-in chicken thighs (skin on)
Freshly cracked pepper and sea salt
For BBQ Sauce:
2 cups ketchup
1 cup water
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
1/4 cup siracha
5 tablespoons light brown sugar
1/2 tablespoon fresh ground black pepper
1/2 tablespoon onion powder
2 tablespoon prepared mustard
3 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Use the first four ingredients to make a marinade, allowing the mixture to rest for at least one hour
In a shallow container, cover the chicken with the marinade for at least 6 hours (preferably overnight)
In a medium sauce pan, combine all ingredients for the sauce and simmer for 25 minutes.
After the marinating process is complete, remove the skin from each thigh (one at a time)
Trim excess fat from the edges of each thigh.  If there are any veins on the bottom of the thigh, trim that away as well
Using a sharp knife, scrape the fat from the bottom side of the chicken's skin (until the skin is essentially transparent.
Re-wrap the trimmed thigh with the skin
Liberally coat the chicken with salt and pepper
Using heavy smoke from pecan wood (or your wood of choice)cook the chicken at a temperature of 265 - 285 farenheight for two hours
During the final 45 minutes of cooking, liberally apply the barbeque sauce 2 - 3 times
Serve the chicken immediately

Description: 
Chicken thighs are the easiest part of the chicken to cook!  Taking the time to create your own sauce will provide a unique flavor that most backyard cooks will not bring to the table
