1 cup chopped pecans or walnuts
1 (18.5 ounce) package yellow cake mix

In a large mixing bowl, combine cake mix, pudding mix, eggs, BACARDI(R) Gold Rum, oil and water. Using an electric mixer, beat at low speed until moistened. Beat at high speed 2 minutes. Pour batter over nuts. Bake 1 hour or until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean. Cool 15 minutes, then invert onto serving plate.
Melt butter in saucepan. Stir in sugar, water and BACARDI(R) Gold Rum. Boil 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Prick top of the cake with a fork. Spoon and brush glaze evenly over the top and sides. Allow cake to absorb glaze. Repeat until all glaze is absorbed.
