Ingredients:
2 large cucumbers, peeled
1 tsp salt
1/4 cup white onion, minced
1 cup sour cream
2 tbsp white wine vinegar
2 tbsp fresh dill, chopped (or 2 tsp dried)
1 tbsp sugar
dash of white pepper
1/2 cup mild blue cheese, crumbled
salt to taste

Directions:
Peel cucumbers, slice in half lengthwise, and scoop out seeds with a spoon. Slice into thick half-moons and place on a plate layered with paper towels. Sprinkle about 1/2 tsp salt over them and set aside for 10 minutes.
In medium bowl combine onion through pepper & mix thoroughly. Pat cucumbers dry with paper towels and toss into sour cream mixture. Fold in blue cheese. Refrigerate for at least an hour and salt to taste before serving.

Description: 
Move over plain jane cucumber salad! This salad makes an entrance with unusual chunks of blue cheese tossed in for a creamy burst of flavor. If blue cheese is to strong for you, try a mild feta and a squirt of lemon! When testing this recipe, both light and regular sour cream held up well, while the fat free version tended to water out quickly.
