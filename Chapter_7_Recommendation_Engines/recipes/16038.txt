2 cups fresh sliced mushrooms

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and reserve.

In a small bowl, combine milk and cornstarch; stir into vegetable mixture. Stir and cook over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 1 minute more; add cheese and stir until melted. Pour sauce over pasta and garnish with tomato wedges. Serve.
