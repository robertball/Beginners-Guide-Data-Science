Description: 
This a quick and easy hot sauce my dad makes with canned tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, and spices. My mom had to go behind him to write down what he was tossing in. Charring the jalapeno peppers (optional) gives it that smokiness, and the jalapeno pepper seeds need to be in the hot sauce (picante) for the heat.
