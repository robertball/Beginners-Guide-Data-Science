Ingredients:
1 1/4 c. vegetable oil
1 tsp garlic powder (not garlic salt)
1 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp cayenne
2 - pkg ranch dressing mix (small package)
3 Tbsp crushed red pepper flakes
1 box (4 sleeves) saltine crackers (You could use any type of cracker - we also love white cheddar Cheez-its.)

Directions:
Mix all ingredients except crackers.
Stir to thoroughly combine the oil and spices.
Place the crackers into a large 2 GALLON ziplock bag.  Slowly pour the spice/oil mixture over the crackers while gently moving the crackers around in the bag.
Seal the bag, and GENTLY turn the bag over and over to cover the crackers with the spice mix.
Let the bag sit for about 1 hour, then turn to coat again.
Repeat this step several times to let the crackers "marinate" and they are well-coated with the spice mix.
Best of you let it sit overnight before serving.
Store in an air tight container.
* I decrease the oil to 3/4 - 1 c.
* Our favorite: use 1 family size box of white cheddar Cheez-its instead of the saltines!
* These measurements are from the original recipe.  If you like less spicy, omit the black pepper and cayenne, and decreased the crushed red pepper flakes.
* Additional use: crush the crackers in the food processor and using them to coat chicken tenders before baking.
