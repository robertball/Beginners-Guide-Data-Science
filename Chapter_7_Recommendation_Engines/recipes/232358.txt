Ingredients:
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon mint extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (12 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Stir heavy cream, sweetened condensed milk, milk, mint extract, vanilla extract, and chocolate chips in a bowl until evenly mixed.
Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until softly frozen. Transfer ice cream to a lidded container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours to overnight.
