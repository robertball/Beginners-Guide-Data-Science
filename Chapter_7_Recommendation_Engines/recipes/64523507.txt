Description: 
This cookie is part of my 12 Days of Christmas: Holiday and Celebration Cookies from Around the World collection that I make every year to give as gifts for the holiday season.  I love this cookie because of the ricotta cheese.  These are so delicious!  This recipe yields about 8 dozen cookies.  Trust me you won't be able to stop eating them.
