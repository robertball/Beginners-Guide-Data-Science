Ingredients:
1 pound breakfast sausage, mild
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
3 to 4 cups whole milk, more to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons black pepper, more to taste
Biscuits, warmed, for serving (use canned biscuits from refrigerator section unless you are a biscuit master, then make from scratch using your own recipe)

Directions:
Bake biscuits according to package directions.
With your fingers (or spoon), tear small pieces of sausage and add them in a single layer to a large heavy skillet. Brown the sausage over medium-high heat until no longer pink. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Sprinkle on half the flour and stir so that the sausage soaks it all up, then add more little by little. Stir it around and cook it for another minute or so, then pour in the milk, stirring constantly.
Cook the gravy, stirring frequently, until it thickens. (This may take a good 10 to 12 minutes or longer if making a large batch.) Sprinkle in the salt and pepper and continue cooking until very thick and luscious. If it gets too thick too soon, just splash in another 1/2 cup of milk or more if needed. Taste and adjust the seasoning.
