Description: 
S'mores indoors have all the flavors and textures of fire-roasted s'mores but can be prepared indoors any time of the year! Kids and adults are going to love these slightly elevated summer campfire favorites. I used semisweet chocolate chips, but this recipe will work with milk chocolate and white chocolate chips as well.
