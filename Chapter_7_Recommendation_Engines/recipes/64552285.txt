Ingredients:
one whole chicken, thawed
medium yellow onion
head of garlic
1 tsp dried rosemary or 3 sprigs fresh rosemary
1 tsp dried thyme or 5 sprigs of thyme
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp lemon pepper
drizzle of olive oil
salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Slice yellow onion into fours and halve garlic head, then place on the bottom of slow cooker. Remove any bags of gizzards, etc. from inside of the chicken.
Mix all dried spices in a small bowl and then sprinkle all around the chicken (top, bottom and sides). Place chicken on top of onion and garlic and throw in any fresh spices. Drizzle a bit of olive oil on top of chicken, then cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours. The vegetables and chicken will create it's own juice, but feel free to add a tiny bit of stock if you like.
