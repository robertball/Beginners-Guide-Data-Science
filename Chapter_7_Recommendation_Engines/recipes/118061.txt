Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package ramen noodles
1 1/2 cups hot water
8 ounces boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 2-inch strips
2 teaspoons canola oil, divided
1 large green pepper, cubed
2/3 cup chopped onion
1 garlic clove, minced
1/2 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
2 teaspoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon salt-free seasoning blend
1 small tomato, cut into wedges

Directions:
In a bowl, place noodles in hot water for 2 minutes; drain and set aside. Discard seasoning package or save for another use. In a large nonstick skillet, stir-fry chicken in 1 teaspoon oil until no longer pink. Remove and keep warm. Stir-fry the green pepper, onion and garlic in remaining oil until crisp-tender. Add the chicken broth, soy sauce, seasoning blend and noodles; toss gently. Add tomato; heat through.
