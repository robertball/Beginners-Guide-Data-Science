Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon coconut extract
1 3/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup shredded coconut

Directions:
Cream the butter until smooth; add sugar and continue creaming until light and fluffy. Stir in egg, vanilla and coconut flavoring.
Sift the flour with the salt and baking soda. Alternately add the flour mixture and the shredded coconut to the creamed mixture. Form the dough into logs about 2 inches in diameter. Tightly wrap dough and chill for at least two hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Remove dough from refrigerator and cut into 1/4-inch slices. Bake on an ungreased cookie sheet until the edges are golden, about 10 minutes. Cool on wire rack.
