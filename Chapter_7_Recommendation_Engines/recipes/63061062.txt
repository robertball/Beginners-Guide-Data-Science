Ingredients:
2 lb extra lean ground beef
20 oz farfalle (bowtie) uncooked pasta
1 cup of shredded mozzarella & cheddar cheese
1/2 yellow onion, chopped
4-5 cloves of garlic, finely diced
2 cups tomato sauce
1-2 tbsp Italian seasoning
1/4 cup ketchup
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
Optional: chili pepper flakes
Sauce
3 tbsp butter
3 tbsp flour
4 cups milk
pinch of nutmeg

Directions:
Set a large skillet to medium high heat. Add oil.
Add onions and garlic and cook for approx 3-4 minutes or until soften.
Add ground meat and spices and cook until brown, approx 5 minutes.
Add tomato sauce and ketchup, mix well and turn heat to low and let simmer.
Fill a pot of water and set to high heat. Once boiling, add pasta and cook until al dente, approx 7-9 minutes. Drain pasta once cooked.
In the meantime set a small pot to medium high heat and add butter, flour and slowly pour in milk and keep stirring. Add nutmeg. Once it boils, turn off heat.
Preheat oven to 375F.
In a large casserole dish, place a layer of pasta, followed by a layer of the meat mixture, and then the bechamel. Repeat layering in this order.
Top it with shredded cheese.
Cover and cook for 25 minutes. Remove foil and broil for 5 minutes or until brown and bubbly.
