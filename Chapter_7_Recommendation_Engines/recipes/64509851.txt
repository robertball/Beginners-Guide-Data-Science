1 tablespoon sea salt
1 tablespoon white or black pepper
1 tablespoon onion powder
2 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon dried oregano

Place all into glass measuring cup which holds over one cup and gently whisk together.   Seal in airtight container.  Makes approximately 2/3 cup of seasoning to use as desired in strength.  I use about 1 tablespoon each recipe.

Description: 
Mildly spicy, not too hot,  a must add to lots of things for a divine flavor spark.   I use it in my chicken Marsala, in fried chicken (even gluten free) and seafood dishes.  Shake some into the flour mixture and dredge meats thru it.  Not offensive to the delicate palate.  Easy enough to make, and with most of the items found in your pantry already.
