Ingredients:
Crepe Batter:
1 cup milk
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
3 eggs
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 pinch salt
Filling:
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
Sauce:
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
2 tablespoons dry white wine

Directions:
Combine milk, flour, and eggs in a blender. Blend on high speed until well mixed, about 1 minute. Let batter rest for 30 minutes.
Heat an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Lift pan and pour about 3 tablespoons batter into the center; tilt skillet so batter evenly coats bottom. Cook until top appears dry, 45 to 60 seconds. Flip and cook 15 to 20 seconds more. Remove crepe and stack onto a plate. Repeat with remaining batter; you will have leftover crepes for another use.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter for filling in a skillet over medium heat. Add bell peppers and onion; stir-fry until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant. Add remaining butter, shrimp, and Cajun seasoning.
Mix cream, flour, and Cajun seasoning together; slowly pour into the shrimp mixture. Cook and stir until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Pour in white wine and cook until heated through and thickened as desired, 2 to 5 minutes more.
Spoon some of the shrimp filling into the middle of each crepe and roll crepe around filling, or fold in halves or quarters.
