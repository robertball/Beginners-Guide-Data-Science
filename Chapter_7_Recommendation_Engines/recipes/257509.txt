Ingredients:
1/2 cup sticky rice
1 egg
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, minced
2 teaspoons soy sauce
salt to taste
4 ounces ground pork
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon pork stock, or as needed
1/4 cup water, or as needed
1 teaspoon dried goji berries (wolfberries), or to taste

Directions:
Rinse sticky rice and place in a bowl; cover with water. Soak rice for at least 3 hours. Drain.
Beat egg in a large bowl; mix in ginger root, soy sauce, and salt. Add pork, cornstarch, and pork stock; stir in 1 direction until combined, 5 to 6 minutes. Roll pork mixture into bite-size balls.
Pour enough water into the bottom of a wok to cover by about 1 inch; bring to a simmer.
Roll pork balls in sticky rice until they are coated completely. Place 6 balls in a steamer basket.
Place steamer in the wok and steam until pork is cooked through and rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove balls and garnish with goji berries.
