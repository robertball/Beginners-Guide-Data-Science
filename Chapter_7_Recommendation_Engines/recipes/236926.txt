Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) bag dark chocolate chips (such as GhirardelliÂ® 60% Cacao)
1 (12 ounce) package low-fat silken tofu, at room temperature
1/3 cup maple syrup
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon milk, or as needed

Directions:
Melt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, about 5 minutes.
Blend melted chocolate, tofu, maple syrup, and vanilla extract together in a food processor or blender until smooth. Add milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, to tofu mixture with the food processor on high until mousse is creamy and pudding-consistency. Pour mousse into a serving dish and refrigerate until set, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
Guaranteed to go viral; everyone wants the recipe, and they'll never know it has tofu! It's an easy, rich, and creamy chocolate mousse that is adapted from a vegan version. It is much healthier than regular chocolate mousse. Try adapting it further by adding coffee for a mocha mousse, peanut butter, or even strawberry jelly! It can be served immediately but it will set up further when chilled.
