Ingredients:
6 ounces milk chocolate, chopped
6 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons corn syrup
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 teaspoon table salt
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 cup dried tart cherries
1 cup shelled pistachios
Edible gold leaf, for garnish

Directions:
Line a 13 by 9-inch pan with foil, leaving 2 "handles" extended from the sides.
Add the chocolate to a glass bowl set over simmering water. Stir constantly to melt the chocolate. Add the heavy cream, corn syrup, butter, salt, and cayenne. Stir until smooth and remove from the heat.
Add the cherries and pistachios and stir to incorporate. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and smooth out the mixture evenly with a rubber spatula. Sprinkle with the edible gold leaf on top. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to firm up.
Once the chocolate is firm, remove it from the pan, using the foil handles to lift it. Remove the foil from the bottom and cut the chocolate into chunks on a plastic cutting board with a sharp knife.
