Ingredients:
1 packet active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (~100-~110)
5oz can evaporated milk
3/4 cup sugar
1 15 oz can pumpkin
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 egg, beaten
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
6 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons pumpkin pie spice
4 tablespoons melted butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
3oz pkg cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons melted butter
1 cup powdered sugar
1/4 cup milk

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, proof the yeast with the water, 5-10 minutes.
Add evaporated milk, sugar, pumpkin, olive oil, and egg.  Mix until combined.
Add in 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and 5 cups of flour.  Knead for 8 minutes, forming a stiff dough.  Add more flour if necessary.  This dough will be slightly sticker than most doughs.
Let rise in a warm place in a lightly oiled bowl for 45 mins.  The dough will not double in size.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Punch down dough and roll out flat, around an 18x26 inch rectangle.
Brush dough with 4 tablespoons of butter.  Combine brown sugar and remaining 2 tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice.  Sprinkle the dough with the brown sugar mixture.
Roll dough and cut into 12 equal size pieces.  Place in greased 9x13 baking pan.  Place in oven for 30-40 minutes, or until light browning on top has occurred.
While cinnamon rolls cook, combine vanilla, 2 tablespoons of melted butter,  cream cheese, milk, and powdered sugar.  Pour over cinnamon rolls as soon as they come out of the oven.
