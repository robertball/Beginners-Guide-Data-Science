Ingredients:
1 tablespoon oil, or to taste
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup grill seasoning (such as Weber® Chicago Steak® Seasoning)
2 tablespoons seasoned salt
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 large round steaks - tenderized, trimmed, and cut into about 4-ounce portions
1/4 cup oil for frying, or as needed
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)
1 onion, sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat the inside of a roasting pan with about 1 tablespoon oil.
Mix flour, grill seasoning, seasoned salt, garlic powder, and black pepper to together in a shallow bowl. Dredge steak in the flour mixture until all sides are coated, shaking off excess. Place coated steak on a plate and let rest for 5 minutes.
Heat enough oil in a skillet to coat the bottom of the pan over medium-high heat. Add steak, a few pieces at a time, to the hot oil; fry until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer browned steak to the prepared roasting pan.
Mix beef broth, cream of mushroom soup, and diced tomatoes with green chile peppers together in a bowl; pour into the roasting pan. Top broth mixture with onion slices.
Bake in the preheated oven until steak is tender, about 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

This is tender and delicious round steak with a hint of heat. I had the spicy tomatoes in the cupboard and decided to throw them in my recipe. My family loved it.
