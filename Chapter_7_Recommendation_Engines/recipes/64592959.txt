Ingredients:
1¼ cups (one 12-ounce bottle) sweet chile sauce
1 tablespoon hot sauce, or more to taste
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2 dozen chicken wings
Cilantro, for garnish (optional)

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil.
2. In a large bowl, mix the sweet chile sauce with the hot sauce, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder to combine.
3. Add the chicken wings to the bowl and toss well to coat. The glaze should be thick enough to easily coat the chicken.
4. Transfer the chicken to the prepared baking sheet and roast until the chicken is fully cooked, 15 to 20 minutes. Raise the oven temperature to 425°F and continue to cook until the glaze begins to brown, about 5 minutes more.
5. Transfer the wings to a serving dish and garnish with cilantro, if using. Serve immediately.
