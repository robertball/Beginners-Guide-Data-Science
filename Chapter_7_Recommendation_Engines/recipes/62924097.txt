Ingredients:
4 cups of all purpose white flour
2 teaspoons of baking powder
1 heaping teaspoon of salt
1/4 cup of canola oil
1 and 1/4 cups of warm water. (Plus  up to 1/4 cup more if needed)

Directions:
Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl.
Add 1/4 cup of canola oil to 1 and 1/4 cups of water.
Mix with a fork, forming into a ball.  If dough is still dry,  add up to 1/4 cup more water if needed to form dough.
Use your hands to knead the dough in the bowl for 3-4 minutes. Add a small amount of flour if the dough is sticking to your hands. The dough should have a smooth appearance.
Form the dough into 12 to 16 balls about the size of an egg.
Cover the bowl with a cotton towel to keep tortillas from drying out. Let dough rest for 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile preheat a cast iron griddle on medium high heat.
Roll out one tortilla at a time using a rolling pin on a floured surface. The tortilla should be around 6 to 8 inches in diameter.
Place the tortilla on a hot cast iron griddle (not greased.) Turn the tortilla with a spatula when small areas are browned, (less than a minute.)
Stack and cover the tortillas with a cotton towel or foil until ready to serve.
Store tortillas in the refrigerator in a gallon size plastic bag or place in the freezer.
To reheat tortillas, place in the microwave for 10 seconds.

Description: 
Most flour tortillas use lard or vegetable shortening as one of the ingredients. This recipe uses canola oil with the same great tortilla taste. A great alternative for those of you who are allergic to soy products.  Add a bowl of green chili and then get ready to sop it up with a tasty tortilla.
