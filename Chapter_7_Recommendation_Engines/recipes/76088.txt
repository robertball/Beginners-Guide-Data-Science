Ingredients:
2 cups milk
3 eggs
1 tablespoon water
1 cup dry bread crumbs
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 Red Delicious apple, cored and diced
1 (8 ounce) package dry bread stuffing mix
2 cups apple juice, or as needed
2 tablespoons butter, or as needed
1 Red Delicious apple - peeled, cored and diced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour the milk into a shallow bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and water. Place the bread crumbs in a shallow dish or on a plate. Dip the chicken breast halves into the milk, then into the egg, then press into the bread crumbs to coat. Place on a plate, and set aside.
Prepare the stuffing mix according to the package directions, but substituting apple juice for the water. When bringing the juice and butter to a boil, add the diced apple with peel to the pan. Stir in the stuffing mix until the liquid is absorbed. Transfer the stuffing to a baking dish, and top with the pieces of the remaining apple. Place the chicken breasts on top of the stuffing, and cover with aluminum foil.
Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the chicken juices run clear.
