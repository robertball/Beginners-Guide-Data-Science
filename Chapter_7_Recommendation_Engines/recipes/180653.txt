Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
3 carrots, chopped
2 sweet potatoes, chopped
1 eggplant, chopped
4 plum tomatoes, chopped
3 zucchini, chopped
1/2 cup raisins
3 (16 ounce) cans chicken broth
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon honey
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (15.5 ounce) can garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat oil in the bottom of a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat . Cook and stir the onion, green bell pepper, and garlic in the oil until tender, about 5 minutes.
Place the carrots, sweet potatoes, eggplant, plum tomatoes, zucchini, and raisins in the pot with the onion mixture. Stir in the chicken broth, lemon juice, honey, and season with cumin, coriander, turmeric, and cinnamon. Bring the stew to a boil over high heat, cover, and reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.
Pour the garbanzo beans into the stew and season with salt and pepper. Stir to combine and cook the soup for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.
