Zucchini Zazzle!
You asked for it, you got it. Here's our recipe for lightened-up zucchini nut muffins. Hooray!
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups shredded zucchini (about 1 large zucchini)?
1 cup whole-wheat flour?
1/2 cup all-purpose flour?
2/3 cup Splenda No Calorie Sweetener (granulated)?
1/3 cup brown sugar (not packed)?
1/2 cup fat-free liquid egg substitute (like Egg Beaters Original)?
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce?
3 tbsp. light whipped butter or light buttery spread (like Brummel & Brown)?
3 tbsp. crushed walnuts, divided?
1 1/2 tsp. baking powder?
1 tsp. cinnamon?
1 tsp. vanilla extract?
1/2 tsp. nutmeg?
1/2 tsp. salt
Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a medium bowl, combine both types of flour, Splenda, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.
In a separate medium bowl, mix together the zucchini, egg substitute, applesauce, butter, and vanilla extract. Slowly add this mixture to the first bowl, and stir until thoroughly blended. Mix half the crushed walnuts (1 1/2 tbsp.) into the batter.
Line 9 cups of a 12-cup muffin pan with baking liners and/or spray with nonstick spray. Evenly distribute batter among the 9 cups. Top each cup with a sprinkling of the remaining 1 1/2 tbsp. crushed walnuts.
Bake in the oven for 20 - 25 minutes, until a toothpick poked into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Let cool and then enjoy!
