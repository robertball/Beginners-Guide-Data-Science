Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup chopped onions
2 cloves minced garlic
3/4 cup chili sauce
1/2 cup beer
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
3 1/2 pounds country style pork ribs

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onions and garlic in hot oil until fragrant and softened, 4 to 6 minutes.
Stir chili sauce, beer, honey, Worcestershire sauce, and dry mustard into onion mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until sauce thickens and flavors develop, 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake ribs in a baking dish in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Spread sauce over ribs and return to oven; bake until sauce bubbles and ribs are tender, 1 hour.
