Ingredients:
1 cup broccoli florets
1 tablespoon butter, melted
½ cup low-fat cottage cheese
1  egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons milk
1 cup cornmeal
½ teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch cake pan.
Bring an inch of water to a boil in a large saucepan.  Place broccoli in pan and cover. Steam until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, and rinse with cold water until cold; squeeze out excess water.
Combine melted butter, cottage cheese, egg, milk, and steamed broccoli in a large bowl. In a separate large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, baking soda, and salt.  Make a depression in the middle of the dry ingredients; spoon in broccoli mixture. Stir until well combined. Spoon into prepared pan.
Bake until a knife inserted into the center of the pan comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Loosen edges of cooked cornbread with a knife. Cut into wedges to serve.

Description: 
Quick and easy cornbread from scratch with fresh broccoli and low fat cottage cheese. This cornbread, though not cake-like and sweet like many recipes, is still moist and is quite savory. Since many people don't own an iron skillet, this recipe uses a cake pan instead.
