Ingredients:
1 medium to large head of cabbage, coarsely shredded.
1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped
5 or 6 chopped green onions, including the tops (save some to sprinkle on the top of this dish)
---
1 and 3/4 cups mayonnaise
1/2 cup white vinegar
3 Tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
---
2 large tomatoes cut into wedges.
Sprinkle with reserved chopped green onions.

Directions:
1. In large bowl combine the cabbage, yellow onion and green onion. (Grama literally used to hold large chunks of cabbage and shred it with a sharp knife that way right into the bowl).
2. In a smaller bowl combine the mayo (or salad dressing), white vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper.
3. Pour the dressing over the cabbage and onions in the large bowl and mix it all up. Add more salt, pepper or sugar to taste. If you wish, place slaw in a serving bowl.
Then arrange over the top the 2 large tomatoes cut into wedges, and sprinkle it all with the reserved chopped green onions.

Description: 
My Grama Kid lived for a large part of her life on a cattle farm on a lake in northern Minnesota. I think some of the recipes were designed with preservation in mind as they only had iceboxes up until the 1950's. She had a huge garden (that she had trouble keeping the deer out of), and she was a GREAT cook. There were 3 salads where the dressings were variations on the same thing and they did something different depending on the vegetable used. She always had one of these on her table. 
This is the one that everybody asked for the most:)
