1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 cup butter, melted
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
1/4 cup pure maple syrup

1 cup shredded zucchini
1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
1/2 cup white chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350* F
In small bowl, whisk or soft together the flour, baking powder and salt.  Set aside.
In large bowl, beat butter and brown sugar until well-blended; beat in eggs, one at a time, then maple syrup and maple flavoring.
Stir in flour mixture until just blended.
Squeeze the shredded zucchini to remove excess liquid.  Fold in zucchini, then walnuts and white chocolate.
Spread batter into an 8 1/2" x 11" baking dish; bake for 30 minutes or until tester inserted in center comes out clean.
Let cool ten to fifteen minutes before cutting into squares.
