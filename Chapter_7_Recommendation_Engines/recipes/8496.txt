Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) whole chicken
1 ½ cups prepared barbecue sauce

Directions:
Put chicken, legs up, into slow cooker.  Pour sauce over and inside the chicken.  Cover.
Cook for 8 to 10 hours on low setting.  It is not a good idea to check it, as steam escapes and it takes quite awhile to reheat.

Description: 
Easiest recipe I've ever fixed!   I received it when my oldest son was a baby --today he is 17 and it is still a hit!   Just a few minutes of preparation, and all day cooking.   Dinner will be hot and ready whenever you have a chance to eat.  Meat falls from the bones, and sauce can be used as a gravy for rice or potatoes.  Enjoy!
