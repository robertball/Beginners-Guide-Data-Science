Ingredients:
3 pounds skinless, boneless trout fillets
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 small onion, chopped
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
3 eggs
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon pepper seasoning
vegetable oil for frying
Cocktail Sauce:
3/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a piece of aluminum foil large enough to wrap up trout in a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Place trout in the prepared pan; drizzle butter and lemon juice on top. Fold up aluminum foil to enclose trout in a packet.
Bake in the preheated oven until flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 1 hour. Cool for 10 minutes. Flake into a large bowl; add onion and celery. Mix in seasoned bread crumbs.
Beat eggs, mayonnaise, and lemon pepper seasoning in a small bowl until blended. Mix into trout mixture. Form trout mixture into 12 patties.
Heat oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Fry patties in batches until deep golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
Mix ketchup and horseradish together in a small bowl to make cocktail sauce. Serve with trout patties.

Description: 
Came up with this recipe because I have 2 avid fishermen in my home and plenty of trout to cook.
 Also have a recipe for an easy homemade cocktail sauce, which goes well with the patties, but it's optional.
