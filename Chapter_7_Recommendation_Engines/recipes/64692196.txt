Chocolate Pots de Creme Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
12 oz semisweet chocolate chips (1.5 cups)
4 cups heavy cream for whipping
8 egg yolks

Directions:
1. Carefully separate the yolks from the whites and set aside in a bowl.
2. In a heavy bottomed saucepan, boil chocolate and cream on medium high, stirring constantly until thick and smooth.
3. Remove from heat and let cool, slowly stirring for 2-3 minutes.  This step is crucial to success--if your mixture is too hot, it will cook the yolks into tough ribbons rather than the yolks acting as a thickening agent.
4.  Keeping off heat, slowly drop egg yolks one at a time into the mixture, stirring constantly as  the mixture thickens.
5.  Fill demitasse cups, or any small dishes you prefer.  I sometimes use tea cups or even just a beautiful large serving dish with the whole recipe in it.
