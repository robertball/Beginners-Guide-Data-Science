Ingredients:
Sushi Rice:
1/3 cup Japanese sushi-style rice
1/3 cup water
2 1/4 teaspoons rice vinegar
2 1/4 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
Sushi Rolls:
4 ounces sashimi-grade yellowfin tuna, cut into small chunks
1/3 cup mayonnaise
3 tablespoons chile oil, or more to taste
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce
1 green onion, diced
3 sheets nori, cut in half
1/2 small ripe avocado, thinly sliced
1/4 English cucumber, cut into matchsticks

Directions:
Rinse rice in a strainer until water runs clear.
Combine rice and water in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat; stir until sugar is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour over rice; stir until rice cools and looks dry.
Mix tuna, mayonnaise, chile oil, sesame oil, sriracha sauce, and green onion in a bowl with a fork, mashing to break up some of the chunks. Leave a few chunks intact for texture.
Cover a bamboo sushi rolling mat with plastic wrap. Lay 1 nori sheet, shiny-side down, on the mat. Spread a thin layer of rice over the nori. Layer avocado slices across the rice. Flip nori sheet so avocado is against the mat. Spread a generous layer of tuna mixture 3/4 of the way down the back of the nori; top with cucumber matchsticks.
Roll up sushi using the rolling mat, tucking in ends with the plastic wrap. Remove plastic wrap and place sushi roll on a plate. Repeat with remaining nori, rice, avocado, tuna mixture, and cucumber.
