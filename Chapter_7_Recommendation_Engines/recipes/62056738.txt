Ingredients:
2 15 oz. cans tomato sauce
2 16 oz. cans jellied cranberry sauce
3 lbs. ground round (NOT chuck)
3 large eggs
3/4 cup bread crumbs
1 1/2 tbsp dried parsley
Salt and pepper as desired

Directions:
Heat the tomato sauce and the cranberry sauce in a large pot until the cranberry sauce is melted and smooth.  Turn down to a simmer and cover.
Mix remaining ingredients together well.  Form the meat into small meatballs, approx. 1" each.  Drop in to the hot sauce.  Bring back to a boil, then reduce the heat again to medium-low and cook the meatballs until they are done, about 30 minutes.  May be served on cocktail toothpicks or over noodles.
