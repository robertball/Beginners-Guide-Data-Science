Description: 
This dressing packs a punch of flavor without the use of dried herbs or spices.  I wanted a recipe that explodes with freshness, a bit of tang and traditional ranch flavor. It can be made on the lighter side if you wish.  Use it to dip veggies or decadent foods such as fried onion rings or chicken strips.  Stores well in the refrigerator.
