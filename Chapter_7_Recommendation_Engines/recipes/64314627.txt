Ingredients:
1/4 cup raw cashews or cashew butter
1/4 cup walnuts
1/4 cup raw sunflower seeds
1/4 cup raw almonds
3 soft medjool dates

Directions:
Grind the nuts and seeds in a high-powered blender of coffee grinder to make a fine nut flour. I often use the back of a wooden spoon to crush the walnuts into a paste.
Knead mashed medjool dates into the powdered/crushed nuts. Add the cashew butter if using and continue to knead until an even consistency.
Mold into bite-size balls that toddlers can use as finger food.
You can grind a large amount of the nuts at one time and store in the freezer for later use.
