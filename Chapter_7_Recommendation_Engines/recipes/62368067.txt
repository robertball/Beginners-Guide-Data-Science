Ingredients:
a baked single crust pie shell or a graham cracker crust
1 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup freshly squeezed Key Lime juice
1/4 cup Cuervo Gold tequila
1/4 tsp salt
3 tbsp sugar or splenda
3 eggs separated

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350F
Mix the lime juice, tequila, salt, 1 tbsp of the sugar and the egg yolks until very well combined.  The reaction of the milk and the lime juice will make for a thick filling.  Pour the mixture into the prepared pie crust and top with the meringue made by beating the egg whites with the remaining two tbsp of sugar until stiff peaks are formed.
Bake the pie for 15 minutes or until lightly browned on top.
Use Key limes not limes; there is a difference
