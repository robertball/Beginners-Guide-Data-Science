Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1-2 teaspoon baking powder
pinch of salt
1/2 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup superfine sugar
1 large egg, beaten
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2/3 cup sour milk
FILLING:
1 tablespoons light corn syrup
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
3/4 cups heavy cream
2 cups chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350. Line pan with parchement paper. Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
Place butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat until fluffy. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract then gradually add the flour mixture and sour milk until thoroughly incorporated.
Pipe or drop the batter by generous rounded tablespoons onto the prepared pan about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes until risen and firm to the touch. Cool then transfer to a rack.
FILLING:
1. Place the chocolate chips, corn syrup, butter, and heavy cream into a large microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes, until the mixture is very hot. Stir until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth. Chill in the refrigerator, stirring occasionally, till the filling is cool room temperature. Remove from the fridge, and beat at high speed with an electric mixer until it lightens in color and thickens slightly. If the filling doesnâ€™t lighten and thicken after several minutes of beating, chill for another 15 minutes, then beat again.
Spread the filling on the flat half of the cakes and then top it with the little cake.
