Ingredients:
1 cup milk, room temperature
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3 tablespoons white sugar
3 cups bread flour
2 teaspoons bread machine yeast
FILLING:
3 tablespoons butter, melted
2/3 cup brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup raisins
TOPPING:
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon water
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Place milk, one egg, two tablespoons butter, salt, 3 tablespoons sugar, flour and yeast in bread machine pan. Select Dough cycle, and press start.
When cycle is complete, remove dough from machine, punch down, and let rest for 5 minutes.  Roll out on lightly floured board into an approximately 24x10 inch rectangle.
Brush the dough with 3 tablespoons melted butter, then sprinkle with brown sugar, cinnamon, 1 cup nuts and raisins.  Roll up tightly, jelly roll style from the longer side.  Place on a greased baking sheet, shape into a ring, and seal ends. Mist with warm water, cover with plastic wrap which has also been mist with water, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, approximately 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl, beat together 1 egg and 1 tablespoon water; set aside.
Just before baking, brush dough with egg mixture, sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup walnuts. Bake in preheated for 20 to 25 minutes.  This is a dense ring and if it browns too quickly, just cover with foil and continue to bake.
