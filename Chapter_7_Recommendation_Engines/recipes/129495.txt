Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) leg of lamb
salt and pepper to taste
4 slices bacon
1/2 cup fresh breadcrumbs
2 tablespoons chopped green onions
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons dry white wine
1/3 cup beef stock

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Season the lamb leg to taste with salt and pepper. Place into a metal roasting dish, and drape with the bacon slices. Roast the lamb in the preheated oven for 45 minutes or until the desired doneness, turning once.
Combine the breadcrumbs, green onions, garlic, and parsley in a small bowl. Sprinkle into the roasting dish over the meat drippings, then return the dish to the oven, and continue baking until the breadcrumbs have toasted to a golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes.
Remove the baking dish from the oven; set the lamb leg onto a plate, and cover with aluminum foil. Allow the lamb to rest in a warm spot for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, place the baking dish onto a burner on the stove over medium-high heat. Pour in the wine and beef stock, and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook for 5 minutes. Slice the lamb leg, and serve with the wine gravy.
