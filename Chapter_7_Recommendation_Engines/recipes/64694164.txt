Ingredients:
1 Artichoke per person
Italian seasoned bread crumbs
Garlic
Parmesan cheese
Olive oil

Directions:
Cut off the top 1/4 of artichoke with serrated knife and the stem.
Remove any other sharp leaf tips with kitchen shears.
With shears, remove some of the leaves in the immediate center creating a small space above the heart for more stuffing.
Wash under cool running water making sure to open the layers of leaves gently.
Place each artichoke on cutting board cut side down and let sit so most water drains out.
Finely chop several cloves of garlic and add to your breadcrumbs.
Add Parmesan cheese to breadcrumbs and mix well.
Place artichoke on board lined with wax paper.
Pour breadcrumb mixture into center of artichoke.
Gently open leaves to allow breadcrumbs to fall into the layers of leaves.
Leave some extra breadcrumbs in the center.
Place artichoke in a deep sauce pot.
Add extra spoonful of Parmesan cheese to top of artichoke.
Drizzle artichoke with olive oil.
