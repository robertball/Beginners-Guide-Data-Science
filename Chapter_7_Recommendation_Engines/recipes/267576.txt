Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package rigatoni pasta
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 ounces prosciutto, chopped
1/3 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in tomatoes; cook until bubbling, about 5 minutes. Add cream, cinnamon, salt, pepper; stir until blended. Stir in prosciutto.
Drain rigatoni and pour into a medium casserole dish. Pour sauce over rigatoni and give mixture a quick stir. Sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese evenly over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot and browned, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
This is a quick and easy dish that will taste like it took hours to make! I love to make this for Sunday dinner because it is so warm and filling. The prosciutto and hint of cinnamon really make this recipe pop. I like to serve this with a nice salad and garlic bread (AlexiaÂ® brand).
