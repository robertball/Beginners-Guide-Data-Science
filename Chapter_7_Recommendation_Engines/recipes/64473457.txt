Ingredients:
DRY INGREDIENTS:
1-1/2 cup gluten free flour of choice
1/4 cup coconut flour or brown rice flour
1-1/2 cup coconut sugar
1 cup dry baking cocoa powder
1 cup dark chocolate chips
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
WET INGREDIENTS:
1-3/4 cups buttermilk (or any milk)
3/4 cup vegetable oil (I use avocado oil)
4 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Using two large mixing bowls, one for dry, one for wet ingredients begin. Combine each to the other and drop into paper lined cupcake baking pan/pans.  Do not fill TOO full, bake about 20 minutes, depending on oven, you do not want to over bake, or they will dry out.  Moist is best, and cooled down cupcakes are best.  No frosting needed with these!
