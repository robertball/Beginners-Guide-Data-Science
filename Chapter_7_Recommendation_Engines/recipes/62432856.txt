Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, once around the pan in a slow stream
1 tablespoon butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 shallots, minced
1 cup vodka
1 cup chicken stock
1 can crushed tomatoes (32 ounces)
Coarse salt and pepper
16 ounces pasta, such as penne rigate
Â½ cup heavy cream
20 leaves fresh basil, shredded or torn
Crusty bread, for passing

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over moderate heat.
Add oil, butter, garlic, and shallots.
Gently saute shallots for 3 to 5 minutes to develop their sweetness.
Add vodka to the pan, 3 turns around the pan in a steady stream will equal about 1 cup.
Reduce vodka by half, this will take 2 or 3 minutes.
Add chicken stock, tomatoes.
Bring sauce to a bubble and reduce heat to simmer. Season with salt and pepper.
While sauce simmers, cook pasta in salted boiling water until cooked to al dente (with a bite to it).
While pasta cooks, prepare your salad or other side dishes.
Stir cream into sauce.
When sauce returns to a bubble, remove it from heat.
Drain pasta. Toss hot pasta with sauce and basil leaves. Pass pasta with crusty bread.

Description: 
This recipe will make enough for 2 couples. If you plan a romantic evening where more than two's a crowd, reserve half the sauce to freeze for another supper before the addition of basil, and only cook 1/2 to 2/3 pound of penne. This was a dish by Rachael Ray.
