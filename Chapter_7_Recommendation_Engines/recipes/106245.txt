Ingredients:
1 serving cooking spray (optional)
2 cups corn bread stuffing mix
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork
1/2 cup diced onion
1/2 cup diced green bell pepper
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons seasoned salt
1 teaspoon garlic and herb seasoning blend
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray.
In food processor or blender, pulse stuffing mix to fine crumbs; place in large bowl. Stir in ground beef, ground pork, onion, green pepper, tomatoes, eggs, seasoned salt, seasoning blend, and pepper.  Use your hands to mix very well; pat into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 45 minutes to 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (72 degrees C). Cool for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing.
