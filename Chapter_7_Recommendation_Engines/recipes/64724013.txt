Ingredients:
1 cup water
3/4 cup uncooked whole wheat couscous
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas or garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained
1 can (14-1/2 ounces) stewed tomatoes, cut up
1 can (14 ounces) water-packed artichoke hearts, rinsed, drained and chopped
1/4 cup feta cheese, crumbled
1/2 cup pitted Greek olives, coarsely chopped
1 Tbsp lemon juice
1/2 tsp dried oregano
Dash pepper
Dash cayenne pepper

Directions:
In a small saucepan, bring water to a boil. Stir in couscous. Remove from heat; let stand, covered, 5-10 minutes or until water is absorbed. Fluff with a fork.
Meanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until tender. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Sir in remaining ingredients; heat through, stirring occasionally. Serve with couscous.

Description: 
A great salad to add to your meatless Monday lineup. I usually have to add the olives to my own plate, my wife doesn't care for them.
