Ingredients:
1 and 1/2 cup instant polenta (such as Tipiak)
1 cup pureed pumpkin
2 cups chicken stock (not broth)
1 cup water
1/2 t. sea salt
1 and 1/2 cup sharp freshly shredded cheddar (I prefer Tillamook brand)
1/4 c. EVOO (or more, as needed)

Directions:
Bring pumpkin puree, stock, water and salt to a boil in a stock pot. Sprinkle polenta over and whisk in, working quickly to avoid clumping.
Remove from heat when it thickens and pulls away from the sides of the pan. Immediately stir in cheddar, mix well, and spread in a 9 by 13 inch pan to cool.
Cut into squares, cut squares in half on diagonal to make triangles.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Pour EVOO onto a baking sheet, and roll each triangle in EVOO, coating all sides generously. Add EVOO if necessary.
Roast in oven about 20 minutes or until edges are golden and crispy.
