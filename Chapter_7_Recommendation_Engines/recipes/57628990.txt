Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/2 - 3/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups blueberries, fresh or frozen
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup chopped pecans
3 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch cake pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated. Stir in the blueberries. Pour batter into prepared pan. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, cinnamon and chopped pecans. Cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
