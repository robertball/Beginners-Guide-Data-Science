Ingredients:
3 Tbsp olive oil
1/2 red onion, diced
1 red pepper, diced
1 Tbsp garlic, crushed
6 chorizo sausage links, cut into bite-sized pieces
1/2 lb roasted chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 cup rice
2 cups water
2 roma tomatoes, diced
1 tsp turmeric
2 tsp spanish paprika
2 tsp marjoram
1 pinch saffron
Salt and pepper

Directions:
1. On medium high heat saute the onions in 2 Tbsp olive oil, adding the peppers and garlic. Remove from pan and set aside.
2. In the same pan saute the chorizo until browned all sides. Remove from pan and set aside, scraping as much from the pan.
3. Reduce the heat to medium. With the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, lightly toast the rice until it begins to turn a light nutty brown. Stir in the turmeric and paprika while toasting the rice.
4. Add the water and stir to deglaze the pan.
5. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Add the tomatoes and previously-cooked items into the pan, and mix.
7. Sprinkle the chicken, marjoram and saffron on top.
8. Once at a rolling boil, reduce to a low simmer and cover for 20 minutes.

Description: 
After trying many paella dishes and being a little underwhelmed, we tried to make our own and were pleasantly surprised! Our 3 and 7 year-old kids asked for seconds and thirds. 

A simple and quick one-pot meal that also goes great with a light salad.
