Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package elbow macaroni
2/3 cup rice bran oil, divided
2 cups unsweetened soy milk
1 cup nutritional yeast
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons yellow mustard
1 teaspoon ground paprika

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch baking dish.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl; toss with 1 tablespoon rice bran oil.
Combine remaining rice bran oil, soy milk, nutritional yeast, garlic, mustard, and paprika in a high-powered food processor or blender; blend until smooth and creamy.
Pour soy milk mixture over elbow macaroni in the bowl; toss to mix. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until center is bubbling, about 20 minutes.
