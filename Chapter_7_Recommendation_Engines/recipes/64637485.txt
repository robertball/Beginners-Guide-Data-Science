Ingredients:
2 cups (160 g) quick oats
1/2 cup (40 g) vanilla protein powder
2 Tbsp (14 g) ground flax
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 cup (64 g) almond butter (or any nut butter)
1/4 cup (80 g) honey, or brown rice syrup if vegan
1/2 cup (120 ml) unsweetened vanilla almond milk
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/3 cup (60 g) mini chocolate chips (dairy-free if vegan)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F (175C) and prepare an 8x8 (20x20cm) baking pan by spraying it with cooking spray. Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, combine oats, protein powder, flax, cinnamon, and salt. Set aside.
In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine almond butter, honey, almond milk, and vanilla. Mix until fully combined. Pour wet mix into dry mix and stir until fully incorporated. Fold in chocolate chips.
Pour into prepared baking pan. Using a spatula or your hands, spread the mixture evenly in the pan, pressing down firmly.
Bake for 18-20 minutes, until edges begin to turn golden brown.
Remove from oven and let cool in pan for 20 minutes before cutting into bars.
