Ingredients:
2 large potatoes, peeled and grated
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (16 ounce) package bulk pork breakfast sausage (such as Jimmy DeanÂ®)
4 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1 cup shredded Gouda cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish.
Rinse shredded potatoes in a colander with cold water; drain and squeeze potatoes to remove liquid.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add potato. Season potato with salt and pepper; stir. Place a cover on the skillet and cook until potato is tender, about 3 minutes.
Heat a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Cook sausage in the skillet, breaking with a spatula into crumbles, until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir potatoes into the sausage and remove skillet from heat. Spread the sausage and potato mixture into the prepared casserole dish.
Beat eggs and cream together in a bowl; add Gouda cheese and stir. Pour the egg mixture atop the sausage and potato mixture.
Bake in preheated oven until the egg is set, about 25 minutes.
