Ingredients:
3 large egg whites
2/3 cup unsweetened coconut milk
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup tapioca flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup coconut flour
cooking spray

Directions:
Place egg whites, coconut milk, honey, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a bowl; blend with an electric hand mixer until mixture is light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add tapioca flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Mix with hand mixer just to combine, about 1 minute. Fold in coconut flour by hand using a spatula (do not over mix).
Heat skillet over medium heat; spray with non-stick cooking spray. Pour batter in 1/4-cup portions in batches on the hot skillet. Cook on one side until small bubbles form in the center of the pancakes and edges look dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip them over and cook the other side until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer pancakes to a baking rack; keep warm.
