Description: 
This is another recipe we experienced while vacationing in South Africa. They serve it everywhere but finding a good version of this stuff isn't always easy. In South Africa they use Peri Peri powder instead of cayenne pepper. For me this recipe is a bit of a bust if it's not spicy enough.
