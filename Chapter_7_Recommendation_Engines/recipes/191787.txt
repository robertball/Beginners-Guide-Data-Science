Ingredients:
2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant banana pudding mix
1 quart cold milk
2 bananas, chopped
4 cups heavy cream
4 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 (12 ounce) package prepared pound cake, cubed
1/2 (12 ounce) box vanilla wafers (such as NillaÂ®), crushed

Directions:
Whisk pudding mix with milk until smooth. Stir in chopped bananas; set aside.
In a large bowl, whip cream until stiff peaks are just about to form. Beat in vanilla and sugar until peaks form. Make sure not to over-beat, or cream will become lumpy and butter-like.
Layer half the pound cake cubes, half the pudding, half the whipped cream, and half the crushed vanilla wafers in a trifle bowl. Repeat with the remaining cake, pudding, and whipped cream, and top with the remaining crushed wafers. Chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
