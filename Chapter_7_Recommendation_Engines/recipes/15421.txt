Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup toasted and chopped almonds
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 egg whites
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 gallon raspberry ice cream, softened
1/4 cup raspberry syrup

Directions:
In a medium bowl combine flour, almonds, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Mix well, then add melted butter or margarine. Stir thoroughly, then press mixture into a 9-inch pie pan. Bake crust in preheated 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove and cool completely.
Preheat broiler.
In a small mixing bowl beat egg whites until frothy. Add white sugar one tablespoon at a time, beating constantly until stiff peaks form.
Spread softened ice cream into cooled pie shell. Cover completely with meringue.
Brown meringue in preheated broiler just until meringue begins to turn golden. Watch very closely! Pour just enough raspberry syrup onto each serving plate to thinly coat the bottom of plate. Place a slice of pie on each plate and serve immediately.
