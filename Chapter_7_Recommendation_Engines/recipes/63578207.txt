Ingredients:
1 package grape tomatoes
1 medium garlic clove
olive oil
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 lb. Shrimp
2 cups orecchiette pasta
¾ cup heavy cream
6-8 fresh basil leaves

Directions:
Fill pot with water and bring to a boil.
Cut the tomatoes in half. Peel & chop garlic. Put olive oil in skillet and add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Saute until garlic is sizzling. Add tomatoes, season with salt and pepper and cook until all the liquid from the tomatoes has evaporated, 10-12 minutes.
While tomatoes are cooking, peel the shrimp. Once the tomatoes are ready, cook the pasta.
While pasta is cooking, add the shrimp to the pan with tomatoes. Season with salt and add the cream. Coarsely chop basil and add to pan. Cook until cream has thickened and reduced by about one-third. 2-3 minutes.
When pasta is done, drain well and toss with sauce.
Serve with salad and bread!
