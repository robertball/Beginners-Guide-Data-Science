Ingredients:
10 fluid ounces coconut flavored rum
6 fluid ounces pineapple juice
16 fluid ounces strawberry-flavored soda (such as CrushÂ® Strawberry)

Directions:
Pour the rum and pineapple juice into a cocktail mixing cup, and stir to combine. Gently pour the strawberry soda into the mixture, pouring down the side of the mixing cup to prevent the soda from going flat. Slowly tilt the mixing cup back and forth a few times to mix; pour into cocktail glasses.
