Ingredients:
1 1/2 # shredded chicken meat (use a 3 or 4# chicken)
4 cups chicken broth
2 carrots, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
1/2 onion, diced
2 T olive oil
2 T butter
1/4 cup flour
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 bay leaves
1 cup frozen peas
FOR DUMPLINGS:
2 cups flour
1 T baking powder
1 t salt
2 eggs
3/4 to 1 cup buttermilk (start with 1/2 and add more if necessary
1/4 cup chopped chives

Directions:
1) make a lovely stock by poaching chicken with assorted veggies, thyme, bay leaves, 1 head garlic cut in half, etc.  Poach for apx 1 hr then shred meat.
2) Saute carrots, onion, & celery in olive oil.  Add garlic and saute another minute or two.
3) Add 1/4 cup flour and make a roux
4) Add 4 cups of warm stock and let reduce for 15 to 20 minutes.  Add bay leaves and season well with salt & pepper.
5) Add frozen peas, then 2 cans of soup, then chicken and let simmer for a bit
6) Make dumplings:  Whisk together dry ingredients and make a well in center.
7) Beat eggs slightly, then add to buttermilk.  Pour liquid into flour mixture and combine well - mix should resember biscuit dough
8) carefully drop heaping tablespoonfuls of the dumpling batter into the simmering hot chicken mixture. The dumplings should cover the top of the sauce, but should not be touching or crowded. Let the dumplings poach for 10 to 15 minutes until they are firm and puffy. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Season with freshly cracked black pepper and garnish with chopped chives before serving.

Description: 
This is an adaptation of Tyler Florence's recipe for same.  Loved loved loved his dumplings - they were supurb.  Didn't quite care for the soup mix - too thin for our tastes.  Reduced broth to 4 cups (from 6) and adding 2 cans Cream/Chicken soup to thicken.
