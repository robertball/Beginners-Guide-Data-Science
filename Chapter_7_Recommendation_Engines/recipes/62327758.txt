Ingredients:
1/3 – 1/2 c. evoo (enough to coat the salmon well)
2 extra large garlic cloves, crushed
Kosher salt
½ - 1 lemon, juiced (you just need enough to spoon over fish)
Cilantro leaves, whole (enough to coat top of fish well)
Onion slices, 1/4" - 1/2”  thick, halved (put as much as you want on top of fish) (a nice hefty layer)
Orange, sliced, approx 1/4” thick (enough for a layer, don’t overlap)
7 pieces salmon, approx 2 1/2” wide, 1 1/2- 2” thick and 3 1/2 “ long

Directions:
Marinate salmon in a ziplock bag with evoo and garlic for 30 min. or more in fridge.
On grill (low) place salmon skin side down and sprinkle generously with kosher salt. Spoon lemon juice over and cover with cilantro. Top  with as many onion slices you can, then an even layer of orange slices.
Close BBQ lid.
Check at 6 minutes. (might need 3-4 minutes more)
Done when white just starts to ooze out of fish.
