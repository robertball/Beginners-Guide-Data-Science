Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 envelope taco seasoning mix
3/4 cup water
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 head romaine lettuce, shredded
1 (8 ounce) jar salsa
2 tomatoes, diced
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend
8 ounces sour cream
1 (10 ounce) bag tortilla chips

Directions:
Brown ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until crumbly and no longer pink, about 8 minutes; stir in taco mix and water. Cook beef mixture until thickened, about 10 more minutes.
Place black beans into a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
Spread 1/4 of the beef mixture on a serving plate and top with 1/4 of the black beans. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 4 salads. Spread separate layers of  romaine lettuce, salsa, tomatoes, and cheese over the salads. Generously garnish with sour cream and tortilla chips.
