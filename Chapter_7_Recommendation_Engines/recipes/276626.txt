Ingredients:
1 head napa cabbage, cut into 2-inch pieces
7 cups water, divided
4 tablespoons salt, divided
1 (4 inch) piece dried kombu, cut into very thin strips
1 tablespoon seeded and thinly sliced dried Asian red chile peppers
2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
2 tablespoons monosodium glutamate (such as Aji-No-MotoÂ®)

Directions:
Place cabbage into a large pot and cover with 3 1/2 cups water, or more if needed to just cover cabbage. Add 2 tablespoons salt. Place 2 pots that nest within each other on top of the cabbage; place something heavy into the smaller pot so that it crushes down on the cabbage. Let sit for 24 hours at room temperature.
Remove pots on top of cabbage. Drain all water, placing cabbage back into the pot. Add kombu and chile pepper.
Make tsukemono water by combining remaining water, remaining salt, mirin, and monosodium glutamate in a large pot or bowl. Add to the cabbage pot and replace 2 pots on top. Let sit for another 24 hours at room temperature.
Transfer mixture to mason jars and refrigerate until ready to serve.
