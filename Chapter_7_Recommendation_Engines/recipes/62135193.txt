Ingredients:
2 (8 oz) cream cheese bars
1 (16 oz) sour cream
6 large eggs
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
5 lbs flour
4 (8 oz) extra sharp cheddar cheese bricks
1 (5 lb) bag red potatoes, peeled and quartered
2 tablespoons onion powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon pepper
Saute:
2 1/2 tablespoons butter
salt and pepper to taste
2 medium onions, peeled and sliced

Directions:
1. Mix cream cheese and sour cream well.
2. Add oil and eggs, and mix
3. Add flour, slowly a little at a time, until not sticky. Let dough rest while making potatoes.

5. Layer potatoes, cheddar cheese, remaining onion powder, salt and pepper in a large container several times until all items are used.
6. Let set until cheese melts.
7. Mash potatoes until creamy not clumpy.
8. Roll dough on floured surface until 1/2" thick. Cut dough into 2"x2" squares.
9. Fill one side of dough square with 1 1/2 tablespoons of potatoes mixture. Fold other side of dough over potatoes and press edges together to seal. Can crimp edges to make look fancy.
10. Place pierogies on floured cookie sheets and place in freezer until frozen.
11. Choice: Place in freezer bags and cook at a later time or boil a large pot of water.
12. Place pierogies in water, stirring with a wooden spoon. Pierogies are done when they float. Strain well.

14. Mix in pierogies and fry until golden.
