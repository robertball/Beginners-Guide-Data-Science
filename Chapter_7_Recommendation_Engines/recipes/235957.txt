Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 3/4 pounds pork loin fillet, cut into 1-inch cubes
6 cups water
3 cubes beef bouillon
3 cubes chicken bouillon
3 cups cubed rutabaga
2 cups chopped carrots
2 cups chopped celery
2 (15.5 ounce) cans canned hominy, drained
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork in hot oil until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir water, beef bouillon, and chicken bouillon together in a large pot over medium-high heat until bouillon dissolves. Add pork, rutabaga, carrots, and celery; bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until vegetables tender, about 40 minutes.
Stir hominy and kidney beans into pork-vegetable mixture and simmer until hominy and meat are tender, about 30 minutes more. Season with salt and ground black pepper.

Description: 
On the Akwesasne Reservation where I grew up I have fond memories of corn soup always being on the stove on New Year's Eve. Friends and family would stop in and have a bowl or two and celebrate the end of the year. I continue this tradition with my own family now. Use canned Indian corn instead of hominy if available.
