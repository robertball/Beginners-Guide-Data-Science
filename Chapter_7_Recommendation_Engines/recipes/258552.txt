Ingredients:
2 (21 ounce) cans peach pie filling
1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 cup chopped pecans, divided
1/2 cup butter, cubed
2 cups toffee baking bits

Directions:
Build a campfire and allow the fire to burn until it has accumulated a bed of coals. Rake the coals into a flat bed on one side of the fire.
Line a 12-inch Dutch oven with parchment paper. Pour in peach filling; spread evenly. Sprinkle cake mix on top, followed by 1/2 cup pecans. Stir peach mixture briefly.
Sprinkle butter cubes, the remaining 1/2 cup pecans, and toffee chips evenly over the peach mixture. Cover with lid.
Carefully place medium-hot coals over and under the Dutch oven; cook until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.
