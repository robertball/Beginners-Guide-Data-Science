Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon dried chives

Beat cream cheese, garlic powder, and chives together in a bowl until smooth.

Submitter: 
Sheri
Description: 
You can mold this spread any way you like. For Easter I do bunnies; I make a heart for Valentine's Day. Serve with Italian bread, crackers, or (my favorite for a brunch) triangle-cut pieces of assorted bagels. Great for a take-along office snack and for a breakfast treat.
