Ingredients:
2 tbsp peanut oil
1/2 tsp cumin seeds
2 white onion, chopped
2 fresh green chile, de-seeded and chopped, depending on how hot you like it
1 inch piece fresh ginger, peeled
5 garlic cloves, peeled
1/2 tsp chili powder
2 tsp turmeric
3 tbsp garam masala
1 tsp brown sugar
1 tbsp tomato puree
2 large cans (28 oz) san marzano tomatoes
1/4 cup fresh coriander, chopped

Directions:
Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large pan. Add in cumin seeds and listen for them to sizzle. Add chopped onion to the pan once oil is heated. De-seed and chop the green chile, chop ginger and add to the pan. Crush the garlic and add to the pan; cook for 2-3 minutes.
Add chili powder, turmeric, garam masala and sugar; cook for 2-3 minutes but really give the spices a chance to dry roast. You'll know when your entire kitchen smells amazing from the garam masala.
Add tomato puree and tinned tomatoes; stir and cook for a few minutes.
Transfer sauce to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth and silky.
To make Chana Masala, add 16 oz of chickpeas for every 8 oz of sauce you use.  Add in freshly chopped coriander on top and stir in before serving.
Can be easily frozen for future use. 8 oz of sauce for every 16 oz of vegetables, beans or anything else you're using it with. Use fresh coriander to add on top when serving.
