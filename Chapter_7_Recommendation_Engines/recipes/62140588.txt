Ingredients:
1 pound pinto beans
two large cloves of garlic
1 tsp. salt
Canola oil

Directions:
The secret to frijoles refritos (erroneously called refried beans) is to slow cook the pinto beans in water. After hand cleaning the beans to remove any small pebbles and bad beans, wash them thoroughly with cold water, place in a large pan with about 5 quarts of water. Add two cloves of peeled and smashed garlic and cook covered over lower heat for six hours. Add water if needed to ensure that the beans remain covered. Half an hour before the cooking time is over, add salt and stir, then complete cooking. Remove garlic.
When the cooking time is over, spoon enough of the beans and liquid for your meal into a hot skillet containing a small amount of canola oil. Using a potato masher, mash the beans to a puree.  Serve moist and hot with your meal, cover with grated mexican cheese and accompanied by pickled jalapeno peppers.
