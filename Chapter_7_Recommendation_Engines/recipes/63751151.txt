Ingredients:
Ingredients:
1 pack Nutter Butter cookies (details here)
1 bag Vanilla Almond Bark (details here)
1 bag M&Ms
orange Tic Tacs
1 Black Decorator Icing (use a black gel pen will make the job much easier, details here)

Directions:
Melt the Almond Bark for 90 seconds.
Dip the nutter butter cookies in and make sure they are totally covered. This is the most technical part in making these cookies. Make sure not to leave your fingerprints on the cookies when they are wet! Put 3 pieces of the M&Ms on the cookies for the buttons. The nose is a orange Tic Tac. Use your favorite colored ones for the holiday season, blue, red, yellow and green are all great choices.
