Ingredients:
One whole cut up chicken or whatever pieces you prefer.
Vegetable oil for frying
Salt
Pepper
5 Tablespoons minced garlic
3/4 Cup butter
One bottle of good dry white wine
2 jars whole button mushrooms

Directions:
Heat the oil over medium high heat in a large pot. Pat dry chicken pieces and fry in the hot oil until golden brown on all sides. Drain on paper towels and generously season with salt and pepper. You want to actually over season the chicken at this point because it's the only salt and pepper in the entire recipe. Disgard the oil from the pan and add butter. Lower heat to medium and add the garlic and the mushrooms. After one minute add the wine. Add chicken back to the pan.Bring to a boil, lower heat to a simmer and cover. Cook one hour then remove the cover. Continue to cook another 30 minutes until the chicken is super tender and almost falling off the bone.

Description: 
An Italian cook inspired me to make this chicken dish. Serve it with with ravioli and marinara sauce. The garlic butter wine sauce of the chicken is the perfect match with the pasta and tomato sauce.
