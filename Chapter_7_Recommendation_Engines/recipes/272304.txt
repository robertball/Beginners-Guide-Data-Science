1 egg
1/4 cup milk
2 cups panko bread crumbs
3 teaspoons cracked black pepper

Directions:
Whisk egg and milk together in a bowl. Mix panko, pepper, and salt in a shallow bowl.
Lightly dust calamari with flour, shaking off any excess. Dip in egg mixture then panko mixture to coat. Transfer to a plate and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
Heat oil in a saucepan or deep fryer. Deep-fry calamari in batches until light golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
