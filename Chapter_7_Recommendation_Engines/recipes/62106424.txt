Ingredients:
ice
1 shotglass of Vanilla Vodka
1 shotglass of Peach Schnapps
1 shotglass of Pomegranate juice (available in the produce section at your local grocery store)
1 tbl. Simple Syrup
1 tsp. Lemon juice
Sprite
1 Lime Wheel

Directions:
Combine ice, vodka, peach schnapps, pomegranate juice, simple syrup, and lemon juice into your martini shaker.  Shake vigourously to chill.  Pour into Martini glass, top with a splash of chilled sprite, and garnish glass with a lime wheel.
***tip****simple syrup is one part water, one part sugar boiled until sugar is dissolved.  I do a cup at a time so that I can store extra in the fridge and have it ready
