Ingredients:
1 red onion, chopped
2 stalks celery, sliced
1 tomato, chopped
1 cup baby carrots
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 egg
1 (12 ounce) package extra firm tofu
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup bread crumbs
1 cup sharp Cheddar cheese
1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed tomatoes

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 8x4 inch loaf pan.
Place the onion, celery, fresh tomato, garlic, carrots, and salt and pepper into a food processor. Process until the vegetables have been pureed. Add the egg, tofu, and Parmesan cheese; process. Finally, pour in the bread crumbs, and process until evenly incorporated and the mixture is firmer. Pack the mixture into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes, then top with the Cheddar cheese and canned crushed tomatoes. Continue baking until the cheese melts and the crushed tomatoes are hot, about 15 minutes more.
