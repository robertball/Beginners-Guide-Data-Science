Ingredients:
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup cornmeal
4 (4 ounce) fillets swai fish
2 tablespoons canola oil
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Combine red pepper flakes, seafood seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Spread corn meal into a shallow bowl. Season swai fish with red pepper flake mixture and press each fillet into cornmeal to coat. Wrap coated fillets in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Unwrap fish and place in the hot oil; cook until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Add water, bring to a simmer, cover, and cook, flipping occasionally, until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
My husband loves fish. Since I am allergic, I don't partake. Swai was on sale at the grocery so we picked some up. Since he has never tried it before, I decided to cook it in a familiar way for him. He devoured it. I served this with honeyed carrots and fried yellow squash.
