Ingredients:
3 (28 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 white onion, diced
1 bunch fresh basil leaves, torn
1 tablespoon anchovy paste
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
salt to taste
3 (6 ounce) cans pitted black olives, chopped
1 cup balsamic capers, drained
1 bunch parsley leaves, chopped
3 (16 ounce) packages spaghetti
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Combine tomatoes, olive oil, onion, basil, anchovy paste, garlic, oregano, baking soda, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer; reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend, 1 to 2 hours. Add olives, capers, and parsley during the last 20 to 30 minutes of cooking.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Divide spaghetti among serving bowls; ladle sauce over noodles and sprinkle red pepper flakes on top.

Description: 
Capers and black olives give this tomato sauce a briny, unique flavor. Spaghetti noodles are preferable because they will trap the sauce ingredients.
