Ingredients:
1/2 cup diced bacon or ham
4 medium red potatoes, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cups chicken broth
2 cups cream-style corn
1 cup corn kernels undrained
2 teaspoons salt
ground black pepper to taste
2 cups half-and-half

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large pot over medium-high heat, and cook until crisp. Drain and crumble, reserving about 2 tablespoons drippings in the pot.
Mix potatoes and onion into the pot with the crumbled bacon and reserved drippings. Cook and stir 5 minutes. Pour in the broth, and stir in corn. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover pot. Simmer 20 minutes, stirring frequently, until potatoes are tender.
Warm the half-and-half in a small saucepan until it bubbles. Remove from heat before it boils, and mix into the chowder just before serving.
