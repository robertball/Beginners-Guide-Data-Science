Ingredients:
2 (6 ounce) pork chops, medium size
Tablespoon olive oil
Tablespoon butter
2 tablespoons chopped white onion
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 cup white wine
1 tablespoon heavy cream or 2 tablespoons milk
1/4 cup water
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Begin by heating the oil in the pan on medium-high, while at the same time drying the pork with paper towel to evenly brown.
Take the pork and salt/pepper it, afterward place in hot oil, lower the heat to medium.
Sautee first side for 3 minutes or until brown and then flip over and cook other side for 3 minutes.
Add the water, garlic and onions, allow to come to a full boil for 2 minutes.
Add the white wine, butter and milk or cream, bring to a boil for 30 seconds, then reduce heat to medium-low.
Cook uncovered for 5 to 10 minutes until sauce has reduced to the thickened consistency you desire, longer times create more syrupy sauces, shorter times more soupy.
Add pepper as desired, salt after tasting.
Serve hot with a side of roasted potatoes or other fresh vegetable!
