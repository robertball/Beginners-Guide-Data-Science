Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups water
1 cup sugar
4 pints fresh raspberries or 2 (12 oz) bags unsweetened frozen raspberries, thawed
1 lime

Directions:
Combine sugar & water in medium saucepan. Heat to boiling over high heat. Boil 3 or 4 minutes.
Remove from heat & pour into medium bowl, cover & refrigerate until well chilled about 4 hrs or overnight. Alternately, place bowl in a sink full of ice water & stir until chilled, about 30 minutes.
Crush raspberries or puree in a food processor and push thru fine sieve to remove seeds. Grate zest from lime and squeeze its juice. Add to strained berries.
Prepare an ice cream freezer as manfacturer suggests.
Combine berries with the sugar water. Freeze as manufacturer directs.
