Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 1/2 pounds sirloin tips, cubed
2 bay leaves
1 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 cup dry sherry
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1/4 cup pimento-stuffed green olives
1/2 cup raisins
2 tablespoons capers
1/2 can Goya Black Beans, rinsed
4 potatoes, peeled and quartered
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large saute pan, heat oil over medium heat. Cook onion and garlic in oil, stirring frequently, until transparent. Stir in cubed meat, and cook until browned. Stir in red bell pepper, bay leaf, cumin, chili poweder, and oregano; cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir in sherry, tomato sauce, vinegar, olives, raisins, black beans and capers.  Pour in enough water to just cover meat.  Bring to boil, reduce heat to low, and cover.  Simmer until fork tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Add more water if  the stew becomes too thick.
Stir potatoes into the stew. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Cook, covered, until potatoes are almost tender. Uncover, and cook until done.
Serve with plaintains and yucca fries!

Description: 
The traditional dish uses a good amount of olive oil and meat with a lot of marbling.  This version is lower in fat, but is true to the spirit of the recipe.  Although it does take a fair amount of time, it is not difficult to make.Modified from: Cuban Beef Stew
