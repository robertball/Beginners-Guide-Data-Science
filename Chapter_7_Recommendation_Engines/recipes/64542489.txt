Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 cup salted pistachios
1/4 cup maple syrup

Directions:
Add all ingredients to your Vitamix and blend on high for about 2 minutes; mixture will become hot, which makes it creamier.
Pour into ice cube trays and freeze until solid (at least 2 hours).
Put frozen cubes in to the blender and blend on high speed until it circulates for a few seconds; use the tamper to assist.
Pour mixture in to well chilled bowls.
Serve immediately.
