Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup white chocolate chips
2/3 cup milk chocolate chips
2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/3 cup chopped walnuts
1/3 cup chopped pecans
1/3 cup chopped almonds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar. Mix in the eggs and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt; add to butter mixture, and stir until just blended. With a large wooden spoon, stir in the white, milk, and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Stir in the walnuts, pecans, and almonds. Drop dough by heaping spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
