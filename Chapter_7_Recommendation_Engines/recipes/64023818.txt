Whisk dry ingredients in one bowl. Mix wet ingredients in a second bowl. Add dry mixture just until combined. If too dry, add a little more milk. Should be thicker than cake batter, but not too thin. Depending on humidity/texture of your whole wheat flour, you may need more liquid to reach desired consistency.
Substitute egg replacer/oil to make vegetarian/vegan.
Bake in Belgium waffle maker by pouring approx 1/2-3/4 Cup batter or according to mfg instructions. These are very filling! Enjoy!
