Ingredients:
olive oil as needed
1 (18 ounce) package prepared basil and garlic polenta
1 pinch dried oregano, or to taste
3 small tomatoes, sliced
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 cup diced fresh tomatoes
1 yellow squash, sliced and quartered
4 green onions, chopped
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x13-inch glass baking pan with olive oil.
Slice polenta into 1/2-inch rounds and place into the prepared pan in rows. Drizzle lightly with olive oil. Season with oregano.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
Remove the pan from the oven. Pour sliced tomatoes, black beans, diced tomatoes, squash, and green onions on top of polenta. Cover with Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until squash is soft and cheeses are bubbling, about 20 minutes. Serve.
