Ingredients:
1 3/8 cups olive oil
1 1/2 cups freshly squeezed orange juice
2 tablespoons brandy
1 1/2 cups white sugar
5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/4 cups chopped walnuts
1 cup Thompson seedless raisins
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
2 tablespoons sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 12-inch round springform pan.
Combine olive oil, orange juice, and brandy in a large bowl. Stir in sugar. Combine flour, baking soda, and baking powder in another bowl and sift into the oil mixture. Fold in walnuts, raisins, cinnamon, and cloves. Mix well. Tip batter into the prepared springform pan and level the top. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.
Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 60 minutes.

Description: 
This cake is named after the Saint Fanourios. It's said that if you've lost something, you make this cake so that St Fanourios can help you find it. While the story behind this cake is nice, the cake itself is even nicer! I love the richness of the olive oil, which helps the cake stay moist for days.
