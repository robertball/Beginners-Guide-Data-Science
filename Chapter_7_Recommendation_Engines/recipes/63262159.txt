Ingredients:
1 (10 oz) package frozen chopped spinach
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese (in the can)
1 cup shredded mnozzarella cheese
4 large eggs
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 t. garlic powder
dash cayenne pepper
1/2 t. Italian herb seasoning

Directions:
Thaw spinach, then squeeze out as much liquid as you can.  Please the dry spinach in a bowl and break up into small clumps.
Preheat oven to 350.  Line baking sheet with parchment paper, or spray well with Pam.
Add remaining ingredients to spinach and stir to break up the spinach into small pieces and combine the ingredients well.
Spread batter evenly into baking pan.
Bake about 20 minutes or until dry and turning golden brown.
Remove from oven, loosen from parchment paper. Let cool.  Cut into desired serving pieces.
I usually use a cookie sheet that measures 10x13, the batter spreads out to about 1/4 inch thick.  When it is cooked it makes a thickish wrapper that can be rolled up around whatever ingredients.  You can use a smaller pan to have thicker "bread" if desired.
