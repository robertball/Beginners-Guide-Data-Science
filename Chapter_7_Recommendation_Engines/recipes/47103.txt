Ingredients:
1 French baguette, cut into 1/2 inch slices
1 (8 ounce) tub spreadable goat cheese
1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
12 red seedless grapes, halved

Directions:
Pour chopped nuts into a bowl, and set aside.  Spread each bread slice with approximately 1 tablespoon goat cheese. Dip into the pecans to thoroughly coat the cheese.  Arrange on a plate, and push a grape half into the top of  the cheese on each slice.

Description: 
Tastes rich and crunchy, yet it's very quick and simple to prepare. Lovely with a nice glass of wine.  Sometimes I make this for myself to eat with a salad.
