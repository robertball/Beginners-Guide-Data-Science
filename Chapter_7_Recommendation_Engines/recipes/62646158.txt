Ingredients:
8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
1 bottle reduced calorie pasta sauce (680 ml)
1/2 cup red wine
2 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoon mustard powder
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon chili powder

Directions:
Add flour to a shallow bowl and coat chicken breast halves in flour. Melt butter in a large skillet. Place flour-coated chicken breasts in the skillet over medium heat and brown on all sides. Remove chicken and place onto paper towels to let excess liquids drain.
Using the same skillet, add pasta sauce, red wine, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, mustard powder, garlic, and chili powder. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and return chicken to skillet. Cover, and simmer for 35 to 40 minutes, or until chicken is tender, no longer pink and juices run clear.

Description: 
A fantastic mildly spicy and saucy variation of this dish. This healthy, low calorie dish is great served with steamed rice and vegetables. Add a slice of toasted french bread to mop up the sauce. 1 serving (approx 210 grams) has 260 calories and 30 grams protein.
