Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon ancho chile powder
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon sea salt
2 pounds cooked chicken breasts, shredded
1 ½ cups red enchilada sauce, divided
2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided
4  green onions, green and white parts chopped and separated
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
4 large zucchini, thinly sliced lengthwise
½ cup queso fresco, or more to taste
¼ cup sour cream (optional)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute onion until softened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add chile powder, garlic, cumin, and sea salt; stir until combined. Add chicken and 1 cup enchilada sauce. Stir to combine and remove from heat. Let chicken mixture cool slightly.
Stir 1 cup Cheddar cheese, white parts of green onions, and 1/4 cup cilantro into the chicken mixture. Pour 1/4 cup enchilada sauce into the bottom of a 9x11-inch baking dish.
Slightly overlap 3 slices of zucchini on a cutting board. Top with a small mound of the chicken mixture. Roll up and place in the prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining zucchini slices and chicken mixture. Spoon remaining 1/4 cup sauce over zucchini enchiladas. Sprinkle remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese and queso fresco on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 30 minutes. Garnish with green parts of green onions, sour cream, and 2 tablespoons cilantro.

Description: 
These enchiladas have a smoky depth of flavor and a lighter hit to the waistline, with zucchini wraps replacing tortillas. We actually like these better than traditional recipes; the edges crisp up nicely and the filling is so rich.
