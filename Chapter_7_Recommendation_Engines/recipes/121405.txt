Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup baking cocoa
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup unsweetened applesauce
3/4 cup egg substitute
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
FILLING:
3 ounces reduced fat cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup reduced fat peanut butter
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup egg substitute
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
FROSTING:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons baking cocoa
2 tablespoons 2% milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon water

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa and salt. Stir in applesauce, egg substitute and vanilla; mix well. Pour about half of the batter into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray.
In a mixing bowl, combine the filling ingredients; beat until smooth. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto batter. Spoon remaining batter over the top; cut through batter with a knife to swirl peanut butter mixture.
Bake at 325 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until edges are firm and center is almost set. Cool on a wire rack.
In a small bowl, combine the frosting ingredients until smooth. Spread over brownies.
