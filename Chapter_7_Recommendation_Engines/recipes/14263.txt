Description: 
Clean tasting; not too oily, not too sour. If you really need it, add garlic, but I wouldn't recommend it. Use this dressing on a mixed greens salad with as many vegetables as you enjoy. I have eaten this dressing almost every day since I had teeth! (And that's a long time, believe me!)
