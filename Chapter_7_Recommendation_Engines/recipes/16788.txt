Ingredients:
6 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
2 leeks, chopped
2 teaspoons margarine
1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream

Directions:
In a medium pot over medium heat, combine the potatoes and broth and allow to simmer for 20 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.
In a separate skillet over medium heat, saute the leeks in the butter or margarine for 5 to 10 minutes, or until tender. Add the leeks and the cream to the potatoes and stir well. (Note: This is the point I like to take a potato masher and slightly thicken the soup.)

Description: 
A quick and easy soup that tastes great. I like to take a potato masher and roughly mash some of the potatoes. This helps to thicken the soup. I also like to use seasoned chicken broth. You can use heavy cream or half-and-half, depending on how rich you want the soup to be.
