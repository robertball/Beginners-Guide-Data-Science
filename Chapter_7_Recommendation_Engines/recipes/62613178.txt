Description: 
This is a beef and bean chili using a roast instead of ground beef. It's made on the stove-top, simmers about an hour, and is great served with corn chips. Mmm mm! The jalapeno gives it a little edge, but not too much because of the amount the recipe yields, so adjust for your own taste.
