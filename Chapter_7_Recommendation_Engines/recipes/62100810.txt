Ingredients:
1 lb of nuts(cashews, peanuts, etc)
1 bag peanut butter chips
1 bag good chocolate chips
1 bag pretzel rods
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1/4 cup butter
2/3 cup sweetned condensed milk
1/2 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Combine the chips and nuts in a food processor and coarse chop.  Or you can chop with a knife.  Put in a 9x13 pan and set aside.
In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup and butter.  Bring to boil over meduim heat, stirring constantly.  Add condensed milk and stir til it comes back up to a boil.  Reduce heat and boil over low heat until caramel reaches 236 on the candy thermometer, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat and add vanilla.  Let the caramel sit for 15-20 minutes, or until thickened slighty.
Using a spatula or spoon, cover the pretzel 2/3 with caramel and then lay in the nut/chip mixture and press the nuts and chips onto the pretzel using your hands.  Then place on a piece of waxed to set.  Refrigerate or freeze when set.
These look nice put in treat bags and tied with ribbon.  I use cashews for the nuts.
