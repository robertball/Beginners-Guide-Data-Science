Ingredients:
3 pounds sauerkraut
1 onion, chopped
1 pound uncooked rotini pasta
1 pound fresh mushrooms, chopped
1/2 pound butter
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup

Directions:
Place the sauerkraut and onion in a large skillet over medium-low heat with enough water to cover. Simmer 1 hour, or until most of the water has cooked off.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rotini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
In a medium skillet over medium heat, saute the mushrooms in 2 tablespoons of the butter for about 5 minutes.
Stir the remaining butter, cooked pasta, and cream of mushroom soup into the sauerkraut mixture. Cook and stir 15 minutes, or until heated through.

Description: 
For this tasty pierogi casserole, sauerkraut, onion, mushrooms, and pasta are combined and baked in a rich, buttery sauce. If you are making this ahead and are going to reheat it in the oven you may have to add a little water. If cold, bake at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
