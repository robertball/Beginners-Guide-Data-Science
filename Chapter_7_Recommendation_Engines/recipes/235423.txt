Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 bay leaf
1 cup dry white wine
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
1 cup fish stock
salt and ground black pepper to taste
6 mussels, scrubbed and debearded
6 clams, scrubbed
1 (4 ounce) fillet halibut, cut into 2-inch pieces
10 small scallops
3 precooked crab legs, cracked
6 precooked tail-on shrimp
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a heavy large Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic to onion; cook until garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Stir 1/4 cup parsley, basil, oregano, red pepper flakes, and bay leaf into onion mixture; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine to seasoned onion mixture; bring to a boil. Cook and stir mixture until most of liquid evaporates, about 10 minutes.
Pour tomatoes with juice and fish stock into seasoned onion-wine mixture; simmer until flavors blend, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Stir mussels into tomato mixture; cover Dutch oven with a lid and simmer for about 2 minutes. Add clams to mixture; simmer about 2 more minutes. Add halibut, scallops, and crab legs to mussels-clams mixture; cover Dutch oven and simmer until mussels and clams break open and halibut and scallops are cooked through, about 2 more minutes. Add shrimp to cioppino and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Discard any mussels or clams that didn't open.
Divide cioppino among serving bowls; sprinkle with 2 tablespoons parsley.

Description: 
Cioppino. Excellent recipe. One of the easier recipes and a very good one. Love fish stock over clam juice. I used more fresh parsley on slices of French bread with garlic butter.
