Description: 
Sitting here after dinner and I've got a sweet craving, what's new 'eh? Here's a late night serving for two!  Experimenting, I decided to put the buttermilk in my fridge to good use.   Bread pudding is quick and easy to throw together and most folks have the basic ingredients on hand.   In short time I had warm, sweet and satisfying bread pudding to enjoy.  The buttermilk and almond extract is a nice change from the usual.  Top with whipped cream if desired.
