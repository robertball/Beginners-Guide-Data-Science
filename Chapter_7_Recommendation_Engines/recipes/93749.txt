Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 tablespoons light corn syrup
2 eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
Cream together the butter and sugar in a bowl. Stir in the syrup and eggs. Sift together the flour, salt, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and cloves in a separate bowl; add to the butter mixture; knead into a stiff dough. Pat into a flat circle, and wrap in waxed paper. Refrigerate at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll the dough out onto a lightly-floured surface to about 1/2-inch thickness. Cut the dough using a star-shaped cookie cutter. Place cookies one inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until the edges are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature before serving.
