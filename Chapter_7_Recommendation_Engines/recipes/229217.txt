Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
4 green onions, thinly sliced
1 (1 ounce) package ranch dip mix
1 cup chunky-style salsa
1/4 cup Smucker's® Peach Preserves
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 pound sliced roasted chicken (from deli), chopped
3/4 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese or crumbled queso blanco cheese
8 slices precooked bacon, chopped
1 (16.3 ounce) can Pillsbury® Grands!® Homestyle refrigerated buttermilk biscuits

Directions:
In small bowl, mix sour cream, 1 sliced green onion and 1 tablespoon of the ranch dip mix. In another small bowl, mix salsa, preserves and 1 tablespoon of the cilantro.
Heat closed medium-size contact grill for 5 minutes; spray grill plates with Crisco(R) Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. Meanwhile, in medium bowl, mix chicken, cheese, bacon and remaining green onions, cilantro and ranch dip mix.
Separate dough into 8 biscuits; press or roll each into 5-inch round. Place 1/4 cup chicken mixture on one side of each biscuit round. Fold biscuit over filling; press edges to seal.
Place biscuits, two at a time, on grill; close grill. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown. Cut each quesadilla into 3 wedges. Serve with sour cream and salsa mixtures.
