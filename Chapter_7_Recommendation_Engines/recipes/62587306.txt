Ingredients:
6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
1 bunch of broccoli rabe
1 15 oz can of chickpeas
1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes
3 large garlic cloves, sliced thinly
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to boil.  In the meantime, cut the bunch of broccoli rabe about 1.5 inches from the bottom of the bunch and discard. The remaining stems and leaves are great, don't waste them.  Rinse the broccoli rabe.
Once the pot of water is boiling, add about 2 teaspoons of salt(good salt, like Kosher Salt), then add the broccoli rabe for about 7 minutes at most.  Then drain the broccoli in a colander and blanch it in cold water.  Set aside.
In a large skillet, warm the olive oil under a very low simmer and add just about half the sliced garlic. Sauté the garlic on low heat for about 10 minutes until the garlic is browned.  Once browned, carefully remove the garlic from the pan leaving the garlic infused olive oil behind.
Now add the broccoli rabe, red peeper flakes and remaining garlic slices and turn up the heat to a simmer or low heat.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Sauté for 5 minutes and then add the chickpeas. Sauté for an additional 5 minutes and serve.
