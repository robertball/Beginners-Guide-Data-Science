6 cups shredded lettuce
2 cups non-fat cottage cheese

Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute garlic in hot oil until fragrant and slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add diced tomatoes, vegetarian ground beef crumbles, and taco seasoning; cook and stir until tomatoes are soft, about 10 minutes.
