Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 pound baby calamari - rinsed, dried, and sliced into rings
vegetable oil for frying
Tomato Relish:
1/2 cup diced tomatoes
1/4 cup diced red onion
1/4 cup diced celery
1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese, or to taste
1/4 cup blue cheese salad dressing, or to taste
1/4 cup Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's RedHotÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Combine flour, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a resealable plastic bag and shake to combine. Add calamari and make sure all pieces are coated.
Heat oil in a frying pan over medium to medium-high heat to 395 degrees F (200 degrees C).
While oil heats, combine tomatoes, onion, and celery in a bowl. Set tomato relish aside.
Shake excess flour from calamari and drop calamari into the hot oil in batches. Fry until golden brown, about 1 minute per batch. Drain on paper towels. Transfer cooked calamari to a serving plate.
Top with crumbled blue cheese, blue cheese salad dressing, hot sauce, and a sprinkling of tomato relish.

Description: 
A delicious take on everyone's two favorite appetizers - Buffalo wings and fried calamari! Fresh, homemade calamari drizzled with blue cheese and hot sauce, topped with a cooling tomato relish. Hard to give a serving size, as my daughter Evan and I finish a whole recipe between us, or I'll make a plate for myself (only) as an entree! The beauty is, you can adjust just about all of the ingredients to taste!
