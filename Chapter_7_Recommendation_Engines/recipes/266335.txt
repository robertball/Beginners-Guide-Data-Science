Ingredients:
7 cups water
20 apple cores and peels, or more to taste
1 cup apple juice concentrate, thawed, or as needed
1 (1.75 ounce) package powdered fruit pectin
9 cups white sugar
1 drop red food coloring, or more as needed (optional)

Directions:
Place water, cores, and peels in a large pot. Bring to a simmer and cook for 25 minutes. Strain liquid through a cheesecloth set over another large pot. Pour in enough apple juice to equal 7 cups of liquid. Add pectin and bring to a rapid boil. Add sugar and continue boiling for 1 minute. Remove jelly mixture from heat and add food coloring.
Pour jelly mixture into sterile jars leaving 1/8 inch room at the top. Wipe jar rims and adjust lids and rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 5 minutes.
Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 12 to 24 hours. Press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down. Remove the rings for storage and store in a cool, dark area.
