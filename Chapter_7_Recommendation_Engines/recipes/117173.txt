Ingredients:
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
3/4 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup chopped onion
6 tablespoons butter, divided
1 cup cooked wild rice
1/2 cup chopped dried apricots
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 (24-ounce) Cornish game hens
1/2 cup apricot preserves
1 tablespoon white vinegar

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute the mushrooms, pecans and onion in 4 tablespoons butter until tender. Stir in the rice, apricots, parsley, salt, pepper and cayenne.
Spoon about 3/4 cup rice mixture into each hen; tie legs together with kitchen string. Place hens, breast side up, on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Melt remaining butter; brush over hens.
Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-3/4 to 2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F for hens and 165 degrees F for stuffing. In a small saucepan, warm preserves and vinegar; spoon over hens. Bake 15 minutes longer.
