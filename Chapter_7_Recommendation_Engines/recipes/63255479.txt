Description: 
YUM! This soup couldn't be any easier to make! The hardest part is chopping the ham, onions, and celery....and how hard can that be? This is almost exactly like a soup which was served at a local Country Kitchen restaurant that closed several years ago. Enjoy!Modified from: Calico Bean Soup
