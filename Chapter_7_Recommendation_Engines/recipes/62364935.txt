Ingredients:
2 1/4 tsp. yeast
2 1/3 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup warm water
1 T milk or soy milk
1/3 cup Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup oil
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp. ground white pepper
1 tsp. ground black pepper
1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
1 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
1 jalapeno pepper, including seeds, diced*

Directions:
Combine water and yeast in 1 cup of the whole wheat flour. Let sit for about 10 minutes, until it foams and rises.  This is called proofing.  If it doesn't foam, repeat this process with new ingredients, your yeast is inactive!
While that is taking place, combine soy milk, Parmesan cheese, oil, salt, garlic powder, white pepper, black pepper, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, and jalapeno pepper in large bowl.  Add 1 cup of whole wheat flour.  Stir in proofed yeast mixture.
Add enough extra whole wheat flour so that dough is not sticky, then knead on a floured surface.
Place in greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down.  Shape into a loaf on parchment paper or place in a greased 9"x 5"x3" bread pan.  Cover,let rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes.
Bake at 375 for 35-40 minutes, until browned, and "knocks hollow".
