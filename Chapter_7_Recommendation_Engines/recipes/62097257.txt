Ingredients:
- 1 lb. hamburger
- 1 pkg. Bob Evan's Zesty Hot Sausage
- 1 block Velveeta Cheese
- 1 small jar of your favorite salsa (I use Chi Chi's Mild Salsa)

Directions:
Brown your hamburger in a frying pan on the stove and drain when finished.
Meanwhile, cut the velveeta cheese into blocks and drop into the preheated crockpot.
When the hamburger is done, repeat the same process with the sausage and put into the crockpot.
Stir in the jar of salsa and heat until hot.
Serve right out of the crock pot with your favorite tortilla chips!

Description: 
This is a wonderful cheesy beefy taco dip that I got from a friend of mine!  You make it right in your crock pot and it serves right from the bowl!  Everytime I go to a party, I have to bring enough to make a double batch at the party!  It's wonderful and everyone rants and raves about it!  It's quick and easy too!
