Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 yellow onion, chopped
1 red sweet pepper, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound crusty white bread, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
1 (14 ounce) package Hillshire Farm® Smoked Sausage, bias-sliced 1/2-inch thick
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/2 cup fresh parsley, coarsely chopped
6 eggs
2 cups half-and-half
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Snipped fresh chives (optional)

Directions:
In a large skillet, heat butter over medium heat. Add onion, red pepper, and garlic. Cook and stir 6 to 8 minutes or until just browned.
In a very large bowl, combine onion mixture, bread cubes, sausage, 2 1/2 cups cheese, and parsley. Transfer mixture to a greased 3-quart rectangular baking dish.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, half-and-half, salt, and black pepper. Pour evenly over the bread mixture. Press lightly with the back of a large spoon to moisten all of the ingredients. Cover with foil. Chill 4 to 24 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake, covered, for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake 30 to 35 minutes more.
Remove from oven. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Let stand 15 minutes; serve warm. Garnish with chives, if desired.
