1 (8 ounce) can PillsburyÂ® refrigerated crescent dinner rolls
2 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
3 tablespoons sugar
1 egg
1/2 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips

In small bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Add egg; beat on low speed just until mixed. Fold in chocolate chips; spread over crust. Top with remaining rectangle of dough. Press out to edges of dish; pinch edges to seal with bottom crust. Drizzle with caramel topping.
Bake at 375 degrees F 18 to 22 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 1 hour on cooling rack. Cut into 3 rows by 3 rows to make 9 bars. Cut each bar diagonally into 2 triangles. Store covered in refrigerator.
