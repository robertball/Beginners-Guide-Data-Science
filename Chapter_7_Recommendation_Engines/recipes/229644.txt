Ingredients:
Mojito Marinade
1 cup orange juice
1/2 cup lemon juice
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon white sugar
8 large large scallops
2 yellow squash, cut into 4 large chunks
2 zucchinis, cut into 4 large chunks
1 (8 ounce) package portobello mushroom caps, cut into large chunks
4 bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 60 minutes
1/2 cup fresh basil
Stuffed Tomatoes
2 large tomatoes, cored
1 (12 ounce) package microwaveable broccoli in cheese sauce
1 1/2 cups cooked brown rice
1 slice American cheese, cut into 4 strips

Directions:
Whisk orange juice, lemon juice, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, and sugar together in a large bowl to dissolve seasoning into the liquid. Add scallops, yellow squash, zucchinis, and portobello mushroom to the mojito marinade; toss to coat.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Thread onto a skewer a piece of mushroom, yellow squash, zucchini, and a scallop, respectively. Repeat so there are two of each item on the skewer; repeat with remaining skewers. Sprinkle fresh basil evenly over the skewers.
Carefully remove tomato insides with a spoon; discard tomato insides.
Pour broccoli with cheese sauce into a microwave-safe bowl; cook in microwave until broccoli is tender and the sauce is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir broccoli with cheese sauce and rice together in a bowl; spoon into the hollowed-out tomatoes. Place 2 strips American cheese atop the mixture in a crossing pattern.
Cook the skewers in preheated oven until the scallops are cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven to a plate; cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.
Reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake tomatoes in the oven until the cheese is bubbling, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve with the skewers.

Description: 
Fresh and large scallops stew in a marinade of tangy Cuban 'mojito.' Two large scallops meet chunks of yellow squash, zucchini, and portabello mushrooms on a stick to form a kabob. It's sure to take you away to the tropics in the middle of your work week. Serve with a baked and stuffed broccoli-cheese tomato.
