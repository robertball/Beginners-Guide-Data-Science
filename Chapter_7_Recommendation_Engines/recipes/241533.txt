Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 large sweet potato, diced
3 cups Hillshire Farm® Smoked Sausage, sliced into 1-inch rounds
1 (19 ounce) can chickpeas (optional)
1 teaspoon paprika, sweet or smoked
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
6 cups low-sodium chicken stock
4 cups kale (or spinach)
Crumbled feta cheese or goat cheese (optional)
Freshly ground black pepper, for garnish

Directions:
Drizzle olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until onions release some moisture, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, sweet potato, sausage, and chickpeas. Add paprika, coriander, chipotle powder, cumin, and salt. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring once or twice.
Pour stock into the pot and bring to a simmer. Cook until sweet potato has softened, 10 to 15 minutes. Taste for seasoning; add more salt, if needed. Stir in the kale (or spinach) and cook for 1 minute until kale has wilted. Ladle into bowls and top with cheese, if using, and freshly ground pepper.

Description: 
This soup is so versatile that it works with whatever you have on hand. If you don't love chickpeas, use cannellini, black or kidney beans. Or, take them out altogether. If you don't like kale add swiss chard or spinach. Feel free to switch up the spices if you prefer something a bit tamer.
