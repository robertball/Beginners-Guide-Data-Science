Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
9 ounces cubed cooked chicken
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's <sup>&reg;</sup>edHot(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
2  plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped
4  radishes, diced
1 ½ cups chopped romaine lettuce
½ cup diced cucumber
1 stalk celery, sliced
2 slices red onion, chopped
¼ cup crumbled blue cheese
3 tablespoons blue cheese salad dressing, or to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and let cool.
Reheat chicken in the bacon fat, seasoning with salt and pepper, until just starting to brown, about 3 minutes. Drain chicken on paper towels and place in a large bowl. Add wing sauce and stir to coat all the pieces. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
Break bacon into pieces and combine with chicken. Add tomatoes, radishes, lettuce, cucumber, celery, red onion, blue cheese, and dressing. Toss salad and divide between 2 plates.
