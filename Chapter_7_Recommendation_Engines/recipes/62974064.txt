Ingredients:
1 (18 ounce) box suger-free yellow cake mix
2 1/2 cups quick-cooking oatmeal	 (use only quick-cooking)
1/2 cup brown sugar	 (use 3/4 cup for a sweeter crust and topping)
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 cup melted butter + 2 tbsp
1 large egg, slightly beaten
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 1/2 cups of fruit preserves
1/2 cup flax or sunflower seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven 375 degree oven and grease 13x9 inch pan.  Combine cake mix, oatmeal, cinnamon and brown sugar.  In separate bowl whisk egg with lemon juice and vanilla until combined; add to the crumb mixture along with 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons melted butter.  Using a large wooden spoon toss to combine then use your fingers to finish the mixing.  Mix until the mixture clumps together.  Sprinkle a litle more than half of the crumb mixture into the pan then spread out evenly pressing firmly to cover bottom.  Spoon the jam carefully over the crust in the pan and spread evenly.  Cover with remaining crumb mixture over top of the jam then gently pat the mixture down slightly.  Bake for 20 minutes (the top should be very light brown).  Cool completely, wrap individual bars in Saran wrap.  Can be frozen.
