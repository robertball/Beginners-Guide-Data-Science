Ingredients:
1 lb of ground turkey
1 can of chicken broth
1 cup of water (optional - depending on how thick you want it)
1 can of black beans (drained)
1 can of corn (drained)
1 cup of salsa (you can add more for taste)
1 can of green beans (drained)
2 Tbsp roasted garlic seasoning
2 Tbsp of dried minced onion
Shredded cheese, tortillas, or sour cream to top it off (all optional)

Directions:
Throw everything into a crockpot and enjoy!  I've found having it cook for 6 hours is the best.   Easy to duplicate as well.
