Ingredients:
1/2 cup corn syrup
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1 small onion, chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon chili powder
16 chicken wings

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the first eight ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes or until thickened. Meanwhile, cut chicken wings into three sections; discard wing tips. Place wings in a well-greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes, turning once. Brush with sauce. Bake 20-25 minutes longer, turning and basting once, or until chicken juices run clear. Serve with additional sauce if desired.
