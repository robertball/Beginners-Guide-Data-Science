Ingredients:
Inside Ingredients for Pie:
1 and 1/2 cups brown sugar
3 Tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 cups water
1 and 1/2 cups dark molasses (I use Kings Syrup)
3 eggs
3 teaspoons vanilla (real, not artificial)
Ingredients for Top Part of Pie:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 and 1/2 cups brown sugar
2 (9-inch) pie crusts (or make your own scratch)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients for bottom part of pie and cook on medium heat until thickened. The crumb topping will soak into the bottom mixture so the mixture will not be very thick like pudding, slightly thinner.
Once the mixture has thickened, pour into Un-baked pie shell, dividing between two pie shells.
Combine top part ingredients and sprinkle on the top of cooked filling on both pies.
Bake at 375 for 45-50 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.

Description: 
This recipe for vanilla pie is not the yellow creamy kind most of us are used to, it’s the brown sugar kind, most popular in Amish country. The inside of this pie has a yummy brown sugar n’ vanilla center, similar to the pecan pie center.
