Ingredients:
3 1/2 pounds pot roast
3 cloves garlic (peeled)
1 whole carrot (sliced into 1/2 inch rounds)
1 small onion (halved and quartered)
1 tablespoon oil
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1 1/2 cups beef broth from concentrate
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Season pot roast with salt and pepper and place in slow cooker. In a non-stick pan heat over medium high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of oil and toss in cut onion and carrot.  Cook vegetables until they begin to caramelize, about 5 minutes.  Add 3 tablespoons of four and stir to coat vegetables in flour.  Slowly add the beef broth, a little at a time making sure to dissolve any lumps of flour in the pan. Stir in tomato paste and simmer for 3 minutes.  Add broth and vegetables to slow cooker.
Cook on High setting for 3 to 4 hours, or on Low setting for 8 to 9 hours.
