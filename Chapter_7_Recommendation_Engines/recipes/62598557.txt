Ingredients:
1/2 pound pasta, such as penne
Salt
2 Tbsp. olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 Tbsp. pine nuts
1/2 cup black olives, pitted and chopped
1 pound broccoli, chopped (peel and chop stem, too, if you like)
Freshly ground black pepper
Freshly shredded Parmesan or Asiago

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add 1 Tbsp. salt and cook the pasta until tender to the bite. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid, and drain the pasta.
Return the pot to the stove and heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add garlic and pine nuts and cook, stirring, until pine nuts start to turn golden.
Add olives and stir to combine. Add broccoli and stir to combine. Add about 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta-cooking liquid, cover, and cook until broccoli is tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add noodles and the remaining 1/2 cup pasta-cooking liquid. Stir to combine and cook until liquid is absorbed/evaporated.
Serve topped with black pepper and cheese to taste.
Makes 3 to 4 servings Broccoli Olive Pasta.
