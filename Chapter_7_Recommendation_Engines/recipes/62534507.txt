Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups cranberries
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 eggs
1 teaspoon almond extract
Topping
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 TB butter
2 TB flour
1/4 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9 inch pie pan.
Combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Stir in the cranberries and the walnuts, and toss to coat. Stir in the butter, beaten eggs, and almond extract. If you are using frozen cranberries, the mixture will be very thick. Spread the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted near the center comes out clean. Serve warm with whipped cream or ice cream.

Description: 
There 's flour, sugar and eggs in this cranberry-walnut filling, so it bakes up beautifully without a pie crust. It 's flavored with a bit of almond extract and is the perfect mate for a scoop of vanilla or rum raisin ice cream.Modified from: Crustless Cranberry Pie
