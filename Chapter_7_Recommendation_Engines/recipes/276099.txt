https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
3/4 cup ketchup
3/4 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
8 (1-inch thick) boneless pork chops

Directions:
Combine ketchup, maple syrup, Worcestershire sauce, butter, mustard, oil, salt, cloves, and pepper in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and let simmer, 5 to 10 minutes. Let cool completely, 15 to 20 minutes.
Place pork chops in a zip-top bag and pour cooled sauce over them. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cook the pork chops on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes total, flipping as needed. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
Warning - the sauce does not smell or taste very good on its own! But it makes the best grilled pork chops I have ever had. Serve it with grilled pineapple slices and rice.
