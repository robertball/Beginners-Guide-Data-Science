Ingredients:
1 cup vegetable broth
1/2 cup red quinoa
1 3/4 cups Brussels sprouts
1/4 cup cubed carrots
1/4 cup peeled and cubed parsnips
1/2 red onion, chopped
2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and patted dry
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
Dressing:
1/4 cup tahini
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon maple syrup
5 tablespoons hot water
1 avocado, mashed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place vegetable broth and quinoa in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Simmer until quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes.
Place Brussels sprouts, carrots, parsnips, and red onion on a baking sheet; drizzle with 1 teaspoon olive oil.
Bake in the preheated oven until softened, about 10 minutes.
Mix chickpeas with turmeric in a bowl. Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chickpeas until browned, about 8 minutes.
Mix tahini, lemon juice, and maple syrup in a bowl until well combined. Add hot water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dressing is thin and smooth.
Divide quinoa, roasted vegetables, chickpeas, and mashed avocado between 2 serving bowls. Drizzle 1 tablespoon dressing over each bowl.
