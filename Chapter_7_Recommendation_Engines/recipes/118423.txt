1/4 pound bulk Italian sausage
2 cups biscuit/baking mix
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 teaspoons minced fresh oregano

1/2 teaspoon minced fresh cilantro or parsley
1 egg, beaten
2/3 cup milk

Directions:
In a small skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. In a bowl, combine the biscuit milk, cheese, oregano, onion and cilantro. Combine the egg and milk; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.  Stir in the sausage.
Drop by heaping tablespoonfuls onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 425 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm.  Refrigerate any leftovers.
