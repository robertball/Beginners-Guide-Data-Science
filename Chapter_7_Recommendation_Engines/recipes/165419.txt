Ingredients:
2 pounds yuca, peeled, and cut into 4 inch sections
2 quarts vegetable oil for frying
salt to taste

Directions:
Place the yuca into a large pot, and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the yuca can be pierced easily with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain, and allow to steam for several minutes until cool enough to handle. Cut the yuca into french fry-sized sticks, discarding the fibrous core.
Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Fry the yuca in batches until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes per batch. Remove with a slotted spoon, and drain in a paper towel-lined bowl. Toss with salt to taste, and serve hot.
