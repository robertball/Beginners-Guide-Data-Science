1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons lemon zest

Directions:
To Make Shell: Combine the coconut, butter, egg white, 1 packet stevia, and lemon zest. Combine crust ingredients in food processor until they form a ball. Press into a 9 inch pie plate.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat ricotta, yolks, and stevia until lemon colored. Add lemon juice, zest, and vanilla.
Beat whites until stiff, fold into lemon mixture. Pour mixture into the prepared shell. Do not over fill the shell, it rises slightly when baking.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 45 to 50 minutes. Let pie cool then refrigerate to set, the pie will become creamy and dense. Serve cold.

Description: 
This pie has a lovely, creamy texture, and a refreshing taste from lemon juice and lemon rind stirred in. The filling is poured into a homemade crust, baked for an hour until set, and served with sweetened, sliced strawberries.  We revised the original crust to a coconut crust which would be carb friendly or Paleo friendly, and we replaced the sugar with 3 packets of stevia.Modified from: Rose Galletta's Ricotta Pie
