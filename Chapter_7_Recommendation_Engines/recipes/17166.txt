Ingredients:
6 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons minced onion
2 tablespoons minced green bell pepper
1 tablespoon minced garlic
7 ounces tomato sauce
1/2 teaspoon chicken soup base
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 pound cheese tortellini
6 fluid ounces heavy cream
1/2 cup white wine

Directions:
In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-low heat and add basil, thyme, oregano, parsley and dried red pepper flakes; stir together.
Add onion, bell pepper and garlic and cook until onions are transparent; add tomato sauce and bring to a boil, stirring well. Add chicken bouillon and sugar; stir.
While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook according to the package instructions (fresh tortellini take less time than dried). Drain and set aside.
Reduce heat, add cream and wine; bring close to a boil, stirring constantly. Add pasta and serve.
