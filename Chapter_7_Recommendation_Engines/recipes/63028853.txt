Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup almonds
2 tablespoons confectioners’ sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 large egg
1/2 cup strawberry jam

Directions:
Sift flour and baking powder into a bowl; set aside.
Pulse almonds, confectioners’ sugar, salt, and cinnamon in a food processor until finely ground (but not wet); transfer to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.
Add butter and granulated sugar; mix on medium speed until fluffy. Mix in vanilla and egg. Reduce speed to low.
Add flour mixture; mix until combined.
Wrap dough in plastic wrap; refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
Roll dough into balls and use a straw to remove the middle of the ball.
Space 1 inches apart on baking sheets.
Bake cookies and hearts until pale golden, 10 minutes. Transfer to racks to cool.
Meanwhile, heat jam in a small saucepan over medium heat until reduced and thickened, about 7 minutes.
Insert jam into cookies with syringe.
Sprinkle cutout cookies with confectioners’ sugar. Store in an airtight container up to 2 days.
