Ingredients:
6 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled
2 eggs
1 c. milk
1 1/2 tsp vanilla
2 large very ripe bananas, mashed
2 c. flour
1/2 c. sugar
1 Tbsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
About 1/4 cup honey
About 1 Tbsp peanut butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 and position rack in center of oven.  Grease or line 12 muffin cups.
In a large measuring cup, whisk together the eggs, milk, and vanilla.  Stir in the mashed banana.  In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  With a rubber spatula, fold in the wet ingredients and the melted butter just until combined.  Evenly fill the muffin cups.
Bake until golden brown around the edges, about 18-20 minutes.  Transfer to a wire rack and let cool 5 minutes before removing from pan.
While muffins are cooling, stir together the honey and peanut butter, using enough honey to achieve a glaze consistency.  Once muffins are slightly cooled, drizzle with honey-peanut butter glaze.  Refrigerate leftover muffins.
