Ingredients:
3 egg whites
1 pinch salt
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup finely chopped pecans
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 (1 ounce) squares German sweet chocolate, chopped
3 tablespoons strong brewed coffee
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy.  Add cream of tartar and salt and beat until whites stand in soft peaks.  Add sugar gradually and beat until very stiff. Fold in chopped nuts and 1 teaspoon. vanilla. Turn the meringue into a buttered 9 inch pie plate. Spread over bottom and sides of plate,  building up the sides 1/2 inch above the edge of the plate.  Bake in preheated oven for 60 minutes.  Cool.
In the top of a double boiler, heat chocolate, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove from heat and stir in coffee.
In a large bowl, whip the cream to soft peaks. Whisk in vanilla. Fold 1/3 of the cream into the melted chocolate, then fold the chocolate mixture back into the whipped cream until no streaks remain. Work quickly to prevent the chocolate from seizing up. Spoon mixture into meringue shell. Chill for 2 hours in the refrigerator.
