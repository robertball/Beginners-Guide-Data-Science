Ingredients:
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 medium onion, chopped
1 medium red or yellow bell pepper, chopped
2 cups sliced mushrooms (8 ounces)
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt plus a pinch, divided
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper plus a pinch, divided
1/2 cup Madeira, preferably medium dry, or sherry
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 1/2 cups wild rice (about 10 ounces)
1 14-ounce can diced tomatoes, preferably fire-roasted
2 cups mushroom or vegetable broth
1 1/2 cups water
1/4 teaspoon crumbled saffron
2 cups halved Brussels sprouts
1 small sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes

Directions:
1.Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, garlic and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushroom liquid has evaporated, 10 to 12 minutes. Whisk Madeira (or sherry) and tomato paste in a small bowl; add to the skillet. Cook, stirring, until the liquid turns syrupy and is almost absorbed, about 2 minutes.
2.Add wild rice, tomatoes, broth, water, saffron and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 40 minutes. Uncover and simmer until the rice is tender and most of the grains are “popped,” 20 to 30 minutes more.
3.Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400°F.
4.Toss Brussels sprouts and sweet potato with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Spread the vegetables in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast, stirring once halfway through, until tender and browned in spots, 18 to 20 minutes.
5.Reduce oven temperature to 350°.
6.When the rice is done, arrange the roasted vegetables decoratively on top of it. Transfer the skillet to the oven to heat through before serving, 5 to 10 minutes

We are not a vegetarian family and like to add some meat to dishes. So Sometimes we like to throw in something a little different every now and then.
