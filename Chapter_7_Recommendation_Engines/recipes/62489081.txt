Ingredients:
1 or 2 bags candy corn (Brach's is the best)
1 or 2 bags M&Ms (any variety)
1 or 2 jars of your favorite roasted, salted nuts (I like a combination of peanuts, cashews and almonds)
2 to 3 handfuls of raisins or craisins (or both)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a large container with a lid.  Secure lid and give it a really good shake until it's all mixed.

Description: 
'Gorp' traditionally stands for granola, oats, raisins and peanuts.  Well, this is a 'candy-fied' version I learned from one of my college roommates.  Her mom would send this sweet and salty treat in care packages as soon as it turned fall.  Now I make it as soon as I see candy corn in the stores.  My favorite part is how the raisins get salty from the nuts!
