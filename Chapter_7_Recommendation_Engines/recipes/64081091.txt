Ingredients:
12 oz cauliflower florets (about 1/2 head without stems)
1 c shredded mozarella cheese (about 4 oz)
1 egg, beaten
1 t oregano
3/4 t minced garlic
1/4 t tumeric
1/4 t salt
1/8 t cayenne pepper
1/4 c basil pesto
1/2 c crumbled chevre
2 large tomatoes, sliced
basil leaves, chiffonade
red pepper flakes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425F.
Pulse florets in food processor until finely textured (like couscous) but not mushy. Transfer to microwave bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Microwave HIGH 7 min.
Remove plastic wrap and stir and toss cauliflower to release steam until just warm.
Combine mozarella, egg, oregano, garlic, salt, tumeric, and cayenne with cauliflower. Toss to combine.
On oiled parchment on baking sheet, shape cauliflower mixture into a disc no larger than 10" diameter. Make a shallow rim and insure even thickness.
Bake in upper 1/3 of oven 10 min at 425F. Turn pan. Bake about 10 min more until just beginning to brown on edges. Cool at least 10 min. Preheat broiler.
Remove parchment from under crust. Spread crust with pesto. Sprinkle with 1/2 of chevre. Arrange sliced tomatoes over cheese. Sprinkle with basil and remaining chevre.
Broil in center of oven 5-10 min to desired doneness.
