Ingredients:
Meatballs:
1 pound lean ground beef
3/4 cup crushed soda crackers
1/4 cup finely chopped onion (optional)
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons milk
1 clove garlic, crushed (optional)
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, or more to taste
Sauce:
1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch, or as needed
1 1/2 tablespoons water, or as needed
1 (14 ounce) can crushed pineapple, with juice
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup vinegar
3 tablespoons soy sauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Mix ground beef, crushed soda crackers, onion, eggs, milk, garlic, salt, pepper, and ginger in a large bowl until well combined. Shape the mixture into 1- or 1 1/2-inch balls. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes.
Combine pineapple and juice, brown sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Mix cornstarch and water in a small bowl or cup and gradually stir into the boiling sauce until slightly thickened.
Place meatballs in a slow cooker. Pour pineapple sauce over meatballs.
Cover and cook on Low until meatballs are no longer pink inside and have absorbed the sauce, 4 to 5 hours.
