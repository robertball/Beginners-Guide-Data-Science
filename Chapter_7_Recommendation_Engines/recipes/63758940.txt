Ingredients:
• 3-4 sliced panchetta
• Olive oil
• 1 can artichokes, quartered and drained
• 1 bunch kale, chopped
• 1 lemon, juiced
• 1 teaspoon sea salt
• 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
• 1/4 cup pecorino cheese, freshly grated

Directions:
Take panchetta and chop. Heat a saute pan over medium heat and add in 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Saute panchetta until crisp – about 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon remove panchetta and place on a plate lined with a white papertowel.
Using the saute pan over medium heat add in artichokes and cook for 2 minutes on each side. You really just want them to brown a little. Remove from pan and set on a plate.
In a large bowl or serving platter add chopped kale, Then add in artichiles and panchetta. Drizzle with olive oil (about 3 tablespoons) then add lemon juice, salt and pepper. Toss together. Using your Edgeware grater top with Pecorino cheese

Description: 
I created this Kale, Artichoke and Pecorino Salad the other day with ingredients I had in the house as a side dish for company. Everyone just loved this dish! Adding the Pecorino right before serving gave the salad and extra flavor that made this dish very yummy!! Give it a try! You can omit the cheese to keep it Paleo!
