Description: 
Healthy, delicious, thick sauce made with simple fresh ingredients reminiscent of a bruschetta topping cover a grilled mild white fish. I like to serve it with brown rice that has been mixed with butter and Parmesan cheese. If you are watching fat and calories, omit the butter and cheese.
