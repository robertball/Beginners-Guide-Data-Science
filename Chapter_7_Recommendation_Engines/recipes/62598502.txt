Ingredients:
Pancakes:
•1 1/2 cup All-Purpose Flour
•2 Tablespoons Sugar or Splenda
•2 Teaspoons Baking Powder
•1 Tablespoon Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
•1 Teaspoon Salt
•2 Eggs
•1/4 Cup Milk
•1 Cup Buttermilk
•4 Tablespoons Butter, melted
•1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract
•1 Teaspoon White Vinegar
•2 Teaspoons Red Food Coloring
•Nonstick cooking spray
Cream Cheese Glaze:
•4 ounces Cream Cheese, softened
•1 Cup Powdered Sugar, sifted
•1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract
•1 Tablespoon Milk, if the glaze is too thick.

Directions:
1.Preheat a griddle to medium-high heat. In a bowl, use a whisk to combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, cocoa powder and salt. Set aside.
2.In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, then add the milk, buttermilk, butter, vanilla extract, white vinegar and food coloring, whisking to combine completely. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, stirring just until combined. Do not overmix.
3.Spray nonstick cooking spray on the hot griddle, and spoon batter into the desired sized pancakes. Cook until bubbles form in the batter, the edges are dry and the underside is lightly brown, about 3-5 minutes, then flip over and cook the other side 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat.
4.As pancakes cook, make the cream cheese glaze: In a small bowl, use a hand mixer or whisk to mix together the cream cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Add a little milk if needed to make a glaze that has a thin enough consistency to drizzle.
5.To serve, stack three pancakes on a plate and drizzle cream cheese glaze over them or serve glaze on the side.

The first time I had these were at a very cute upscale Breakfast/Brunch Inn. Went home that very day and began recreating the amazing experience I had just had and I've come up with the following masterpiece!
