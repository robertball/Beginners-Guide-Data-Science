1 (8 ounce) package frozen artichokes, thawed and chopped

Description: 
Chopped artichoke hearts with garlic, lemon juice, and Parmesan. Great on rotelle pasta or as an appetizer on mini toasts. Tastes just like the stuff I was paying too much for at the specialty market. We freeze the leftovers in an ice tray for easy weekday dinners.
