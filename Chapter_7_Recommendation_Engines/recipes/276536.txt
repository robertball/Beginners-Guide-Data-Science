Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 stick butter, cut into chunks
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
4 tablespoons maple syrup
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 small egg
1 tablespoon water, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 baking trays.
Sift flour, ginger, and baking soda together into a large bowl. Add butter chunks and stir until they are coated with flour. Mix the butter and flour together with your hands until mixture resembles fine bread crumbs.
Whisk together maple syrup, egg, and oil in a small bowl until combined. Add maple syrup mixture to flour mixture and knead until a ball of dough forms, adding water, if needed.
Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness, cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters, and place on the prepared cookie sheets. Repeat until you have used all the dough.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack.

Description: 
This recipe for basic gingerbread cookies is very easy and quick because the dough doesn't need to sit in the refrigerator. I'm horrible at rolling out dough and cutting out shapes. The oil in this recipe makes the dough less sticky. Decorate with frosting and candies, if desired.
