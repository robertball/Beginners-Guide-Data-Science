Ingredients:
12 Chicken wings (about 2 lbs total)
1/2 Cup Spicy Mustard
1/2 Cup Maple Syrup
3 Tbl Cider Vinegar
3 Tbl Honey
2 Tbl Chili Sauce
3 Tbl Bourbon
2 tsp Soy Sauce
Fresh Ground Pepper

Directions:
Cut wings into 3 sections, discarding the wing tips, getting 24 pieces.
In a large resealable bag, mix well all but the chicken wings.
Put wing sections into bag and let marinate in the refrigerator for 4 to overnight.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line baking sheet with foil and spray with non-stick cooking spray.  Drain wings, reserving marinade.  Arrange wings on sheet in a single layer and grind pepper over wings.  Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes, flipping wings after 15 minutes and basting with marinade.
After 30 minutes, remove foil, baste again and bake for another 20 minutes or until tender and no longer pink, basting again after 10 minutes.
