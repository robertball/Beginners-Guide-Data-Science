Ingredients:
1 Pork roast - boned and rolled by your supermarket or butcher:
5 lb. roast - 1 1/2 hours
10 lb. roast - 1/34 to 2 hours
1 small bottle of apple cider vinegar
12 oz. water
1 stick, butter or margarine, melted
1 disposable aluminum pan, about the same size as the roast.
To taste: garlic salt, pepper, dried parsley, and 1/2 tsp chopped rosemary

Directions:
Prepare your grill for rotisserie cooking, removing the cooking racks as necessary.
Bring the pork to room temperature and rub it well with the garlic salt, pepper, parsley and rosemary.  Place securely on spit rod and place in rotisserie holder on grill.  Place disposable aluminum pan underneath roast on grill bottom (or rack if not removed).
Mix together the melted butter, cider vinegar and water and pour into the disposable pan.
Turn on the grill and rotisserie as directed in your manual.  Baste about every 20 minutes, keeping the lid closed between bastings.  Do not overcook as meat will dry out.
FYI: Do Not trim the fat from the meat as this helps to keep it moist.  Trim it at the table as necessary.
