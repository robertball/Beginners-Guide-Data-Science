Description: 
Crepinettes are probably my favorite type of sausage, both to make and eat, and that's all thanks to caul fat--one of the culinary world's most interesting and useful ingredients. Unfortunately, it's also one of the most bizarre looking ingredients, and that does scare some people off. But these sausage patties are so moist and flavorful, I do hope you give them a try.
