Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) bag fresh cranberries
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup turbinado sugar
1/4 cup water
1 orange, zested
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1 dash ground black pepper

Directions:
Combine cranberries, white sugar, turbinado sugar, water, orange zest, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, allspice, and pepper in a large pot over medium heat. Simmer, stirring frequently, until sugar dissolves and cranberries pop, 10 to 12 minutes.
Blend cranberry jam into desired consistency using an immersion blender.
Pour jam into a glass pint jar; cool until thickened and set, about 1 hour. Seal jar and refrigerate.

Description: 
I needed to fill some holiday cookies with jam and since raspberries and apricots weren't in season, I opted to use cranberries. This jam is lightly sweetened, fragrant, and has a beautiful color that complemented the cookies perfectly!
