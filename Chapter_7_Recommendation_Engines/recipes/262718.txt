Ingredients:
14 tablespoons white sugar
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon rose water
1 1/2 tablespoons dried rose petals
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs and rose water. Stir in rose petals.
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Mix into the dough. Cover and chill dough for at least 1 hour, or overnight.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line baking sheet with parchment paper.
Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/3-inch thickness. Cut into shapes with a shaped cutter, or simply cut into rectangles or squares. Place cookies 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until light and crisp, 6 to 8 minutes. Cool completely before serving.
