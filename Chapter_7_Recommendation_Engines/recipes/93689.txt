Ingredients:
1 bunch scallions, all parts, sliced
8 ounces portobello mushroom caps
2 1/2 tablespoons Filippo Berio Olive Oil or Filippo Berio Extra Virgin Olive Oil , divided
1 (11 ounce) box quick-cooking barley
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth or vegetable broth
Salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Mince 2 tablespoons of the scallion greens; set aside. Cut the mushrooms into 1/4-inch-wide slices, then crosswise into 1/4-inch chunks.
Warm 2 tablespoons oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the mushrooms. Stir and cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes, or until the mushrooms give off liquid. Uncover and cook for about 4 minutes, or until browned.
Add the barley and scallions. Stir to combine. Add the broth, a pinch of salt, and the pepper. Bring almost to a boil. Cover and reduce the heat so the mixture just simmers. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or until almost all of the liquid is absorbed. Remove from the heat. Stir in almost all of the Parmesan and the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of oil. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Sprinkle each serving with scallion greens and some of the remaining Parmesan.
