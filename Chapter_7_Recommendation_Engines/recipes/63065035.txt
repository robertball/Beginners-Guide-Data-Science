Ingredients:
16 o mahi mahi
olive oil
salt
pepper
lemon juice
chili flakes
(all to taste)
broccoli
asparagus
spinach.
2 T water

Directions:
Wash all your veggies, and put damp into the crockpot. Top with your fish. I squeezed the marinade out of the fish, because it seemed awfully oily.
I added 2T of water to the crockpot and cooked on LOW for approximately 2-3 hours. Mahi Mahi is pretty thick; if you are using thinner fish (such as tilapia) check after 90 minutes.
