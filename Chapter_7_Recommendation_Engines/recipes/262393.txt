Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped
1 lemon, zested and juiced
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 (3 ounce) packages smoked salmon, flaked
1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Combine cream, butter, and garlic in a small pot while spaghetti is cooking and heat over low heat until hot. Stir in parsley, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper. Heat until cream sauce is heated through but not boiling.
Drain spaghetti and place into a large bowl with cream sauce. Stir in smoked salmon and serve immediately with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite recipes during the week cause it's so quick and easy. It is basically ready as soon as the spaghetti is cooked al dente. If you'd like a vegetarian version, just leave off the smoked salmon.
