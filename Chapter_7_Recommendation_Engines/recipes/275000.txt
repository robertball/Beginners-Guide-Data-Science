Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup peanut butter
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups miniature marshmallows
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, peanut butter, egg, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add flour and stir until blended.
Press dough into an ungreased 12- or 14-inch round pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until pale and firm, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle marshmallows and chocolate chips over the entire 'pizza'. Continue baking until marshmallows start to brown, 5 to 8 minutes more. Let cool before slicing.
