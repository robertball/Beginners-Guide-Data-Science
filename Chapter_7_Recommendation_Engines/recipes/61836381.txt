Ingredients:
3 cups York apples
2 cups cooked butternut squash
4 eggs
1/2 cup condensed milk
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust
4 cinnamon sticks

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut apples into eighths and boil until slightly tender.
Mash together the apples and squash in a bowl. Fold the eggs, milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice into the potato mixture. Pour the mixture into the pie crust.
Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 45 minutes.  Cut cinnamon sticks in half and arrange on top of pie. Bake until a knife inserted into the center of the pie comes out clean, about 15 minutes more.

Description: 
This pie has a custard-like filling. I love the unique taste.  I usually don't measure anything, so I say play with the spices until it tastes right!Modified from: Sweet Potato Butternut Squash Pie
