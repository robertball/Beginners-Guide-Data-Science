Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) box Barilla® Spaghetti
1 (24 ounce) jar Barilla® Traditional Sauce
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 onion, chopped
2 (6 ounce) cans tuna, drained and flaked
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons capers, drained and chopped
1/4 cup sliced black olives
1/2 cup canned diced tomatoes, drained
1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
1 teaspoon anchovy paste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, reserving about 1/2 cup cooking water.
Heat olive oil in medium-sized pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion until it starts turning translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tuna, garlic, cayenne pepper, capers, and olive slices. Cook 3 to 4 minutes longer.
Stir in tomatoes, herbes de Provence, and anchovy paste. Simmer for 10 minutes.
Add Barilla(R) Traditional pasta sauce. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 20 minutes. If sauce seems too thick, add a few tablespoons of reserved pasta cooking water. Serve over pasta.
