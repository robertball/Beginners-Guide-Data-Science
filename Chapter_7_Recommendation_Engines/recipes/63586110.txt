Description: 
The meatballs in this recipe freeze well, so make a bunch! Double or triple the batch and lay out the extra uncooked meatballs on a big baking sheet(s) and throw them in the freezer for a few hours  until each meatball is Individually Quick Frozen (ah, ha!).  Then, you take them out of the freezer and put dinner-size portions into Ziplock bags and pop em back in the freezer. Next time you need a quick dinner, pull some out and you'll have dinner on the table in no time!
