Ingredients:
4 Large Green Bell Peppers
1 lb ground Hot Italian Sausage
1 8 oz can of Basil and Garlic flavored tomato sauce
1 6 oz box Long Grain and Wild Rice-prepared according to package directions.
1/2 cup of Fresh Grated Parmesan Cheese
1 cup of Shredded Mozzarella Cheese

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees.
Wash peppers, and cut the knobs off the bottom of the peppers so they sit flat.
Slice the top off the pepper and remove the seeds and ribs.
Cook Italian Sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and cooked through.
Add in cooked wild rice and tomato sauce.
Simmer for about 5 minutes until entire mixture is warmed through.
Remove from heat and add Parmesan cheese. Stir until combined.
Stuff each pepper until mixture reaches the top of the pepper.
Place peppers in a foil lined baking dish.
Top each pepper with 1/4 cup of the mozzarella cheese.
Bake at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes, or until cheese browns.
