Ingredients:
3 tsp. plus 3 cups sugar, divided
1 c. butter, softened
6 eggs
1 c. mashed ripe bananas (about 2 medium)
1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
1/2 tsp. lemon extract
3 c. all-purpose flour
1/4 tsp. baking soda
1 c. (8 ounces) sour cream
GLAZE:
1 1/2 c. confectioners' sugar
1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
3 to 4 tsp. milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325°. Grease a 10 inch fluted tube pan. Sprinkle with 3 teaspoons sugar; set aside.
In a large bowl, cream butter and remaining sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in bananas and extracts. Combine flour and baking soda; add to the creamed mixture alternately with sour cream, beating just until combined.
Pour into prepared pan (pan will be full). Bake at 325° for 75-85 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
In a small bowl, whisk glaze ingredients until smooth; drizzle over cake. Store in the refrigerator. May be frozen for up to 1 month.
