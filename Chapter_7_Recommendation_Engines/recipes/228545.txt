Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 pounds ground chicken
3 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed and drained
2 onions, halved and thinly sliced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
1 (14.5 ounce) can Mexican-style stewed tomatoes with chiles, undrained
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons vinegar
2 tablespoons prepared mustard
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Cook and stir ground chicken in the hot oil until no longer pink and the chicken is crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Stir in pinto beans, onions, diced tomatoes, Mexican-style stewed tomatoes, water, brown sugar, chili powder, vinegar, mustard, salt, and black pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer chili until thickened and flavors have blended, about 3 hours. Stir occasionally and add extra water if needed.
