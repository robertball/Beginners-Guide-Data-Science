Ingredients:
2 pounds yellow squash coarsely cubed
1 large onion coarsely chopped
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
water
4 T. butter
1 cup saltine crackers, crumbled
1/2 cup milk
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 cup pecans, finely chopped

Directions:
Place the squash, onion, salt, and pepper in a large saucepan.  Add as little water as you dare.  Cover and cook the squash until soft, stirring now and then to prevent scorching.  Drain the squash, then return it to the pan or bowl and stir in the butter.  Taste and add more salt and pepper if necessary.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 1 1/2 quart baking dish well.  Stir the crumbled crackers into the squash and turn into the casserole.  Pour the milk over the squash and sprinkle with the cheese and pecans.  Bake uncovered 20 minutes until the milk is absorbed, the squash is bubbly and the cheese is melted.  Remove from the oven, let stand 5 minutes, then serve hot.
