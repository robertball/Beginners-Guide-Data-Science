Ingredients:
1 center cut boneless pork loin about 3-3 1/2 lbs.
3 tbsp. oil
4 slices uncooked bacon cut into 1" pieces
1 tbsp. apricot preserves
2 tsp. fresh garlic, minced
1 tbsp. fresh rosemary, finely chopped
1 1/2 cups fresh bread crumbs
3 tbsp. fresh parsley, chopped
3 tbsp. melted butter
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. pepper

Directions:
Heat oven to 425.
Heat oil in a large skillet then add pork roast and brown well on all sides.
Allow pork to cool slightly.
In a food processor, puree bacon to a smooth paste.
Transfer half of bacon to a bowl (this amount of bacon is needed for blades to process) and stir in apricot preserves, garlic and 2 tsp. of rosemary.
Spread bacon mixture over pork.
In a bowl combine butter, bread crumbs, remaining rosemary, parsley and salt and pepper.
Toss well to mix and press onto roast (not ends).
Place in roasting pan and roast for 15 minutes at 425.
Reduce heat to 350 and roast for about 45 minutes or to 145 degrees.
If crust starts to brown to much, tent with foil.
Allow to rest for 15 minutes before slicing.
