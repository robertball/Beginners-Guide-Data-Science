Ingredients:
8-9 cups all purpose flour
10 t baking powder
2 cups sugar
4 large eggs
3/4 cup milk
1 cup melted butter
2 t vanilla or almond extract
1.5 cups chopped walnuts
1 jar of Maraschino cherries (8oz size) diced with juice retained and set aside.
1 beaten egg for brushing tops of biscotti

Directions:
Beat 4 eggs in extra large bowl.
Add cherry juice and milk to eggs.  Mix well.
Add to the egg mixture sugar, vanilla or almond extract and melted butter. Stir until blended.
Gradually add baking powder, 8 cups of flour, cherries, and nuts. Add more flour if dough is too moist to form into loafs.
Let dough rest 10 minutes.
Dust hands with flour and divide dough into 4 parts forming and shaping each part into a 3" wide log or loaf about 12" long.
Place 2 logs on a greased cookie sheet, leaving room between logs.  Brush top of each log with beaten egg.
Place in 350 degree pre-heated oven for 20-25 minutes.  Place logs on wire rack to cool.  When cooled wrap each log in foil to keep fresh.  When ready to serve cut into 1" slices.
These biscotti like cookies are usually served soft but can be toasted.

Description: 
Looks and taste like a traditonal biscotti but are soft and moist.  Great with coffee, tea or dipped in a glass of milk.  Baked whole loafs can be frozen then sliced and served at room temperature and still taste fresh baked.
