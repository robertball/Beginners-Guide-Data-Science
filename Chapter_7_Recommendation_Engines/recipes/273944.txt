Ingredients:
6 cups chicken broth, or as needed
3 cups water, or as needed
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
1 cup brown rice
1 cup wild rice
1/2 pound fresh morel mushrooms, chopped, divided
2 carrots, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 cup heavy cream
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon grated Pecorino Romano cheese, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Combine chicken broth and water in a large stockpot. Heat over medium-high heat until boiling; reduce heat to low and keep warm.
Heat olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat in a large Dutch oven until butter melts. Add brown rice; cook and stir constantly until toasted, about 5 minutes. Stir in wild rice, 1/2 the morel mushrooms, carrots, celery, onion, and garlic. Cook, stirring constantly, until onions are translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in white wine; cook until evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes.
Mix 1/2 the chicken broth mixture into the rice; stir to combine. Cover and cook over medium heat until thickened, about 30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Pour in remaining chicken broth mixture, remaining morel mushrooms, and thyme. Cover and continue to cook over medium heat, stirring every 5 minutes, until wild rice is tender, 30 to 40 minutes.
Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon butter and heavy cream. Cook until butter is melted, about 1 minute more. Season with salt and pepper. Top with Pecorino Romano cheese.

Description: 
Two of my favorite northwoods ingredients come together to make a risotto-like meal! Using a mix of wild rice, brown rice, and morel mushrooms ensures a nice creamy, and 'earthy' flavor. If your morels are particularly large, make sure to chop them into 1/2-inch pieces.
