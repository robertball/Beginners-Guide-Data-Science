Ingredients:
16 ounces whole-wheat pasta shells
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound ground turkey
1 cup chopped onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
3 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth
3/4 cup water
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed
1/3 cup tomato paste
2 cups roughly chopped kale
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Stir in the pasta, and return to a boil. Boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 12-15 minutes. Drain well.
Heat olive oil in a large soup pot; add turkey, onion, and garlic. Cook over medium heat until meat browns and onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in sage and rosemary and cook for about 1 minute, do not allow herbs to brown.  Pour the broth and water into the pot along with the garbanzo beans and tomato paste. Bring to a boil and add kale. Simmer until kale softens, about 5 minutes.  Season soup with salt and pepper.
To serve, place a serving of cooked pasta in the bottom of a soup bowl and ladle hot soup over.
