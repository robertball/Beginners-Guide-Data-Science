Ingredients:
250g butter
250g turo(quark)
15g salt
250g flour
2 egg yolks
10g quick rise yeast
1 egg
grated parmasan cheese

Directions:
Cut butter into small chunks.  Slowly blend in the turo so as not to melt the butter.  Add egg yolks and yeast, mix just so yolk is mixed in - don't over mix (you should still be able to see the egg yolks. Add the flour.  Mix together slowly until dough starts to form.  Then mix at a higher speed until dough sticks together. Form ball with dough, cover in saran wrap. Leave in fridge to rest for 2 hours or overnight.
Lightly flour hard surfaced for rolling out dough.  Work dough over a few times.  Roll out dough to 2 cm thickness. Cut out biscuits.  Roll out second batch of dough (leftover from cutting) to slightly thinner due to elasticity of the dough. Remove excess flour from biscuit.
Whisk one egg and spread onto biscuits. Sprinkle with grated parmasan cheese on top of biscuits. Place biscuits onto pan. Let biscuits rest on pan for 1/2 hour. Then bake at 350F for 10-12 minutes
