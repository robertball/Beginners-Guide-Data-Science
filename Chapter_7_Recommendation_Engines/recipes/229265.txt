Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 pound boneless beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup red wine
1 1/4 cups water
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup
2 potatoes, peeled and diced
1 (7 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
3/4 cup chopped onion
1 (4.66 ounce) container beef stock concentrate (such as Knorr® Homestyle Stock
1 (4.5 ounce) can mushroom stems and pieces, drained
2 carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 stalks celery, coarsely chopped
1 (.4 ounce) packet dry vegetable soup mix (such as Knorr®)
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1 1/2 cups beef stock, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine flour, salt, and black pepper in a resealable plastic bag; place beef into bag in batches, shaking to coat.
Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef until evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer beef to a plate. Pour red wine into Dutch oven, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Return beef cubes to Dutch oven and add water, tomato soup, potatoes, corn, onion, beef stock concentrate, mushrooms, carrots, celery, vegetable soup mix, and basil; bring to a boil.
Cover and transfer Dutch oven to preheated oven; bake for about 1 hour. Add beef stock to pot, if needed. Continue to bake until beef is very tender, about 1 hour more.

Description: 
I decided to use this very good base recipe and add something to it. Great cold weather dinner with a loaf of crusty bread and a glass of red wine.
