Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (12 ounce) package Hillshire Farm® Rope Smoked Sausage, cut in 1/4" cubes
1 1/2 cups chopped yellow onion
1 large poblano pepper, chopped
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
4 (15 ounce) cans black beans, drained
Cooking spray
1 cup shredded Colby-Jack cheese
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add sausage; cook 2-3 minutes until just starting to brown, stirring occasionally. Add onion and poblano; cook 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened. Add cumin and cook about 30 seconds, stirring constantly, until fragrant. Remove from heat and stir in ketchup, brown sugar, lime juice, chipotle peppers, Worcestershire, salt, pepper, and beans.
Spoon mixture into an 11x7-inch (2-quart) broiler-proof baking dish coated with cooking spray. Cover with foil. Bake until bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes.
Preheat broiler to high. Uncover beans and top with cheese. Broil until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro.
