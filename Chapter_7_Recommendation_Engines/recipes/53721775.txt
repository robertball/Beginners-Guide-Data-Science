1/2 cup butter, melted
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/8 teaspoon dried basil
1/8 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

1 (1 pound) loaf French bread, halved lengthwise

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
In a small bowl, mix butter, garlic salt, rosemary, basil, thyme, garlic powder and Parmesan cheese.
Spread each half of the French bread with equal portions of the butter mixture. Sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.
Place bread halves, crusts down, on a medium baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 10 to 12 minutes, or until the edges are very lightly browned.
