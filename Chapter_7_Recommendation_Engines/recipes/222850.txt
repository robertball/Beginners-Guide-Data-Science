Ingredients:
5 pounds ground beef chuck (80% lean)
2 eggs
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon onion powder

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix ground beef, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and onion powder together in a large bowl. Divide into 15 portions, roll into balls, and flatten into patties about 1/2-inch thick.
Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 6 to 8 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
