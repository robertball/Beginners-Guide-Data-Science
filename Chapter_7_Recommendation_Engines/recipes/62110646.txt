Description: 
This is a simple recipe a friend shared with me years ago. The ingredients are usually on hand, and this can be whipped up in short notice. All of the ingredients can be scaled to particular tastes; I usually eyeball everything and add more or less of what I want. You could also use other vegetables from your garden, but I particularly like this combination.
