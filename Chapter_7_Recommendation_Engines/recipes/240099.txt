Description: 
I wanted a 100% whole wheat bread that tasted good with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and that has a decent rise. This one not only tastes good, it rises more than than white-bread-flour recipe I used to make. It is also soft and freezes well. I make my bread on Sunday, then make and freeze my sandwiches for the week. Each day I take one out of the freezer and Friday's is just as good as the one on Monday. You can use any flavor jelly.
