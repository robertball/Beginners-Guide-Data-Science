Ingredients:
2 Baking potatoes
1/2 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
Cooking Spray
Salt to taste
Cajun seasoning to taste
*Mix up your seasonings used, personally I love Cayenne Pepper but my boyfriend doesn't like that much heat*

Directions:
1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
2) Wash and peel potatoes, then cut into small bite size pieces.
3) Mix together olive oil and lemon juice and use to coat potatoes.
4) Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray to avoid sticking (do not forget this step as I usually do).
5) Spread potatoes on baking sheet and season with salt and cajun seasoning to taste.
6) Place baking sheet in the oven and cook until light golden brown, flipping half way through.
(Cooking time seems to always vary for me, anywhere from about 20-35 minutes.

I avoid ever frying anything in my house, so I like to cook up these delicious potatoes in place of french fries.
