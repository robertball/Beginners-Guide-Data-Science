Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup amaranth
1/3 cup peanut butter
1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/4 cup honey
1 egg
1 cup garbanzo bean (chickpea) flour
1 cup rolled oats
1/3 cup sunflower seeds
1 tablespoon chia seeds
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray an 8-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Combine water and amaranth in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until water is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Mix peanut butter, applesauce, honey, and egg together in a bowl. Add cooked amaranth, garbanzo bean flour, oats, sunflower seeds, chia seeds, baking powder, and cinnamon and mix well; spread into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cut into wedges and store in a container in the refrigerator.
