Description: 
When I was in high school, I worked for an Irish family...and they made these yummy treats each year for St. Patrick's Day. The sweet frosting and salty peanuts are an irresistible combination. The only complaint my husband has is that I make them just once a year! -Bridget Jones, Veyo, Utah
