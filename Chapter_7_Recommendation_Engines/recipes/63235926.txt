Ingredients:
1 uncooked pizza crust (homemade or store bought)
1 steak (your favorite)
1 onion
mozzarella cheese
bruschetta topping (purchased)
parmessan cheese

Directions:
Grill your favorite steak with your favorite seasoning.
While steak is cooking, saute your onion until carmalized, and shred mozzarella cheese (as much as you like.
Once steak is done, remove and let rest.  Don't overcook your steak, as it will cook a bit in the oven.
Press pizza crust in prepared pan.  Top with shredded mozzarella.
Place you cooked onions over top of the cheese.
Thinly slice your steak, then place on pizza.
Using a spoon, randomly put the bruschetta topping on the pizza.  It is thick and won't cover your pizza completely as sauce would.
Cook, according to the directions for your pizza crust.
Once cooked, sprinkle with shaved parmessan.
