Ingredients:
1/4 c butter or margarine
1/2 onion, chopped
2 carrots, diced
2 celery stalks, diced
1/4 c flour
1 cup chicken broth
1 1/2 c milk
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning (optional)
3 c cooked turkey or chicken, shredded or cubed
1/3 cup frozen peas
1 tablespoon parsley
Seasoning such as salt, pepper, Alpine Touch, garlic powder, onion powder

Directions:
Melt butter over medium heat.
Add first 3 veggies and salt & pepper if desired, cook until veggies are tender, about 5 minutes.
Add flour, cook for 1-2 minutes.
Add broth and milk gradually, stirring  nearly constantly until thick and bubbly. About 8-10 minutes.  (While this is cooking, I put the biscuits in the oven, they take about 10-13 minutes)
Add turkey, poultry seasoning and peas, season to taste, heat through and hold on low heat until biscuits are done or ready to serve. Sprinkle with parsley.
Note: I use refrigerated biscuits, spray with butter and add parsley and Alpine Touch for a special touch.
