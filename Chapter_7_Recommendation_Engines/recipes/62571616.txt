Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 (6 ounce) salmon fillets
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons minced onion

Directions:
Combine the black pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, brown sugar, onion powder, and salt in a small bowl. Stir in 1 tablespoon of olive oil to make a paste. Spread the paste all over the salmon fillets, and set aside to marinate at room temperature 30 minutes.
Make carmelized onions by slow cooking with 1 TBSP of vegetable oil and 1 TBSP of Butter.
Heat a separate non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the salmon fillets in the hot skillet until golden brown on each side, and no longer translucent in the center, about 4 minutes per side.
Or cook at 400 degrees for 5 minutes on each side.  Pour the browned onions and olive oil over the salmon fillets to serve.
