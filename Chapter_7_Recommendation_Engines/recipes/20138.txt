Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 muffin cups.
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt.
In a separate bowl, cream together sugar and shortening. Stir the flour mixture into the sugar mixture alternately with the milk. Fold in the fruit. Pour batter into prepared muffin pans.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
