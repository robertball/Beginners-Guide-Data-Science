2 white onions, quartered
4 serrano peppers, or to taste, stemmed
6 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste
1 lime, juiced (optional)

Directions:
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Combine tomatoes, onions, serrano peppers, and garlic in a large bowl; drizzle with vegetable oil and toss until lightly coated. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
Broil in the preheated oven until vegetables begin to brown, about 5 minutes.
Transfer vegetables to the bowl of a food processor. Add salt and cumin; pulse a few times until desired chunkiness is reached. Add cilantro and pulse a couple of times to combine. Stir in lime juice.
