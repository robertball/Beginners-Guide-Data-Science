Ingredients:
1 package of tofu
1/2 package of sun dried tomatoes
4 tb parmesean cheese
4 tb of vegetable oil
1/4 stick of butter
1/4 cup of canned mushrooms well chopped
1 package of wraps (6-7 inch in diameter wraps) the medium sized ones - not the real small ones but not the ones bigger than plate. (unless you want BIG wraps)
- you'll either have 2 for each or 1 for each -

Directions:
Place 4 tb of oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Wait for the pan to get hot and then add the cubed tofu. Let the tofu cook until you see it starting to turn to a golden color. Add the package of sundried tomatoes chopped well and then once the tofu starts to turn a golden color add the 1/4 cup of mushrooms. When the tofu is starting to look well braised (goldeny crisp) remove from the heat and take the contents out and put on a paper towel and pat dry on top with another paper towel. Return to a pan or bowl and add the butter and parmesean cheese (or ramano). Add as much cheese as you like.(I like cheese) The flavors are explosive.

Description: 
Amazing flavors, tofu takes on the flavor and texture of cheese with 1/2 the calories. The flavors are explosive. I personally like to eat it straight and forget the wraps - but if you're looking for something to take with you or serve pretty - it's wonderful!
