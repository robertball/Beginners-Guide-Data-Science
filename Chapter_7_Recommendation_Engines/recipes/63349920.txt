Ingredients:
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1 garlic clove, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon honey
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Freshly ground pepper
8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 3 pieces each
1 large red onion, cut into 8 wedges, root left intac

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Stir together vinegar, garlic, salt, honey, and oil in a large bowl; season with pepper. Add chicken and onion to the marinade. Let stand at room temperature, tossing occasionally, 15 minutes.
Thread 6 pieces of chicken and 1 onion wedge onto each of 4 skewers. Transfer skewers and remaining onion wedges to a nonreactive baking dish; drizzle marinade on top. Bake until chicken is cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes. Divide skewers and onion wedges among serving plates; drizzle with juices from baking dish.
Variations
To grill the kabobs, thread the marinated chicken and onion onto the skewers. Grill over medium heat, brushing with marinade and turning halfway through, until the chicken is cooked through and the onions are charred, 16 to 18 minutes. (If you use wooden skewers, soak them in water for at least twenty minutes before grilling.)
