Ingredients:
25 Brussels sprouts, halved
3/4 pound red-skinned new potatoes, halved
3/4 pound small purple potatoes, halved
2 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
1/2 head cauliflower, cut into small chunks
1/2 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more to taste
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard (optional)
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup tahini
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon water, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Toss Brussels sprouts, new potatoes, purple potatoes, sweet potatoes, cauliflower, juice from 1/2 a lemon, olive oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a separate container. Place on a sheet pan. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven, flipping vegetables halfway, until sprouts and potatoes are tender and crispy, about 40 minutes.
Mix tahini, yeast, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, and water together in a bowl. Add more water to achieved desired thickness.
Serve the vegetable mixture in bowls and drizzle the tahini sauce on top.

Description: 
We call this a boost bowl because it is packed with vegan/vegetarian fuel, giving your body a break from animal protein. If you've been slacking on your vegetable intake this is a great way to make up for it. Or you can always add this as a side dish or appetizer to any meal! Even the meat lovers went back for seconds. It's filling, very nutritious, and also makes a fantastic side dish.
