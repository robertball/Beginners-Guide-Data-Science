Healthy Green Falafel Recipe

https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 cans Chickpeas
1 Large Onion, chopped
1 cup Parsley, chopped and packed
1 cup Cilantro, chopped and packed
4 Garlic Cloves
2 tsp Cumin
1/2 tsp Chili Powder
2 tsp Baking Powder
1 tsp Salt
1 cup Flour

Directions:
In a large blender or food processor, combine 2 cans of drained chickpeas, chopped white onion, garlic, and parsley and cilantro.
Blend on high until the mixture reaches a smoothie consistency. If youâ€™re not using a Vitamix you will likely need to pause several times to stir/continue blending (try not to add liquid as the batter will naturally be very liquid-y).
When things seem fully blended, add in your chili powder, baking powder, cumin, and a 1/2 cup of the flour. Blend again until the consistency is even. Pour into a bowl, stir in the other 1/2 cup of flour evenly, and cover in the refrigerator for about an hour to let the ingredients set. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
Remove the falafel batter from the refrigerator. Grease some baking sheets with Pam or a bit of oil and use a melon-baller or 2 tablespoon scoop to plop down the batter in small 1 inch balls. Make sure to leave a bit of space between each sphere.
Pop into the oven and bake for 45 minutes, flipping the balls about every 15 minutes to ensure that each side browns and flattens. Serve with pita, tahini or hummus, and fresh vegetables.

Description: 
Chickpeas are my favorite beans, thus being one out of many reasons why I love absolutely falafel, especially with so many flavorful herbs and spices.
