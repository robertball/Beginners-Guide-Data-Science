Ingredients:
3 bone-in chicken breasts
½ tomato, chopped
¼ onion, chopped
Salt and pepper, to taste
½ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ to ½ teaspoon cumin
3 tablespoons flour
¼ cup water
Approx 12 corn tortillas
Veg oil

Directions:
Boil chicken with enough water to cover. Cook until done. Cool & de-bone chicken. Chop chicken, and reserve broth. If you use boneless breasts, add 2-3 teaspoons chicken bouillon to water when cooking chicken.
Sauté the tomato and onion until soft. Add chicken & sauté 2 minutes. Add enough reserved broth to cover chicken mixture by about 1 inch. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cumin. Simmer 15 minutes. Thicken with flour & water whisked together. Spoon out gravy into separate pan and keep warm, leaving the chicken mixture for the taco filling.
Soften corn tortillas in enough hot oil to coat tortillas. Fill each softened tortilla with chicken mixture and roll tacos the same as enchiladas. Place in dish. Spoon gravy over tacos to serve.  May be made ahead & covered with plastic wrap. Microwave to warm up & serve with gravy.
