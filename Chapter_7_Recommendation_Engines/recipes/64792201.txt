Ingredients:
1/2 cup gluten free sourdough starter discard
1 cup gluten free all purpose flour mix
10 tbsp non-chlorinated water, or more if needed
1/2 tsp fine sea salt
1 tsp oil
1 tsp water
2 tsp sesame seeds

Directions:
Line an 8x4x2.5 loaf pan with parchment paper.
In a stand mixer, mix the starter discard and flour and salt on low speed. Add water until combined and comes together. Add only enough water to create cross between dough and a thick batter. This will depend on the types of flours in your flour mix. You may not need all the water. Use a rubber scraper to pour the dough into the lined loaf pan.
Cover loosely with plastic wrap. Put into the oven to rise overnight or up to 12 hours.
Remove from the oven. Sprinkle with 1 tsp oil and water mixed. Top with sesame seeds.
Preheat the oven to 425°F. Bake for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 375°F and continue baking until the internal temperature reaches 190°F.
Remove and allow to cool five minutes. Remove from the loaf pan, remove the parchment paper, and cool on a cooling rack.
Wait until completely cooled before slicing.

Description: 
True sourdough flavor in a hearty, gluten free bread ready for your sandwich fixings. I love the taste of this bread with butter and jam or toasted and served with soup even though it is delicious on its own. It will hold up to spreading peanut butter or avocado.
