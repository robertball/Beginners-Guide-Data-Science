Ingredients:
2 cups molasses
1 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon ground ginger
3 cloves garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste
1 (1 1/2 pound) pork tenderloin

Directions:
Whisk together the molasses, vinegar, honey, brown sugar, red pepper flakes, ginger, garlic, salt, and pepper until combined. Remove 1 cup of this mixture to use for basting later. Pour the remaining marinade into a resealable plastic bag, and add the pork tenderloin. Coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil grate.
Remove the pork tenderloin from marinade, and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade. Cook on preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes, basting occasionally with the 1 cup of reserved marinade.
