Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
3 cups white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
6 large eggs, at room temperature
3 cups cake flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan.
Beat butter and cream cheese together in a bowl using an electric mixer until well combined. Add sugar and beat until fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Mix almond extract, vanilla extract, salt, and baking powder into creamed mixture; beat in 2 eggs. Add 1 cup flour and mix well. Add 2 eggs and mix well. Add 1 cup flour and mix well. Add last 2 eggs and mix well. Add remaining 1 cup flour and mix until batter is smooth.
Remove 2 cups batter and place in a separate bowl; stir in cocoa powder. Pour 1/2 of the plain batter into the prepared pan; add 1/2 of the chocolate batter and swirl with a knife. Repeat with remaining plain batter and chocolate batter, swirling gently.
Place pan in the middle rack of the preheated oven; bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 90 minutes.
