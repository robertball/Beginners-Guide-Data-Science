Ingredients:
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
5 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon dill weed
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 tablespoons honey

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, cheese, baking powder, dill and garlic powder. In another bowl, beat the eggs, milk, oil and honey. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean (top will have an uneven appearance). Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
My husband and I often make a meal of bread and salad. We enjoy the garlic, dill and cheddar flavors in this savory bread. We think it's best served fresh from the oven.
