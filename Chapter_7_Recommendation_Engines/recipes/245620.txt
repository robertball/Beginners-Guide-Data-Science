Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) pork roast
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 (14.5 ounce) cans sauerkraut, or to taste
3 cups water, or more as needed
1 onion, chopped
1 apple - peeled, cored, and finely chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place pork roast in a large roasting pan. Season with salt and black pepper. Mix sauerkraut, water, onion, and apple together in a large bowl. Pour sauerkraut mixture over roast.
Bake roast in the preheated oven until heated through, about 1 hour. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Continue to cook roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), adding water if sauerkraut mixture looks dry, about 2 hours more.
Remove roast from oven and allow to rest in a warm area before slicing, about 10 minutes.
