Ingredients:
1 (14.5 ounce) package gingerbread cake mix
1 1/4 cups lukewarm water
1 egg
1 cook-and-serve vanilla pudding mix
3 cups milk
1 (30 ounce) can pumpkin pie filling
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon rum (optional)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 (12 ounce) tub thawed whipped topping (such as Cool WhipÂ®)
10 gingersnap cookies

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine cake mix, water, and egg in a large bowl using a fork. Pour batter into an ungreased 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 28 to 33 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Combine pudding with milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit and cool completely with a layer of plastic wrap directly touching the surface, to prevent a skin from forming.
Meanwhile, mix pumpkin filling, brown sugar, rum, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and cloves together in a large bowl using an electric mixer on low speed until well blended, 2 to 3 minutes.
Tear cooled cake into cubes or bite-size pieces. Arrange in a layer at the bottom of a large glass or trifle bowl. Pour 1/2 of the pumpkin mixture over cake; layer 1/2 of the whipped topping over pumpkin. Repeat layers.
Pulverize 2 gingersnap cookies in a food processor or place in a plastic bag and crush using a rolling pin or mallet. Dust over trifle. Stand 8 whole gingersnap cookies up around the circumference of the trifle.
Cover trifle with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 24 to 48 hours. Remove from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before serving.
