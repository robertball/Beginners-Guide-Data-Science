Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 Tbsp baking powder
2 Tbsp brown sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 egg
1 1/4 cups milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 tsp vanilla
3/4 cup mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly spray mini muffin pans.
In a large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking powder, brown sugar and salt.
In a small bowl, lightly beat egg. Mix in milk, vegetable oil and vanilla.
Pour liquid ingredients into dry ingredients and blend well. Stir in mini chocolate chips.
Fill the mini muffin cups 3/4 full. Bake for 10-11 minutes. Cool for 1 minute and then transfer to wire racks.
Note ~ you can use regular chocolate chips but they have a tendency to drop to the bottom of the cups so you will need to decrease amount of milk.
