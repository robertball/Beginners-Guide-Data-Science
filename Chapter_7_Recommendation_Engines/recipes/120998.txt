Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup rye flour
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons sugar
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
2 teaspoons salt
2 cups milk
1/2 cup water
3 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, rye flour, sugars, yeast and salt. In a saucepan, heat the milk, water and oil to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining all purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into four pieces. Roll each into a 15-in. rope. Twist two ropes together; pinch ends to seal. Repeat with remaining dough. Place in two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled,a bout 45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
