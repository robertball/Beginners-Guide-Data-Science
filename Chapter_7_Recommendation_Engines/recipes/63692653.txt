Ingredients:
1 lb. lean beef chuck, trimmed & cut into 1" cubes
2 Tbsp. flour
2 tsp. vegetable oil
2 large yellow onions, thinly sliced (about 3 cups)
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tsp. tomato paste
2 C. beef broth
4 C. sliced carrots
2 medium russet potatoes, thinly sliced (about 2 cups)
1 C. 1-inch green bean pieces
1 Tbsp. cornstarch
1 Tbsp. cold water
1/4 C. chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Coat beef with flour, shaking off excess.  In a large nonstick pot, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add beef; sauté until browned, about 6 min.  Place on a plate.
Add onions to pot; sauté for 6 min.  Add garlic; sauté, stirring for 1 min.  Pour off fat.  Return beef to pot; stir in tomato paste, then broth.  Add enough water to just cover; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low; simmer until beef is tender, about 1 1/4 hrs.  Skim off any foam.
Add carrots, potatoes, and green beans.  Cover partially; simmer for 15 min.
In a small bowl, mix cornstarch and cold water; stir into stew.  Increase heat and boil uncovered for 1 min.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
