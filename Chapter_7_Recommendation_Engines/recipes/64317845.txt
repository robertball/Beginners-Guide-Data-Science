Ingredients:
6-7 Tomatillos
3-4 Serrano peppers (depending how spicy you like it)
1 medium white onion
3-4 cloves garlic
1 bunch cilantro
1 Tbsp Kosher salt
1 carton chicken stock
1 can white Homily, drained
4 large chicken breasts
1 Tbsp Cumin
1 tsp pepper
1 tsp Adobo seasoning
1 avocado
1 lime

Directions:
You can save time by making the chicken breasts ahead of time in the crock pot. Turn on low for about 4.5 hours. Shred and add seasonings: Cumin, pepper, and Adobo. Squeeze half a lime.
To make the salsa verde, place the tomatillos & Serrano peppers with stems off in a clear plastic vegetable bag in the microwave for 4-5 minutes to soften. Make sure you tie the bag closed and add a couple holes in the top to vent. In a blender, add the onion, garlic, cilantro, salt, and the softened tomatillos and peppers and blend until smooth.
In a large pot, add the chicken stock, homily, shredded chicken mixture, and half of the salsa verde(add more to taste). Simmer for 30 minutes. Serve garnished with cilantro, avocado, and lime wedge.

One of my favorite casual restaurants in Las Vegas in Chino Latino in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. They have the best verde chicken posole that I tried to duplicate at home.
