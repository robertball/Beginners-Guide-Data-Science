Ingredients:
• Two 2½- to 3-pound rabbits
• Salt
• Black pepper
• Flour
Braise
• 3 tablespoons vegetable shortening
• 4 slices thick-sliced bacon, sliced into lardons
• 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
• 1 small onion, coarsely chopped
• 2 stalks celery, coarsely chopped
• 1 small carrot, sliced into 1-inch rounds
• 2 cloves garlic, smashed
• 1 cup dry white wine
• ½ bunch fresh sage
• ½ bunch fresh thyme
• 6 cups chicken stock
Dumplings
• 2 cups flour
• ½ teaspoon baking powder
• ¼ cup chopped fresh sage
• ¼ teaspoon salt
• ¼ teaspoon black pepper
• 5 tablespoons chilled rendered bacon fat
Stew
• 1 medium onion, finely chopped
• 2 parsnips, medium dice
• 1 poblano pepper, finely chopped
• 2 carrots, medium dice
• 2 stalks celery, finely chopped
• 5 cloves of garlic, minced
• 1 tablespoon dried oregano
• 5 bay leaves
• 2 teaspoons salt
• ½ teaspoons black pepper
• 1/3 cup vegetable oil
• 3 tablespoons whole-grain mustard
• ½ cup dry white wine

Directions:
Season the rabbits with salt and pepper. Just before cooking, dust with flour and shake to remove excess.
Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the shortening and bacon and cook, stirring, until the shortening has melted and the bacon has cooked halfway and rendered much of its fat. Drain the bacon fat from the skillet (strain if necessary) and refrigerate. You should have about 5 tablespoons of fat.
Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a large Dutch oven. When the oil is very hot, add the rabbit pieces and cook until evenly browned. Add the onion, celery, carrot, and garlic and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are coated with fat, then add the wine. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until reduced by half (about 5 minutes). Add the sage, thyme and chicken stock. Return to a boil, reduce the heat, cover and simmer until the meat pulls easily away from the bone (turning the rabbit once or twice for even cooking), about 45 minutes to an hour.
While the rabbit braises, prepare the dumplings:
Combine the flour, baking powder, sage, salt and pepper. Combine with the reserved chilled bacon fat until the mixture resembles coarse pebbles. Make a well in the center of the mixture and add the water to the well. Use your fingers to work in the liquid and form dough. Knead briefly. Roll to 1/4" thick. Cut to 1"X4" strips.
Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the dumplings and boil 3 to 5 minutes, until tender; drain. Toss the dumplings with a small amount of oil to keep them from sticking together, then set aside.
Transfer rabbit to baking dish. Reserve liquid, discard vegetables. Separate fat from liquid and set aside.
