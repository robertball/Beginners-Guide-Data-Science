Ingredients:
Kale (as much as you can handle)
Peanut Butter (a whole jar)
Powdered Sugar (a 1 pound bag)
Rice Krispy Cereal (2 boxes)

Directions:
First, chop up the kale in a food processor or by hand if you want to make things more difficult. Throw the little pieces into a bowl and add the peanut butter. Then, add powdered sugar one cup at a time and stir to taste. This is going to be the base for your dessert bites, so make sure it tastes delicious! Then, sprinkle in rice krispy cereal until you can form little balls out of the mess (yes, your hands will be filthy). Place the balls on wax paper on a tray and leave them in the fridge for an hour. Take them out and share with your entire GISHWHES team! :)
