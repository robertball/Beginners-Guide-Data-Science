Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter, or as needed
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 red onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 tablespoon butter, or as needed
1 pound bacon, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
3 jalapeno peppers, minced, or to taste
1 cup beer, or more to taste
1 cup barbeque sauce
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup molasses
6 cups cooked pinto beans
1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
cracked black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in hot oil until onion begins to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Add bacon, bell pepper, and jalapeno peppers; cook and stir until bacon is browned, 7 to 10 minutes more.
Stir beer, barbeque sauce, brown sugar, and molasses together in a large bowl; add pinto beans and bacon mixture. Season with garlic salt and black pepper. Pour beans mixture into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and browned, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
Take the time to make up a batch of these authentic Texas baked beans the next time you have an outdoor cookout. They are sure to be a hit! These are great if you don't have a smoker, but if you have access to a good hickory or pecan fire, take advantage. For a real Texas experience, enjoy a bottle of Lone StarÂ® beer for yourself and one for the beans while you make them.
