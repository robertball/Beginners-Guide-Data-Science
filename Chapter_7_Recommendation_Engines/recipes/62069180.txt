3/4 cup creen onin chopped
1 Tblsp Lemon juice
3 Tblso Butter

8 ozs mushrooms sliced
1-2 Tblsp Dijon Mustard (I use the spicy)
1/4 cup Chick Stock or Boulion
White Wine or Sherry to taste

Directions:
Pound the Chicken breast to 1/8" thickness. Make sure the chicken is thin so that it will cook more quikly and get tender.
Heat Olive oil and butter in a heavy skillet.  Place the cheick in the pan and cook about 1 minute on each side. Remove the chicken to a plate and add the Wine, Mustard, Onion, Mushrooms and Chicken Stock.  Mix this together well.  Put the Chicken back in the pan and cover.  Let simmer for about 5 minutes to allow the flavors to come together.
I serve over rice.
