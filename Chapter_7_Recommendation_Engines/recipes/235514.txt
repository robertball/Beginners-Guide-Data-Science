Description: 
It is rare for me to come up with a recipe that is just too good not to write down. Usually, when I cook, I like to play around with the ingredients and so I rarely make something the same way twice. But this meatloaf was as close to perfect as I could imagine. I tried to be specific in my directions but there is no way to determine ahead of time how wet the mixture will be after adding the vegetables. How wet is too wet is hard to describe, but it is better to err on the side of moisture, I'd think.
