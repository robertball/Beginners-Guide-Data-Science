Description: 
When I was in Culinary School, I worked at a ski resort where I met a woman who would become one of my chef and business mentors. Sadly, she died from pancreatic cancer in 2016. This cake is the first recipe she ever taught me. 

The balance between the meringue and folding in the flour is a technique that is difficult to master, but it can be done. Make sure to fold in the whites, don't mix. You want the whites to help your cake be light and rise properly.
