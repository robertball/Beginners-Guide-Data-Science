Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate fudge cake mix
1 egg
1/2 cup margarine, melted
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup evaporated milk
14 large marshmallows
7 ounces flaked coconut
1/4 cup evaporated milk
3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons margarine
1/2 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease mini-muffin tins.
In a bowl, combine cake mix, egg, 1/2 cup melted margarine and flour until well blended.  Roll into 1 inch balls and place in prepared mini-muffin pans.  Press into bottom and up sides of muffin cups.
Bake in preheated oven 10 minutes, until set.
While cups are baking, combine 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup evaporated milk in microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave on high 2 minutes, until mixture comes to a boil.  Stir in marshmallows until melted.  Stir in coconut until well combined.  Spoon into baked shells while mixture is still warm.
In a microwave-safe bowl, combine 1/4 cup evaporated milk, chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons margarine.  Microwave on high 1 minute, remove from oven and stir until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth.  Stir in almonds until well coated.  Spoon over coconut mixture and spread to cover.  Cool completely before removing from pans.  Store in refrigerator or freezer.
