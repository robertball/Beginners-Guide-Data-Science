Ingredients:
1 pie pumpkin, seeded peeled and diced
2 tbsp olive oil
pinch of salt and pepper
1 tsp dried sage
1 tbsp butter
1 tbsp olive oil
1 shallot, diced
1 cup arborio rice
4 cups hot Chicken broth
1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 deg. Lightly oil a baking sheet. In a medium sized bowl toss diced pumpkin with olive oil, salt, pepper and dried sage. Spread evenly onto prepared baking sheet and roast in the oven for about 25 mins, or until they begin to caramelize and get a little colour, turning once midway through cooking. Remove from oven and set aside.
Melt butter and olive oil in a medium sauce pan.  Add diced shallot and saute over medium heat until soft and translucent. Add rice and stir for about a minute or so. Add a about a 1/2 cup of chicken broth or use a ladle, at a time and stir slowly until it's absorbed into the rice, add another ladle of broth and stir. Continue this until you have about a half cup or so of broth left to add. At this point add half of your diced roasted pumpkin, and the last of your chicken broth. Stir until most of the broth is absorbed. This whole process should take about 20 mins. You don't want it to be dry. Turn off the heat and stir in the parmesan cheese. Serve immediately
