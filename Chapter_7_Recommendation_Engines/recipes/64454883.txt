Eggplant Patties Recipe

Ingredients:
2 medium eggplants
1 large onion
4 cloves garlic
1 cup besan/chickpea flour
1 teaspoon Italian herbs
2 Tablespoons nutritional yeast
1/4 tomato paste

Directions:
Chop the eggplants into pieces/cubes. Chop the onion and crush the garlic. Saute in a pan adding splashes of water if the mixture begins to stick. Cook until the eggplant is mushy and no longer white in colour.
Add the mixture to a food processor & pulse the mixture until it is sticky and slightly lumpy but not too finely chopped.
Gently stir in the remainder of the ingredients until well combined.
Don't be worried if the mixture appears too sloppy to work. This helps the patties from drying out too much.
Shape into patties and place on a lined baking tray. You can either use wet hands, or just spoon amounts of the mixture directly onto the tray & use the back of the spoon to press them gently together.
Bake in a preheated 180C oven for 30-40 minutes until well browned and cooked through. Flip the patties over half way through baking.
