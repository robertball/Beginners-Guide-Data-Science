Ingredients:
nonfat cooking spray
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 large russet potatoes
1 tablespoon malt vinegar, or to taste
sea salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil; spray with cooking spray.
Mix oil, seafood seasoning, onion powder, hot sauce, and garlic powder together in a bowl.
Cut potatoes into spirals using a spiralizer fitted with a large shredder blade; snip long spirals into smaller lengths.
Place potatoes into a large bowl; drizzle with oil mixture. Toss until potatoes are evenly coated.
Spread coated potatoes in a single layer onto the baking sheets, leaving 1/4-inch of space between potato spirals.
Bake in the preheated oven until bottom of potatoes are browned, 8 to 9 minutes. Flip potatoes with a spatula. Bake until potatoes are browned and crisp on top, about 6 minutes.
Sprinkle malt vinegar and sea salt over potatoes.

Description: 
Leave that bag of frozen french fries in the freezer because these fries are just about as easy to make. They just might become your new favorite fries. An ice-cold bottle of beer is the perfect side kick.
