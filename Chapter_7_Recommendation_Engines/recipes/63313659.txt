Ingredients:
4 Tbsp unflavored gelatin (About 6 -.25 oz envelopes)
1 cup cold water
1 1/2 cups boiling water
4 cups sugar
1/4 tsp flavored oils or extracts (such as peppermint, lemon, strawberry etc.)
1-2 drops food coloring
sugar for coating

Directions:
In a large saucepan, soften the gelatin in cold water for 5 minutes.
Stir in bowling water until dissolved.
Stir in the sugar.
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and boil for 25 minutes, stirring constantly.
Divide mixture among 4 shallow pans (Such as 3" x5")
Add 1/4 tsp flavoring and 1-2 drops food coloring to each pan. Stir until combined.
Cover the pans with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
In the morning, cut the gelatin into 3/4 inch cubes using a knife dipped in hot water. (It may pull, but that's OK.)
Separate cubes and roll in sugar.
Place gumdrops on wax paper and leave at room temperature for two days to crystallize.
Store in an airtight container.
