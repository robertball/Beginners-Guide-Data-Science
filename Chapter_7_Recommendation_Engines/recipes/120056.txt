Description: 
Cumin, cilantro and red pepper flakes lend a Southwestern flair to tender pinto beans in this recipe from Mrs. L.R. Larson of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. 'This dish was inspired by one served at a Dallas, Texas restaurant. The chef added chunks of ham, but my version is meatless,' she writes. 'It makes a great Tex-Mex side or a filling lunch when served with corn bread.'
