Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
1 cup margarine, softened
1 tsp. vanilla
1 tsp. almond extract
4 eggs
3 cups flour
1 540ml fruit pie filling
Cinnamon (optional)
Glaze:
3/4 cup icing sugar
1 tbsp. butter or margarine
1 tsp. almond extract
1 1/2 tbsp. milk

Directions:
Mix first 4 ingredients till blended. Beat in eggs. Mix in flour.
Spread 2/3 of batter on greased 10" x 15" cookie sheet.
Spread pie filling over batter. If using apple pie fill, sprinkle cinnamon over pie fill.
Spread remaining batter a tsp. @ a time on the top. This part takes some time & patience!
Try to spread it enough with your fingers or the back of a wet spoon to cover most of the pie fill, but definitely not all of it.
Bake @ 350 x 30 min.
Cool slightly.
Meanwhile, mix the glaze ingredients and heat in microwave just enough to mix smooth.
Drizzle over top of the cake while still heated.

Description: 
A very versatile dessert/square featuring whatever flavor fruit pie fill you fancy. Freezes well, so the large quantity can be enjoyed for months to come, even if you only need a few servings now. Great for a potluck contribution!
