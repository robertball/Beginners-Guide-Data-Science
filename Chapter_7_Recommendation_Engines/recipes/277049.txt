Ingredients:
Meatballs:
1/2 pound bulk mild Italian sausage
1/2 pound lean ground beef
1/2 cup cooked rice
1 egg
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
Soup Base:
2 tablespoons hot pepper and garlic infused olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
12 cups water
6 cubes chicken bouillon
1 medium head cabbage, cored and cut into large pieces
3 carrots, cut into large pieces
2 large potatoes, peeled and cut into large pieces, or more to taste
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon mushroom-flavored salt
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix sausage, beef, rice, egg, garlic powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl for meatballs. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir for 1 to 2 minutes. Add water and bouillon cubes; bring to a boil. Add cabbage, carrots, and potatoes. Boil gently for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, form meat mixture into regular-size meatballs. Drop gently into the pot and add fresh and dried oregano. Reduce heat and let simmer until meatballs are no longer pink in the centers, about 30 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
I discovered this meatball soup with cabbage a few years ago from a Mexican place and I have been searching for the right combinations. 
I think I have it almost right with this one. Very hearty and filling.
