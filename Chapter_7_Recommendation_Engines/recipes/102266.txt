Ingredients:
Crust:
2 cups chopped pecans
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
1/2 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
1 1/3 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
4 egg yolks
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon brandy

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together the pecans, 1/3 cup sugar, 1/4 cup butter and miniature chocolate chips. Press into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch pie plate. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool completely.
In a metal bowl set over a pan of simmering water, combine 1 1/3 cups chocolate chips and 1/2 cup butter. Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla.
In a separate bowl, beat egg yolks with 1/4 cup sugar until thick and pale using an electric mixer, at least 3 minutes. Stir into the melted chocolate and set it back over the pan of simmering water. Whisk constantly until thick, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour into the cooled crust and smooth the top.
Heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan. When warm, stir in the remaining chocolate chips until melted. Remove from the heat and stir in the brandy. Pour over the truffle filling. Refrigerate for several hours to set before serving.

Description: 
I am a pastry chef and I have developed many desserts that can be served at Passover. This shouldn't be prepared just for the holiday - it's great all year long! Garnish with any seasonal fresh berries.
