3 tablespoons peanut oil
2 medium skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed
2 unpeeled apples, cored and cubed

1 bunch green onions, chopped
2 cups sliced mushrooms
2 tablespoons honey
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat peanut oil in a large frying pan or wok over medium heat. Add chicken, apples, and ginger; cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Add green onions and continue to saute until chicken is almost cooked through and apples start to soften, 5 to 6 minutes more.
Stir in mushrooms, honey, salt, and pepper; continue to saute until chicken pieces are no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, about 5 minutes more. Serve.
