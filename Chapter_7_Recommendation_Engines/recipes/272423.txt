Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 medium onions, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
2 pounds cubed lamb stew meat
2 cups beef broth
1/2 pound eggplant, cubed
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped
1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
1 cup diced dried apricots, soaked in warm water
1 cup plain yogurt
1/2 cup apricot jam

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over high heat. Fry onions and garlic in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add curry powder, ginger, turmeric, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, and cloves; continue stirring for 1 minute.
Reduce heat slightly and add lamb. Cook until browned on all sides, 5 to 8 minutes. Add beef broth, eggplant, tomato paste, bell pepper, jalapeno peppers, and vinegar. Drain apricots and stir in. Reduce heat and cover; simmer on low, stirring occasionally, until lamb is tender, about 1 hour.
Stir yogurt and jam into the curry a few minutes before serving.

Description: 
My mother asked me to make this recipe for her and I was surprised at how good it was. My neighbor smelled it and asked what I was making, and loved it too. Serve with traditional curry garnishes such as chutney, peanuts, sliced bananas, and dates. I served over brown rice.
