1 spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
1/2 cup water
1 onion, diced

1 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Pour water in baking dish and place halved squash cut side down in dish.  Bake for 45 minutes or until a fork pierces the skin very easily.  Set aside until cool enough to handle.
In a large skillet, melt butter with olive oil.  Saute onion until just softened.  Add minced garlic and sauté another minute.  Add dried basil and undrained can of tomatoes.  Cover and simmer 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, shred spaghetti squash with a fork.
Add salt and pepper to tomato mixture, then add squash and parmesan cheese and toss to coat completely.  Cover and cook until heated through.
Top with additional parmesan cheese to serve.

Description: 
Very tasty twist for spaghetti squash.  This will serve four as a main course with crusty bread, or more as a side to your favorite meat entrée.  Leftovers re-heat very well, too.
