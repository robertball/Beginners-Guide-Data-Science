2 cups butter
2 cups olive oil
3/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
6 tablespoons ground black pepper
4 lemons, sliced
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon paprika
4 teaspoons Cajun Seasoning
1 cup minced shallot
8 pounds large shrimp - peeled and deveined

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Heat butter and oil in a large saucepan. Add Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, lemons, hot sauce, Italian seasoning, garlic, paprika and salt to the saucepan. Mix well and simmer 5 to 7 minutes.
Divide shrimp between two Dutch ovens. Pour 1/2 of the sauce into one Dutch oven and 1/2 of the sauce into the other. Heat the sauce in both Dutch ovens to a simmer and cook the shrimp for 6 to 8 minutes; until the shrimp begin to turn pink.
When the shrimp have begun to turn pink pour the shrimp and sauce from both Dutch ovens into a large baking pan (or two pans depending on how much sauce you have). Bake the shrimp for 10 minutes, stirring once.
