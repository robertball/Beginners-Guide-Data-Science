Ingredients:
? cup almond butter
½ cup dry sweetener*
1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1? cups oat flour
½ teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
¼ cup sorghum flour, or whole wheat pastry flour
½ cup grain-sweetened chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat baking mats.
In a large bowl, use a strong fork to beat together the applesauce, almond butter, dry sweetener, and flaxseeds. Once relatively smooth, mix in the vanilla.
Add in the oat flour, baking soda, and salt and mix well.
Add the sorghum flour and chocolate chips and mix well.
Drop spoonfuls of batter onto the prepared baking sheets in about 1½-tablespoon scoops, about 2 inches apart. Flatten the cookies a bit, so that they resemble thick discs (they won’t spread much at all during baking).
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes. The longer you bake them, the crispier they will be.
Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the sheets for 5 minutes, and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.

These can be carried with little fear of them breaking up into crumbs. Crispness depends on time baked.
