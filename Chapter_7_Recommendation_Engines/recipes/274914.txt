Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (3.5 ounce) link hot Italian sausage, casing removed and crumbled, or more to taste
1 slice pancetta, diced
1 medium onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
6 cups chicken broth
3 new potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices, or more to taste
2 kohlrabi bulbs, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 bunch kale, stems removed and chopped
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 pinch garlic powder
1 pinch onion powder
1/2 cup heavy cream
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage and pancetta in the hot skillet until browned, breaking it up as you stir, 5 to 7 minutes. Toss in onion and cook until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add chicken broth, potatoes, kohlrabi, kale, cayenne, garlic powder, and onion powder to the pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer until potatoes and kohlrabi are tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Pour in cream and cook over low heat until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
