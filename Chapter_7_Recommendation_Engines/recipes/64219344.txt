Ingredients:
1 can Swanson chicken with buffalo sauce (9.7 ounce)
1- package of garlic and herb Swiss cheese spread like Laughing cow (all 8 triangles of cheese)
1/2 Cup ranch dressing
1/3 cup hot sauce like cholula (or more if you prefer more kick)
1 and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Unwrap cheese and pace in a microwave safe bowl. Add chicken to cheese and mash/mix the two with a swirling chopping motion. Microwave in  45 second increments until combined- mixing in between cooking.  Remove from microwave and add ranch dressing and hot sauce. Mix well. Then add cheese mix well. Place into microwave and cook an additional 45 seconds until melted. Transfer dip to a mini slowcooker. Serve with tortilla chips, celery sticks or sweet bell pepper.

Description: 
This dip is QUICK, thick, cheesy and spicy. Perfect to whip together for game night! I created this without your typical cream cheese brick because all I had on hand was a wheel of spreadable light cheese. It worked out just fine- if not better.  We serve this with super thin tortilla chips, celery sticks and sweet bell pepper strips.
