Ingredients:
Crust:
3/4 c. bread flour
3/4 c. white flour
1/2 tsp. salt
6 T. cold butter, cubed
2 T. olive oil
3 T. ice water
Caramelized onions:
1/4 c. olive oil
8 onions, thinly sliced
1 sprig rosemary
Assembly:
salt and pepper
1 (5 1/2 oz.) log goat cheese
1/2 c. pitted green olives
1 red bell pepper, roasted, peeled and cut into strips

Directions:
CRUST:  Put flours and salt in food processor and pulse.  Add butter and oil and process till cut into flour.  Add water and process till dough forms ball. Press dough into a disk. Refrigerate at least one hour.
ONIONS:  (Slice in food processor with slicing blade, if available.)  Combine onions, oil, and rosemary in large skillet (do not heat oil first).  Cover tightly and cook over medium heat till onions release their water, about 15 minutes.  Stir, reduce heat to low, re-cover, and cook, stirring frequently, till onions begin to brown, about one hour.  Remove lid and continue cooking over low heat, stirring frequently, till onions are deep brown, 30 to 45 minutes.  Do not let onions scorch.
Pour onions into a strainer and set aside until onions are drained completely.
Remove tart dough and roll out 1/4 inch thick.  Place in tart pan (or pie pan).  Spoon drained onions across bottom of pan.  Season lightly with salt and pepper.  Dot goat cheese over.  Scatter olives and arrange bell pepper strips.
Bake  at 400 until crust is browned and cheese melts, about 45 minutes.
