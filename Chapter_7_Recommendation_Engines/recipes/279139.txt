Description: 
If you think substituting braised greens for the patty is crazy, you're not alone, because that's what I thought. Then I tried it and was treated to one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches of my life. Even if you never use these greens to make a grilled cheese sandwich, you should still master this recipe to serve as a side to meat, with pasta, or scrambled into some eggs. This stuff is just shockingly delicious. I served mine with radishes and cornichons.
