Ingredients:
4 med white Onions (Sliced thin)
2 Tbs. Minced garlic ( fresh or jarred)
1/4 C. butter
2 C. white wine ( I use Chardonnay or white Zinfandel)
2 Tbs Saffron
2 gallons heavy whipping cream
Parmesan to taste.
Salt and pepper to taste. ( I use Kosher or Sea salt and cracked pepper but Iodized and table pepper will work.)

Directions:
Caramelize onions and garlic with butter. Add wine and reduce by half. Add Heavy whipping cream bring to boil then turn down to a simmer and reduce by half, add Saffron at this time, and salt and pepper taste as you do this for it is easy to over season with salt and pepper. Sauce is done at this time. Put in fridge to cool. Sauce will thicken into a paste, which can be used in individual meals.
