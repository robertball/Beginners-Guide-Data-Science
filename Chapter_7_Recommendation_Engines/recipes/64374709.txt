Description: 
These not-too-sweet cookies are a little crispy around the edges and soft inside, studded with chocolate chips - sometimes with dried cranberries or currants.  My husband and son usually eat them all in an afternoon.  Great for kids' lunches, or a healthy accompaniment to an afternoon cup of tea.
