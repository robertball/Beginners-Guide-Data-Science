Ingredients:
12 oz. wide egg noodles, cooked
6 eggs, beaten
16 oz. small curd cottage cheese
1 cup sour cream
4 oz. cream cheese, softened
2 cups whole milk
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
Topping
1/3 cup sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix together the eggs, noodles, cottage cheese, milk, sour cream, cream cheese, butter, sugar, vanilla, and salt in a large bowl.
Pour ingredients into a greased 9x13 dish.
In a small bowl combine the sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon.  Sprinkle evenly over the noodle mixture.
Place on the middle rack of the preheated oven and bake until the noodles are golden and crisp and the dish is bubbly, approximately 1 hour.
Remove and let cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before serving.
