Ingredients:
1 package thawed puff pastry
2 cups beef suitable for stew chopped into 1/2 inch cubes
(Precooked is also acceptable)
1 tbsp. olive oil
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 medium onion diced
2 carrots diced
2 medium sized yellow potato's peeled and diced
1 rib of celery diced
1/2 cup frozen pees
2 tbsp. butter
1/4 cup flour
3 cups low sodium beef stock
1 cup milk
Salt & Pepper to taste
1 bay leaf
1 sprig fresh rosemary

Directions:
Pre-Heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  In a large stock or soup pot brown the meat in olive oil and butter over medium heat. Add onion and continue to brown for 3-4 minutes.  Add the garlic, carrots, celery and potatoes.  Cook for 3-4 minutes.  Add the butter, seasonings & flour, at this point you are cooking the flour to make a base for the gravy.  Cook for 2 minutes.  Add the beef stock into the pot slowly, being careful to scrape up all the brown bits on the bottom of the pan.  The mixture will thicken over a period of about 5 minutes.  Add the milk and rosemary.  Continue cooking for 15-20 minutes on low heat.  When you are ready to assemble the pot pie add the peas.  Evenly pour the meat & gravy into your desired baking vessel of choice.  Lay the pastry over the mixture, crimping the sides of the pastry down tightly.  Bake in covered for 30-45 minutes or until the pastry is puffed and golden.
