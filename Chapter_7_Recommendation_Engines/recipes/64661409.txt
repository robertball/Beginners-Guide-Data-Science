Ingredients:
INGREDIENTS
1 tablespoon olive oil
8 ounces fresh chorizo
½ medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
1 cup cilantro, leaves picked and reserved for garnish, stems minced
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 russet potato, coarsely grated and rinsed
1 garlic clove, minced
1 green bell pepperstemmed, seeded and diced
1 Fresno chile, thinly sliced on a bias
2 teaspoons lime zest
2 tablespoons lime juice
Kosher salt, to taste
2 to 4 eggs

Directions:
1. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chorizo and cook, using a wooden spoon to break it up, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chorizo to a bowl.
2. To the skillet, add the onions and minced cilantro stems, and cook until the onions have caramelized, 5 minutes.
3. Add the butter to the pan. Using paper towels, squeeze out any remaining liquid in the rinsed grated potato, then add to the pan and mix with the onions. Press the mixture into an even layer and let cook until golden, 4 minutes. Add the garlic, then cook, stirring constantly until the potatoes are evenly crisp, 2 minutes.
4. Add the bell pepper, chile, reserved chorizo and lime zest, and cook until the peppers begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the lime juice and season with salt.
5. Make 2 to 4 wells in the hash and crack an egg into each one, then season each with a pinch of salt. Cook, covered, until the whites are just set, 3 to 4 minutes. Garnish with the cilantro leaves, then serve.
