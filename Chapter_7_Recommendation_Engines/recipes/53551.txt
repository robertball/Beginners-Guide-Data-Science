Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds halibut, cut into 4 pieces
3 green onions, cut into 3 inch lengths
2 fresh mushrooms, sliced
6 leaves napa cabbage, sliced into 4 inch pieces
2 slices fresh ginger root, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
1/8 cup water
crushed red pepper flakes to taste
fresh cilantro sprigs, for garnish

Directions:
Arrange 1/2 of the green onions on the bottom of the steaming bowl (it is important to steam in a container in order to retain the steam and juices around the fish).  Place 1/2 of the mushrooms and Napa cabbage sections on top of the onions. Place fish on top of the vegetables. Sprinkle ginger, garlic, and  red pepper flakes over fish.  Top with the remaining green onions, mushrooms, and napa cabbage. Drizzle soy sauce and water over everything.
Place steam bowl in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Steam for 15 to 20 minutes, or until fish flakes easily.  Garnish with cilantro, if desired.

Description: 
This is a basic and common Chinese recipe for steamed fish.  My father taught me how to make this; it is easy to prepare, hard to mess up, and very versatile. Serve over white rice, using some of the sauce mixture from the steaming bowl.
