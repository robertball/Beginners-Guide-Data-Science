Ingredients:
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15.25 ounce) can corn, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 1/2 cups cooked white rice
6 ounces Gruyere cheese, cubed
2 jalapeno peppers, diced
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
salt and ground black pepper to taste
20 frozen empanada shells (such as GoyaÂ® discos), thawed

Directions:
Mix black beans, corn, pumpkin, rice, Gruyere cheese, jalapeno peppers, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Refrigerate filling for 1 hour to allow flavors to blend.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets or line with parchment paper.
Roll empanada shells lightly using a rolling pin to stretch slightly. Place 1 to 2 tablespoons of filling onto the center of each disc. Fold into a semi-circle shape and press edges closed using a fork. Place empanadas on prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
These spicy vegetarian fritters are a hit with my friends. You can add more or fewer peppers to your taste. Using pre-made empanada shells makes it quick and painless.
