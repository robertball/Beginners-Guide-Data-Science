Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons parsley flakes, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups medium shrimp, shelled
2 tablespoons lemon juice
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 cup dry sherry

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
While linguine is cooking, melt butter in a frying pan. Mix in 1 tablespoon parsley, salt, and pepper. Add shrimp and cook for 2 minutes, flipping 1 or 2 times. Add 1 tablespoon parsley, lemon juice, and garlic. Cook for another 2 minutes, flipping 1 or 2 more times. Pour in sherry and cook for 1 minute.
Drain linguine and divide among plates. Spoon shrimp on top, reserving juices for dipping or to pour over pasta at the table. Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon parsley over each plate for garnish.
