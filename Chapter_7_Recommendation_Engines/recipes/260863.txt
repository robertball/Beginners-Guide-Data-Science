2 poblano peppers, seeded and chopped
1 large onion, chopped
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced, or more to taste
2 cups hot vegetable broth
2 cups texturized vegetable protein (TVP)
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 (32 ounce) can canned diced tomatoes, undrained
2 (15 ounce) cans kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 cup beer
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste

Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in skillet over medium-low heat. Add bell peppers, poblano peppers, onion, garlic, and jalapeno. Cook and stir until soft, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a slow cooker.
Combine hot vegetable broth and TVP in a bowl; stir and let sit until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Add to the slow cooker.

Description: 
This is a thick, hearty vegetarian chili that is a hit at parties even among die-hard meat eaters. The TVP gives it the texture of ground beef, and the chiles give it a nice depth of flavor. Cook it in the slow cooker or on the stovetop. This recipe really benefits from using the best quality ingredients you can find. Also, I find this tastes best after sitting in the fridge overnight and reheating the next day. Serve with grated cheese on top.
