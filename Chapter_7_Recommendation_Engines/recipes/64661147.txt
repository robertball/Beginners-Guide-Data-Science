1 cup butter (225 g)
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup milk
4 eggs
2 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon soda

Set  Instant Pot速 on "Sautee" cycle. Add butter, sugar to the pan insert.  When butter melts, add cocoa powder and milk. Whisk until bubbly (boiling) and smooth. Take out the pan insert from the  Instant Pot速 and let mixture cool for 5-10 minutes. Measure 1/2 cup of chocolate mixture and set aside, this is going to be ganache for drizzling the cake.
Start adding eggs to the rest of chocolate mixture, one at a time, whisking until each one is incorporated. After that add flour and soda and mix thoroughly.
Return pan insert with batter to the  Instant Pot速. Close lid, set on "low pressure" Cake cycle, keep venting valve open.
When cycle ends, keep on Warm for 30 more minutes. After that take out insert pan, separate cake from the sides of the pan with the knife, cover the pan with a serving plate and invert the cake onto the plate.
Poke the cake with a toothpick or a knife, then drizzle chocolate ganache slowly over the cake, letting it absorb the ganache. Serve plain or decorate with chocolate sprinkles and fruit.
