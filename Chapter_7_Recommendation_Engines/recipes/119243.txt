Description: 
My husband has high cholesterol, so I've had to revise some of his favorite recipes,' says Sandra Cooper of Calgary, Alberta. 'I've found that adding herbs to vegetables is a good way to replace some of those yummy cheese and dairy-rich cream sauces. And since the veggies in this dish are baked, they retain most of their nutrients.'
