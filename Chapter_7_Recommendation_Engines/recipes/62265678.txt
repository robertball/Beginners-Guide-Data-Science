Ingredients:
2 16 oz bag coleslaw mix
2 4 oz cans of shrimp
2 tbsp chopped garlic
2 tsp black pepper
2 tsp salt
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp onion powder.
1 lb package egg roll wraps (I use Nasoya)
1 quart oil to fry egg rolls

Directions:
In a large, microwave safe, bowl place the coleslaw mix.  Microwave on high for 5 minutes.  Let cool.
Mix in the remaining ingredients.
Place one wrapper on the table with a corner pointing towards you. Lightly brush the corners with a little water. Place second wrapper, about one inch off center to the right, directly on top of the first wrapper.
Place about 1/3 cup vegetable mixture in center.
Bring up bottom corners to cover just over the mix, not all the way to the top corners. Dab wrapper with a little water. Pack filling inside well and fold in the 2 sides till just about touching.
Wet the remaining top corners with a little water and roll the filled wrapper portion tightly toward it and press to seal.
Heat oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Fry  egg rolls until golden brown. About 5-7 minutes.
Drain on paper towels and cool slightly before eating.
