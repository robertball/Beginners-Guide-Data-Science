Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 small onion, chopped
1 carrot, diced
1/2 cup chopped broccoli florets
1/4 cup diced red bell pepper
1 clove garlic, minced
3 cups vegetable broth
1 1/2 cups rice
1 (1.41 ounce) package sazon seasoning with coriander and achiote (such as Goya®)
1 dash adobo seasoning with pepper (such as Goya®)

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, carrot, broccoli, red bell pepper, and garlic in hot oil until garlic just begins to brown, about 5 minutes.
Pour vegetable broth into the saucepan; add rice, sazon seasoning, and adobo seasoning and stir. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, about 25 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork to serve.
