Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 pound boneless beef top round steak, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
1 small onion, sliced and separated into rings
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups beef broth
1 cup cubed cooked potatoes
CRUST:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons cold butter or margarine
3 tablespoons shortening
2 tablespoons cold water
1 teaspoon milk

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, salt, pepper and paprika; mix well. Add beef, a few pieces at a time, and shake to coat.
In a skillet, cook beef and onion in oil until beef is browned and onion is tender. Add broth to the skillet. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 45 minutes. Uncover; stir in the potatoes. Cook until heated through. Spoon meat mixture into a greased 7-in. pie plate or 2-cup baking dish.
For the crust, in a bowl, combine the flour and salt; cut in the butter and shortening until crumbly. Gradually add water, tossing with a fork until dough forms a ball. Roll out pastry to fit baking dish. Use a small cookie cutter to cut a shape in the center of the pastry; place pastry over meat mixture. Trim pastry to 1/2 in. beyond edge of dish; flute edges. Brush with milk. Bake at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until pastry is lightly browned on edges.

When I was growing up, Mom let us pick our birthday meals. This one was a frequent choice. I made sure to copy down the recipe to use in my own home years later.
