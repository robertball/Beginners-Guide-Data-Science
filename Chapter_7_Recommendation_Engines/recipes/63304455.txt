Ingredients:
4 Cups of skim milk (3 1/2 cups whole milk)
2 Tablespoons of all purpose flour
3-4 Tablespoons of vegetable oil (I tried olive oil, it really changed the flavor to much for me).
2 Tablespoons low sodium sour cream
1/4 Cup low sodium chicken broth (Pacific or Imagine Organic low sodium are the best for lower sodium)
2 Cups shredded chicken
2 Cups small cubed chicken chunks
1 1/2 Teaspoon Mrs. Dash No Salt Table Blend (I tried a couple of other types, can't get this flavor)
1/2 Teaspoon fresh ground pepper
1/2 Teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 Teaspoon minced garlic (or finely chopped fresh)
1/4 Cup finely chopped onion
1/2 Teaspoon celery seed
Roux flour mixture to desired consistency
Garnish of cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a 3-4 quart sauce pan, heat oil on medium heat.  Gradually stir in the flour to form a paste.  Slowly add the milk mixing continually, simmer for ten minutes.  Add shredded chicken, stock, sour cream, spices and bring to a rolling boil, reduce heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes.  Stir in the chicken chunks, and, heat an additional 10 minutes.  Thicken to desired consistancy with corn starch.  Season to taste, garnish as soup with parsley and cheddar cheese.
