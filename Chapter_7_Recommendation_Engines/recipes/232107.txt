Description: 
I made up this one-pot curry one night when I came home hungry from work and wanted to whip up something quick but exciting. It mixes sweet, spicy, sour, and savory flavors and is easy to make in under an hour. You can augment it with extra vegetables if you want. Correct seasoning, adding more mango juice if too spicy or tart. Serve over hot basmati rice.
