Ingredients:
2 cups spelt flour
1 cup whole wheat flour, or as needed
1/2 cup rolled oats
1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup warm water (120 to 130 degrees F/50 degrees C)
1/4 cup maple syrup
3 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon maple syrup
2 tablespoons rolled oats

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the spelt flour, whole wheat flour, oats, yeast, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, nutmeg, ginger and salt. Combine the oil, warm water, and 1/4 cup maple syrup; stir into the flour mixture.
When the dough is stiff enough, turn out onto a floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic, about 7 minutes. Knead in more flour if necessary to keep the dough from being sticky. Place dough in an oiled bowl, and turn to coat. Cover, and set in a warm place to rise until double in size.
Punch down dough, and form into a tight ball by folding the sides into the center. The tighter the ball, the more it will rise instead of just spreading. Place on a greased baking sheet with the seam underneath. Let rise for 20 minutes, or until your finger leaves a dent when you poke it gently.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix together 3 tablespoon of water and 1 tablespoon of maple syrup. Brush over the top of the loaf, then sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of oats.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Cool on a wire rack before slicing.
