Ingredients:
1 1/2 C brown rice
3 C chicken stock
1 tsp olive oil
1 med yellow onion, minced
2 cloves garlic, roasted
2 tomatoes, diced
2 poblano peppers, roasted
1/2 C grated Colby-Jack cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Set oven broiler on HIGH, and place poblano pepper directly on the rack, along with garlic cloves wrapped in foil.  Turn peppers over after top side is blackened.  Leave garlic in oven for 15 minutes.
When peppers are finished, place them in a container covered with plastic wrap.  Let them steam for 15 minutes.
While the peppers steam, and the garlic roasts, heat olive oil in large pot on medium heat.  Add onions.
When onions are soft, add in rice and chicken stock.  Bring to a boil.  Immediately cover the pot, and turn heat to low.  Let rice cook for 15 minutes.
Chop tomatoes, and grate cheese. Take garlic out of oven.
Peel peppers, take off tops and seeds, and chop.
When rice is done, add in garlic, tomatoes, peppers, and cheese.  Stir until cheese is melted through.
Serve with Cilantro Lime Chicken for a fast, easy dinner!
