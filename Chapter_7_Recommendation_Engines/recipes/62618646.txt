Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup ground almonds or walnuts
6 eggs, separated
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
2 cups finely grated carrot

Powdered sugar (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.
Grease a 9 inch springform and dust it with about 2 tablespoons of the ground nuts.
Beat the egg yolks with the lemon juice and 1/2 cup sugar until pale and thick.
Stir in remaining ground nuts, cocoa, ginger and carrot.
In separate bowl, beat egg whites until fluffy.
Add salt and beat until thick.
Add remaining 1/2 cup sugar a little at a time and continue to beat until stiff and shiny.
Fold whites into carrot mixture and pour into prepared pan.
Bake for about 45 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out dry.
Allow to cool 1/2 hour before unmolding.
Dust with powdered sugar if desired.
