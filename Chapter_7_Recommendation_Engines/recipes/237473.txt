Description: 
You're going to love this quick-cured salmon technique. While the process is incredibly simple, the potential variations are endless. Whether you're talking about the brine or post-cure seasonings, this is something that begs for adaptation. Smoked salt, chipotle, or smoked paprika could be used before or after the cure to make things a little loxier, and don't even get me started on the herbs. After the 3-minute cure, you can sprinkle your slices with dill, tarragon, chervil, and/or thyme.
