Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 egg yolks
3/4 cup butter
1/2 cup any flavor fruit jam
2 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup flaked coconut
1/2 cup blanched slivered almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, 1/2 cup sugar and salt. Make a well in the center and add the egg yolks and butter. Work into the dry ingredients with your hands until well blended. Press dough into an unprepared 9x9 inch baking pan.
Bake 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven. When the crust cools a little bit, spread with the jam or jelly, and set aside.
In a clean bowl, whip the egg whites until they reach soft peaks. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, then the almond extract. Continue to whip until the whites hold stiff peaks and sugar is dissolved. Fold in the coconut and spread the mixture over the jam layer. Sprinkle the almonds over the top, and return to the oven.
Bake for 8 to 10 more minutes until the top is lightly browned. Cool slightly and cut into bars.
