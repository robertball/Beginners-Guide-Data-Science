Ingredients:
3 pounds onions, cut into 1/8-inch slices
1/3 cup butter
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup sherry
7 cups beef broth, divided
1 bay leaf
3 ounces all-purpose flour
1 loaf baguette, sliced
1/2 pound sliced Gruyere cheese, or as needed

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Add onions, butter, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Cook and stir about 4 minutes. Add wine; close and lock the lid. Select manual and high pressure and set timer for 20 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully immediately after timer goes off using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Add sherry and select saute mode. Cook for 3 minutes, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
Add 6 cups broth and bay leaf to the pot. Close and lock the lid; select manual and high pressure and set the timer for 6 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Meanwhile, mix flour and remaining 1 cup broth together in a bowl.
Release pressure carefully immediately after timer goes off using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Set pressure cooker to saute and remove and discard bay leaf. Add flour-broth mixture, and cook and stir until soup is thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Ladle soup into oven-safe serving bowls and top each with slices of baguette and Gruyere cheese. Broil soup bowls until bread is toasted and cheese is melted, 1 to 3 minutes.
