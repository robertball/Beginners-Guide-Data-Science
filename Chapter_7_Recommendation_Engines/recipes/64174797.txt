Ingredients:
1 russet potato, peeled and cut into bite-sized pieces (1 1/2 cups / 240g)
1 cup carrot, cut into 1/2 inch rounds (130g)
1/4 yellow onion, diced  (1/2 cup)
2  cups water
1/4 cup cashew nuts, soaked & blended
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons coconut milk

Directions:
Place potato, carrot and onion in a pan with 2 cups of water and simmer for 20 minutes with the lid on.
After 20 minutes, turn off heat and add Earth Balance, nutritional yeast, turmeric and salt. Stir to combine until melted.
Pour mixture into a blender and blend until creamy, about one minute on medium. You may need to scrape the sides down from the blender a couple of times for everything to get incorporated.
Add coconut milk to the blender and continue to blend until mixture is creamy and smooth
Now that the cheese sauce is done, preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C).
Cut and simmer the cauliflower in 2 cups of water (475ml) for 10 minutes.
Evenly spread 1/4 cup (60g) of cheese sauce on the bottom of an 8×8 baking pan.
Add the cauliflower and sprinkle with a pinch or two of salt.
Pour two cups (460g) of cheese sauce over the cauliflower, stir to combine and evenly top with crackers and green onions. Bake for 20 minutes.
