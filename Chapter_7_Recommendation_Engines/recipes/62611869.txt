Ingredients:
2/3 cup water
1/3 cup uncooked white rice
8 cabbage leaves
1 pound lean ground beef
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 egg, slightly beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed tomato soup
Alternate sauce:
2 8oz cans of tomato sauce or homemade sauce
2 Tbls Brown sugar
1 Tbls Lemon Juice
2 tsp worchestershire

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
Bring a large, wide saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Add cabbage leaves and cook for 2 to 4 minutes or until softened; drain.
In a medium mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, 1 cup cooked rice, onion, egg, salt and pepper, along with 1/4 cup of tomato soup/alternate sauce. Mix thoroughly.
Divide the beef mixture evenly among the cabbage leaves. Roll and secure them with toothpicks or string. Can also be placed seam-side down in a pan without securing.
In a large skillet over medium heat, place the cabbage rolls and pour the remaining tomato soup over the top. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 40 minutes, stirring and basting with the liquid often.
Can be baked in oven instead of on stove top. If baking, place rolls seam side down in the baking pan, pour sauce over all. Cover pan with foil and bake at 350Â° for about 1 hour.
