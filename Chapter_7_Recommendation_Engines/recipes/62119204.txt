Ingredients:
1 cup small-sized pasta (I use veggie spirals)
1/2 pound ground beef
1 small onion, roughly chopped
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 (14.5 ounce) can chili beans
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with chilis
1 (10 ounce) can condensed tomato soup
whatever chili toppings you like (cheese, chopped onion, crackers, etc.)

Directions:
In large saucepan over high heat, boil pasta to al dente, drain, and set aside.
Turn heat down to medium, and use same (now empty) pan to brown together beef, onion, and spices. Cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is browned.
Stir in beans, tomatoes, soup, and pasta.
Turn down to lowest heat and simmer 10 minutes.
Add your favorite toppings and enjoy!
