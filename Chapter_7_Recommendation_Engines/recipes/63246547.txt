Ingredients:
1 lb. jalapeno peppers, sliced lengthwise and stem and seeds removed
1 lb. skinless chicken tenders, sliced in half
1 medium onion sliced into wedges
1 lb. thick cut bacon sliced in half
1 tablespoon seasoning salt (or to taste)
1 teaspoon garlic powder (or to taste)
Ranch Dressing for dipping (optional)

Directions:
Season chicken tenders with seasoning salt and garlic powder.
Put one piece of chicken into the hollowed out jalapeno pepper, then place a onion wedge on top of the chicken.  Wrap bacon around the entire pepper and secure with a toothpick or two. Repeat with the rest of the peppers.
Heat grill to medium heat and cook peppers about 15 minutes, flipping occasionally, until chicken is fully cooked.

Description: 
I never really cared for the cream cheese verisons of stuffed jalapeno peppers, so I came up with my own. It takes a little prep work, but they are so worth it!
