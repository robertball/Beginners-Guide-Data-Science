Description: 
We only use three ingredients here, which is why this works so well. Try to resist the temptation to add salt, pepper, or other spices, as the blue cheese will provide all the punch you need. We're going for pure blue cheese flavor in a buttery, crunchy package, and anything else would just get in the way.
