1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup butter
4 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
5 tablespoons half and half
4 cups confectioner's sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped pecans

4.	In medium sauce pan, bring 1 cup butter, water, and 4 tablespooons unsweetened cocoa powder to boil.
5.	Mix the hot water, butter, and cocoa into the dry ingredients.
6.	Mix the wet ingredients into the mixing bowl.
7.	Pour into prepared cake pan and bake 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
8.	While cake is still warm, to make the icing, bring 1/2 c. butter, half and half, cocoa powder just to a boil. Remove from heat and beat in sugar and vanilla. Beat well. Pour over cake while still warm. Sprinkle nuts on cake.
Tip: don't use an electric mixer - just use a whisk or a fork to blend the ingredients at each step. Over mixing can make the cake dry. Also, be careful not to boil the milk mixtures - bring them just under the boil.

Description:
