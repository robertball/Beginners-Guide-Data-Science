Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup pureed cooked beets
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon red food coloring
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon vinegar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch cake pan with parchment paper.
Sift flour and baking powder together in a large bowl.
Whisk sugar, buttermilk, beets, oil, eggs, cocoa powder, red food coloring, vanilla extract, vinegar, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add flour mixture gradually to the bowl, stirring after each addition just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan. Tap pan firmly to settle the batter and remove large bubbles.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.

Description: 
After reading about the history of the popular red velvet cake, I wanted to try the version with beets. It has a beautiful color and tastes divine with or without frosting. This recipe makes one sheet cake, a 2-layer cake, cupcakes, or even cake pops.
