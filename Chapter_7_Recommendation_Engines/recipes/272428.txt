Ingredients:
1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
1 tablespoon sweet paprika
½ tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
½ teaspoon mustard powder
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
8  chicken wings, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk together brown sugar, paprika, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, poultry seasoning, mustard powder, and pepper in a large bowl. Toss in chicken wings and rub the seasonings into them with your hands until fully coated.
Arrange wings in the basket of the preheated air fryer, standing up on their ends and leaning against each other and the wall of the basket.
Cook until wings are tender inside and golden brown and crisp on the outside, about 35 minutes. Transfer wings to a plate and serve hot.
