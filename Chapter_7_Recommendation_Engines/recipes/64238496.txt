Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
7 Tablesppons cold stick margarine or butter, cut up
6 - 7 tablespoons ice water

Directions:
Whisk the flour and salt together in a medium size bowl.  With a pastry blender or two knives, cut in the shortening and cold margarine until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Drizzle 6 to 7 tablespoons ice water over flour (I always use all).  Toss mixture with a fork to moisten, adding more water a few drops at a time until the dough comes together.
Gently gather dough particles together into a ball.
Roll out dough, and put in a pie plate.  Fill with desired filling and bake.*
*If seems too sticky, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for at least 30 minutes before rolling.
