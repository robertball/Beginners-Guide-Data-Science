Ingredients:
top sirloin steaks, rib eye steaks, flank steaks. Whatever you prefer, 1 inch thick cut is recommended.
Salt (to coat steaks in advance)
Seasonings:
4 teaspoons salt
4 teaspoons paprika
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon coriander
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
Canola oil
Whipped butter

Directions:
Salt both sides of the steaks in advance and let them come to room temperature before pan frying. Salt at least 40 minutes in advance of frying.
Mix together seasoning ingredients and coat steaks on all sides.
Put enough canola oil to completely cover the bottom of the frying pan. Heat over high heat. Wait until the oil just starts to smoke. Add the coated steaks and cook on medium heat to desired doneness. About a minute or so before turning off the heat add a tablespoon of butter to each steak and let it melt.
Remember: About 5Â° F before your steak is done, remove it from the pan and set it aside to cool. Your steak will continue cooking somewhat even after you remove it from the pan.
