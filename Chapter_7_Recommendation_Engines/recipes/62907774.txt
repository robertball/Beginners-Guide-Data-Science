Description: 
I like my pork sweet, salty and spicy.  This rub doesn't work for you if you don't like a sweet bark on your meat.  With three lbs of brown sugar, you should be able to fully cover five racks of ribs.  You can increase or decrease the various spices depending on your taste buds.  Always add less of a particular ingredient when you can add more later!
