Ingredients:
10 lemons
1 quart 95% alcohol (190 proof)
6 cups water
4 cups white sugar

Directions:
Zest lemons, making sure to get the outermost part of the skin and avoid the white pith.
Place lemon zest in a glass bowl and cover with alcohol. Cover and let infuse at room temperature until yellowish in color, about 7 days.
Bring water and sugar to the boil in a saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Remove syrup from heat and let cool, about 10 minutes.
Pour alcohol into the syrup through a fine-mesh strainer; discard lemon zest. Stir well.
Pour limoncello into thick, freezer-safe glass bottles. Store in the freezer for at least 2 weeks before serving.
