Ingredients:
1 large butternut squash, peeled and cut into "fries"
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon Chinese five-spice powder
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 teaspoons sea salt
2 teaspoons black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place cut squash in a large bowl. Add oil, five-spice powder, garlic, salt, and black pepper and toss to coat.
Cook butternut squash fries in the preheated air fryer, shaking every 5 minutes, until crisp, 15 to 20 minutes total. Remove fries and season with additional sea salt.

Description: 
These 'fries' made with Chinese five-spice powder are sweet and spicy, and they're a fiber-full, lower-carb alternative to French fries. Made in the air fryer, they're less messy and can cook up while the rest of your meal is in the making.
