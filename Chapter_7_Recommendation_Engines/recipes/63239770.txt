Ingredients:
1-1/2 cups corn oil (I'd use 1 cup)
1-3/4 cups granulated sugar(I'd use 1-1/2 cups)
3 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 can (8 oz.) crushed pineapple
2 cups grated carrots
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional - my kids don't like nuts in cakes)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Beat together oil, sugar and eggs until well-combined.
In a bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves. Add to the egg-sugar mixture, mixing well.
Drain the pineapple well. Add carrots, walnuts and pineapple to mixture. Blend to mix well.
Pour batter into a greased and floured 9" or 10+" baking pan and bake at 350 degrees F for about 1 hour or until a pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cake cool on rack.
Prepare Cream Cheese Frosting: Cream together 2 packages (8 oz. each) cream cheese, 1 cup powdered sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Spread on the top and sides of cake.

Description: 
A little bit dense, but very moist. The ingredients below are from the original recipe. You may want to alter it (as I always do with most of the recipes) by reducing the oil and sugar, and omitting the nuts.
