Ingredients:
1/3 cup water
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil (EVOT)
3 anchovy filets
2 tablespoons EVOT to saute anchovy filets
2 cloves finely minced garlic (for saute)
3 cloves minced garlic (for marinade)
1 bay leaf
4 teaspoons minced fresh parsley
1 teaspoon sweet basil
1/2 teaspoon (Mediterranean)  oregano
1/4 teaspoon  thyme
Fresh ground black pepper to taste
Sea salt to taste (remember anchovies are salty)
1 - 14oz can of water pack artichoke hearts or you can use the fresh frozen variety

Directions:
In a saute pan, heat 2 Tbs EVOT over medium low heat.  Add anchovy filets and cook gently - the anchovies will dissolve in the oil - add the 2 cloves of finely minced garlic and cook till fragrant and soft.  Do not brown. Let cool.
In a jar with lid combine the water, vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, 3 cloves minced garlic, bay leaf, parsley and basil and oregano. Add the cooled anchovy/garlic/oil mixture. Cover and shake to mix. Add artichokes. Shake to mix and coat completely. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours and no longer than 24 hours. Discard bay leaf. Serve with a slotted spoon.
Perfect accompaniment to a barbeque or with a mixed greens salad.

Description: 
I started with Sylvia Raynor's marinated mushroom recipe and used artichoke hearts instead. I love the intense flavour of the anchovy/garlic oil - anchovies melt away and leave nothing but amazing taste and aroma behind.  Don't be afraid to try them.Modified from: Marinated Mushrooms
