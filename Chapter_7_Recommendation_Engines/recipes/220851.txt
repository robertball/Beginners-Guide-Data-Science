Ingredients:
1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon white sugar
1 pinch fresh ground black pepper
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1 1/4 cups milk
3 large eggs
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Butter the inside edges of a 2-quart casserole dish.
Stir flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, sugar, black pepper, fresh thyme, and milk together in a large bowl until smooth.
Whisk eggs and lemon zest into milk mixture to form a smooth batter.
Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat.
Cook and stir asparagus and 1/4 teaspoon salt in melted butter until the asparagus turns dark green and is coated with butter, 1 to 2 minutes.
Layer asparagus in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Pour batter evenly over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until the pie has puffed up and is browned around the edges, 40 to 45 minutes.
