Description: 
My 4yo said he didn't like soup.  I was making applesauce and already had butternut squash puree in the fridge (cut lengthwise, remove seeds, place cut-side down in a baking dish, fill half-way with water and bake 50 minutes at 350).  To me this tastes like apple pie and pumpkin pie mixed together.  Probably a bit much sugar to feed the kids often, but it got squash into my picky eater!
