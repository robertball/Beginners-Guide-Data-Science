Ingredients:
16 ounces ham
1 T vegetable oil
3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 onion, chopped
3 stalks celery chopped (optional)
2 cups water
2 cups chicken broth
1 medium head cabbage, chopped
3 cups milk, divided
3 tablespoos butter or vegetable oil
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a large pot over medium high heat, saute the onions for 5 - 10 minutes, or until light golden brown. Add celery and contine to saute for a few minutes. Add water,chicken broth and potatoes and simmer for about 10 minute. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the cabbage, return to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for another 20 minutes. Add 2 1/2 cups of the milk and heat slowly to just under a boil. (Note: Don't try to do this too fast, or the milk will burn on the bottom of the pot.)
In a separate small pot or pan, on medium high heat, melt butter and continue to stir until the butter stops making the "crackling" sound. Add the flour and stir constantly until the ingredients smell like baked pie crust. Add the (cold) remaining milk and cook for a minute or two until the milk is thick. Add to the pot and stir until incorporated. Using this method, you will not get lumps.
