Ingredients:
1 pkg oven-bake cresent rolls
8 hot dogs, regular size
1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
Condiments for dipping (i.e., ketchup, etc)
*Optional: Cream cheese (4 TBSP)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees (or as instructed on cresent rolls package).
Using a large cookie sheet, unwrap uncooked rolls.
Sprinkle small amount of cheese on top of roll triangles.
Lay hot dog at base of roll and wrap up just like a regular cresent roll.
Bake in oven approx. 12 minutes or until rolls are golden and hot dogs begin to plump.  You may wish to broil at the end for 1-2 minutes.
Serve with dipping condiments if desired.
*Optional alternate: If you like, instead of cheddar, spread 1/2 TBSP cream cheese on roll before rolling up hot dog.
Enjoy.
