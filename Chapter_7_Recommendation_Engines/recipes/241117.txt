Ingredients:
oil for frying
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup milk
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 (8 ounce) package panko bread crumbs
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1 pound halibut, cut into 2-inch squares

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk eggs, milk, and flour together in a shallow bowl. Stir panko bread crumbs and seasoned bread crumbs together in another bowl.
Gently dip halibut squares into egg mixture, the press gently into bread crumbs mixture to generously coat completely. Place breaded halibut in a single layer on a plate while breading the rest.
Cook halibut in preheated oil until golden brown and crisp on the outside, 4 to 6 minutes.
