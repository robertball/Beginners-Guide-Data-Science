Ingredients:
2 14 oz cans fire roasted tomatoes, pureed
1/2 c jarred roasted pepper, packed
1 4 oz can green chilies
1/2 small red onion, roughly chopped
1/2 c cilantro, packed
6 green onions cut in 2" pieces
3 cloves garlic
1-2 small jalapeno peppers seeded or not
1 tsp cumin
2 T fresh lime juice
1/2 tsp salt opt

Directions:
Drain the tomatoes, reserving the juice.
Combine all ingredients except reserved tomato juice in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse on and off until all ingredients are finely chopped and salsa is desired consistency. We like it a bit chunky, but if you like a smoother salsa, just keep pulsing. If you like a thinner salsa, add a small amount of the reserved tomato juice and pulse one more time.
Taste for seasoning and adjust as needed. Serve with chips, tacos or other Mexican entrees, as a baked potato or omelet topping, soup garnish, etc.
