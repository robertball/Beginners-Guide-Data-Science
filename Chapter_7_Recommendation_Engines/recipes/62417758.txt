Ingredients:
Pan Roasted Pork Chops
4 centre loin pork chops
2 Tbsp butter
1 Tbsp vegetable oil
Salt and Pepper to taste
Applesauce
1/4 cup olive oil
4 onions peeled and thinely sliced
4 apples, cored and sliced 1/4 inch
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1 Tbsp fresh rosemary or 1 Tsp dried
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
For the Applesauce, heat the oil in a small pan over medium heat.  Patiently cook the onions, stirring occasionally until they are soft and golden brown.  Add the apples, vinegar, rosemary and a dash of salt/pepper.  Stir and simmer until apples are tender.
For the chops, preheat large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add oil to the pan, then the butter and allow to heat (butter will start to brown).  Season the chops with a bit of salt/pepper and add to the saute pan.  Sear for 2 minutes per side, then reduce heat to medium-low.  Cover the pan and simmer for 10 minutes.
Serve the applesauce over the chops with any accumulated juices.

Description: 
This is not your typical applesauce so please don't shy away from it!  Pork farmers are raising their pigs to be leaner so do not overcook the chops.  It's okay if there is a tinge of pink when you cut into it!  Searing the chops on high heat for 2 minutes per side will create a seal allowing the juices to stay inside.
