Ingredients:
2 whole bone-in chicken breasts with skin
1 quart water
salt
1 lb. egg noodles
broth from cooked chicken
water and more broth to equal 10 cups, total liquid

Directions:
Cook chicken in water until juices run clear.
Remove breasts and strain cooking water, which is now broth, to remove those ugly thingys floating in the juices.
Add enough water and broth to stock to equal 10 cups liquid.  [Remember, the more chicken broth you use the better flavor your dish will have.]
When liquids are boiling, add the egg noodles and return to a boil.
Simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.
Remove skin and bones from breasts and add meat to the pot of simmering noodles.
Keep cooking until liquid is reduced to your satisfaction.
DO NOT drain or rinse the noodles.
Serve with mashed potatoes.
