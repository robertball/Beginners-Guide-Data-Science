1 12.3 oz container firm tofu, sliced into 8 slices

1/2 sweet red pepper, cut into chunks
1/2 sweet gree pepper, cut into chunks
4 oz light cream cheese
1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
plain fat free Greek yogurt or sour cream, tomatoes, diced sweet pepper, shredded cheese for garnish

Directions:
In a small sauce pan, simmer Herdez sauce, cream cheese and black beans over low heat, uncovered and stiring occassionally. In a heated, lightly oiled skillet, carefully add tofu and cook until browned on each side (about 5-10 minutes per side - take care in flipping the slices so they don't break). In a small skillet, saute sweet peppers and onions until tender crisp, about 5 minutes.
