Ingredients:
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon oil, olive, extra-virgin
1/2 clove(s) garlic minced
peppercorns, black freshly ground, to taste
10 ounces fish, halibut fillets or mahi-mahi, cut into 2 portions
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/8 teaspoon salt, sea or kosher salt
1/2 medium lemon cut into wedges

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Line a baking sheet with foil.
Mix lemon juice, oil, garlic, and pepper in a shallow glass dish. Add fish and turn to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, toast sesame seeds in a small dry skillet over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until golden and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl to cool. Mix in thyme.
Sprinkle the fish with salt and coat evenly with the sesame seed mixture, covering the sides as well as the top. Transfer the fish to the prepared baking sheet and roast until just opaque in the center, 10 to 14 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.
