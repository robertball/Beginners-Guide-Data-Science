Ingredients:
Four whole chicken breasts
Water
Plain bread crumbs
Soft margarine

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line a cookie sheet with foil.  Spray a cookie cooling rack with PAM nonstick spray and place the rack on the foil lined pan. Rinse the chicken breast with water and then press the chicken on both sides in plain bread crumbs. Place the chicken on the prepared rack. Dot the center of each piece of chicken with 2 teaspoons of the soft margarine.  Bake for about 25 minutes.  Allow the meat to rest a couple of minutes before serving.

Description: 
This recipe seems too simple to be tasty, but it really is delicious and heart-healthy. Substituting regular butter will not work.
