Ingredients:
1 Can (15oz) Pumpkin
1 Can Evaporated Milk
3 Eggs
3/4 Cup Sugar
2 tsp. Pumpkin Pie Spice
1/2 tsp. Salt
1 Boxed Cake Mix (Yellow or Spice)
1 Stick Butter

Directions:
For the filling, blend everything except the cake mix and butter in a blender for about 7 seconds, or just till blended.
Pour into a greased 9x13 pan (or two 8 or 9 inch round pans, if splitting.)
Gently shake cake mix on top of the filling in as even a layer as possible. You can super lightly smooth with a spatula.
Cut cold butter into thin pats and layer all over the top of the cake mix.
Bake at  350 degrees for 50-60 minutes, or until beginning to brown on top, or lightly browned. Wait at least 10 minutes before cutting. Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, if desired.

Description: 
The filling of a pumpkin pie with the ease of a dump cake.  Everyone asks me for the recipe and oftentimes people who don't like pumpkin pie... like this dessert! We always have this instead of pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving and Christmas.
