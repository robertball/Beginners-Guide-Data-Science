Ingredients:
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter, room temperature
4 eggs, beaten
1 can crushed pineapple, drained
5 slices bread, cubed (preferably day old at least)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a large mixing bowl, cream the sugar and butter  together thoroughly
Beat the eggs and add them to the mixture.
In a cheesecloth, drain the pineapple thoroughly getting it as "dry" as you can. Reserve liquid for another dish. Add this to the mixture.
Cube the bread into 1-2" cubes and gently fold into mixture coating thoroughly.
In an 8" x 8" baking pan, pour the mixture and tamp down lightly, spreading it out to the corners.
Bake for 45 minutes or until top is golden brown and bubbling.
I've substituted Splenda for those who are diabetic and it was still great. I also now substitute the bread with different types such as sunflower seed bread, 5-grain whole bread, whatever I can find at the bakery that's a day or two old.
This is a never fail dish and easy to make.

Description: 
A friend brought this to my house for a pot luck holiday dinner and I fell in love. It's a quick, easy and delicious dish to bring with you anywhere, anytime. Goes great with Ham as a side dish or for dessert or even breakfast (cut down on the sugar). I brought it for the holidays one year and now my nieces INSIST I bring it every year. A new tradition created. Serve hot or cold.
