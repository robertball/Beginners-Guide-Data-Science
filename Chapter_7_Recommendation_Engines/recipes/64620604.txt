Ingredients:
1 to 1 1/2 lbs Venison steak or loin
1 medium onion
4 medium potatoes ( I used russet)
3 medium carrots
3 stalks of celery
3 bay leaves
1 tbs pepper
1 tbs salt
1 tsp garlic powder or 2 cloves fresh garlic
2 tbs flour
1 small can of tomato soup
2-3 cups broth/stock/water(I used a mixture of chicken and beef broth)
Oil for cooking
Bread and butter for dipping.

Directions:
1. Take flour and half of the salt and half of the pepper and mix in small bowl. Chop venison into 1 inch cubes. Toss venison in flour mixture until well covered.
2.  Heat oil in pan, brown all sides of venison.
3. While venison is browning, take onion, 2 carrots, 2 potatoes, and 2 stalks of celery and puree. Take remaining carrot, potatoes, and celery and cut into even sizes.
4.  Mix everything into pressure cooker, taking care not to break bay leaves, until desired consistency. Use salt and pepper to taste.
5. Set pressure cooker to the soup/stew setting for 35 minutes.
6. Serve with bread and butter.
For slow cooker, cook on low for 5-6 hours until venison and potatoes are tender.
