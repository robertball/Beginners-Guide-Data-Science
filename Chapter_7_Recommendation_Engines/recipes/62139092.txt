DIRECTIONS
1.	Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash. Mix in butter, ¼ cup milk. Beat until creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste; set aside.
2.	Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add onion and cook until clear. Add garlic salt and pepper. Add ground beef and cook until well browned. Pour off excess fat, then stir in flour and cook 1 minute. Add ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, sherry and beef broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. It should have a nice gravy consistency.  If too thick, add a little more beef broth.  Mix in the corn, peas and carrots.
3.	Spread the ground beef mixture in an even layer on the bottom of a 2 quart casserole dish. Next, spread the layer of mashed potatoes. Top  with the shredded cheese.
4.	Bake in the preheated oven at 375 degrees for 25 minutes, or until golden brown.
