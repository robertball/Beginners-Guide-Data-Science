Ingredients:
TART SHELLS
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup LAND O LAKES® Butter, softened*
1/2 cup sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon almond extract
FILLING
1 cup powdered sugar
1/2 cup LAND O LAKES® Butter
1/3 cup dark corn syrup
1 cup chopped pecans
36 pecan halves

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees F.  Combine all tart shells ingredients in large bowl.  Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Press 1 tablespoon mixture into each cup of mini muffin pans to form 36 (1 3/4 to 2-inch) shells.  Bake for 7 to 10 minutes or until very lightly browned.  Remove from oven.  Reduce oven to 350 degrees F.
Meanwhile, combine all filling ingredients except chopped pecans and pecan halves in 2-quart saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture comes to a full boil (4 to 5 minutes).  Remove from heat; stir in chopped pecans.
Spoon filling into baked shells; top each with pecan half.  Bake for 5 minutes.  Cool 20 minutes; remove from pans.
