Ingredients:
1 large Red Delicious apple
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 tablespoon finely shredded coconut
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch brown sugar, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut the core and seeds out of apple, leaving about a 1/2 in the bottom, creating a well-like hole. Mix 2 tablespoons brown sugar, butter, coconut, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl; fill well in the apple with brown sugar mixture. Place stuffed apple in a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until apple is tender, about 30 minutes. Transfer baked apple to a serving bowl and drizzle any remaining juices from baking dish over apple; sprinkle with 1 pinch brown sugar and cinnamon.
