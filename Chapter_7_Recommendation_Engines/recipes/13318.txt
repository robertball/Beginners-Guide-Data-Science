Place lentil mixture, cumin, and pepper into a food processor or blender and puree until smooth.
Transfer pureed soup into a large stock pot and return to heat.  Right as soup is ready to boil add onion soup mix, stirring until well mixed.  Simmer until soup has a thick creamy consistency.
Prior to serving add lemon juice and chopped parsley for a little flavor and garnish.

Description: 
Lentil soup is a favorite in the Middle East.  It is often the first dish used to break the day of fasting during Ramadan.  My husband loves it anytime of year, especially on cold days.  Serve with grissini, or garlic croutons.  Can be reheated, but may need to be thinned with heavy cream or water. Garnish with fresh parsley.
