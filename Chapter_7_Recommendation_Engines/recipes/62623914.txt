30 saltine crackers
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons dry potato flakes
2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 t. garlic powder
1 t. onion powder
1 t. paprika
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2-3 eggs

Place crackers in a large resealable plastic bag; seal bag and crush crackers until they are coarse crumbs.Into bag #2 add flour, potato flakes, and spices. Mix well.  Beat eggs in Bag #3.
One by one, dredge chicken pieces in flour mixture, then place in bag with egg mixture. Next add chicken to crackers. Seal bag and shake to coat.
After the chicken has it's coating on it, refrigerate it overnight, or at least 3-4 hours.  It helps the coating stay on when cooking.  Take it out and let it stand at room temperature for an hour before cooking.
Cook coated chicken in skillet 350 degrees, for 15 to 20 minutes,  until golden brown and juices run clear.
Do not turn often or the coating will come off, let it brown, then turn.  If using bone in chicken, and its not done finish in oven.
