Ingredients:
4 chicken breasts (6 oz)
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 whole lemon sliced
4 oz baby zucchini quartered lengthwise
4 oz baby carrots
4 oz cherry tomatoes
16 asparagus spears, trimmed
1/4 cup shredded basil
1/4 cup dry white wine
2 tbsp olive oil

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Place each chicken breast in the center of a 14-inch square piece of parchment paper (or foil) and top with lemon slices, zucchini, carrots, tomatoes, asparagus, and basil, dividing evenly. Sprinkle each with 3 tablespoons wine and 1/2 tablespoon olive oil.
2. Bring the edges of the parchment to the center and fold together twice to seal tightly, leaving space between parchment and contents. Place the 4 packets on a large baking sheet.
3. Bake until parchment is browned on edges and center puffs up, 14 - 16 minutes. Remove from oven, put each packet on a plate, and serve, letting people pierce the center to reveal the food.
