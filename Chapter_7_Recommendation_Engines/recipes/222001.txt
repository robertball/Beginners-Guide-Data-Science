Ingredients:
1 pound spicy Italian sausage, casing removed
1 tablespoon fresh parsley, minced
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup heavy cream
3 1/2 cups tomato sauce
1 cup water
14 1/2 ounces dry penne pasta
1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Cook sausage in a Dutch oven over medium heat until browned, about 15 minutes.
Stir in parsley and cook for about 2 minutes.
Stir in white wine and cook until the wine has nearly evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir in heavy cream, increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Stir in marinara sauce and water and return to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer sauce for 1 hour.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne, and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
Combine pasta and sauce; remove from heat, cover and let sit for about 2 minutes.
Serve pasta and sauce topped with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.

With all the options for different kinds of sauces and types of sausage, it goes without saying that you can embellish this a hundred different ways, and I hope you do.
