Ingredients:
1 cup chicken broth
½ cup quinoa
1 pound ground chicken
½ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
1  zucchini, diced
1 (15 ounce) can corn, drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed, drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, drained
1 cup salsa
¾ cup shredded Mexican cheese blend

Directions:
Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
Mix chicken, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl.
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken mixture in hot oil until chicken is cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Transfer chicken mixture to a bowl.
Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir zucchini in hot oil until softened, about 4 minutes. Add cooked quinoa, chicken mixture, corn, black beans, tomatoes, and salsa to skillet; cook, stirring, until heated through and flavors have combined, 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle cheese over the top. Cover skillet and cook until cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes.

Description: 
We are trying to eat healthier, but we still want flavorful, so I came up with this recipe. My family loves it! Great served with chips, stuffed in half a zucchini (and baked), in a tortilla, or just by itself!
