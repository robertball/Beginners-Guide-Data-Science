Ingredients:
3 medium sweet potatoes or yams (1 lb)
3 Tbl. Brown sugar
1 Tbl. Butter
--optional--
1/2 c. tiny marshmallows
1 small can mandarine oranges
1/2 jar maraschino cherries

Directions:
Cook fresh whole sweet potatoes, covered, in enough boiling water to cover for 25 - 35 minutes, until tender.  Drain; cool slightly.  Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2" thick slices.
In a 1-qt casserole dish layer half the potatoes, half the brown sugar, and half the butter.  Repeat layers.
Bake, uncovered, in a 375 degree oven for 30 - 35 minutes or until potatoes are glazed, spooning liquid over potatoes once or twice.
If desired, add optional ingredient(s) and bake for 5 minutes more.
