Ingredients:
3 cups mixed nuts (pecans, walnuts and almonds)
2 tablespoons organic butter
1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground mustard
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
1/4 teaspoon allspice
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
1 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Put the nuts in a mixing bowl and set aside. Put the butter into a small saucepan and place over medium heat.
As the butter melts, add the thyme leaves, cumin, mustard, cayenne, allspice, and pepper. Allow to simmer for 1 minute.
Pour the butter mixture over the nuts, add the salt and toss well to coat. Put the nuts onto a baking sheet in 1 layer. Put the pan into the preheated oven until the nuts are a golden brown, about 20 minutes.
Remove and let cool. Serve immediately or keep in a sealed container for 1 week.
