Ingredients:
4 medium sweet potatoes
2/3 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup seedless raisins, or 1/2 cup chopped apple (optional)
1/4 cup cognac

Directions:
Wash the sweet potatoes but do not peel. Boil in water to cover until barely soft, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and peel. Slice into a greased casserole.
Preheat over to 350F
Bring to a boil the brown sugar, water, butter and raisins. Add the cognac and pour the mixture over the potatoes.
Bake, uncovered, 30 minutes, basting several times with the syrup in the casserole.

Description: 
Classic recipe for Sweet Potatoes that aren't over-the-top sugary. These are a great alternative to the sugar/butter/marshmallow covered sweet potatoes that seem to dominate Thanksgiving dinners now.
