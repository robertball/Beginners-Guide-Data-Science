Ingredients:
1-1/4 pounds salmon fillets
1 egg
1/2 cup soft bread crumbs
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon grated lime peel
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 cup coarsely ground pistachios
2 tablespoons canola oil
Lime wedges

Directions:
In a large nonstick skillet, bring 4 cups water to a boil. Reduce heat; add fillets and poach, uncovered, for 8-10 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Remove from pan and cool slightly.
In a large bowl, combine the egg, bread crumbs, mustard, lime peel, salt and pepper. Shred salmon with two forks; fold into bread crumb mixture. Shape into eight patties. Coat both sides with pistachios.
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook patties in oil in batches for 1-2 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Serve with lime wedges. Yield: 4 servings.
