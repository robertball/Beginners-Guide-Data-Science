Ingredients:
3 racks St. Louis style pork ribs (I get them from Costco)
Lawry's seasoning salt
2 cups KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce
1/4 cup Brown sugar
1/4 cup Honey

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 300º, line cookie sheet with 2 sheets tin foil, fold the 2 sheets lengthwise to create 1 wide sheet so no juices will leak through. Do this twice so you have 2 layers thick (4 sheets of tin foil total). Sprinkle top and bottom of ribs with Lawry's.
Mix BBQ sauce, brown sugar & honey together getting all lumps out. Pour on bottoms of ribs spreading all over with brush or back of spoon. Repeat on top.
Now do same with tin foil on top...2 sheets tin foil, fold the 2 sheets lengthwise to create 1 wide sheet so no juices will leak through. Do this twice so you have 2 layers thick (4 sheets of tin foil total). Roll all 4 layers tin toil toward ribs creating thick roll around all sides of ribs. Take small sharp knife point & poke 8 small holes in top of tin foil.
Bake for 3 1/2 hours, remove from oven & carefully tear top of tin foil open to expose top of ribs. Be careful to keep your arms & fingers out of the steam. Now pour remaining BBQ sauce over tops of ribs, keeping the juice in the bottom of the foil lining. Put back in over for 15-20 minutes without anything on top so BBQ sauce can caramelize to stick to the ribs.
Remove from oven & let sit for 10 min before cutting…..or just pulling apart! These will fall off the bone!
