Ingredients:
1/2 pound thin spaghetti
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/4 pound Mizithra cheese, grated

Directions:
Cook pasta in large pot of salted, boiling water until al dente. Drain.
As pasta cooks, slowly melt butter over medium heat until golden. Stir often to prevent burning. Strain through a single sheet of paper towel to remove solids. Toss pasta with clarified butter. Sprinkle generously with cheese to taste.
