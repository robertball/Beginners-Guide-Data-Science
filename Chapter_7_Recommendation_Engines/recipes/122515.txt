2 cups sugar
2 teaspoons almond extract
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar until almost white, about 10-12 minutes. Beat in extract. Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Stir in almonds. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls 2 in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool for 2 minutes before removing to wire racks.

Description: 
My family - all of whom are self-proclaimed chocoholics - can't get enough of these rich cookies. My sister-in-law shared the recipe and believes their success lies in beating the butter and sugar very well.
