Description: 
Delicious chocolate roll recipe from my husband's grandmother.  She made this chocolate roll quite a bit during the 60's and 70's.  You can choose to roll the cake up with ice cream inside and freeze it, or roll it up with a yummy cream cheese filling.  Note:  Add red food coloring to the cake batter on Valentine's Day - looks very special and festive with the white filling.  Enjoy!
