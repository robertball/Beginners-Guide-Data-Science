Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water
1 cup cottage cheese, room temperature
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon butter, room temperature, plus more as needed
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons dill seed
1 tablespoon dried minced onion
1 egg
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Soften yeast in warm water; let stand 10 minutes.
Mix cottage cheese, sugar, butter, 1 teaspoon salt, and baking soda together in a large mixing bowl. Add dill seed, dried onion, egg, and yeast mixture. Mix well. Gradually add flour, about 1/4 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. If dough seems too sticky, add another tablespoon or 2 of flour.
Cover bowl with a clean cotton kitchen towel and place in a warm place until double in size, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously butter a 1 1/2- to 2-quart baking dish.
Gently stir dough to release bubbles. Transfer to prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven; brush top with butter and sprinkle on a pinch of salt. Let bread cool 5 minutes before transferring from the baking dish to a cooling rack.

Description: 
This super rich bread bakes up high and is full of flavor. It's a family recipe. It's even better toasted with lots of butter.
