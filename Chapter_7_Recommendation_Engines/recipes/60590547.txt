Description: 
This is homemade barbeque sauce cooked over chicken without the grill!This recipe was very good! However, like others have said, I found it to taste way too much like ketchup. I improvised by putting 1/2 cup of ketchup(instead of 1 cup), 1 1/2 teaspoons of soya sauce, 1 table spoon chilli powder, 1 table spoon garlic powder and a few shakes of hot sauce. I gave this recipe a 3 because of the changes that needed to made. After all the changes, it tasted absolutely delicious. I've used this recipe to make wings, legs and thighs. I will definitely using this recipe for making barbeque chicken in Modified from: Becki's Oven Barbecue Chicken
