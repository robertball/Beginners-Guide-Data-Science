Ingredients:
1 quart yellow dandelion blossoms, well rinsed
1 gallon boiling water
1 (.18 ounce) package wine yeast
8 cups white sugar
1 orange, sliced
1 lemon slice

Directions:
Place dandelion blossoms in the boiling water, and allow to stand for 4 minutes. Remove and discard the blossoms, and let the water cool to 90 degrees F (32 degrees C).
Stir in the yeast, sugar, orange slices, and lemon slice; pour into a plastic fermentor, and attach a fermentation lock. Let the wine ferment in a  cool area until the bubbles stop, 10 to 14 days. Siphon the wine off of the lees, and strain through cheesecloth before bottling in quart-sized, sterilized canning jars with lids and rings. Age the wine at least a week for best flavor.

Description: 
This very old recipe utilizes the bane of homeowners: the dandelion!  I found this in 1993 when a flood left our front yard full of beautiful, very large dandelions. The blossoms CANNOT have been sprayed with any pesticides, and should be thoroughly rinsed.
