Ingredients:
2 c rolled oats
1/2 c brown sugar
1/2 c flax meal OR wheat germ
3/4 t ground cinnamon
1 c flour (all-purpose or whole wheat)
3/4 c raisins or other dried fruit
1/2 c nuts
3/4 t salt
1/4 c honey
1 egg, beaten
1/2 c canola oil
2 t vanilla
1/2 c peanut butter (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350F. Generously butter 9x13 inch baking pan.
In a large bowl mix together the oats, brown sugar, flax meal, cinnamon, flour, raisins, and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the honey, egg, oil, vanilla, and peanut butter, if using. Blend well. Pat mixture evenly into pan.
Bake about 20 minutes, or until the edges begin to turn golden brown. Cool in pan 5 minutes. Cut bars while still warm or they'll be too brittle.

Description: 
My girlfriend brought these granola bars over for a playgroup one morning and ever since they've been a staple!  My son requests them almost daily so I usually triple the recipe and make 2 trays so we have plenty on hand.Modified from: Playgroup Granola Bars
