Ingredients:
6 pork chops
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon seasoning salt
2 egg, beaten
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups Italian-style seasoned bread crumbs
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 can golden mushroom soup
1 cup milk
2/3 cup white wine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Rinse pork chops, pat dry, and season with garlic powder and seasoning salt to taste. Place the beaten eggs in a small bowl. Dredge the pork chops lightly in flour, dip in the egg, and coat liberally with bread crumbs.
Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, fry the pork chops 5 minutes per side, or until the breading appears well browned. Transfer the chops to a 9x13 inch baking dish, and cover with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. While baking, combine the soups, milk and white wine in a medium bowl. After the pork chops have baked,cover them with the soup mixture. Replace foil, and bake for another 20 minutes.
