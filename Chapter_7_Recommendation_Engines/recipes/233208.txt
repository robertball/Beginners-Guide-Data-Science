Ingredients:
8 cups beef broth
3 pounds beef ribs
1 onion, sliced
Water as needed to cover
1 (12 ounce) jar HERDEZ® Roasted Pasilla Chile Mexican Cooking Sauce
1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed
Cilantro, to garnish

Directions:
Place broth in a large pot; add beef ribs and onion. Pour in enough water to cover beef. Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until the meat pulls away from the bones, 3 to 4 hours.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Remove beef ribs from broth mixture and place in a baking dish. Mix cooking sauce and brown sugar in a bowl; pour over meat.
Bake in the preheated oven until beef and sauce are hot, about 15 minutes. Serve sprinkled with chopped cilantro to garnish.
