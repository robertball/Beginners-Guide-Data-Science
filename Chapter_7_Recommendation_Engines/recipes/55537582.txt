Description: 
This is so good and reminds me of a real moist kind of a sweet quick bread.  Everybody asks for the recipe: this bread is moist, and easy to make too.  Note: If you are using frozen blueberries, you can thaw them in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  However, you need to increase the amount of blueberries to 3/4 cup.Modified from: Favorite Banana Blueberry Quick Bread
