Ingredients:
Canned crabmeat (7 oz/220g, drained)
*Peanut oil (1 tbsp)
Fresh ginger (1 tbsp, shredded)
Fish broth or chicken broth (3 cups/24 fl oz/750 ml)
Canned creamed corn (1 can/14 oz/440 g)
Fresh cilantro (1 tbsp, chopped)
**Chinese rice wine  (1 tsp)
*I used olive oil and it worked just deliciously.
**I used Japanese sake (rice wine). What's the diff I ask?

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the ginger and after about 30 seconds-1 minute add the broth and creamed corn. Stir well and bring the mixture to a boil.
Once boil is reached, add crabmeat and stir well. Bring back to boil.
When the soup returns to a boil, stir in cilantro and rice wine.
Serve and enjoy!
