Ingredients:
2 1/4 cup pureed red peppers (about 3-5 depending on size)
2 1/2 cups WHITE WINE vinegar 9USE LESS)
6 cups sugar
2 pouches liquid pectin (MUST BE LIQUID NOT DRY) (in our stores it's in the baking section)
14 4oz. ball jars (comes in box with jar, lid and seal)

Directions:
Cut peppers, removing all seeds, puree in blender or food processor, don't leave big chunks but a few small pieces are fine.
Combine pureed red peppers, white wine vinegar and sugar in LARGE saucepan.  Bring to rolling boil (a boil that can not be stirred down), stir CONSTANTLY. DON'T TURN YOUR BACK FOR A SECOND, IT BOILS OVER IN A SPLIT SECOND AND IS AWFUL TO CLEAN OFF YOUR STOVE!!!
Add liquid pectin.  Bring to a boil and stir for about 5-7 minutes or until it begins to show signs of thickening (AGAIN, DON'T TURN YOUR BACK).  Can test by putting a small amount on a plate and placing into refrigerator to make sure it sets.
Skim off any foam.
*Fill sterilized jars to about 1/2 inch of rim.
**Process jars for 10 minutes.
