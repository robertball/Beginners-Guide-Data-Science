Ingredients:
2 tablespoons bacon grease
1 large onion, diced
2 carrots, peeled and diced
3 stalks celery, diced
2 cloves garlic, crushed
3 potatoes, diced
8 cups hot water
8 cubes chicken bouillon
1 ham bone
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/2 (16 ounce) package frozen corn
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Melt bacon grease in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion, carrots, celery, and garlic in hot bacon grease until vegetables are slightly tender and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir potatoes into onion mixture; cook and stir until golden, about 10 minutes.
Stir hot water and chicken bouillon together in a slow cooker until bouillon is dissolved; add onion mixture, ham bone, diced tomatoes, corn, tomato sauce, black pepper, and salt.
Cook soup in the slow cooker set to Low for 4 to 6 hours. Remove ham bone from soup and let rest until cool enough to handle. Remove meat from ham bone and stir meat into soup.

Description: 
I was looking for a good use of a ham bone without the heavy cream of a potato soup. I made use of a few other recipes to come up with one that I thought my husband and I would like. I think it is important to start with the three basics: onion, celery, and carrots. In addition, you can add a variety of different vegetables to suit your taste or depending on what you have in the house at the time.
