Description: 
I never would have believed what a DELICIOUS recipe this was until my sister told me about how the recipe spread like wildfire after an office potluck where it was served. Sure enough, it was wonderful! This is one way to get the kids to eat their veggies! By the way, to make it a little less fattening, I used light cream cheese.
