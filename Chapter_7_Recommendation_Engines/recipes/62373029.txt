Ingredients:
*  1 3/4 cup Half/Half No Fat
*  1 3/4 cup Skim
* 2/3 cup uncooked arborio rice
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons honey, divided
* 2 teaspoons grated orange peel

* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon (I DON'T LIKE)
* 1/3 cup pistachios optional

Directions:
In a large saucepan, bring the milk, rice, sugar, 1/4 cup honey, orange peel and salt to a boil.
Reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 30-35 minutes or until rice is tender and pudding is thickened, stirring occasionally.
((( I am going to add ONE BEATEN EGG here))) and stir for 2 minutes longer.
Stir in the vanilla, (cinnamon) and remaining honey. Serve warm or cold. Sprinkle with pistachios.

Description: 
“Arborio rice is the key to this creamy pudding. The slow cooking allows the rice to become tender and absorb the honey & citrus flavors.”   TASTE OF HOME Recipe
