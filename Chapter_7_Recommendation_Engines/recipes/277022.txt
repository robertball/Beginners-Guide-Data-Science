Ingredients:
2 tablespoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 (8 ounce) sushi-grade ahi tuna steaks
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
2 cups coleslaw mix
1/4 cup julienned yellow bell pepper
1 cup Asian-style vinaigrette
1/2 cucumber, shaved
2 tablespoons pickled ginger, or to taste
1 tablespoon wasabi paste, or to taste

Directions:
Whisk sesame oil, canola oil, and soy sauce together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add tuna steaks and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
Mix together toasted and untoasted sesame seeds on a rimmed plate.
Remove tuna steaks from the marinade and dip in sesame seed mixture until well coated on sides and edges. Discard remaining marinade and seeds.
Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot. Add tuna steaks and sear for 45 seconds on each side, and 20 seconds on each edge. Remove tuna to a plate and cool in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 2 hours.
Remove tuna from the refrigerator and cut into thin slices.
Combine coleslaw mix, bell pepper, and vinaigrette in a bowl; mix until well combined. Transfer to a large rectangular serving plate and top with shaved cucumber and sliced tuna. Place pickled ginger in one corner of the plate and wasabi in another corner.
