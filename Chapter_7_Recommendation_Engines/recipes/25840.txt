Directions:
Beat butter, sugar, egg yolk, milk and vanilla in medium bowl until light and fluffy.  Stir together flour, cocoa and salt; gradually add to butter mixture, beating until blended. Refrigerate dough at least 1 hour or until firm enough to handle.

Spoon about 1/4 teaspoon filling into each thumbprint. Gently press a KISS in center of each cookie. Cool completely. About 2 dozen cookies.
VANILLA FILLING: Combine 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon softened butter or margarine, 2 teaspoons milk and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract in small bowl; beat until smooth.
