Twice Cooked Cabbage and Chicken Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 head of cabbage
2-3 chicken breasts
2 eggs
1/8 c. wheat-free tamari (or soy sauce if you're ok with wheat)
3 tbsp butter
3 tbsp sesame seed oil
1-3 tbsp Srirachi sauce (spice level depends on your preference)
1 tsp minced garlic (split into 1/2 and 1/2)
pinch salt
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp honey

Directions:
Slice the chicken breasts into as thin strips as possible. Kitchen shears work the best for this.
Slice or dice the cabbage up as you wish, either in long slivers or chunks like we did:
Melt the butter in large pot and add salt, 1/2 tsp. garlic, and onion powder and mix.
Add in cabbage and stir and coat thoroughly.
While the cabbage is cooking, heat the sesame seed oil and the other 1/2 tsp. garlic in a large skillet.
Add in the sliced chicken and srirarchi and cook through, approximately 10 minutes.
Combine the chicken and the cabbage and add the tamari sauce and honey and stir.
Once that's all mixed, make yourself a little hole in the middle and crack two eggs in.
Stir the eggs until they start to cook almost all the way and then stir the whole thing together.
Cook, tossing often, an additional 5-7 minutes.
Taste it and see if it needs anything; if it does, now's the time to add it! Everyone's taste is different.
Serve and enjoy!
