Description: 
If you've ever picked or bought an ulu, thinking you were going to bake, make chips etc., and the next day it's practically mush, then this is the perfect recipe to try. Or if you've been forced to eat raw ripe ulu, and have developed a complex around the mushy state of this food, this recipe should turn your ulu distaste into yummy breakfast wonder. Enjoy with maple syrup, honey, or whatever!
