Ingredients:
1 cup chili garlic sauce
1 (5 ounce) bottle Louisiana style hot sauce
2 tablespoons granular sucrolose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
1 tablespoon butter
12 skinless chicken drumsticks

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the chili garlic sauce, hot sauce and sweetener. Set aside.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the drumsticks, and cook until browned on the outside, turning as needed. Reduce heat to medium-low, and spoon sauce over the chicken to coat. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken has cooked through and sauce is thick and sticky, about 20 minutes.
