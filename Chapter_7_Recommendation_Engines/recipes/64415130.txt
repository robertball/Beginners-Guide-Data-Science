Ingredients:
1/2 pint ripe strawberries, hulled and quartered (about 2 cups strawberries)
2 slices bread
Â½ large ripe avocado, sliced
6 small mozzarella balls, sliced in half
Small handful of arugula
Olive oil and/or butter
Balsamic Vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Spread strawberries out.  Bake for 10-20 minutes, or until strawberries are soft and carmelized.
Preheat panini press or griddle.
Place strawberries on slice of bread.  Cover with avocado slices, mozzarella, and arugula.  Cover with other slice of bread.  Coat outside of bread with a small amount of butter or olive oil (so that bread will brown nicely).
Cook until mozzarella melts.  Serve with balsamic vinegar for dipping.

Description: 
It sounds like a strange combination, but it's really good! It takes a little bit more effort than a plain grilled cheese, but is a nice change of pace.  It's a nice way to get a lot of fruit into your lunch, because the strawberries really cook down and you use a lot of them.  Also a good way to use some imperfect strawberries since you won't notice the imperfections when you cook them down.
