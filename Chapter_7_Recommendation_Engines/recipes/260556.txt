Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup buckwheat flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
6 teaspoons shortening
1 egg, separated
1 1/4 cups 1% milk
1 tablespoon molasses

Directions:
Mix all-purpose flour, buckwheat flour, and baking powder together in a bowl. Cut in shortening with 2 knives or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Beat egg yolk lightly in a separate bowl. Mix in milk and molasses. Pour into the flour mixture; mix batter until no dry spots remain.
Beat egg white in a separate bowl until stiff. Fold into the batter.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Pour batter into 4-inch cakes on the griddle. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
Love this for a weekend breakfast. The hot cakes are light and fluffy. We usually have them with maple syrup and butter.
