Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (5 pound) whole trout
3 tomatoes, chopped
1 large onion, roughly chopped
2 lemons, juiced
1 small bunch cilantro sprigs
3 cloves garlic, halved
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup water
1 potatoes, cut into 1/4-inch slices, or more to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Drizzle a large oven-safe pan with oil.
Rinse trout and pat dry with a paper towel. Place on a flat work surface. Cut trout from one side through the middle horizontally to within one-half inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book; lay onto the prepared pan.
Place tomatoes, onion, lemon juice, cilantro, garlic, coriander, cumin, salt, pepper, and cinnamon in a food processor. Pulse until chopped fine but not pureed. Pour 1/2 the mixture on top of 1/2 of the trout; fold the other side of trout on top. Spoon the remaining 1/2 of the mixture on and around the sealed trout. Add water to the pan; arrange potatoes around the trout. Cover pan with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until trout flakes easily with a fork, about 45 minutes.
