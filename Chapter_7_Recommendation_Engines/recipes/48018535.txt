Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated thin pizza crust
1/2 cup Light Ranch-style salad dressing
1+ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1+ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup chopped tomatoes
1/4 cup chopped green onions
Sliced sweet onion
1 tsp minced garlic
1 can sliced olives
Olive Oil
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a pizza pan or medium baking sheet.
Chop chicken into bite-size pieces.  Place chicken in olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat with onions and garlic. Cook until no longer pink, and juices run clear. Season with salt and pepper.  Cool, then either shred or chop into small pieces.
Unroll dough, and press into the prepared pizza pan or baking sheet. Bake crust for 7 minutes in the preheated oven, or until it begins to turn golden brown. Remove from oven.
Spread ranch dressing over partially baked crust. Sprinkle on mozzarella cheese. Place tomatoes, green onion, and chicken on top of mozzarella cheese, then top with Cheddar cheese. Return to the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until cheese is melted and bubbly.
