Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 cups diced onion
1 green bell pepper, cut into medium dice
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 (15.5 ounce) cans black beans, drained
3 cups chicken broth, divided
Salt and ground black pepper, to taste
1/4 cup low-fat sour cream
1/4 cup prepared salsa

Directions:
Heat oil in a soup pot over low heat while chopping the vegetables. Increase heat to medium-high and stir in onion and green pepper. Saute until tender; about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cumin and saute until fragrant; about 1 minute.
Stir in beans and 2 1/2 cups chicken broth. Season with salt and pepper and simmer for 15 minutes.
Pour black bean mixture into a blender. Making sure to remove canister cap for steam to escape, puree until smooth; about 30 seconds.
Return soup to pot, stir in remaining broth and heat through. Ladle a portion of soup into each bowl. Garnish with sour cream and salsa and serve.
