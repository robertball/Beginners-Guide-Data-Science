Ingredients:
1 1/4 cup warm water
1 Tbs honey
1 Tbs sugar
2 tsp. dry active yeast
3 1/4 cup flour
1 tsp. salt

Directions:
In a medium bowl, dissolve sugar and honey into warm water.  Sprinkle yeast over and let sit until yeast bubbles(approx. 3 minutes).  Add flour and salt.  When all ingredients are well combined, turn onto floured surface and knead for approximately five minutes(until springy and firm).  Let sit on warm surface for half hour.  Roll out onto a baking stone or baking sheet.  and add toppings!!!  Bake at 375* until golden brown.  Should turn out wonderfully puffy and light.  Sometimes, I like to braid rolled out pizza dough and bake smothered in mozzerella cheese as breadsticks.  That's a family favorite!

Description: 
This is a recipe that you can't keep to yourself.  The dough is as good as any pizzaria, except fat free!!!  Plus, it takes about half the time of other pizza dough recipes.  I have shared it with MANY friends and it has always become an instant addition to their family meals as well.  It's a great way to eat healthier, and to spread a small grocery budget thinner.
