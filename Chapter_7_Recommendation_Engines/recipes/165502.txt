Ingredients:
3/4 cup orzo pasta
1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons melted butter
1/2 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed
1/2 cup frozen green peas, thawed
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the orzo pasta, and cook until al dente, 6 to 7 minutes; drain.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, and season with onion powder, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until the mushrooms have softened and released their liquid, about 5 minutes. Stir in the butter, corn, peas, parsley, and cooked orzo pasta. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.
