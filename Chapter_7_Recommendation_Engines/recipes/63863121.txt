Ingredients:
Cake:
2-1//4 C cake flour (or 2 C all purpose flour plus 1/4 C cornstarch, triple sifted)
1-1/2 t cinnamon
1 t ground nutmeg
1 t ground ginger
1/2 t ground cloves
1/2 t allspice
1 t salt
1 T baking powder
1/2 t baking soda
3/4 C sugar (turbinado or organic cane sugar)
1/2 C dark brown sugar
1/2 C olive oil
2 eggs (room temperature)
3/4 C milk (can be low fat)
1/4 C yogurt or sour cream
1 t vanilla
1 15 oz. can pumpkin puree
Frosting:
3/4 C milk (can be low fat or skim)
4 T flour
1/2 C granulated sugar (turbinado or organic cane sugar)
1/2 C dark brown sugar
1/4 t salt
3/4 C room temperature unsalted butter
8 oz. package cream cheese
1 t vanilla
2 T good bourbon

Directions:
For the cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees and prep muffin tins with cupcake liners.  Blend the sugars and oil well.  Add the remaining wet ingredients and blend well.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet in three installments, mixing just until well blended (but don't over mix!).  Spoon a scant 1/3 C batter into the pans (about 2/3 full) and bake for 20-22 minutes (or until centers spring back to the touch).  Yield:  24 cupcakes
For the Frosting:  Pour 1/3 of the milk into a small saucepan and add the flour.  Whisk vigorously until well blended with no lumps.  Add the remaining milk and stir well.  Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until a thick paste forms.  If you get any lumps, pass the mixture through a sieve.  Add this mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment.  Add the sugars and beat until the mixture cools and all the sugar is melted / incorporated.  Add the flavorings.  Add the butter and cream cheese alternately - a couple tablespoons at a time - until it is all incorporated.  Continue beating until the frosting is super silky and light. This is a soft frosting.  It will stiffen up if refrigerated for a bit before using.  I use a pastry bag or a plastic food storage bag with a corner clipped off to add one neat dollop to each cake.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe for a Thanksgiving potluck.  I took inspiration from a number of different recipes online and made my own alterations and additions.  The frosting is entirely my own take and I have yet to see it anywhere else.  The cupcakes received enthusiastic raves...and what wasn't devoured at dinner went home with all of the party goers.
