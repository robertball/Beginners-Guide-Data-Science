1 pound ground beef
1 (10.5 ounce) can Campbell's® Condensed French Onion Soup
3 slices cheese, cut into quarters (squares)
1 (15 ounce) package Pepperidge Farms® Mini Sandwich Buns (White or Wheat)

Shape the beef into 12 (2 1/2-inch) mini burgers.
Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the burgers and cook until well browned on both sides. Remove the burgers from the skillet. Pour off any fat.
Stir the soup in the skillet and heat to a boil. Return the burgers to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook until the burgers are cooked through. Top the burgers with the cheese and cook until the cheese is melted. Just before serving, place the burgers on the buns and top each with 1 tablespoon soup mixture.
