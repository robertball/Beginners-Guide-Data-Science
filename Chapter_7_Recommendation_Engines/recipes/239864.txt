Description: 
After deciding against buying a springform pan, but wanting cheesecake for Thanksgiving, I combined a few recipes to get this final product. It got great reviews from all the family! These cupcakes really should be made the day before, as well as the frosting. I store mine in tupperware in the fridge so they set up nicely.
