Ingredients:
Ingredients:
•1 (8-ounce) cream cheese, softened
•12 ounces (3 sticks) butter, softened
•3 cups all-purpose flour
•2 (14-ounce) cans fillings of choice (apricot, prune, raspberry, etc.)
•Confectioners' sugar

Directions:
1.Mix cream cheese and butter until light and fluffy. Add flour 1 cup at a time and mix well. Divide dough into 3-4 sections.  Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate for 24 hours.
2.Heat oven to 350 degrees. Roll out dough 1/4-inch on a surface that has been dusted with equal parts confectioners' and granulated sugars (not flour), because the granulated sugar will act as ball bearings and help keep the dough from sticking (will also add sweetness to cookie). Cut into 2-inch squares. Place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon filling on center of each square. Overlap opposite corners of dough to the center over filling.
3.Bake for 10-15 minutes or when corners start to brown. Cool and dust with confectioners’ sugar.
Note: Cookies tend to become soggy if held for several days, so store them tightly covered (or freeze) without the confectioners' sugar. Dust with confectioners' sugar just prior to service.
