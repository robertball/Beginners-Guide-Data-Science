Ingredients:
1 Box - Duncan Hines Pineapple Supreme Cake Mix (or a different flavor cake mix if desired)
1 (20oz.) Can - Crushed Pineapple (undrained)
1 Cup - Packed Brown Sugar
1/2 Cup - Butter or Margarine (melted)
1 Package - Vanilla Instant Pudding

Directions:
Prepare cake in a 13x9 inch pan as directed on cake's package and let cake slightly cool for a few minutes.
While cake is slightly cooling, stir together melted butter and brown sugar, then mix in undrained pineapples.
Poke holes (I use the round end of a wooden spoon) into cake staggered about an inch apart and pour pineapple mixture on top on cake, filling in holes.
Prepare instant pudding as directed on the package and pour on top of pineapple mixture.  It will look like the pudding will overflow out of the pan, but mine always just comes right to the top.
Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
