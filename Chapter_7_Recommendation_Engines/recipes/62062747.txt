Ingredients:
1/2 lb large shrimp: peeled and de-
veined
6 oz bay scallops
6 oz shredded crab meat (I use canned but only lump)
2,1/2 cups tomatillo sauce (green enchilada sauce)
2 tsp vegetable oil
1 pack 6 inch corn tortillas
sour cream to taste
1/2 cup part skim mozzarella or mont. jack cheese
chopped fresh cilantro to taste (1tbsp)
toothpicks if you wish

Directions:
Preheat oven 350F
Mince garlic and cook in oil for 1 minute.  Add shrimp and scallops. Saute for 3 minutes - until shrimp are pink and scallops are done
Add 1/2 of tomatillo sauce, cilantro and all of crab meat.  Remove from heat and set aside.
Soften tortillas by putting them in damp paper towels and heating them in the microwave for 20 seconds or until soft.  Spread remaining tomatillo sauce into a casserole pan (7x13).   Fill each tortilla with the seafood mixture and set inside pan with the seam up.  Secure with a toothpick if you wish. Sprinkle 1/2 of the cheese over the enchiladas.  Pour the remaining tomatillo sauce over the enchiladas and follow with the remaining cheese.  Add sour cream on top to taste.  Bake for 20-25 minutes or until bubbly and tortilla edges start to crisp.

Description: 
These casserole-style enchiladas are pretty simple and can be pretty low in fat if you skip sour cream and use lowfat cheese.  This takes longer to prepare if you peel shrimp yourself.  I have also added shredded cooked chicken thighs in the past to use up leftovers.  Depending on the sauce, I also add diced jalapeos and ground cumin for spice.
