Ingredients:
2 slices bacon, chopped
1 cup peeled and cubed potatoes
1/3 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped assorted mushrooms
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 cup milk
1 sprig fresh thyme
1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
salt and coarsely ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Fry bacon in a stockpot over medium heat until it is semi-crispy, about 5 minutes. Stir in potatoes and onion and cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in mushrooms, garlic powder, and onion powder; cook and stir until mushrooms have softened, about 5 minutes more.
Pour water and milk over mushroom mixture, add thyme and flour, and bring to a boil. Boil until potatoes are very soft, adding water as needed, about 20 minutes. Crush some of the potatoes with a wooden spoon to reach a creamier consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
