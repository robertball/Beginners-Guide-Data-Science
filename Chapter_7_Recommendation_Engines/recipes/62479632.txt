Ingredients:
3/4 of a 1 1/2-lb loaf white bread, such as Orowheat Country White, cubed and set out to dry several hours
2 packages of sausages, such as Farmer John links, cooked, chopped
1 Granny Smith apple, grated or minced
1 stalk celery, cut into thin slices
1/2 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon ground sage
1 teaspoon rubbed sage leaves
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried oregano
Celery salt and ground pepper, to taste
1 egg, slightly beaten
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Mix the first ten ingredients in a large bowl.
Season with celery salt and ground pepper to taste.
Pour the egg and water over the mixture and mix gently but thoroughly.
Stuff the mixture into the neck and body cavity of a washed and dried turkey, securing those openings with either a skewer or basting thread.
When the turkey has been cooked and rested for up to half an hour, remove all dressing from the turkey and place into a bowl for serving.
If cooking the dressing separately from the turkey, place it into a oven-friendly bowl and pour some broth or turkey-related liquid over the dressing; cover the bowl and bake for 45 minutes in a 325 degree oven.

Description: 
Our Thanksgiving turkey would not be complete without this delicious moist dressing made by my late father-in-law.  We always double the dressing, using as much as we can to stuff inside the turkey (never had a problem) and the rest baked in a separate dish.  If you choose to bake separately from the turkey, be sure to use a little of your turkey broth made from the neck, gizzard, heart, and some onions and celery.  There never seems to be enough leftovers to send home!
