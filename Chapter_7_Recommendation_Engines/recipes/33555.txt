Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) loaf round rye bread
1 cup sour cream
1 cup mayonnaise
1 (4 ounce) jar dried chipped beef, chopped
1 teaspoon Beau Monde â„¢ seasoning
2 teaspoons celery salt
3 tablespoons dried dill weed

Directions:
Using a bread knife, remove the 'crown' of the bread. Hollow out the inside of the loaf, and cut into bite size cubes for dipping.
In a medium bowl, blend sour cream, mayonnaise, chipped beef, Beau Monde seasoning, celery salt, and dill weed. Mix thoroughly, cover, and chill for at least 1 hour.
Spoon the chilled dip into the hollow bread loaf, and serve with cubed bread for dipping.
