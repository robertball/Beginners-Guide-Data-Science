Once both cheeses are incorporated, add all other ingredients and mix well.
Add to an air tight container and refrigerate overnight or at least an hour to let the flavours meld. Before eating, leave at room temp. for half an hour to soften, or microwave until barely soft. Serve it with crispy crackers, toast or bagels.

Description: 
Attention cheese lovers!!! This may be the best cheese spread you've ever had! It's tastes just like a Welsh Rarebit, but easier and quicker! We always make it around the Christmas holidays, or for Football and Hockey game nights. Everyone begs for this recipe! Turn this into a pub spread by adding a half cup of your favorite dark ale. Use brick cream cheese for a spread, or spreadable cream cheese for a dip.
