Ingredients:
3 cups baking mix
1 tablespoon sugar
3/4 cup shortening
3/4 cup milk
Filling:
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 cup brown sugar
4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3/4 cup chopped pecans
Frosting:
4 oz. cream cheese, softened
1/8 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon milk

Directions:
Place baking mix & sugar in a large bowl and work in shortening with a pastry cutter. Add the milk.
Knead the dough lightly, adding extra flour if needed to keep from sticking, or  extra milk if it’s too dry. (You don’t want a really wet dough).
On a floured surface, roll dough into a rectangle approximately 14" x 9".
Brush dough with melted butter. Combine brown sugar & cinnamon..Spread over the buttered dough, taking care to get right up to the edges.
Cut dough into long strips about 1 1/2 inches to 2 inches wide. Roll up each strip of dough and seal the seams. Place in lightly greased iron skillet or medium pan.
Bake in preheated 450 degree oven for 20 - 25 minutes. While rolls bake, stir together cream cheese, softened butter, confectioners' sugar, vanilla and milk. Remove rolls from oven and top with frosting.
