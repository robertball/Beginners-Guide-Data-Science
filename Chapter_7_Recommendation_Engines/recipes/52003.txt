¼ cup olive oil
¼ cup lemon juice
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
⅛ teaspoon pepper
1  boneless, skinless chicken breast, cubed
1  pocket bread round, cut in half
1 small onion, sliced
1  tomato, sliced
½ cup plain yogurt

Directions:
Combine the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, oregano, garlic powder, and pepper in a large resealable bag.  Add chicken cubes, mix well, and allow to marinate in the refrigerator 3 hours or overnight.
Pour the chicken and marinade into a frying pan over medium-high heat.  Cook until the chicken is no longer pink.  Stuff each half of the pocket bread with chicken, onion, tomato, and yogurt; serve while still hot.

Description: 
This is a very tasty and extremely simple sandwich.  You do need to marinate the chicken at least 3 hours. I usually do it overnight.
