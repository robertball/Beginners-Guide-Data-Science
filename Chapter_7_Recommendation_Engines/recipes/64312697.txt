Ingredients:
1 medium head cauliflower, broken into small florets
2 tablespoons flour
2 eggs
1/2 cup milk
3/4 cup seasoned breadcrumbs
For sauce:
1/4 c light mayo
1/4 c plain fat free greek yogurt
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish or to taste
1/4 lemon juiced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Spray a rimmed baking sheet with non stick spray. Whisk the eggs and milk together in a medium bowl. Put the flower and the breadcrumbs in separate gallon sized zip top bags.  First shake the cauliflower florets in the flour. Pour them into the milk egg mixture.  With a slotted spoon remove them quickly and put into the breadcrumb bag and seal and shake.  Pour the breaded florets onto the prepared pan, spray the tops with non stick spray or an olive oil mister and bake for 30 minutes turning once.
While the cauliflower is baking, make sauce.  Mix all ingredients in a bowl and season with salt and pepper as desired.

Description: 
I was looking for a healthy alternative to serve as an appetizer on pizza night.  This took the place of greasy cheese sticks or fried wings, typical dishes to pair with pizza.  The added bonus is that this is low in fat and delicious! My family gobbled them up, and I'm sure yours will too!
