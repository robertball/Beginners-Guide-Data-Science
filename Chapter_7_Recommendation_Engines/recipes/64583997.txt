Ingredients:
Bulbs of green garlic
Olive oil
Sea salt, to taste

Directions:
Slice off tops of garlic bulbs and place up to 3 bulbs to a large sheet of aluminum foil. Lightly drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt & pepper, if you like. Wrap up all tightly inside the foil and put inside a hot gas grill on the top rack away from flames until cloves are butter-soft, about 30 minutes.  Squeeze out the garlic and mix with a fork until spreadable. Spread warm garlic on toasted bread or crackers with cheese, mix into mashed potatoes, salad dressings or sauces, or use it in a baba ganoush.
Cook Tip: You can also roast garlic in the foil packet in a toaster oven or a 350F oven for 45-60 minutes.

Description: 
Green garlic has a brief spring window for you to enjoy, so caramelizing it on a grill allows you to make the most of its mellow flavors!
