Ingredients:
8 oz. elbow macaroni
1/4 C. butter (1/2 stick)
1/2 onion, diced finely
1/4 C. flour
1/2 t. salt
1/4 t. black pepper
1/2 t. granulated garlic, or garlic powder
2-3 C. milk
8 oz. extra sharp cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 375.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Cook pasta according to package directions until al dente (just a tiny bit tough)
Melt butter in a medium sauce pan.  Add onions and saute until onions are translucent - about 5 min.  Add salt, pepper and garlic powder. (it might sound gross, but the garlic really is necessary!) Add flour and whisk together.  Cook, whisking occasionally, until butter mixture is beginning to turn brown - about 5 min.
Add 1 C. of milk, and whisk until very thick and all lumps are gone.  Continue to add milk until it is the consistancy of pudding.
Over low heat, add cheese, and stir until melted.  It is very important to use EXTRA sharp cheddar - that's where the incredible taste comes from - even regular sharp won't do it.
The cheese sauce should be a little thin, so add more milk if necessary.  Adjust seasonings to taste. Add pasta to sauce and stir well.
Pour into an 8x8 pan and bake for about 30 min or until top browns and the edges bubble.
