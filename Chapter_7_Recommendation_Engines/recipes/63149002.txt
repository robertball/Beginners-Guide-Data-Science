Ingredients:
4 chicken breasts
2 slices whole wheat bread
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan Cheese
salt & pepper for seasoning
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon flour

Directions:
Dice your chicken breasts into bite size pieces, preferably the size of a tablespoon. Toast your two slices of bread and grind them in the blender until they become bread crumbs. In a mixing bowl add bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper and flour. Mix ingredients together. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper(easy clean up). Grab a few pieces at a time and toss them in the mix just enough to get them covered in bread crumbs. Place them on the cookie sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes at 425 degrees.
