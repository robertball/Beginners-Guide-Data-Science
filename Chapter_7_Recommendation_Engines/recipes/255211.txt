Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package elbow macaroni
2 cups frozen mixed vegetables
1 tablespoon coconut oil, or more to taste
1 pinch garlic powder
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add elbow macaroni; cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add frozen vegetables; cook and stir until tender yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain into a bowl.
Place coconut oil in the warm pot. Add macaroni mixture, garlic powder, sea salt, and pepper; toss until combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Top with Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This is a twist on pasta tossed in olive oil. It's a quick, easy, and healthy meal that even kids will eat without a fuss. It's really just a jumping-off point; you can add in whatever herbs and spices suit your tastes. This is my toddler's favorite dish, and I have to admit, I love it, too!
