Ingredients:
1 pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
2 1/2 cups pitted sour cherries
3/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon butter
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry.
Mix the sugar, flour, and salt; toss with the cherries, mixing well. Pour the cherry filling into the pie shell, and dot with butter.
Weave strips of pastry into a lattice top. Place the pie on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown, about 40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
