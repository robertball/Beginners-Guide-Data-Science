Heat oil, butter or marg in a frying pan. add mushrooms, peppers, or what ever you choose, and saute for approx. 1 minute. Add beaten eggs and scramble. in the meantime, sprinkle half of the tortilla with your favourite cheese and microwave  on a paper towel for 20 sec. lay the scrambled eggs on the warm tortilla on the bare (no cheese) half. Top with salsa, if using. Fold over once, then fold in one end and continue rolling as tight as possible, to the end. the cheese also acts as glue to keep it from falling apart! Enjoy
