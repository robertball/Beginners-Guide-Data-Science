Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package seashell pasta
8 slices bacon
1 cup creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle WhipÂ®)
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 red onion, finely diced
1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, rinsed and drained
4 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
1/2 cup sliced black olives
1/2 cup diced sharp Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook shell pasta at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels; crumble.
Whisk creamy salad dressing, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, garlic, Dijon mustard, and oregano together in a bowl to make a creamy dressing.
Mix pasta, bacon, red onion, water chestnuts, eggs, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, celery, olives, Cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese together in a large bowl. Add dressing and stir to coat. Chill in refrigerator at least 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
I created this salad because I wanted something with a little kick and a lot of texture and taste. This is a recipe you can tweak to make it your own. It keeps well in fridge and is best served cold as a side dish. You can add diced ham or even a can of chunky tuna to make a complete meal.
