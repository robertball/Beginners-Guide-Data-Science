Ingredients:
1lb ground turkey, chicken, or very lean ground beef
1 16oz can refried beans
1 14oz can peas, drained
2 small (12oz) bottles enchilada sauce (I use Pace)
1 6oz(?) can chopped olives
Shredded cheese of your choice
6 10in. tortillas
Picante or hot sauce, or other appropriate ingredients
sour cream

Directions:
1. In large skillet, brown meat, do not drain (this is why it is important that it is lean)
2. Blend in refried beans and peas.  If you have a picky eater, fill number of shells appropriate for that individual, adding shredded cheese as desired.
3. Blend in enchilada Sauce and olives.
4. Pour a thin layer of enchilada sauce into bottom of a 12x12 baking dish.
5. Place 1/2 cup of mixture in center of tortilla, sprinkle with shredded cheese as desired.  Roll up, tucking or not tucking ends as desired.
6. Place enchilada in dish, sprinkle with cheese as desired.  If you want extra heat in some enchiladas, add Picante or other hot sauce to appropriate number of shells.  Repeat steps 5 & 6 until mixture is used up.
7. When baking dish is full, pour enchilada sauce over all (except for picky eater ones, if necessary). Bake
at 350 degrees until heated through.
You can also bake for 10 min at before topping with sauce to
crisp shells.
8. Remove from oven, sprinkle with shredded cheese as desired and bake until cheese is melted and sauce bubbly.

My first recipe.  I put it together when I couldn't find a simple, tasty enchilada recipe that I could moderate for my picky 4yo AND my spice loving husband.
