Ingredients:
2 tablespoons shortening
1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces
¾ cup instant rice, uncooked
1  chopped green bell pepper (optional)
2 cups water
⅛ cup chicken rice soup mix

Directions:
Melt the shortening in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute the chicken sections in the shortening for 2 minutes per side, or until browned. Remove chicken and set aside.
Add the rice and green bell pepper, if desired, and saute for 3 minutes, or until slightly browned. Add the soup mix and water and stir together well. Bring this to a boil, then add the chicken, reduce heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is very easy to make, with ingredients that you might usually have on hand. It gets its flavor from dry soup mix. Try it with some fresh, steamed vegetables.
