Ingredients:
3 lbs pork, 1 lb of ground beef or pot roast, equal part peeled potatoes, 1 onion, mustard, ketchup, vinegar, salt, pepper, worchester sauce, tabasco, a great mustard based bbq sauce.
Boil pork and beef until they fall apart. Save 1/2 of the renderings/broth. In a separate pot, boil your potatoes and a very very finely minced onion. Run meat and potato/onion mixture through a meat grinder together. Place ground mixture in the broth, add in some vinegar, salt, pepper, tabasco, garlic powder mustard, ketchup and mustard based bbq sauce to taste. Let simmer at a low temp for another hour or two. Serve over white rice.

Description: 
The hash recipe is alleged to be similar to Dukes BBQ in Orangeburg, South Carolina. It's absolutely the best. I have not made it yet, but look forward to trying it over a nice bed of white rice.
