Ingredients:
3 cups self-rising flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon salt
3 eggs
1 2/3 cups white sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup melted butter
1/2 cup honey
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
3 cups grated unpeeled zucchini
1 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans. Stir together the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a bowl until blended. Set aside.
Whisk eggs, sugar, oil, butter, honey, and vanilla together in a large bowl. Stir in zucchini, walnuts, and coconut. Add the flour mixture and stir until well combined. Divide the batter between the prepared loaf pans.
Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool completely. Store loaves overnight in plastic bags for best flavor.
