Ingredients:
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
grated zest of 2 large lemons
juice of 1 lemon
2 eggs
1 cup sour cream or plain yogurt
1 cup whole milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 1 inch cubes
3 tablespoons poppy seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375F. Generously utter or spray the tops and cups of a 12 cup muffin pan.
Combine the sugar and lemon zest in a small bowl.
In a medium bowl, combine the lemon juice, eggs, sour cream (or yogurt) milk, and vanilla. Whisk until blended.
Sift the flour, baking soda and baking powder together into a large bowl. Add the salt and lemon sugar to the dry ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon until combined.
Add the butter and cut in with a pastry cutter or 2 dinner knives until it is the size of small peas. Mix in the poppy seeds. Make a well in the center and pour in the wet ingredients. With a few strokes of the spoon, gently combine, taking care not to overmix the batter.
With an ice cream coop or a large soup spoon, fill the prepared muffin cups until the batter just peeks over the top of the pan. Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 24-30 minutes or until the muffins are light golden brown, firm and springy. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Unmold muffins and allow to cool on a wire rack.
