Directions:
Cut the tomatillos down the middle, and place cut side down on a baking sheet.  Broil for 5 minutes or until the skins are slightly charred.

Description: 
Broiling the tomatillos gives this salsa a subtly smoky taste.  If you are sensitive to spicy food, remove the seeds from the peppers. This salsa is perfect as both a dip for taco chips and to top enchiladas suizas.
