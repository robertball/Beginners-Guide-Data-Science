Ingredients:
2 quarts chicken broth
2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1.5 pounds boneless, skinless chicken, cooked and shredded
2/3 cup diced onion
4 whole tomatoes, diced
3 teaspoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons minced cilantro
1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder
3 teaspoons ground cumin
3 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3 teaspoons Tabasco sauce
GARNISHES
8 ounces shredded cheddar cheese
1 cup sour cream
2 whole avocados, peeled and diced
2 whole limes, cut into 8 wedges

Directions:
Throw everything except garnishes in the crockpot an dlet it cook on high 5-6 hours.
Dress with garnishes and give it a squeeze of lime (a must!) and you're good to go.
If you are not using a crockpot, saute the garlic and onion in 2 tablespoons oil before adding the remaining ingredients.  Simmer for at least an hour to allow flavors to blend.
