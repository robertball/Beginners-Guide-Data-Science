Ingredients:
1 garlic clove, minced
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (5 pound) boneless beef rump roast
3 tablespoons cider vinegar
1/2 cup tomato juice
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
8 medium carrots, cut into thirds
1/2 pound small whole onions
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup cold water
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a Dutch oven over medium heat, saute garlic in oil for 1 minute. Add the roast; brown on all sides.
In a large bowl, combine vinegar, tomato juice, ketchup, sugar, salt and pepper; pour over roast. Cover and simmer for 2 hours. Add carrots and onions; cover and cook for 1 hour longer or until meat and vegetables are tender. Remove to a serving platter and keep warm.
Skim fat from pan juices. Add water to juices to measure 3 cups. Mix flour and cold water until smooth; stir into pan juices. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Slice roast; serve with vegetables and gravy.
