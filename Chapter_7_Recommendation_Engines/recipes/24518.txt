Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
2 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 (9 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
5 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3 cups confectioners' sugar
1/3 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture with the cake mix, salt and vanilla; stir well to combine. Stir in the  flour; beat well. Cover bowl and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
Deflate dough and turn it out onto a well floured surface. Roll dough out into a rectangle and spread with butter. Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Roll up dough and cut into 3/4 inch thick rolls. Place rolls in two lightly greased 9x13 inch baking pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake rolls in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes. While rolls are baking, prepare the frosting. In a medium bowl, stir together confectioners' sugar, 1/3 cup butter, vanilla and milk. Let rolls cool slightly then spread with frosting.

Description: 
My husband was the inspiration for this recipe.  These rolls are extremely tasty and are not heavy.  The secret to this recipe lies in the frosting.  As they say the easiest way to a man's heart is through his stomach!
