Ingredients:
1 large English cucumber - halved, seeded, and chopped
2 red bell peppers, seeded and chopped
1/2 cup chopped red onion
2 stalks celery, chopped
5 plum tomatoes, quartered and seeded
2 cloves garlic, or more to taste
3 cups low-sodium tomato juice
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste (optional)

Directions:
Place cucumber in a food processor; pulse 5 to 6 times to chop into very small pieces. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with red bell peppers, red onion, and celery, pulsing each into very small pieces in the food processor and transferring to the bowl.
Combine plum tomatoes and garlic in the food processor; pulse until finely diced. Pour over cucumber mixture in the bowl.
Pour tomato juice, white wine vinegar, and olive oil over tomato and cucumber mixture in the bowl. Add sea salt, black pepper, basil, parsley, and red pepper flakes; stir well.
Chill until flavors combine and deepen, about 2 hours.

Description: 
My husband requested a gazpacho and it was great to use what I had just picked from my friends' garden. We just love living at the lake during the summer and our friends came over to enjoy this with us. The longer you let it sit in the refrigerator, the better.
