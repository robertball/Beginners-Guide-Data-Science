Description: 
Haupia is a traditional coconut milk based Hawaiian dessert often found at luaus and other local gatherings in Hawaii.  Since World War II, it has become popular as a topping for white cake, especially at weddings.  Although technically considered a pudding, the consistency of haupia closely approximates gelatin dessert and is usually served in blocks like gelatin.
