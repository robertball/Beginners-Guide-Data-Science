1 lb ground beef
2 tbsp margarine
1/2 cup mushrooms, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 small onion, chopped
2 cups beef bullion
1/3 cup flour
1/2 tsp pepper
2 pie crusts (frozen, or home-made)

Directions:
Brown ground beef over medium-high heat. Drain & set aside.
Melt margarine in saucepan. Add mushrooms, garlic, and onion. Saute on medium heat until onion is clear.
Add beef bullion to saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook for 10 minutes.
Mix together flour and pepper. Pour tiny bits of water into flour while stirring with a fork until it reaches a batter consistency. Add to saucepan. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
Pour saucepan ingredients into pan with ground beef. Stir.
Pour all ingredients into one pie shell. Cover with second pie shell, sealing edges. Poke holes for steam to escape. Cook for 30 minutes at 400C or as your crust directions suggest.
