Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups golden raisins
1 1/4 cups raisins
1/2 cup whiskey
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 pound light brown sugar
3 eggs
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 cups chopped walnuts
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans
1 pound red and green candied cherries, halved

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare cookie sheets by lining with parchment paper.  In a medium bowl, toss together the golden raisins and dark raisins with the whiskey; set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and butter. Add the eggs one at a time, mix until light and fluffy. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg; stir into the creamed mixture. Stir in the walnuts, pecans, cherries, and finally, the raisin and whiskey mixture.
Drop cookies by rounded tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to cool on wire racks.
