Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/4 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 pound snow peas
1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained
1/4 pound sliced bok choy
salt and black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
3/4 cup skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - thinly sliced
1 teaspoon white wine
1/4 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in the mushrooms, snow peas, water chestnuts, and bok choy; season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until the vegetables are just tender, about 5 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the wok and wipe the wok clean.
Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in the wok. Stir in the garlic and ginger; cook a few seconds until the garlic begins to turn golden brown. Stir in the chicken and cook until the chicken is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Add the wine, sugar, and chicken broth; bring to a boil. Dissolve the cornstarch in the water and stir into the simmering sauce. Once the sauce returns to a simmer, stir until thick and clear, about 30 seconds. Return the vegetables to the wok and toss until hot and coated with the sauce.

Description: 
While you may see this dish frequently at American Chinese restaurants, it is actually a true Cantonese dish. This is the Americanized version that will duplicate what you're used to eating for take-out. You can substitute sherry and soy sauce for the white wine to make a version with brown sauce.
