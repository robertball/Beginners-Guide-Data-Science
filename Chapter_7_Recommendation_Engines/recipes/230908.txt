Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
3 cloves garlic, sliced
1 (16 ounce) loaf French bread, halved lengthwise

Directions:
Melt butter in a small saucepan; simmer garlic slices in hot butter over low heat until butter turns foamy, about 5 minutes.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Place bread loaf halves under the preheated broiler to toast, 2 to 4 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning.
Slice toasted bread into 2-inch thick slices. Dip toasted side of each slice into garlic butter.
