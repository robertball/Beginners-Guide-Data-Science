Ingredients:
8 cups cubed French bread (1 inch cubes)
2 medium tart apples, peeled and chopped
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened

1/4 cup sugar
1 3/4 cups milk, divided
2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided
1/2 cup English toffee bits or almond brickle chips

Directions:
Place half of the bread cubes in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; top with apples. In a mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugars, 1/4 cup milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla until smooth; stir in toffee bits. Spread over apples. Top with remaining bread cubes. In another mixing bowl, beat the eggs and remaining milk and vanilla; pour over bread. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 35-45 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
