Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 medium onion, chopped
2 medium boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 large carrots, chopped
2 stalks celery, sliced
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
2 cups chicken broth, or more as needed
2 ounces dried egg noodles

Directions:
Spray a skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Add chicken to skillet and cook, stirring frequently, about 4 minutes. Add onion and cook until chicken is browned and onion is slightly translucent, about 3 more minutes. Transfer to the slow cooker.
Add carrots, celery, bell pepper, thyme, and pepper to the slow cooker; mix to combine. Stir in diced tomatoes and enough chicken broth so vegetables are just covered with liquid.
Cover and cook on Low for 7 hours.
While the soup is cooking, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
When soup has finished cooking, stir in cooked egg noodles. Cover and cook until noodles are warm and tender, about 5 minutes.
