2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup cubed fully cooked ham
2 cups water
2 cups cubed red potatoes
1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen corn

In a large saucepan, saute the onion, red pepper and garlic in oil until onion is tender. Add ham; cook and stir for 2 minutes.

Description: 
With lots of chicken and ham, this lightened-up corn chowder has become a favorite at my house, relates Janet Boote of Hull, Iowa. I like to use my own frozen sweet corn when it's available.
