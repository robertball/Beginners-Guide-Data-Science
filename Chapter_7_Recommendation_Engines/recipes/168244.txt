Ingredients:
1 pound bulk pork sausage
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent rolls

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the bottom of a 9x11 inch baking dish.
Cook the sausage in a skillet over medium heat until crumbly and beginning to brown; drain. Stir the cream cheese into the cooked sausage.
Roll the dough from one can of crescent rolls into the bottom of the prepared baking dish without separating. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Spread the sausage mixture over the baked crescent rolls; top the sausage mixture with the remaining can of rolls. Return to oven and bake until the top layer is golden brown, about 8 minutes.
