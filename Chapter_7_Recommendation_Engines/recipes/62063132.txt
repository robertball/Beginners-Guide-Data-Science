Ingredients:
1/2 pound raw shrimp shelled and deveined
1 lb chicken cut into strips
1 pkg chinese noodles or thin spaghetti
6 cloves garlic, sliced thin and roasted
1 pkg bean sprouts
Extra large can chicken broth
1 cup flour
salt
pepper
chili powder
corriander
1 cup chopped peanuts
1/4 cup peanut oil
1/4 cup fish sauce

Directions:
Thinly slice garlic and coat a small pan with cooking spray, roast in oven 200 for about 20 minutes, until golden
Cook Chicken, set aside
Add 2 teaspoons each of salt and pepper to flour.
After rinsing shrimp, dredge in flour and add to hot oil until golden.
These are'nt meant to be heavily deep fried, set aside.
Pour broth in large pot, if it isn't enough to cook a whole pkg of your desired pasta add water and boil.
Cook pasta in broth according to pkg directions during the last 5 minutes of boiling pasta, drop in cleaned and rinsed bean sprouts.
I don't drain this I turn off the heat and work from the pot, but you could drain it just reserve a couple cups of the broth, to add to the noodles when thier in the dish, it isnt a sauce just liquid to keep them from drying.
With slotted spoon transfer noodles and sprouts to a serving dish, letting some liquid drip off, top with chicken,garlic.
Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon each corriander and chili powder and fish sauce.
Toss together and top with shrimp and peanuts.
