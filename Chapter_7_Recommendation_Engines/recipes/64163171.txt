3 cloves garlic, chopped
3/4 cup quinoa
1 1/2 cups vegetable broth
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup frozen corn kernels
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Mix quinoa into onion mixture and cover with vegetable broth; season with cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until quinoa is tender and broth is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Stir frozen corn into the saucepan, and continue to simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes; mix in the black beans.
