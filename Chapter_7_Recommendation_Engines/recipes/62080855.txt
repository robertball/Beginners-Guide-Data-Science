Description: 
I made this recipe up after Thanksgiving using whatever I had in the fridge and freezer. It turned out delicious. You could also freeze this to make later, or prepare the day ahead . This recipe can be flexible - make it without meat for a side dish (omit one can of soup if you do side dish), combine ham and turkey, or use just turkey or ham. Surprisingly very kid friendly, too.
