Ingredients:
1 tablespoon oil
2 chicken breasts cut into chunks
Frozen veggies like peas, carrots, potatoes, green beans
Creamed corn
2 cans chicken broth
1 can cream of chicken
biscuits (canned or homemade)
2 teaspoons minced onion
Chipotle chili pepper
Salt
Pepper

Directions:
Pour oil into Dutch oven and cook the chunks of chicken until no longer pink. Pour in the chicken broth, cream of chicken and creamed corn. Heat to a simmer then add frozen veggies. Add in the minced onion, Chipotle chili pepper, salt, and pepper to taste.
Simmer till veggies are cooked through.
Meanwhile, separate biscuits and cut each in half.
Place biscuits carefully onto the surface of the soup.
Cook uncovered for 10-15 minutes at a steady simmer.
Place lid onto the Dutch oven and cook about 15-20 minutes more.
If you like your dumplings a little golden, turn the broiler on for a couple minutes, but watch closely so as not to burn!
