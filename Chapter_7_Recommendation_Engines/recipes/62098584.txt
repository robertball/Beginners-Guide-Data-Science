Ingredients:
1 bagel, cut in half
1 egg
2 tablespoons cream cheese or Neufchatel cheese, using more or less to taste

Directions:
Spray a frying pan with non-stick spray and heat over medium heat.
Crack the egg into the pan and let it cook until it's set enough to flip over.
To flip the egg, slide the spatula under the edge of the egg and tilt the pan towards the spatula so the egg slides onto the spatula, and while the pan is still tilted, turn the egg over.
Let the egg cook until the yolk is set as much as you would like.
While the egg fries, toast the bagel and then spread both sides with cream cheese.
When the egg is done, put it on one side of the bagel and then put the other side of the bagel on top making a sandwich.  Enjoy!

Description: 
Cream cheese and a fried egg on a toasted bagel make for a quick, easy breakfast that's one of our favorites.  It's called a Beggagel because it's an egg on a bagel (bEGGagel)!
