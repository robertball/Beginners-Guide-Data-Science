Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package seashell, mostaccioli or penne pasta
2 1/2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 cups milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
12-16 ounces smoked Gouda cheese, shredded or cubed
1.5-2.0 ounces (or 3-4 cooked pieces) bacon, crumbled

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
Stir in the flour and cook until a roux forms.
Stir in the milk, salt and pepper; cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is smooth and thick and coats the back of a spoon.
Stir in cheese and bacon.  Continue to stir until cheese is fully melted.  This will take a while - be certain to scrape the bottom of the pot to prevent scorching your delicious cheese sauce.
Combine cooked pasta and cheese sauce.  Heat through and serve.
