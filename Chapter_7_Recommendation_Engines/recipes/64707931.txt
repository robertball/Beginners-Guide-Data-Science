Ingredients:
1/4 c. butter
1/3 c. sugar
1 tsp. cinnamon
1 tsp. orange zest
1/2 c. sliced almonds, if desired
1 loaf French, challah, or Italian bread
4 eggs
2/3 c. fresh orange juice

Directions:
Melt butter and mix in sugar, cinnamon, and orange zest.
Spread evenly in jelly roll pan or cookie sheet pan with sides.
Sprinkle with almonds, if desired.
Beat together the eggs and orange juice.
Slice loaf into 1 inch slices.
Dip and soak slices in egg mixture for a few minutes.
Remove slices from egg mixture and place in pan on top of the butter/sugar mixture in jelly roll pan.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
In the morning, preheat oven to 325.Â° F.
Remove plastic wrap and bake for 20 to 30 minutes until a little brown on the sides.
Serve on plates, flipping slices over so brown glazed sides are on top.
Note: Serve with maple syrup, if desired. It's quite sweet as it is.
