Ingredients:
3 large yellow bell peppers
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
1/4-1/2 red onion, chopped
2 TBS garlic, minced
1 pound ground turkey (85/15)
1  cup instant white rice
3 oz can tomato paste
1 15 oz can diced petite tomatoes with juice
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tsp cumin
2 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp chili powder
dash chili pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
Cut bell peppers in halt lengthwise, carefully removing stems. Scoop out seeds. Bring 8 cups salted water to a boil in a large pot and blanch the peppers until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. Drain and cool in cold water. Set aside.
Place 1 cup water to boil. Add 1 cup instant rice, turn off and cover.
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add turkey and cook, crumbling with a wooden spoon, until it loses its pink color, about 5 minutes. Drain the fat.
Mix in rice,  tomatoes, paste and spices.
Spray a casserole dish with Pam. Stuff the peppers with the mixture and place them in  casserole dish.
Bake uncovered until the peppers are tender and the filling is heated through, 25-30 minutes.
Serve with fresh salad.
