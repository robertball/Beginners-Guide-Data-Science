1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/8 teaspoon onion powder

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Lightly oil grill grate, and place about 4 inches from heat source.

Description: 
I tasted these burgers in Athens, Georgia. They were so good that I made my own recipe. It combines fresh basil, Gorgonzola  cheese, and garlic, and it's easy enough for a quick and simple dinner. Serve them on toasted sourdough or ciabatta buns.
