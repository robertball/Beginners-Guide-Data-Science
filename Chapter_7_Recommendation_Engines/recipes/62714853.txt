Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
2 Banana’s (Mashed)
1 tsp baking powder
2 cup’s water
1 eggs
2 Tablespoons Honey
1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease 2 large baking sheets.  (I used my large Pampered chef stoneware bar pans)
In a large bowl, combine together the water, mashed bananas, vanilla, egg and honey.  Add the Flour and baking powder.
Mix together on a medium speed until the ingredients are thoroughly combined.
Turn the dough onto a floured surface and kneed for approximately one minute until its no longer sticky.
Roll out the dough to ¼ inch thickness and cut into mini size shapes with your favorite cookie cutter.  Should make approx 75 bite size cookies.
Bake for 20 minutes at full heat, then turn the oven off and leave the cookies in the oven for a further 30-40 minutes.
Leave cookies in the baking tray for 10 minutes before cooling on a wire rack.
