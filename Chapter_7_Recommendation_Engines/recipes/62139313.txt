Ingredients:
4 pounds yams, peeled and cut into one inch cubes
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
3 Tbsp butter, melted
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp grated nutmeg
2 Tbsp fresh orange juice
3 Tbsp brandy
1 1/2 tsp grated orange zest
1 cup minature marshmellows
1/2 cup pecans, chopped and toasted

Directions:
Place the yams in a four quart electric slow cooker. In a medium bowl, mix together the brown sugar, melted butter, cinnamon, nutmeg and orange juice. Spoon over the yams.
Cover and cook on the low heat setting 5 1/2 to 6 hours, stirring once. If possible, until yams are tender.
Stir in the brandy and orange zest. Sprinkle the marshmellows and pecans over the top. Cover and cook five minutes longer, or until the marshmallows are melted. Serve immediately.
