Ingredients:
3 T regular oats (not instant)
3 T egg substitute
2 T whole wheat flour
1 T light vanilla soymilk
1/2 T mini semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp vanilla extract
1 no-calorie sweetener packet
Dash salt

Directions:
Place all ingredients in a small bowl, except for chocolate chips. Add 1 tablespoon water and stir until thoroughly mixed. Fold in chocolate chips.
Bring a large pan sprayed with nonstick spray to medium heat. Pour batter in the pan to form 5 mini pancakes. Once pancakes begin to look solid, after about 1 minute, gently flip.
Cook for an additional minute, or until both sides are lightly browned and insides are cooked through. Plate and chew!
