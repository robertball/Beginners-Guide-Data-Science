Ingredients:
8 ounce rib eye steak, thinly sliced against the grain
1 teaspoon sesame oil
½ cup scallions, cut into 2 inch pieces
2 cloves fresh garlic, minced1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (to taste)
2 -3 cups cole slaw mix (shredded cabbage and carrots in a bag)(more cabbage is better because it shrinks during cooking)
2 2.8 ounce packages beef ramen
1½ cups water
1 - 2 tablespoons soy sauce (to taste)
cooked white rice

Directions:
Heat sesame oil in medium skillet and stir fry beef, scallions, garlic and pepper flakes over high heat until meat loses it’s redness.  It doesn't need to be well done.
Stir in cole slaw mix, continually stir and cook 2 minutes longer.  Remove pan from heat and set aside.
Place water in sauce pan and bring to rolling boil. Add noodles from both packages of ramen with only ONE of the seasoning packets. Allow to boil stiring occassionally until most of the water has been absorbed or evaporated.  This will take approximately five minutes.
Add noodles and soy sauce  to the steak mixture and heat thoroughly.
Serve over freshly cooked white rice.
