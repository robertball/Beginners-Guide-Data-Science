Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup sliced almonds
2/3 cup butter
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, room temperature
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2/3 cup unsweetened pineapple juice
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained with juice reserved
1/2 cup heavy cream, whipped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine 2 cups flour, confectioners' sugar, and almonds. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press crust mixture into the bottom of an ungreased 9x13-inch pan. Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned. Set crust aside, and leave the oven on.
While the crust is baking, prepare the cream cheese layer. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time. Blend in 2/3 cup unsweetened pineapple juice. Pour over hot crust and bake until filling is set, about 20 minutes more. Allow to cool completely.
Make the topping: In a saucepan, combine 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 cup reserved pineapple juice. Bring to a boil and stir for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in crushed pineapple. Cool completely. When cool, fold in whipped cream. Spread topping over cream cheese layer. Refrigerate 4 hours before serving.
