Ingredients:
Nonstick cooking spray
2 1/2 cups finely crushed graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup butter, melted
4 packages (8 ounces each) Philadelphia Cream Cheese, softened
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla
4 eggs
1 package (12-ounce) white chocolate chips
1 1/2 cups dried cranberries
Icing
4 ounces Philadelphia Cream Cheese, softened
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preparation
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray; set aside.
2. In a medium bowl combine crushed graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. Press into the bottom of prepared pan. Bake 10 minutes. Cool completely, about 30 minutes.
3. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F. In a very large bowl combine the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until light and fluffy using an electric mixer on medium. Beat in eggs, one at a time, just until blended. Pour half of the white chocolate chips and half of the dried cranberries into batter. Combine. Pour over prepared crust.
4. Sprinkle remaining white chocolate chips and remaining dried cranberries over batter. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until edges are set but center still jiggles slightly. Cool completely in pan on cooling rack, about 1 hour.
5. For cheesecake icing, beat cream cheese until creamy. Beat in powdered sugar. Stir in vanilla. Add 3 tablespoons milk and stir to thoroughly combine. Add milk as needed to get desired consistency. Drizzle over cooled bars. Refrigerate baking cookies & cakes at least 2 hours before serving.
6. Cut into 12 square bars (approximately 3x3 inches).
