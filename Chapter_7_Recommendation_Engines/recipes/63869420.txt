Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups sugar
3/4 cup flour
1/2 cup cocoa
pinch salt
1 can (12-ounce) evaporated milk
1 1/2 cups water (I fill the milk can with water)
3 cups milk
1-2 Tbs. butter
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
In a large saucepan, combine sugar, flour, cocoa and salt.
Whisk the dry ingredients together until smooth and well-combined.
Combine evaporated milk, water and milk and pour over the dry ingredients.
Heat over medium heat and stir occasionally with a spoon (do not use a whisk as it adds too much air), ensuring the mixture doesnâ€™t burn on the bottom.
Heat until mixture boils.
Once mixture boils, remove from heat and add butter and vanilla and stir well.
