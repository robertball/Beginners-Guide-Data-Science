Ingredients:
2 (12 ounce) packages frozen spinach souffle, thawed
2 cups cooked white rice
1 cup milk
1 cup shredded Swiss cheese, divided
¼ cup chopped onion
2 teaspoons prepared Dijon-style mustard
½ teaspoon salt
6  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup fresh bread crumbs
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl stir together the spinach souffle, rice, milk, 1/2 cup Swiss cheese, onion, mustard and salt. Transfer mixture to a 9x13 inch baking dish, and  cover with aluminum foil or a lid.
Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven.
Meanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet, saute the chicken breasts in oil until both sides are golden brown and the juices run clear.  Arrange the chicken on top of the spinach mixture.
In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, butter or margarine and remaining 1/2 cup Swiss cheese; sprinkle over the chicken. Bake uncovered for an additional 25 minutes, or until the spinach mixture is set, the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
