Summer Cucumber Salad Recipe

Ingredients:
1 - 2 cucumbers (see notes below)
1 - 2 TB plain yogurt (lowfat, nonfat or completely unadulterated, your choice)
Salt
Fresh ground pepper
2 sprigs fresh dill **or** 1/2 tsp dried dillweed

Directions:
If you're using cucumbers bought from the grocery, most of them are covered with wax (or some other wax-like substance) so it's best not to try and eat the peels -- they'll taste nasty.  So peel your store-bought cucumbers if you have to.
If you're using fresh cukes right out of your garden (lucky you!), don't bother with peeling them unless you've had to use a particularly noxious pesticide or something on them.  Personally, I do prefer to leave the peels on fresh-grown garden cukes.
Slice cucumbers into 1/8" slices into a bowl.  Sprinkle salt, pepper and dill over the top and add yogurt.  Mix well and chill in the refrigerator for a few minutes to allow the flavors to marry.  Serve cold -- right away!
