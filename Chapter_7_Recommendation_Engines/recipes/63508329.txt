Ingredients:
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 cup lukewarm water (110 degrees)
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 cup semolina flour or cornmeal
1/4 cup whole wheat flour
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in the water. Stir in the salt, semolina flour and whole wheat flour. Add the all-purpose flour until the dough forms a ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, about 10 minutes. Grease a bowl, place dough in the bowl, turning to coat all sides, cover with plastic wrap, and set it in a warm place to rise until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours (or less if it's hot outside).
Punch dough down, and let rise again for about 40 minutes. Punch it down and divide it into four pieces. Set two of the pieces aside; roll the other two pieces into round, oval or rectangular shapes about 1/8-inch thick. As you finish rolling out pieces, set each on a cookie sheet which has been well oiled with olive oil.
Heat your grill to medium hot, setting the rack 3-4 inches above the fire. take on of the rolled-out dough pieces and gently drape it onto the grill. After 1 minute, turn it over.  It should be stiff enough to turn quite easily (if not, your grill is not hot enough.)  Cook for another minutes and remove from grill.
Top your pizza as your wish, placing only precooked ingredients as your grilled pizza will not be on the grill long.
Place back on the grill and cook until the pizza looks done. (Be careful not to let the pizza dough burn!)
