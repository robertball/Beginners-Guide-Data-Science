Ingredients:
8 (1/2 inch thick) slices soft Italian bread
1/3 cup mayonnaise
8 ounces thinly sliced young goat Gouda cheese
1 1/3 cups Sheet-Pan Ratatouille, or other prepared ratatouille

Directions:
Spread both sides of each bread slice with mayonnaise. Layer 1/2 of the cheese, all of the ratatouille, and remaining cheese on 4 bread slices. Top with remaining bread slices.
Heat an extra-large skillet, grill pan, or griddle over medium heat. Cook sandwiches until golden and cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
