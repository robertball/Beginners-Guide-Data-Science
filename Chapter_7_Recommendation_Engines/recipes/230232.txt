Ingredients:
4 slices bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces (optional)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 yellow onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
1/2 apple, peeled and finely chopped
5 cups vegetable broth
1/2 cup apple cider
1 head cabbage, cored and coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
1/3 cup white sugar
1 (12 ounce) loaf crusty bread

Directions:
Place bacon pieces in a large pot and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
Drain fat from the pot and add olive oil, onion, garlic, and caraway seeds. Cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
Stir in chopped apple, vegetable broth, apple cider, cabbage, cider vinegar, and sugar. Bring soup to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer, partially covered, until cabbage is tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
Cut bread into large chunks and place them in the bottom of six soup bowls. Ladle the soup over the bread and serve.

Description: 
A flavorful sweet-and-sour cabbage soup. Years ago a local restaurant served a cabbage apple soup that I've been trying to recreate. This is my best attempt, and possibly even better! For a vegetarian version, simply omit the bacon.
