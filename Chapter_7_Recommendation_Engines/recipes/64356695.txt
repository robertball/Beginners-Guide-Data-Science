INSTRUCTIONS
Add all of the Creamy Avocado Salad Dressing ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth, scraping the sides down as needed. Add hot sauce and additional salt and pepper to taste. Add additional milk to thin to desired consistency if needed. Chill in the refrigerator, time permitting.
Add salad ingredients to a large bowl except for the tortilla strips and toss to combine.
Toss salad with desired amount of dressing (there will probably be some left over) or drizzle dressing over individual servings if not eating all of the salad immediately.
Garnish salad with tortilla strips and freshly cracked salt and pepper.
NOTES
*If using Greek Yogurt, you might need to add more sugar to taste
