Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1/2 cup canola oil
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (19 ounce) package gluten-free yellow cake mix
1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Beat pumpkin puree, oil, egg, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Add cake mix, cornmeal, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and salt and mix well. Pour into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the center of the preheated oven until edges are browned and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.

Description: 
This quickbread is a little sweeter than cornbread, a bit milder than pumpkin bread, and an amazing fall treat. After ordering pumpkin cornbread at a restaurant, I wanted to make a safe version for my 5-year-old, who has celiac disease. I got lucky on my first try, and the whole family devoured it! Serve hot with butter (or a spiced maple butter).
