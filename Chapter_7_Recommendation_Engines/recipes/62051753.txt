Ingredients:
4 grilled chicken breasts (sliced)
1 tbsp oil
1 cup chopped broccoli
1 cup thinly sliced red/green peppers
1 cup sliced portabello mushrooms
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup parmesan cheese
1 1/2 cups spaghetti sauce
oregano, basil, parsley, pepper to taste
4 cups of pasta (fusilli or penne work well)

Directions:
1.  Heat oil in large frying pan.  Add vegetables (broccoli, peppers & mushrooms) and cook while stirring until tender-crisp.  (the chicken may also be sliced and fried instead of grilling)
2.  Add heavy cream and parmesan cheese to vegetables and bring to a boil (stirring often).  Reduce heat and allow to simmer until thickened.
3.  Add spaghetti sauce to vegetable mixture and stir.
4.  Add spices to taste (pepper, oregano, parsley, basil) - approx 1 tsp each.  Let sauce boil gently for approximately 5 minutes.
5.  Add cooked pasta and sliced chicken to vegetable and sauce mixture and stir until well mixed together.  Sprinkle with parmesan cheese to serve.
**Feel free to alter the vegetables (cauliflower, asparagus, white mushrooms, onion) depending on your personal preferences or what you have on hand.  The flavor of the portabello mushrooms is key to the recipe though**
