Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package bulk regular pork sausage (such as Jimmy Dean®)
1 head napa cabbage, cut into bite-sized pieces.
1 onion, chopped
1 carrots, cut into matchstick strips
1 celery, chopped
2 green onions, minced (optional)
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons soy sauce, or to taste
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
5 cups cooked white rice

Directions:
Cook sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat, breaking meat apart into small pieces until completely browned, about 10 minutes. Drain and remove sausage from the skillet.
Place cabbage, onion, carrots, celery, green onions, and garlic in the skillet. Cook and stir over medium heat until bright but still crunchy, about 4 minutes. Add sausage and cook for 2 minutes more. Mix in soy sauce, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes until evenly combined, about 1 minute.
Combine cabbage mixture and cooked rice in a large bowl; mix until rice is evenly distributed.
