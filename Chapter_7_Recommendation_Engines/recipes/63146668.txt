Ingredients:
2 lb fresh salmon fillets
1 cup dried veggie "chips", crushed
1/4 cup real maple syrup
1/4 cup grainy dijon mustard

Directions:
Lay the salmon fillets in a large glass baking dish (I use 13x9).  Mix together the maple syrup and dijon and spread over the fish.  Allow to marinate for up to a day.  To prepare: Sprinkle with crushed veggie chips.  Bake at 350 degrees for approximately 30 minutes or until fish is just cooked through (do not over-cook or your salmon will become tough).
