Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
4 cups mashed watermelon, seeds removed
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup sesame seeds

Directions:
Place the flour in a dry skillet over medium heat. Cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden. Set aside to cool.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, stir together the watermelon, flour, honey, sugar, salt and cinnamon. Grease a 9 or 10 inch pie plate, and sprinkle half of the sesame seeds over the bottom. Pour the watermelon filling over the seeds, the filling should be about 1 inch thick. Sprinkle the remaining sesame seeds over the top.
Bake for 40 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Allow to cool completely before slicing. Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
This is a traditional Greek recipe. When I first heard of it, I was very reluctant to try something so strange. After tasting it, it turned into one of the family's favorite desserts. And it is very easy to make! Sprinkle with a little extra cinnamon before serving if you wish.
