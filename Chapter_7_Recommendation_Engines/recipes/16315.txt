Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
2 tablespoons white sugar
4 cups all-purpose flour, divided
4 eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 cup butter, room temperature
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 cup milk
3 cups raisins
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water; add sugar and 2 cups flour. Mix to combine, cover bowl with plastic, and let rise about 1 hour.
Mix in remaining flour, eggs, butter, salt, milk, and raisins until fully combined. Cover bowl and let rise again for 1 hour.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Drop dough by tablespoonfuls in hot fat and cook until brown on both sides. Cookie usually flips over when done on the first side. Be sure fat isn't too hot or your cookie may be raw inside when dark on the outside. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with granulated or powdered sugar, if desired.
