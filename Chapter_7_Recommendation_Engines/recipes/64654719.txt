Ingredients:
1/2 cup plant based butter (such as Country Crock Plant Butter)
1 cup Erythritol Prebiotic Oligosaccharides blend (such as Swerve Confectioners)
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 tbs creamy peanut butter

Directions:
Line 8" x 8" pan with parchment paper, ends extending over sides.
Microwave butter for 45 seconds or until melted. Add Swerve, graham cracker crumbs and peanut butter; mix well.
Press onto bottom of prepared pan.
Microwave chocolate chips and 2 tbs peanut butter for 45 seconds. Stir and continue to microwave at 20 second intervals until melted. Spread and smooth over graham cracker/peanut butter mixture with an off-set spatula.
Refrigerate for 30 minutes or until semi-hardened. Score chocolate layer (so that chocolate layer will not crack when cutting into bars) and refrigerate until firm, about 30 more minutes.
Remove dessert from pan by pulling on the extended parchment paper; cut into bars.
Note: If you're not on the Keto diet, these bars can be made with real butter and real powdered sugar.
