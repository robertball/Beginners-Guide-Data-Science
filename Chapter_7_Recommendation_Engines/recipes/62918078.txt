Ingredients:
2 apples (I used Golden Delicious, but any type would work)
1 1/2 t sugar
1/2 t cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 225.
Core and slice the apple into very thin slices: Cut the apple into quarters and remove the core. Use the slicing blade of a food processor to thinly slice. (Or, you can also use a mandoline for slicing.)
Arrange the slices on metal baking sheets. (No need to grease or cover the baking sheets.)
Mix together the sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over the apple slices.
Bake for 45 min to 1 hour, or until the slices feel dried out and the edges curl up. If you want, flip them halfway through and sprinkle the other side with cinnamon sugar. Note: they will not feel crispy until they cool down.
Use a metal flipper to loosen the slices from the baking sheet as soon as they come out of the oven, before they stick.

Description: 
These yummy cinnamon apple chips will disappear almost as quickly as you make them! They're perfect for healthy snacks, and easy to take on the road. The secret is baking at a very low temperature for a long time, which dehydrates the apples.
