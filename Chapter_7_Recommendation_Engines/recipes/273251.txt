Ingredients:
1 pound ground sausage
2 (14.5 ounce) cans Italian-style diced tomatoes, drained
19 ounces frozen cheese tortellini
1 (8 ounce) package Neufchatel cheese
1 (5 ounce) package fresh spinach, or more to taste
4 cups chicken broth

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer sausage to a slow cooker.
Pour diced tomatoes, tortellini, Neufchatel cheese, spinach, and chicken broth into the slow cooker, making sure to chunk up cheese throughout the mixture.
Cover and cook on Low until tortellini has become tender, 4 to 6 hours.

Description: 
This tortellini recipe is excellent for a slow cooker. Keep an eye on your tortellini, as it may be done sooner. If it looks soupy, leave the lid off for the last half hour or so of cooking. For a vegetarian version, omit sausage and use vegetable broth instead!
