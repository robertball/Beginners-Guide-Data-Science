Ingredients:
1 cup butter or margarine
1 cup water
1/4 cup baking cocoa
2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a saucepan, bring butter, water and cocoa to a boil; whisk until smooth. Cool to room temperature. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar and salt. Add cocoa mixture; beat on low speed just until combined. Add sour cream, eggs and baking soda; blend until smooth. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. For frosting, in a mixing bowl, cream butter. Combine the confectioners' sugar and cocoa; gradually add to butter. Beat in the vanilla and enough milk to achieve spreading consistency. Frost the cake. Sprinkle with nuts. Refrigerate until serving.
