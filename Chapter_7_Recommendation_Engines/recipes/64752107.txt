Ingredients:
18 ounces shelled, fresh cranberry beans
6 cups vegetable broth
3 Tbsp olive oil
3 Tbsp butter
1 small onion, diced
1 garlic clove, minced
1 sprig fresh rosemary
1 fresh bay leaf
1 sprig fresh sage
1 and 1/4 cups carnaroli rice
1/2 cup dry white wine
3/4 cup tomato sauce

Directions:
1. Bring the vegetable broth to a boil, add the fresh beans. Bring back to a boil, and reduce heat to simmer the beans until they are soft but not mushy. Remove the beans with a slotted spoon. Leave the vegetable broth over the heat source on medium-low.
2. Heat the oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic, whole rosemary twig, bay leaf, and sage. Sauté until the onion is translucent. About 7 minutes. Add the rice and stir to toast the rice. Once the rice has toasted, add the drained beans and stir until well coated.
3. Add the white wine and stir until the wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup broth to the rice and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding one half cup of broth, stirring continuously, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al dente. Add the tomato sauce and stir until creamy and thick. This whole process will take about 18 minutes.
4. Remove from the heat source and let stand for 2 minutes. Remove the rosemary twig, the bay leaf, and the sage and serve.
