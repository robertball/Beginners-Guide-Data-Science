Ingredients:
Custard:
1 (14 ounce) can fat-free sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup low-fat sour cream
1/2 lemon, juiced, divided
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust
Fruit Topping:
1/2 cup blueberry preserves
2 tablespoons dry white wine
1 cup fresh blueberries
1 cup fresh mulberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Combine condensed milk, sour cream, half of the lemon juice, and vanilla extract in a saucepan over medium heat. Simmer and stir over medium heat until custard thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool, about 5 minutes. Pour into graham cracker crust.
Combine blueberry preserves, wine, and remaining lemon juice in another saucepan over medium heat; simmer and stir over medium heat until the preserves have liquefied, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in blueberries and mulberries until coated with preserves and warmed through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool, about 5 minutes. Pour over custard.
Bake in preheated oven until the edges of the crust are golden, about 10 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack, about 15 minutes.
Chill in the refrigerator until custard sets before serving, at least 1 hour.

Description: 
Blueberries and mulberries are everywhere in Eastern PA during the early- to mid-summer, so I created this quick and simple vanilla custard tart to accentuate the natural sweetness of the hand-picked berries. You can sift confectioners' sugar over the tart before serving. Enjoy!
