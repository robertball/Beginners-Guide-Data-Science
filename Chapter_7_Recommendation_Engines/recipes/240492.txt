Ingredients:
Mixture:
12 egg yolks
1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar, divided
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
6 egg whites
Drink:
12 (1.5 fluid ounce) jiggers brandy, or to taste
12 (1.5 fluid ounce) jiggers rum, or to taste
boiling water
1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste

Directions:
Beat egg yolks and 2/3 of the confectioners' sugar together in a bowl until smooth; add vanilla extract, cinnamon, cloves, salt, allspice, and baking soda and beat until smooth.
Beat egg whites in a bowl using an electric mixer until frothy; add the remaining confectioners' sugar and beat until stiff peaks form. Fold egg white mixture into egg yolk mixture. Refrigerate or freeze mixture until chilled, at least 1 hour.
Spoon 2 tablespoons mixture into each mug; top each with 1 shot brandy and 1 shot rum. Fill the rest of each mug with boiling water; stir and top with nutmeg.

Description: 
This was my grandfather's recipe that we pull out every year at Christmas gatherings. He served it without the cloves, cinnamon, and allspice, but we like the added spices. 

It'll warm you up.
