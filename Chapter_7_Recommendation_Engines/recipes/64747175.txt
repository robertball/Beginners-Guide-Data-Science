Ingredients:
Amy’s sauce
Amy’s meatballs
Sausage made with sauce
Eggies made with sauce
Water
Salt
Spaghetti
Fusilli
Ziti
Rigatoni

Directions:
Fill up a big pot of water.
SALT THE WATER.
Let it come to a rolling boil.
Add pasta.
Cook for 8-12 minutes.
Rigatoni takes longer to cook than spaghetti.
Using a timer is inaccurate. You must taste to know if it’s done.
Drain in a scolapasta (It’s not a colander or a strainer)
DO NOT RINSE WITH WATER!
Once drained, add back to pot.
Add some sauce to prevent pasta from sticking. No oil, no butter!!!
Serve with Parmesan and/or Pecorino. The good stuff please!!!
And eat your spaghetti the way I taught you. Please don’t cut it with a knife or use a spoon. Twirl!

Description: 
Not really a recipe but traditional way Sunday’s are done after you made the sauce and meatballs. Use whatever pasta you’d like. My favorite is long fusilli. Never use elbow macaroni. Never mix different shaped macaroni and DO NOT, for the love of God, do not refer to any form of pasta as ‘noodles.’
For 5 people, I use 2 pounds of pasta. It’s better to have more than not enough.
And don’t be embarrassed by the eggies. When times were tough, my Grammy would use eggies in her second-day sauce to add some protein to the meal since meat was costlier. It’s a good lesson!
