Ingredients:
1 1/2 (16 ounce) packages angel hair pasta
2 cubes chicken bouillon
2 cups boiling water
15 sun-dried tomatoes
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons minced garlic, or to taste
2 (16 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes
1 (16 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and quartered
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 tablespoon shredded Parmesan cheese, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.
Meanwhile, dissolve chicken bouillon in 2 cups boiling water in a large bowl. Add sun-dried tomatoes and soak for 5 minutes. Remove tomatoes and chop coarsely, reserving liquid.
Melt butter in olive oil over medium heat; add garlic and cook and stir until it begins to brown. Stir in sun-dried tomatoes, reserved soaking liquid, stewed tomatoes, artichokes, salt, oregano, basil, hot pepper sauce, and black pepper; bring to a boil. Add shrimp; cook and stir until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes.
Serve shrimp and tomato sauce over angel hair pasta. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
