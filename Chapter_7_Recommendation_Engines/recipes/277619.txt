Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 cup milk
1/4 cup pumpkin puree
1 mashed banana
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large egg

Directions:
Sift all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Set aside.
Mix milk, pumpkin, banana, oil, and egg together in another bowl; add flour mixture. Mix just to moisten.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
