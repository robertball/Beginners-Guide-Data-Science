Directions:
Pulse cranberries in a food processor just until roughly chopped; transfer to a clean glass container. Add vodka, simple syrup, lemon peel, orange peel, cinnamon stick, and allspice to cranberries; stir until well mixed. Seal container with a lid and store in a cool dark area, 3 to 5 days, stirring several times a day. Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a glass bottle and refrigerate.

Description: 
This delicious treat can be enjoyed on its own (as a post-Thanksgiving sipper) or mixed with sparkling wine to create a cranberry cordial (a festive way to kick off the holidays). Either way, it's really easy to make! Will last up to 2 months.
