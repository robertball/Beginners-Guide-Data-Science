Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
dash cayenne pepper
2 (1 pound) loaves frozen white bread dough, thawed
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a skillet, brown beef and onion; drain. Add the next eight ingredients; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Cool. Roll each loaf of dough into a 16-in. x 8-in. rectangle, about 1/4 in. thick. Cut each into eight 4-in. squares; top each with 1/4 cup filling and 1 tablespoon cheese. Bring the four corners together up over filling; pinch seams to seal. Place on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise for 15 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until browned. Serve immediately, or freeze and reheat in microwave at 50% power for 1-1/2 minutes each.
