Ingredients:
1 1/2 c Walnuts, coarsely chopped
1 1/2 c All-purpose Flour
3/4 c Chocolate Chips
1 Tbsp Baking Powder
1/2 tsp Ground Cinnamon
1/2 tsp Salt
1/2 c Dark Brown Sugar
1/4 c Canola Oil
1/4 c Fat-free Plain Greek Yogurt
1/4 c Fat-free milk
1 Large Egg
1 Very Ripe Banana, mashed (about 1/3 c)
1 tsp Vanilla Extract

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Coat a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.
2. Measure 1/2 cup of the walnuts into a food processor and grind to a fine meal. Place the ground walnuts, flour, chocolate chips, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl and stir until thoroughly combined.
3. Combine the brown sugar, oil, yogurt, milk, egg, banana, and vanilla extract in a medium bowl and stir until smooth. Add the banana mixture to the flour mixture and stir until thoroughly combined. Stir in the remaining 1 cup walnuts and mix well (the batter will be thick).
4. Fill the muffin cups three-fourths full and bake for 13 to 15 minutes, or until the tops spring back lightly when touched. Remove the muffins from the pan and let cool on a rack.
