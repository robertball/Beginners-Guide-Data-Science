Description: 
My mother had a creative way of using the apple cores and peels leftover from making apple pie: to make homemade apple juice. Store-bought apple juice is tasty, but it has a strong, distinct flavor with almost a hint of bitterness. To those with sensitive palates, it can be a little strong at times. Homemade juice, however, tastes surprisingly different as it is lighter and pleasantly sweet without the kick. Besides using a juicer, this is a super-easy way of making apple juice.
