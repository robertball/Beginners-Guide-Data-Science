Ingredients:
1/2 (12 ounce) package elbow macaroni
1 tablespoon olive oil
13 ounces smoked turkey sausage, chopped
1/2 onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 small apples - peeled, cored, and diced
1 bunch dandelion greens, chopped
5 ounces Asiago cheese, diced
1 teaspoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add sausage and sear for 1 minute. Add onion, then garlic; cook and stir until starting to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in apples and cook until browned, about 2 minutes. Add dandelion greens and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes.
Combine sausage mixture with macaroni and Asiago cheese in a serving dish. Top with Parmesan cheese.
