Lebanese-style Grape Leaves Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 lb. jar grape leaves (California ones are usually more tender than imported)
1 1/4 cup basmati rice
1 lb. ground beef or lamb
2 cups tomato puree or smooth sauce, divided (reduce salt if sauce has salt)
2 Tbsp. dried mint
2 tsp. salt, divided
1/2 tsp. black pepper
1 head garlic, individual cloves peeled and cut into thick slivers
1 stick butter
3-4 Tbsp. lemon juice

Directions:
Drain leaves. Boil a large pot of water; remove from heat, add leaves, and soak for 10-20 min. while preparing the filling, then drain and rinse them.
Filling: wash the rice, then combine with raw meat, about half of the tomato puree, mint, 1 tsp. of the salt, and pepper. Moisten the filling with water to make a soft paste, and add water as you use the filling to keep it soft.
To roll: Lay a leaf vein side up, trim off the stem, and place filling near the stem end. The filling should be about the size and shape of your pinkie (for a leaf about the size of your hand). Tuck the stem end of the leaf over the filling, then fold the sides in, then roll up tightly. Pack neatly and firmly into the large pot, with garlic slivers here and there between the rolls. Top with the butter, cut up into pieces. Combine the remaining tomato puree and salt with enough water to cover the rolls and pour on top. Place a small plate on top of the rolls to weigh them down. Cover and bring to a simmer over med-high heat; reduce heat and simmer 1 hour. Remove the plate. Add the lemon juice. Simmer 1/2 hour more.

Description: 
These are much richer than the Greek style ones. They are best served warm, with plain yogurt on the side to dip them in.
