Ingredients:
1 cup whole-wheat flour
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt
2 T olive oil
1/2 cup roasted red bell peppers
warm water

Directions:
Combine whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour and salt in a mixing bowl and stir together with a whisk or fork.
Puree roasted red bell peppers. Once pureed, add enough warm water to measure 1/2 cup.
To flour mixture, add the oil and stream in the pureed pepper mixture, a little at a time, until puree is absorbed and dough begins to form a ball.
Remove dough from the bowl and knead on floured work surface until it comes together and becomes smooth, about 1 minute.
Return dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for at least 15 minutes.
Remove dough from bowl and shape into eight balls.
Dust the work surface and a rolling pin with flour and roll balls out into 6-inch circles.
Set a cast-iron pan or other non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add a tortilla and cook 1 minute (tortilla will turn light brown in spots).
Flip and cook the other side an additional 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove from the pan and place in a kitchen towel to keep warm.
Repeat this process with the remaining tortillas, adjusting heat as necessary to prevent burning.
