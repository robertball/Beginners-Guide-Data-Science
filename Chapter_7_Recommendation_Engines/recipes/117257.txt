Ingredients:
2 medium acorn squash
1 pound bulk pork sausage
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1/3 cup sour cream

Directions:
Cut squash in half; remove and discard seeds. Place squash cut side down in a microwave-safe dish. Cover and microwave on high for 10-12 minutes or until tender.
Meanwhile, crumble sausage into a large skillet; add celery and onion. Cook over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Remove from the heat; stir in sour cream. Spoon into squash halves. Cover and microwave for 1 minute or until heated through.

Description: 
In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Mary Magner tucks a flavorful sausage mixture into colorful acorn squash halves. Cooking the squash in the microwave means this entree is done in minutes. I like to use maple-flavored bulk pork sausage, Mary notes.
