Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1 cup butter, softened
1 egg
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped walnuts
4 (1 ounce) squares bittersweet chocolate, chopped
4 ounces milk chocolate, chopped
4 ounces white chocolate, chopped
3 teaspoons shortening
3 (1 ounce) squares bittersweet chocolate
3 ounces milk chocolate
3 ounces white chocolate

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cream the butter or margarine with the brown sugar until light. Add the egg and mix well.
Stir in the flour, ground cinnamon, baking soda and salt. Mix in the nuts and the 4 ounces of the bittersweet, milk and white chocolates.
Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls about 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes or until light golden brown. Cool slightly. Dip cooled cookies into the Three Chocolate Glaze.
To Make Three Chocolate Glaze: Heat 1 teaspoon of the shortening with bittersweet chocolate over low heat, stirring constantly, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove from heat. Dip each cookie 1/2 inch deep into chocolate along one edge. Repeat with remaining shortening and chocolates. Rotate dipped edge of cookie for each type of chocolate.
