Ingredients:
2 large russet potatoes
1 tsp olive oil
1 Tbsp finely chopped fresh thyme
1 tsp kosher salt, divided
1 tsp garlic powder, divided
1 Tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Heat the oven to 425 degrees F.  Line 2 baking sheets with kitchen parchment paper.
Using a spiral cutter, cut the potatoes into curly slices using the coarsest/widest blade setting.  Depending on the model of spiral cutter you use, you may need to cut the potatoes to fit into it.
Transfer the sliced potatoes to a large bowl and toss with the olive oil, thyme, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  Divide the potatoes between the 2 baking sheets, spreading them evenly.
Bake for 15 5o 20 minutes, or until they are visibly browning and crunchy in places.  Flip, and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes.
Transfer the potatoes to a serving dish and sprinkle with the remaining salt, garlic powder and parsley.  Serve immediately.
