Ingredients:
2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 tablespoon raw sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon garlic, minced
6 tablespoons water
1/4 cup sweet rice flour
1/4 cup potato starch
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 small head cauliflower, cut into wing-sized pieces
2 tablespoons sesame seeds, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix gochujang, ketchup, sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, and garlic together in a bowl. Set sauce aside.
Mix water, rice flour, potato starch, granulated garlic, salt, and white pepper together in a bowl. Add a small amount of additional water if batter is too thick.
Place cauliflower pieces in a bowl and pour batter on top. Toss to coat. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each piece.
Bake in the preheated oven until some spots form, about 30 minutes.
Transfer baked 'wings' to a large bowl, leaving oven on. Add sauce and toss to coat. Return 'wings' to the baking sheet, leaving space between them. Return to the hot oven until black spots start to appear, about 15 minutes.
Transfer to a serving plate and top with sesame seeds.

Description: 
Nutritious cauliflower with a spicy sauce makes a great vegetarian substitute for chicken wings. Swap out the honey for agave syrup to make this vegan.
