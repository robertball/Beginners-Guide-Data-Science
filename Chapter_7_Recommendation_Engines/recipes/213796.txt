Description: 
Hello! This is my first recipe post, and I hope everyone likes it! I made this on a whim by throwing things together that were in my pantry. Although this isn't a fancy soup by any means, it's an interesting twist on Spanish rice! As a nearly lifelong vegetarian, I know how hard it is to find a good vegetarian soup, so I hope my fellow veggies out there enjoy this very much! For those who aren't vegetarian, I'm sure you can find a way to incorporate some meat into this. This soup is versatile and easy to customize.
