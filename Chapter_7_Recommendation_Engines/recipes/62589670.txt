Ingredients:
1 Whole Chicken 3 to 4lbs
1 Can of Cream of Mushroom soup
1 Can of Cream of Chicken soup
1 Can of Rotel
1 Cup of Milk
20 or so White Corn Tortillas
3 to 4 cups of shredded Colby cheese

Directions:
Prepare the whole chicken by removing any gizzards etc out of the cavity. Place chicken a large pot of water. Make sure there is enough water to cover the chicken and boil it for roughly 40 minutes or until the temperature meets 175 to 180 in the thigh. Drain chicken and let it sit and cool. Depending on how much time you have, it might be better to let it cool in the water to retain some moister.
While the chicken is cooling, in a large bowl combine the Cream of Mushroom soup, Cream of Chicken soup, 1 cup of milk and the can of Rotel.
Pre-heat the oven to 350.
De-bone your chicken once cooled getting rid of the skin, bones and fat. Shred the chicken.
Cut the tortillas into thirds to use them like strips. Spray the bottom and sides of a 9X13 glass dish with cooking spray. Next layer your ingredients in the following order:
Tortillas
Chicken
Soup Mix
Cheese
Tortillas
Chicken
Soup Mix
Cheese
Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly. Enjoy!!
