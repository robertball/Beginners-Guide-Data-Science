Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, coarsely chopped
4 stalks celery, chopped
1/3 pound lean round steak, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 quart beef stock
1 quart water
1 bay leaf
1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
2 pounds beef soup bones
1 large potato, peeled and cut into large chunks
1 large carrot, peeled and cut into large chunks
1 small green bell pepper, chopped
1/4 cup dry black beans
1/4 cup dried split peas
1/4 cup white rice
1/4 cup elbow macaroni
1 cup crushed tomatoes in puree
1/4 cup chopped cabbage
1 cup red wine
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook the onion, celery, and steak in the melted butter until the onions caramelize, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the beef stock, water, bay leaf, marjoram, oregano, and soup bones; lower the heat to medium-low and simmer 3 hours, skimming froth off the top of the soup as it develops.
Add the potato, carrot, bell pepper, black beans, split peas, rice, macaroni, tomatoes in puree, cabbage, and red wine to the stockpot. Simmer 1 hour more. Remove the soup bones, scraping any meat from them back into the pot. Season with salt and pepper to serve.

Description: 
Each generation added to this recipe, from my mother, my father's mother Emmazettat Bolan born in 1860 in Pine Creek, Ohio, Elizabeth Ann Pemberton Bolan, and from her mother Margaret McCrary born in 1786 in Carolina. It's a very hearty soup my family begs for. I am now 76 and have yet to find one as rich. Serve in large soup plates with hot French bread.
