Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef or ground turkey
Olive oil or cooking oil spray.
1 medium onion - coarsely chopped
1-2 cloves of garlic minced
2 28 ounce cans of diced tomatoes
2 cups of uncooked macaroni noodles
Optional:  One stalk of celery, diced
1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
1 Tbsp. Mrs. Dash
A pinch (1 tsp) of sugar
Iodized Sea Salt
Pepper

Directions:
Brown the ground beef in a stock pot.  Drain the beef and set aside in a bowl.
Spray the pot with olive oil or cooking oil.
Saute the onions until tender.  Add the garlic and saute until softened.  Be careful not to burn the garlic as this will make the dish bitter.
While the onions are cooking; cook the noodles until just al dente.  Undercooked is best here about 6 min.
Add the ground beef back into the pot with the onions and garlic.  Add the diced tomatoes to the skillet.  May add celery at this point if desired. Season with a pinch of sugar and salt and pepper to taste.
Simmer for 10 minutes on medium low.
Add the noodles to the skillet and heat through.

Description: 
This is a light but filling dish handed down by my mother.  When it is not quite cold enough for chili but the air is crisp - this is a family favorite.
