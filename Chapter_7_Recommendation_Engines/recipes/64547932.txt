Ingredients:
4 slices thin white, sandwich bread
2 slices of prosciutto cotto (cooked deli ham)
2 slices fontina cheese
1/4 cup giardiniera
2 hot pickled peppers (optional)

Directions:
Heat a panino press according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Place one slice of ham and once slice of fontina cheese on a slice of bread. Do the same with another slice of bread.
Add half the giardiniera on top of the ham/cheese and the other half on the other ham/cheese.
Top the two sandwiches with the remaining slices of bread to form two sandwiches.
Cook each panino in the press until the cheese has melted and the bread has toasted.
Serve with hot pickled peppers on the side.

Description: 
The first time I went to a bar with friends in Italy, I was very curious when they offered me toast as pub grub. When this panino showed up I understood that Italian toast and American toast is NOT the same thing. Cooked ham, fontina cheese and giardiniera make up this hot panino that goes well with your favourite Italian beer.
