Ingredients:
1 cup coconut milk
2  lemon grass, chopped
4 slices (1/2-inch) piece peeled fresh ginger
5  kaffir lime leaves, torn in half
¾ pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into strips
5 tablespoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 cup coconut milk
½ cup lime juice
1 teaspoon red curry paste
¼ cup coarsely chopped cilantro
15  green Thai chiles, crushed

Directions:
Bring 1 cup coconut milk, lemon grass, ginger, and kaffir lime leaves to a boil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the chicken, fish sauce, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium, and continue cooking until the chicken no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1 cup coconut milk, and bring to a simmer, about 3 minutes.
Divide the lime juice and curry paste into 4 bowls. Pour soup into bowls, and garnish with cilantro and Thai chiles.

Description: 
It is a northern Thai soup called Tom Khai Gai. Much of the flavor comes from the garnish that is added after it is cooked: the fresh lime, chiles, coriander leaves, and the roasted chili curry paste. This soup will have a bite to it no matter what you do, but you can modify the spiciness by changing the peppers and the amount of chili paste that you use.
