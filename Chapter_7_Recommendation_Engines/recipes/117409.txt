Ingredients:
1 (2 1/2 pound) dressed rabbit, cut up
1/4 cup olive oil
1 large onion, halved and thinly sliced
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 cups chicken broth
1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 bay leaf
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup lemon juice
5 tablespoons cold water

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook rabbit in oil until lightly browned; remove and keep warm.  In the same skillet, saute onion and garlic until tender.  Stir in the broth, thyme, pepper and bay leaf.  Return rabbit to pan.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30-45 minutes or until meat is tender and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F.
Remove rabbit to a serving platter.  Discard bay leaf.  Combine the flour, lemon juice and water until smooth; stir into pan juice.  Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.  Serve with rabbit.

Description: 
Dawn Bryant of North Platte, Nebraska writes, 'My husband and I do a lot of hunting and eat more wild game that domestic meat.  I came up with this recipe for wild rabbit, and the meat cooks up tender and tangy with a fresh light sauce.  I like to serve it with baked potatoes and steamed broccoli.'
