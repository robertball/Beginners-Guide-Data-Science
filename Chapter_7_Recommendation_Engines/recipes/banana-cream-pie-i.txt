Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
3 egg yolks, beaten
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (9 inch) baked pastry shell, cooled
4 bananas, sliced

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the sugar, flour, and salt.  Add milk in gradually while stirring gently.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is bubbly.  Keep stirring and cook for about 2 more minutes, and then remove from the burner.
Stir a small quantity of the hot mixture into the beaten egg yolks, and immediately add egg yolk mixture to the rest of the hot mixture.  Cook for 2 more minutes; remember to keep stirring.  Remove the mixture from the stove, and add butter and vanilla.  Stir until the whole thing has a smooth consistency.
Slice bananas into the cooled baked pastry shell.  Top with pudding mixture.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes.  Chill for an hour.
