Peanut Brittle - kicked up a notch Recipe

Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups whole and pieces of cashews (toasted at 375 degrees for 10 minutes)  Can use salted roasted peanuts or a mix of the cashews and peanuts.
2 tsp. vanilla
1 scant cup (200 grams) granulated sugar
1/4 cup, plus 1 tbs. light corn syrup
1 1/4 cup unsalted butter, cubed
1/4 cup honey
No salt, since the peanuts and/or cashews have salt.  Add 2 tsp. sea salt if the nuts you use are unsalted.
Option:  8-12 oz. Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips, melted

Directions:
Before I start the cooking, I get the pan ready that I plan to pour the brittle in to.  I use a cookie sheet, lined with parchment paper and have a spatula ready to spread the brittle.  Put all the ingredients together (except nuts) in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan or deep non-stick skillet.  Cook over high heat and stir continuously, until mixture is a caramel color and candy thermometer is at a nice, wich caramel color.  Take off heat and stir in nuts quickly.  Pour onto parchment paper.  Careful - very hot!  Spread to desired thickness and set at room temperature.  Cool completely and break into pieces.  Ready to eat and can be stored in a airtight container at room temperature.
Option: Drizzle cooled brittle with the chocolate and set/store at room temperature.
Hint:  If you want to keep the brittle shiny, handle pieces on its' edges or with rubber gloves.

Description: 
One bite and you've won them over.  This seriously is the yummiest brittle I have ever had.  The one thing most comment on is that it melts in your mouth and not hard on the teeth!
