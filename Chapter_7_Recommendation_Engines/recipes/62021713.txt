Description: 
My mom gave me this recipe and I have altered it some to make it better.  The large amount of blueberries and the cinnamon/sugar topping are what make these muffins the best!  I always get requests for the recipe!!  When using frozen berries, sprinkle them with a small amount of flour to help them from sinking in the batter.
