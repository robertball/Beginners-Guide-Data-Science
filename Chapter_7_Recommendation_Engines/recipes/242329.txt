Ingredients:
3 oranges, juiced
1 lemon, zested and juiced
1 (1 1/2 inch) piece ginger, grated
1 tablespoon soy sauce, or more to taste
4 (4 ounce) fillets swai fish
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons canola oil, or to taste

Directions:
Stir orange juice, lemon juice, lemon zest, ginger, and soy sauce together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add swai fillets, coat with the liquid, squeeze bag to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.
Remove fillets from marinade and shake to remove excess moisture. Discard remaining marinade. Season fish with salt and pepper.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry fish in hot oil until the flesh flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
