10 ounces enoki mushrooms, roots removed
20 slices thinly sliced deli roast beef

Spread roast beef slices out onto a work surface. Divide enoki mushrooms between the roast beef slices and arrange into the middle of each. Wrap the roast beef around the mushrooms.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Arrange beef-wrapped mushrooms into the skillet, season with salt and pepper, and cook until heated through and browned, about 10 minutes per side.
