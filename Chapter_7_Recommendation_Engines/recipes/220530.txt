Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups coconut oil
1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon coarse salt
3 cups quick-cooking Irish oatmeal (such as McCann's®)
1 egg, beaten (optional)
1/2 cup golden raisins
1/2 cup chopped almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease 18 muffin cups with coconut oil.
Beat coconut oil, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated.
Beat 1 egg and vanilla extract into the coconut oil mixture.
Whisk flour, baking soda, and coarse salt together in a bowl; beat into the coconut oil mixture until a dough forms.
Fold oatmeal, raisins, and almonds into dough. Mix beaten egg into dough if needed for moisture.
Spoon dough into prepared muffin cups to about half full.
Bake in preheated oven until center is set and top is lightly browned, 12 to 14 minutes.

Description: 
On the back of a McCann's® Quick Cooking Irish Oatmeal box I noticed a recipe for 'Irish Oatmeal Cookies.' I more or less followed the recipe substituting things here and there, and the results were über-delicious. Perfect for a coffee or tea break snack or breakfast. I would have added some cinnamon if my hubby didn't dislike that flavor so much. Please try it! Here's what I did.
