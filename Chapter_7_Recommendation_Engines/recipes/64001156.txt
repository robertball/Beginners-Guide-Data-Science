Ingredients:
3 cups bread flour
1/2 tsp sea salt
1/4 tsp active dry yeast
3/4 tsp sugar
1 1/2 cups cool water
Olive oil
Kosher salt flakes

Directions:
Combine all dry ingredients and whisk together.
Add water and mix until you have a wet, sticky mass.  If using a stand mixer, stop the mixer as soon as all of the flour and water is mixed.  Do not knead.  Dough will be very sticky and wet, but do not add more flour.
Place dough in a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  Let rest out of direct sunlight for 12 to 18 hours.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface.  Turn dough over itself a few times to make a round.  Cover with a cotton tea towel and let rise an additional 1 to 2 hours.
A half hour before the final rise is complete, preheat your oven to 475 degrees.  If you do not have a baguette pan, preheat a baking stone inside the oven.  Place a pan of water on the lowest shelf.
Cut the dough round in half and shape each into a rough baguette shape.  Do not overwork the dough.  Dust your hands with flour and transfer the dough to the baguette pan or baking stone.
Brush the tops of each loaf with olive oil and sprinkle with salt to taste.  Bake for 15 minutes.
Allow bread to cool for at least one hour before slicing.
