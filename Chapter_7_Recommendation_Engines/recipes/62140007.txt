Ingredients:
4 Large leeks, roughly chopped (use the whole leek including the greens, but discard the roots)
3 T. Butter
4 Large Baking potatoes
7 cups chicken Stock
1 cup Vodka
Salt and White Pepper, to taste
Cream and Chopped Scallions to decorate

Directions:
1. In a stock pot, add the butter and leeks at a medium high heat.  Cooks the leeks until soft, but not browned.
2. Add the potatoes and stock, and bring up to a gentle simmer, but not boiling.  Allow to cook for 20-25 minutes, or until potatoes are soft. At no time should this be allowed to boil, or simmer rapidly!
3. Puree soup in a blender, then sieve back into stockpot.  Add Vodka, and cook at a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally, for an additional 20 minutes.  Again, do not allow it to boil at this stage, but keep it at just barely a simmer.
4. Just before serving, add salt and white pepper to your tastes.  5.  After plating, add a dollop of cream followed by a sprinkling of chopped scallions to each bowl.  Serve, eat, and enjoy!

Description: 
This is a recipe I created with my Lithuanian roommate back home in Dublin.  We took a bog-standard Leek and potato soup recipe, and turned it into something special with the addition of Vodka.  To turn this into a main course soup, add 2 cups of cooked chicken meat at the same stage as the vodka and stir gently.  The alcohol cooks well out, but the vodka gives this dish an interesting sweetness.
