Ingredients:
FOR DOUGH:
1 tablespoon instant yeast
2 tablespoons sugar
1 cup warm water
1/2 cup melted butter
2 eggs
1/4 cup instant potato flakes
1/2 cup warm milk
1 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 -4 1/2 cups bread flour
FOR TOPPING:
1/2 cup olive oil
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon dry parsley flakes
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried sage
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Mix warm milk with potato flakes and set aside to rest 5 minutes.
Place all ingredients for the dough, in bread machine except 1 cup of flour.  Add in the mashed potatoes.
Select dough cycle.
As dough begins to mix you may need to add more flour.  Add flour a little at a time until dough pulls together and away from sides of the pan.  A soft ball should form.  You may not need all of the flour.
Once cycle has completed remove dough to a lightly oiled surface.
Divide in two halves.
Oil two 8 or 9 inch pans well.
Divide each dough half into 12 pieces.
Roll on oiled surface to form balls.
Place in prepared pans.
Let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Combine all of the ingredients for the topping and brush on the risen dough.  Apply liberally. You will have some remaining.
Bake rolls for 25 minutes.
Remove rolls from oven and brush with remaining topping mixture.
Return to oven for 10 minutes.
Rolls are done when internal temperature reaches 190 - 200 degrees by an instaread thermometer.
Cool 10 minutes in pan then remove to a wire rack to finish cooling.
Serve warm.
Rolls freeze and reheat well.
