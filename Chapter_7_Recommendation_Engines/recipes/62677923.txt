Ingredients:
Pie:
1 premade Oreo pie crust
4 ounces Ghirardelli unsweetened chocolate squares
2 sticks butter, softened. (DO NOT USE MARGARINE)
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
4 pasteurized eggs or equivalent fat-free cholesterol-free egg product
Topping:
1 1/2 c. heavy whipping cream
2 T. sugar
1/2 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
1. In a double boiler, melt the chocolate. Set aside to cool slightly.
2. Beat butter until light and fluffy. Add sugar until well mixed.
3. Beat in chocolate and vanilla.
4. Add eggs one at a time. Beat for 5 minutes between each egg. (This is important for dissolving the sugar and allowing the filling to set properly).
5. Pour filling into crust. Chill until set, at least two hours.
Topping:
Whip cream, sugar, and vanilla until stiff peaks form. Spread evenly over set pie.
Garnish with grated semi-sweet Ghirardelli chocolate.
Keep chilled!
