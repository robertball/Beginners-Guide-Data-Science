Ingredients:
1 Vidalia onion (white onion can be used a substitute)
Blue Cheese approximately 3 Tbsp

Directions:
Cut off the bottom (root) of the onion so it will sit flat. This will make it easier to eat later.
Peel onion so that all paper part is removed and only edible onion remains.
Core out about 1/3 the onion. Be careful not to cut so deeply that you go through the bottom! You can save cored out onion for another use.
Fill the onion with blue cheese. About 3 Tbsp. It really depends on the size of the onion that you use and how much onion you  have removed.
Wrap the onion in aluminum foil.
Put on a heated grill for 40 minutes, blue cheese side up.
Remove from grill and serve. Onion will be ready to eat!
Depending on the size of the onion, this may serve 2 people. We like them so much, we usually each get our own.
** white onion can be substituted, if needed!
