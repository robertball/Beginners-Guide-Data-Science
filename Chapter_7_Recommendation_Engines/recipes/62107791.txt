Ingredients:
2 cans of crescent rolls
3 (8 oz.) packages cream cheese, softened
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 stick butter, melted
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
Spread one can of crescent rolls in a 9x13 pan and cover bottom. This will be the bottom crust.
Filling – Mix together cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups sugar and vanilla until creamy. Spread over bottom crust.
Spread 2nd can of crescent rolls over filling as a top crust. Try to spread it around so that it seals the top. It’s kinda hard though after it’s touched the cream cheese mixture. And try to seal the perforated edges of the crescents that will be in the middle of your cheesecake.
Pour the melted butter over the top; mix remaining 1/2 cup sugar with cinnamon and sprinkle over top.
Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Cool, then put in refrigerator. Needs to be served cold.
