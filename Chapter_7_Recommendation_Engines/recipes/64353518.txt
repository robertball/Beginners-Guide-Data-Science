Ingredients:
1 cup rice flour
1 cup shredded coconut
3/4 cup coconut milk
2 cups cooking oil
Coating-Dip:
1/2 cup coconut milk
1/4 cup brown sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix the rice flour, shredded coconut, and coconut milk well until dough is produced.
Form a tablespoon of the dough into a ball-shape and set aside.
Heat a pot on the stove with cooking oil poured in.
Fry the dough balls in that oil on medium heat for ~5 minutes or just until the balls turn a light brownish-tan color.
Turn off the stove and remove the fried balls from the pot, onto a plate lined with paper towels (to absorb any excess oil).
For the brown sugar ball coating/dip, heat up coconut milk in a saucepan. Bring the coconut milk to a boil and then add the 1/4 cup of brown sugar to it, stirring consistently until the liquid thickens.
Once properly thick, remove the liquid from heating, let cool briefly and dip the fried balls into the coating!
Allow to cool a bit more, then serve.
