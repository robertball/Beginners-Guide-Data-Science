Ingredients:
4 thick slices fatty bacon
2 large Idaho potatoes (1 heavy lb), scrubbed but not peeled
Salt and pepper to taste
2 oz (1/2 c) grated cheddar cheese
1 scallion, sliced into thin rounds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250.
Lay the bacon strips in a 12 inch cast iron skillet.
Place over medium heat and cook slowly in order to render the fat.
Remove the bacon to a paper towel to drain. Reduce heat to low to keep bacon fat warm. Dice bacon when cool.
Using a box grater on a clean kitchen towel; grate the potatoes using the largest holes.
Gather the towel ends and twist directly above the potatoes to create a cloth covered potato ball.
Rinse the ball under cool water to remove starch, about 2-3 minutes, then firmly squeeze out excess water.
Turn heat to medium high and reheat bacon fat.
Add the potatoes to the pan by sprinkling them like snow flakes, covering as much of the pan as possible. Avoid clumps of shreds.  Lightly tamp the potatoes down with a spatula.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Let potatoes brown for at least three minutes.  When the potatoes start to crisp, flip the potatoes in two or three sections while adding a bit of olive oil.
Lower heat to medium.
Cook another 3-5 minutes or until the potatoes are crisp on the second side.
Scatter bacon pieces, scallions and cheese on the potatoes.
Place skillet in the oven until cheese melts.
