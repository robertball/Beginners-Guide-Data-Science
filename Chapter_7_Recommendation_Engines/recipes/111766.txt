Ingredients:
2 cups butter, softened
2 cups peanut butter
2 cups white sugar
2 cups brown sugar
4 eggs
4 teaspoons vanilla extract
6 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
24 fun size bars chocolate-coated caramel-peanut nougat candy
1/2 cup white sugar, for sprinkling

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper, and set aside.
Beat together the butter, peanut butter, 2 cups white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl, stirring until well mixed and creamy. Mix in the vanilla extract and eggs.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Mix the flour mixture, one cup at a time, into the butter mixture, and stir until you have a smooth dough.
Scoop up 1/4 cup of dough per cookie, and form it into a ball around a fun size candy bar. Set the balls onto a baking sheet at least 6 inches apart, and flatten each ball with a fork in a cross-hatch pattern, making sure the cookie dough is still fully covering the candy bar. Sprinkle each cookie with about 1/2 teaspoon white sugar.
Bake the cookies in the preheated oven until the cookies are slightly browned around the edges, 12 to 14 minutes.

Description: 
I grew up thinking that a snickerdoodle involved an actual Snickers, and a white cookie with cinnamon sugar was called something else. I have been educated, but the name still sticks. These are large peanut butter cookies with your favorite fun size candy bar stuffed in the middle.
