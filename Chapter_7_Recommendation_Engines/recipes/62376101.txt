Ingredients:
2 tbs salted butter
6 Eggs
1 cup of Flour
1 cup of Milk
1/4 tsp Salt
1/2 tsp Vanilla
1/2 tsp Cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Put butter in an 11 x 9 glass baking dish.  Once the oven is heated put your dish with butter inside for about 5 minutes or until butter is melted but not burned. Mix remaining ingredients untill smooth and pour directly into the hot dish with butter.  Bake for about 20-25 min.
Pour your favorite syrup over it or just dust powdered sugar on top.  There's not mucch need to add more butter because it's already baked onto the top and forms a delicious salty/buttery crust.
