Ingredients:
1 (12.4 ounce) package cheese-flavored crackers (such as Cheez-It®)
2 cups small pretzels
2 cups crispy rice cereal squares (such as Rice Chex®)
1 cup honey-roasted peanuts
4 tablespoons vegetable oil, or more as needed
3 tablespoons barbeque seasoning
1 1/2 teaspoons ground paprika

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine crackers, pretzels, cereal squares, and peanuts in a large bowl. Slowly drizzle oil over cracker mixture and gently stir mixture with your hands until well coated, adding more oil, if necessary.
Combine barbecue seasoning and paprika in a small bowl. Add to cracker mixture and toss gently until coated. Spread out on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring halfway through. Allow to fully cool before serving or storing.
