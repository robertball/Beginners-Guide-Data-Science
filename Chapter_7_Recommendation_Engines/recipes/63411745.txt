Ingredients:
1/2 rack of Beef ribs, about 5 lbs.
2 tsp. Garlic Powder (or fresh crushed)
1 tsp. Fresh Ground Black Pepper
1 tsp. Cinnamon
1 tsp. Kosher Salt
4 cups Beef Broth
1 bottle BBQ Sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven at 350 F.
Mix Garlic Powder, Ground Black Pepper, Cinnamon and Kosher Salt in a small bowl. Cut ribs apart and generously apply rub to each rib. Let ribs sit for 30 minutes.
While the ribs are sitting, pour about 4 cups of Beef Broth into a roaster pan. Add the ribs (on their side) into the pan so that the broth covers the bottom and is partially covering the ribs. Cover roast pan with tightly fitting aluminum foil. Place pan in the oven (it's heavy). Cook for 2 hr. 15 min.
At 1 hour, flip ribs and re-seal foil.
At 2 hours (or until meat is cooked), remove from current tray and onto a cookie sheet. Add BBQ sauce of your choice on the ribs. Cook for another 5-15 minutes. Take out of oven and let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
