5 lb. chuck roast
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp. Italian seasoning
1 tsp. oregano
1/2 tsp. black pepper

12 oz. can beer
1/2 packet onion soup mix

Directions:
Trim beef of fat if desired.  Combine all ingredients in slow cooker.  Use the full jar of pepproncinis, including juice.  You can use more or less pepproncini depending on your taste.  Cover and cook on high for 8 hours.  Uncover and shread meat and peppers (meat should fall apart).  Leave meat and juice in crock pot and serve warm on crusty hoagie rolls, being sure to spoon some juice over each sandwich.

Description: 
This is the best Italian Beef recipe I've ever tried.  The beef comes out tender and juicy, and it has a nice kick from the pepproncinis.
