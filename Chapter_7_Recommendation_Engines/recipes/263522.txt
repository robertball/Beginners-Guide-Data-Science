Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pound asparagus spears, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
salt to taste
1 squeeze lemon juice, or to taste
1 (10 ounce) basket cherry tomatoes, halved
Dressing:
2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add asparagus and stir-fry until tender but still firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and drizzle with lemon juice. Place in a bowl and add cherry tomatoes.
Stir vinegar, mustard, sugar, and salt together in a small bowl. Pour in olive oil and mix well. Drizzle dressing over asparagus and tomatoes and mix well. Serve warm.

Description: 
You can eat this asparagus salad cold and use leftover cooked asparagus but I prefer it when the asparagus is still a little bit warm. Tastes great with meat or fish dishes.
