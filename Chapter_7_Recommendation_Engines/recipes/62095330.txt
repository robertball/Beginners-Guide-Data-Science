Ingredients:
100g dried apricots
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 - 3 cloves finely chopped garlic
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons paprika
450g lamb or beef mince
4 sticks of celery, cut into 1cm pieces
1 large green pepper, sliced
450g tomatoes, sliced roughly
1 lemon
300ml water
1 tablespoon sugar
salt & black pepper

Directions:
Soak the apricots in water for 2 hours or more and then drain.
Heat the olive oil in a fairly large, heavy saucepan over a moderate heat.  Add the garlic and spices and stir for 1 minute.  Then add the mince, stirring and breaking it up with a wooden spoon over a slightly higher heat for a few minutes until browned.  Add the drained apricots and the celery, pepper and tomato.
Shave 5 - 6 strips of rind off the lemon and add to the soup with the juice of the lemon.  Stir in the water and then season with the sugar and salt and black pepper.  Bring to the boil, cover the pan and simmer gently for half an hour.

Description: 
[Using european measurements]

I just had to share this with you all!  This soup, which is more like a stew, is sustaining enough to make a complete meal if accompanied by some good, crusty bread.  The meat, combined with spices and with a tang of lemon and apricots, has the flavour of North Africa.  The apricots need to soak for about 2 hours.
