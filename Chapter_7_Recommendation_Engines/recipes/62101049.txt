Ingredients:
1 block 1/3 less fat cream cheese, softened
1 pkg. Oreos
1 8oz. bar semi-sweet baking chocoate
4 tbs. solid Crisco
White Chocolate chips for melting, if desired.
Solid Crisco (for making chocolate melt easier)

Directions:
Crush Oreos in a large zip top bag then chop the pieces in a food processor until very fine.
Combine softened cream cheese and Oreo crumbs in stand mixer until fully combined. (Mixture will look like thick soil).
Roll into 3/4 inch balls and place on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper.  Place in fridge to chill for about an hour.
Place about an inch of water in the bottom of a spaghetti pot, place a shallow metal bowl over the top and turn heat to low(make sure water is not touching the bowl). In the bowl, melt baking chocolate with 2 tablespoons of Crisco.  (I find the shallow bowl method works better than a double boiler).
Using a spoon, dip chilled balls into chocolate, coat thoroughly and place back on wax paper.
Place back in the fridge to cool.  You're done unless you want to make them a little fancier by drizzling with white chocolate.  If so, melt chocolate in the same way, and once the chocolate coating on the balls has cooled, drizzle with the white.
Keep in an air-tight container in the fridge and impress!!!!
Note: This works great with mint or peanut butter Oreos as well!
