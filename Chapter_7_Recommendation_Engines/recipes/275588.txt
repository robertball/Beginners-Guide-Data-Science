Ingredients:
1 cup heavy whipping cream
3/4 cup whole milk
1/4 teaspoon ground espresso beans
1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons Dutch dark cocoa powder
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine whipping cream and milk in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook for 2 minutes. Stir in ground espresso. Gently add chocolate chips and stir continuously until chocolate melts and is fully blended with the cream mixture, making sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan.
Stir in brown sugar until dissolved, reducing heat to low when the mixture starts to boil. Mix in cocoa powder until incorporated. Add butter; stir until melted. Stir in vanilla extract. Continue stirring over low heat until mixture is dark brown and smooth.
Pass the mixture through a fine strainer to remove espresso granules, then pour into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions, about 20 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.
