Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted*
1 1/2 teaspoons nutmeg
1 cup skim milk
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 cups flour
1/2 cup sugar mixed with 1 teaspoon cinnamon, for finishing the muffins

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
Combine the first three ingredients in a large bowl and stir until well blended.
Add the milk and mix thoroughly.
Add the baking powder and flour and still until combined.
Pour the batter into a 12-cup greased muffin tin (fill each cup about 3/4 full).
Bake until set and beginning to turn golden at the edges, about 15 minutes.
One at a time, remove each muffin from the tin and roll it in the cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat.
Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
These muffins taste just like cake doughnuts, I swear! Even the consistency is pretty close -- a little fluffier, a little less dense, but still very doughnutty.

Not to mention that the recipe is wicked simple; it doesn't even require you to break out your mixer, just one big bowl.
