Ingredients:
3 pounds Roma (plum) tomatoes, quartered
1 yellow onion, halved and quartered
1/2 cup coarsely chopped red bell pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
3 cloves garlic, halved
5 cups low-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line two 10x15-inch baking pans with parchment paper.
Arrange tomatoes, onion, and bell pepper in a single layer on the prepared baking pans. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Add garlic; continue roasting until mixture is tender, about 15 minutes more.
Bring broth to a boil in a large pot over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, covered.
Meanwhile, put 1/2 of the tomato mixture in a blender. Cover and pulse 3 times, then blend until smooth, adding hot broth as needed. Pour into the pot with broth. Repeat with remaining tomato mixture, then stir into the pot until combined.
Simmer soup to heat through, about 5 minutes. Stir in basil and parsley.
