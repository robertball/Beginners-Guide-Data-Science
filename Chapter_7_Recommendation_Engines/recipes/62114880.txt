Ingredients:
2 medium eggplants
2 tennis ball sized balls of fresh mozzarella
6 large roma tomatoes
15-20 leaves fresh basil
1 1/2 cups italian seasoned bread crumbs
6 eggs

Directions:
Peel each eggplant then slice into 1 cm thick rounds.  Slice mozzarella and tomatoes approximately 1/2 cm thick each.
Beat the eggs together and pour into a container deep enough for dipping.  Pour breadcrumbs into a similar size container.
Dip each slice of eggplant first into the egg, covering all sides evenly, and then into the breadcrumbs, again ensuring all sides are evenly coated.
On medium heat, warm a non-stick flying pan on with nonstick cooking spray.  When warm, arrange as many slices of eggplant that fit with room to turn.  When underside is crispy (2-4 minutes), coat the uncooked side with nonstick cooking spray and then flip and continue to cook until both sides are evenly brown and eggplant is tender.
Continue cooking all of the eggplant slice in this manner.  When all slices are cooked, layer as many as possible on the bottom of a 13x9 pan.
Top each piece of eggplant with one basil leaf, one tomato slice, and one slice of mozzarella.  Add another piece of eggplant to the top of each stack and top with tomato and cheese.
Bake for 5 minutes at 275 degrees, or until cheese is softened but not melted.  Delicious alongside pasta with fresh tomato and basil sauce.  Enjoy!
