Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs, milk and oil. Beat in flour and salt just until smooth (do not overbeat). Using two 12-cup muffin tins, grease and flour six alternating cups in each pan. Fill ungreased muffins cups two-thirds full with water. Fill greased muffin cups two-thirds full with batter. Sprinkle bacon over batter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until puffed and golden.  Serve warm. Refrigerate any leftovers.
