Ingredients:
2 cups plain flour
1 cup self-rising flour
3 sticks unsalted butter
6 eggs

3 cups sugar

Directions:
Sift and measure the flour. Set aside. Cream butter with sugar.  Gradually add eggs, sour cream and extract. Mix wet mixture to dry ingredients.  Do not over mix. Pour into greased and sugared 10" tube pan (sugar gives the cake a sweet sparkly coating on the outside).
