Description: 
This is a very dense fudgy pie that will satisfy the chocoholics in your life. It's a snap to whip up and a frozen or refrigerated pie crust will speed things up even more! I created the recipe when I couldn't find a chocolate chess pie without too much sugar in it. This has 1/2 the sugar of most chess pies.
