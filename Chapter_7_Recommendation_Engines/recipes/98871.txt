Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1 1/4 pounds ground turkey
1 (10 ounce) box frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1 jalapeno pepper, stemmed, seeded, and minced
1/4 cup mango chutney
4 small (4 inch) pitas breads, white or whole-wheat, split

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over low heat. Mix salt, pepper, ginger, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, and cloves in a small bowl. Break up turkey in a medium bowl. Add spinach, spices, and jalapeno; mix lightly with a fork to combine. Divide mixture into four portions and form into patties.
Increase heat under skillet to medium-high. Cook burgers until well browned, about 4 to 6 minutes each side. Reduce heat to low and continue to cook, partially covered, until burgers are cooked through, about 5 minutes longer.
To serve, place a burger in each of the 4 pitas. Top each with chutney. Serve immediately.
