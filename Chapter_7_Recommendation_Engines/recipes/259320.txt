Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water (80 degrees F (27 degrees C))
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons salt
3 tablespoons powdered milk
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup very finely chopped pecans
4 cups whole wheat bread flour
2 1/2 teaspoons yeast
1/2 cup chopped dried cranberries

Directions:
Place water, olive oil, brown sugar, salt, powdered milk, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, pecans, flour, yeast, and cranberries in a bread machine in the order listed. Run "dough" cycle. Check dough halfway through kneading cycle to ensure it has a tacky consistency.
Grease a loaf pan. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Shape into a loaf; place in the loaf pan. Cover loosely with a towel or waxed paper and let rise in warm place until doubled, 30 to 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool.
