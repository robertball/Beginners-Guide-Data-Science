Ingredients:
Chicken:
2 tablespoons chopped lemongrass
1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts
Dressing:
1/4 cup fish sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon water
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
Salad:
1 (8 ounce) package dried rice noodles
2 cups shredded lettuce
1 cup bean sprouts
1/2 cup grated carrot
1/2 cup grated cucumber
1/4 cup torn mint leaves

Directions:
Mix lemongrass, 1 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, and garlic together in a bowl until sugar is dissolved; add chicken and turn to coat in the marinade.
Marinate chicken in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to 1 hour.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Transfer chicken to the hot grill, discarding marinade. Grill chicken until no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Whisk fish sauce, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, rice vinegar, white sugar, water, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl to make dressing.
Place noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Let soak until softened, about 15 minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly.
Combine noodles, lettuce, bean sprouts, carrot, cucumber, and mint leaves in a large bowl. Slice grilled chicken and arrange over salad; drizzle dressing on top.
