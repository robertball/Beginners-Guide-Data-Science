Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 tablespoon dried thyme
1/2 cup chopped Granny Smith apples
ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup Gorgonzola cheese at room temperature, crumbled
2 thick cut pork chops
1/2 teaspoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic
1/4 cup Gorgonzola cheese
3 tablespoons dry sherry
1/8 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup chicken broth
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
To make the apple stuffing: In a saute pan or skillet on medium heat, melt the butter and saute thyme, chopped apples, salt and pepper together until the apples are completely softened; about 15 to 20 minutes.
Place the apple mixture in a bowl and mix in 1/4 cup Gorgonzola cheese.  The cheese should liquefy into the stuffing within a couple of minutes.
To prepare the pork chops: Butterfly the pork chops by slicing them parallel to the plane of the chop from the fat side to the bone.  Stuff each one with about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the apple mixture.
Bake the chops for about 1 hour.  Place the chops on a rack with the two stuffing sides pressed together to hold the stuffing inside the chops.
To make the sauce: Heat the oil in a saute pan or skillet on medium heat, then saute the garlic until transparent, and the cheese until slightly melting.  Immediately add the sherry, let cook for a minute until combined, then add the cream and 1/4 cup of the chicken stock, salt and pepper.  Stir until well blended.  Stir occasionally and reduce the liquid on medium high heat until the sauce begins to toast/caramelize and turn darker brown.  Add the remaining 1/4 cup chicken stock, reincorporate the cheese and continue reducing until there is just 1/4 to 1/2 cup of thick liquid remaining.
