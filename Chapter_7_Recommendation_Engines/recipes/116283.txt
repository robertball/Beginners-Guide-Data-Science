Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
4 tablespoons sugar, divided
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 tablespoons cold butter
2/3 cup chopped dates
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/3 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in butter until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Stir in dates. Combine eggs and milk; stir into crumb mixture just until blended (dough will be soft).
Turn onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands, gently knead dough 10 times. Pat into a 9-in. x 6-in. rectangle. Using a floured knife, cut into six 3-in. squares; cut each square diagonally in half.
Place on a greased baking sheet. Combine the cinnamon and remaining sugar; sprinkle over scones. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to a wire rack.

Description: 
My kids love to help make these scones for Sunday morning breakfast. They also love to eat them-the dates are chewy and sweet.  Roni Goodell, Spanish Fork, Utah
