Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
3/4 cup chopped onion
3 cloves crushed garlic
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/2 (12 ounce) package firm tofu, cubed
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon sherry
4 1/2 cups water
2 cups grated carrots
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach
1/4 cup miso paste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Pour oil into the bottom of a large saucepan, and place over medium heat. Add onion; saute until tender and almost brown. Add garlic and ginger; saute until fragrant, just a minute or two. Add tofu. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned; this should take about 5 minutes
Stir in soy sauce, thoroughly coating tofu. Add water and sherry. Bring back up to heat, and add carrots and spinach. Heat through.
Thin miso with some of the soup, and add back into the soup.  Simmer over medium low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with black pepper to taste.  Serve.

Description: 
This is not a fishy soup like those that are kelp based. Let this soup mellow overnight for best taste. Like all vegetable soups, measures are approximate and substitutions can include whatever vegetable you want. Mushrooms of any kind are particularly good in this soup.
