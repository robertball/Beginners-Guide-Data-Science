Description: 
Quick, easy burrito/taco filling that is delicious and freezes great! I serve this with tortillas, shredded Cheddar cheese and little sour cream. You could fill the tortillas and put them all in a baking dish and then cover with salsa and cheese and bake for about 10 minutes, if you don't want a mess at the table.
