1 cup diced onion
1 1/2 cups water
1 (16 ounce) can fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 (15.5 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1/2 cup uncooked ditalini (very short tubular macaroni)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion, and saute 3 minutes or until tender. Add the water and next 6 ingredients (water through tomatoes). Bring mixture to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add pasta, and cook 9 minutes or until pasta is tender. Stir in chopped parsley.
