Ingredients:
3 chicken breats, skinless, boneless
2 cups chicken broth
1 tsp salt
1 1/2 cups potatoes, peeled and chopped
1 1/2 cups carrots, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
1 can cream of broccoli soup
8oz container of sour cream
1/2 cup mayo
1 tsp ground rosemary
1 tsp ground thyme
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp ground black pepper
salt if preferred (soup has salt in it)
1 1/2 cups of bisquick
1 cup milk
1 tsp baking soda
5 TBLSP margarine, melted

Directions:
1. Preheat oven 350 degrees. In a heavy pot pour 2 cups of chicken broth. Add the chicken breast and salt. Let it boil on medium heat for 20 minutes.  Take chicken out of pot to cool and when cool enough to touch, shred by using your hands into a big bowl and set aside.
2. Put chopped potatoes, carrots and onion into same pot of broth. If needed, add enough water so the vegetables are covered. On medium heat let vegetables boil for 10 minutes. You don't want the vegetables to be mushy just til they are tender. Drain the broth, reserve 1 cup of broth, from the vegetables and add vegetables to the chicken.
3. In a separate bowl stir soup, reserved broth, sour cream, mayo and spices until creamy. Pour this over the chicken and vegetables and stir. Grease a 9x13 inch pan. Pour all ingredients into pan.
5. In a separate bowl stir bisquick, milk, baking soda, and margarine until smooth. Pour this over the chicken mixture and bake for 30 minutes.
