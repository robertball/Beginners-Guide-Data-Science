Ingredients:
6 large potatoes, peeled and quartered
1/4 cup skim milk
1 pound ground pork sausage
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 (1 pound) loaf dry white bread, crusts removed and cubed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash with milk.
Meanwhile, place sausage in a large, deep skillet.  Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown.   Stir in green pepper and onion and cook for about 5 minutes.
Fold cubed bread into potatoes, then gently fold in sausage mixture.  Transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, or until heated through.
