Ingredients:
3/4 cup Molasses
1 cup Oatmeal
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 teaspoon salt
1  tablespoon white sugar (will be used in two stages)
1-1/2 cups boiling water
4 1/2 cups bread flour
2-1/2 teaspoons  yeast (Yeast below
1/4 cup warm water (100 degrees)
1 1/2 cups Raisins

Add1/4 cup warm water to sugar in the cup.  Add yeast and set aside.
Add flour to Oatmeal mixture.  Add Yeast mixture.
Set the pan in the machine.  Set the timer for dough setting Check your ownerâ€™s manual mine says that this setting has a pre-kneed time of 2 minutes then a kneed of 25 minutes then first rise of 73 min.  Set your time for 5 minutes less (ie 20 minutes) then add raisins.  Let the bread maker run the full dough cycle (approx. 1 hour) this depends on the machine you have.
Grease two bread pans and set aside
Empty dough on top of a slightly floured service.   Knock down but do not kneed.   Separate into two loafs and place in prepared pans.  Cover with damp towel and allow to rise for about 1 hour.
Bake in oven in a 350 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until bread is hallow.   Cool in pan for about 20 minutes then remove and place on cooling rack.
