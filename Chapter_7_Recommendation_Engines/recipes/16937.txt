Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dried navy beans
1 meaty beef roast bone
2 (14.5 ounce) cans peeled and diced tomatoes
1 1/2 cups red wine
3 tablespoons dried minced onion flakes
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon paprika
1 tablespoon celery seed
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes
water to cover

Directions:
Soak the beans in water overnight, rinse well and drain.
In a slow cooker, combine the soaked beans, meat bones, tomatoes, red wine, parsley, paprika, celery seed, bay leaves, seasoned salt, garlic powder, sugar, ground black pepper and crushed red pepper flakes. Add water to cover.
Cook on low setting for 3 to 4 hours, or until beans are tender. Remove the bones and strip and shred any meat from the bones. Discard the bones and return the meat to the slow cooker. Allow to heat through.

Description: 
This very hearty soup is easy and can be adjusted depending on what meat bones you may have on hand. This is a great way to use up any left over roast from a previous meal. We used a bone from a leg of lamb and a beef rib roast originally cooked on the charcoal grill for a family holiday celebration, and the flavor was extraordinarily rich. Serve with crusty bread.
