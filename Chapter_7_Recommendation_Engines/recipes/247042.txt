Ingredients:
1 quart water
¼ cup salt
¼ cup white sugar
¼ cup hot sauce
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into strips
1 cup all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
½ teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
½ teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon white sugar
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
cooking spray

Directions:
Mix water, 1/4 cup salt, 1/4 cup sugar, and hot sauce together in a large bowl until sugar and salt are dissolved into the brine. Place chicken pieces in the brine and refrigerate, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Pour brine from the bowl.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a baking rack onto a baking sheet and coat rack with cooking spray.
Combine flour, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, and black pepper in a shallow bowl until coating is well mixed. Press chicken pieces into the coating until both sides are evenly coated; place on the prepared rack.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Spray each chicken piece with cooking spray; flip and spray the other side. Continue baking until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Heat oil in a small pan over medium heat until shimmering. Mix 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder together in a bowl; add to oil and cook for 30 seconds. Brush oil mixture onto cooked chicken, adding more layers for extra heat.
