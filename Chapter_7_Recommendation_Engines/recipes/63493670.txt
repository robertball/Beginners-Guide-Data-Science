Ingredients:
1 lb. diced Pork Cubes
1 packets Sezon with Achoite(Goya makes this)
3 c. rice
1 jar green olives
3 tsp. garlic
1 cup Recaito (Goya makes this)
1 can gandules (Pigeon Peas)-(also goya)~can sub black beans
2 cans water

Directions:
In a large stock pan, brown diced pork cubes with garlic.
Add recaito, Sezon, gandules and green olives and simmer about 10 minutes.
Rinse the rice and add to pan and stir until rice is coated.
Add 1.5 cans water. The consistancy is very important at this point. Too much water, and you end up with mushy rice. too little water, and it's dry. You should be able to stir it and it should look like a dense soup. ~Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Open..and stir around. Don't scrape the bottom of pan..but stir towards the top. check rice..you might need about 10 more minutes. Ideally..the rice should be almost 'dry'. there will be a crust on the bottom of the pan. My kids LOVE this crust and fight over it. Great with Hot sauce added too.~You can add leftover chicken in this. It's a very forgiving recipe.
