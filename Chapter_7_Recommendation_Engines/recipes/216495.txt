Ingredients:
4 large egg whites
1 teaspoon water
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon red onion, finely minced
1 cup packed baby spinach leaves
2 slices Weight Watchers Cheese Singles
1 Weight Watchers Wheat English Muffin, split and toasted

Directions:
Combine egg whites, water, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and set aside. Do not whisk or beat egg whites.
Heat a medium nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat and lightly coat with nonstick spray. Add red onion and saute until soft, 1-2 minutes. Stir in spinach and continue cooking until spinach wilts, 1-2 minutes.
Add egg-white mixture and cook until egg whites are opaque, about 3 minutes; using a large spatula, flip over and cook until other side is done, 1-2 minutes. Push eggs and vegetables with spatula to middle of pan and turn off heat. Place Weight Watchers Cheese Singles over eggs until melted, 1-2 minutes. Using spatula, divide and scoop equal amounts egg-and-vegetable mixture onto each English muffin half.
