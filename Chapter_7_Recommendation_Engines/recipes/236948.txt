Remove plastic wrap from candies. Separate gummy candies from dish using a spatula or your fingers. Cover candies with a new piece of plastic wrap; refrigerate, 4 to 6 hours.

Description: 
Best vodka-infused gummies on the net! I use Three Olives速 or Van Gogh速 vodka. Haribo速 or Black Forest速 gummy candy work best. Serve them with a slotted metal or wood spoon, using any non-plastic container. Drink the extra vodka if desired.
