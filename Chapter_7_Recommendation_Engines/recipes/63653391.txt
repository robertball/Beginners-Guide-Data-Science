Ingredients:
2 pounds sweet potatoes
3-4 Tbsp olive oil
Kosher salt
DRESSING
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro (including tender stems)
1 teaspoon of lime zest or lemon zest
2 tablespoons of fresh lime or lemon juice
1/4 cup olive oil
Pinch of salt

Directions:
1.   Prepare your grill for hot, direct heat. While the grill is heating up, peel the sweet potatoes and slice lengthwise, or on a diagonal, into 1/4 inch-thick pieces. Coat the sweet potato slices with olive oil and lightly sprinkle with Kosher salt.
2.   Combine all of the dressing ingredients into a small bowl.
3.  Once the grill is hot, lay the sweet potato pieces down onto the grill grates. Cover the grill and cook until each side gets some grill marks, between 3-6 minutes for each side, depending on how hot your grill is.
4.  Toss the sweet potatoes in a bowl with the dressing and serve hot.
