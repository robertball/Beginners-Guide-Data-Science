Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup(1/2 of 8-oz. pkg)Cream Cheese
1-1/2 cups  flour
1 cup fresh berries
1/3 cup granulated sugar
2 tsp. cornstarch
1 tsp. lemon zest
1 egg
1 tsp. water
1 Tbsp. coarse sugar

Directions:
Use pulsing action to process butter, cream cheese spread and flour in food processor until mixture is well blended and forms ball. Divide dough in half; shape each half into ball. Wrap individually in plastic wrap. Refrigerate 1 hour.
Heat oven to 375ÂºF. Toss berries with granulated sugar, cornstarch and lemon zest.
Roll out 1 ball of dough into 14x7-inch rectangle on lightly floured surface. Cut lengthwise in half, then cut each strip crosswise in half. Repeat with remaining dough.
Beat egg and water until blended. Spoon 1/4 cup berry mixture onto one end of each dough strip. Brush edges of dough with egg; fold in half. Seal edges with fork; place on parchment-covered baking sheets. Cut small slits in tops to allow steam to escape; brush with any remaining egg. Sprinkle with coarse sugar.
Bake 35 to 40 min. or until juices are bubbly and pastries are golden brown.
