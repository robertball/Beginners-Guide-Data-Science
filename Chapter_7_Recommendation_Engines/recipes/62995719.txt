Ingredients:
½ Cup Dried Cranberries
½ Cup peeled and grated Apple
1 Teaspoons Baking powder
2 Cups Whole wheat Flour
1 Teaspoon Cinnamon
1 Cup applesauce
¼ Cup Milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease cookie sheets (I use my Pampered Chef large stoneware bar pans.
In a large bowl mix together all the ingredients except for the milk. Add the milk a bit at a time as required (Slightly more or less milk may be required, depends on how juicy your apples are). The mixture should form a soft dough.
Kneed dough on a floured surface for a good minute. Roll the dough out until ¼ inch think. Cut with your favorite cookie cutter.
Bake in the hot oven for 15 minutes, once the initial 15 minutes is up. Turn off the oven but leave the biscuits in the warm but off over for a further 30 minutes to crisp.
