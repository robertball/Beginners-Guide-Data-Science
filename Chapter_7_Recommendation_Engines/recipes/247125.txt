Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 leeks, sliced
1/2 cup chopped green garlic
3 red potatoes, chopped
4 mini eggplants, chopped
4 small zucchini, chopped
1 bunch kale, stemmed and chopped
1 head lettuce, chopped
6 cups water
5 teaspoons vegetable bouillon (such as Better Than BouillonÂ®)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Add leeks and green garlic; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Add red potatoes, eggplants, and zucchini. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, about 15 minutes.
Stir kale and lettuce into the Dutch oven until wilted. Pour in water and vegetable bouillon. Bring soup to a boil; simmer, covered, until flavors combine, about 1 hour.
Blend soup using a hand immersion blender until creamy.

Description: 
A great way to use all of those CSA veggies and it's creamy and vegan. You can really use any vegetables in this and different amounts. You can't even taste the lettuce or kale.
