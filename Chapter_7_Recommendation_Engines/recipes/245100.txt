Ingredients:
4 strips bacon
3/4 cup chopped onion
3/4 cup chopped celery
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1 (14.5 ounce) can SwansonÂ® Chicken Broth
1/4 cup prepared salsa, hot or mild
1 tablespoon chopped cilantro
1/2 cup Mexican cheese blend, shredded
4 ounces tortilla strips

Directions:
Place bacon in a large saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble.
Saute onion and celery in reserved bacon drippings over medium-high heat until tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in beans, crumbled bacon, oregano, chili powder, and garlic powder. When beans have softened, add Swanson(R) Chicken Broth and salsa. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer covered until flavors have blended, about 15 minutes.
Garnish with cilantro and cheese. Serve with tortilla strips.
