Description: 
Did you need to eat dinner five minutes ago but are still trying to look out for your health?  This recipe for pinto beans simmered with onion and jalapeños is quick and filling.  Serve with rice to satisfy your protein needs without eating meat.  I like my food picante, so I use about 1/4 teaspoon cayenne.  However, you can adjust this level to suit your personal taste.
