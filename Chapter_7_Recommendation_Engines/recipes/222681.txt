Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cauliflower florets
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 cup sweet corn
1/4 cup sesame seeds
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup lemon juice
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon soy sauce (optional)
2 cups arugula, coarsely chopped
1 cup green onions, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano (optional)

Directions:
Bring a saucepan filled with water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and simmer until barely tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain.
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir cauliflower and corn until cauliflower is tender and corn is heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in sesame seeds, 1 tablespoon honey, turmeric, salt, and black pepper; transfer vegetables to a large bowl.
Whisk parsley, 1/2 cup olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, 1 tablespoon honey, vinegar, Dijon mustard, and soy sauce in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
Mix arugula and green onion into cauliflower mixture. Pour parsley dressing over vegetables and toss to combine. Sprinkle oregano over salad. Refrigerate until chilled 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
I just love cauliflower and arugula, but never knew how to put them together. I had several attempts and finally came up with this salad. It's a fusion of citrusy and sweet that explodes in your mouth. This is a perfect appetizer if you are serving roasted chicken or seafood.
