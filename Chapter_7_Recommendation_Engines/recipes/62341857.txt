Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh asparagus, washed and trimmed.
1 small red onion, very thinly sliced
2 teaspoons lemon and pepper seasoning
1 Tablespoon Country Dijon mustard
1 Tablespoon red wine vinegar
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 cup olive oil

Directions:
Steam asparagus until crisp tender.  Rinse with cold water and chill either in the refrigerator or in a bowl of ice water (depending on how quickly you need to serve.)
Lay asparagus neatly in a row (one or two levels deep depending on your amount) on a platter and top evenly with red onion.
Combine remaining ingredients in a measuring cup or small bowl, stirring vigorously until they 'gel.'
Pour evenly down the center of the asparagus and serve.

Description: 
My friend Kate's way of serving asparagus cold - this is a great summertime side.  The vinaigrette cools the heat of the onion nicely.
