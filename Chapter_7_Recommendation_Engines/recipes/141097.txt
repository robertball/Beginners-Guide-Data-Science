Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) pork tenderloins, trimmed of fat
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons sugar or sugar substitute
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon smooth natural peanut butter
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place pork in a large resealable plastic bag. Mix together soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, peanut butter, garlic, curry powder, ginger, and salt in a bowl until smooth. Pour marinade over tenderloins, press air out of bag, seal, and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.
Use a paper towel to pat any excess marinade from the pork; allow to sit at room temperature while the grill is heating. Lightly oil grill grate. Cook pork 3 minutes on each side (on all four sides) for a total of 12 to 15 minutes. The pork will be done when it is no longer pink inside and has reached an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C). Remove from the grill and cover meat loosely with a foil tent. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.
