1 tsp salt (to taste)
Paprika or nutmeg to sprinkle over the top

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F.
Place sweet potato and kale into a 2 Qt casserole dish (with lid).
Place all of the cheesy sauce ingredients into a blender. Blend on high for a minute or two until smooth and creamy
Pour the cheesy sauce evenly over the vegetables, lightly sprinkle with paprika or nutmeg. and cover with a lid.
Bake in oven for 30-50 minutes. Check the sweet potato to check how well it is cooked through at 30 min. Place back in the oven for 10 to 20 minutes until the sweet potatoes are cooked through to your liking.
