Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
1 teaspoon taco seasoning mix
1 cup sour cream
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup prepared guacamole
1 cup diced tomatoes
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons sliced black olives
2 tablespoons finely sliced green onions
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Use left over chicken breasts or prepare as follows:
Place the chicken, 1 1/2 tablespoons of cilantro, and vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat, and pan-fry the chicken breasts until lightly golden brown, no longer pink in the middle, and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken and set aside. When cooled, cut into cubes.
Cook refried beans into the skillet until the beans are hot and bubbling, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix the taco seasoning and sour cream together in a bowl.
To assemble, spread the hot bean and bacon mixture into the bottom of an 8x8-inch glass dish. Sprinkle the chicken cubes over the bean mixture, then follow with these layers: 3/4 cup of Cheddar cheese, guacamole, sour cream mixture, and sliced tomatoes. Sprinkle the top with 1 1/2 tablespoons of cilantro, black olives, green onions, and 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar cheese.
