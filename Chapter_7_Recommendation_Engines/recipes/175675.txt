Description: 
Surprisingly mild and easy to make, this dish takes to substitutions well depending on what you have in the house. Despite the name, even my young children enjoy this chicken! It's quick, easy, and something different for dinner. Apple juice may be substituted for the applesauce and wine. Grainy, spicier mustards will create a spicier sauce; mild or sweet mustards will create a milder sauce.
