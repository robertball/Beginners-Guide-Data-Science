Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cornstarch
1 1/2 cups icing sugar
1 cup sweet rice flour (mochiko)
1 cup tapioca starch
2/3 cup sorghum flour
1/3 cup fine white rice flour
2 1/4 cups butter, softened

Directions:
Sift cornstarch, icing sugar, sweet rice flour, tapioca, sorghum, and white rice flours together in a large bowl. Blend in butter until a soft, smooth dough forms.
Shape dough into 1-inch-thick logs. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until firm, 30 to 60 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Slice cold dough into 1/8-inch rounds. Place rounds 1 1/2 inches apart on a cookie sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are firm and tops are still pale, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool.
