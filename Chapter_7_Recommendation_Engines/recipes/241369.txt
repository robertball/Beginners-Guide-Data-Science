Ingredients:
Roasting:
2 large heads cauliflower, cut into pieces
2 large red onions, cut into wedges
2 cloves garlic, chopped, or more to taste
canola oil cooking spray (optional)
Cream Sauce:
2 cups plain soy milk
1 (14 ounce) package firm tofu, cut into cubes
1/2 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella-style vegan cheese (such as DaiyaÂ®)
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
2 tablespoons onion powder
1 tablespoon lemon juice, or more to taste
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 tablespoon dried marjoram
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste
3 large large kale leaves, minced, or more to taste
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread cauliflower, onions, and garlic onto a large baking sheet. Spray canola oil spray over cauliflower mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Transfer cauliflower mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Blend soy milk, tofu, vegan cheese, nutritional yeast, onion powder, lemon juice, basil, marjoram, oregano, parsley, garlic powder, and black pepper in a food processor or blender until sauce is creamy.
Pour sauce into a saucepan and cook over medium-low heat until warmed, about 5 minutes. Add kale to sauce and cook until kale is wilted, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce over cauliflower mixture and add tomatoes; mix well.
Bake in the oven until bubbling and lightly browned, about 40 minutes.
