Description: 
This is a warm French toast dish my step-mom made once years ago, and my kids have never stopped asking for it.  Now they are making it for their kids! Drizzle melted butter over each serving, sprinkle with powdered sugar, and serve with warm maple syrup. Strawberries can be used in place of blueberries.
