Ingredients:
2 butternut squash, halved and seeded
Softened butter, for rubbing on squash, plus 2 tablespoons
Salt and pepper
Freshly grated nutmeg
1 bulb garlic, ends cut to expose cloves
1 large or 2 medium onions, chopped
2 Honeycrisp apples, peeled and chopped
10 leaves sage, thinly sliced
6 cups chicken stock
A pinch espelette or cayenne, to taste
About 1/3 cup heavy cream
Toppings: toasted pumpkin seeds, fried sage leaves, Chorizo crumbles or crispy strips of salami

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425°F.
Arrange squash halves on a baking sheet and rub with softened butter; season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Dress garlic with olive oil, salt and pepper, and wrap in foil. Roast squash and garlic about 1 hour, let both cool to handle.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a soup pot over medium heat. Add onions, apples, sage, salt and pepper; cook, partially covered until very tender, 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add stock and roasted garlic cloves squished from their skins. Purée with an immersion blender, add cream, blend again and season with espelette or cayenne, just a pinch to your taste. Simmer over low heat until ready to serve.
