Directions:
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
2. Sautee onion, olive oil, and minced garlic in a large skillet for about 5 minutes on medium heat. Add in chopped vegetables (except for the tomato) and edamame. Saut√© for another 10 minutes. Reduce heat as needed.
3. Meanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook for 9-11 minutes, being careful not to overcook. Pour into colander and rinse very well with cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside.
4. In a food processor, make the basil cream sauce by processing the basil, water, olive oil, lemon juice, avocado, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes until smooth (or just about).
5. Just before the vegetables are done cooking, add the chopped tomatoes, and cook for another 5 minutes until tender.
6. Add drained pasta to the vegetables in the skillet. Mix. Now, pour on the basil cream sauce and stir until combined. Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes, to taste. Garnish with basil leaves. Serve warm or cold. Makes 4-6 servings.
