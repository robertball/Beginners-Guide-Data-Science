Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 cups chopped onions
1 cup chopped green pepper (optional)
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies (optional)
8 large garlic cloves, chopped
3 pounds cubed beef stew meat
5 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 bay leaf
1 cinnamon stick
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes in puree
1 (14.5 ounce) can beef broth
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle dark beer
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 (15 ounce) can chili beans
2 (1 ounce) squares bittersweet chocolate, chopped
salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat.  Stir in onions, green peppers, green chilies, and garlic. Cook and stir until onions are soft and translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the stew meat to the pot, cook until well browned, about 5 minutes.
Stir the chili power, cumin, basil, cayenne pepper, crushed red pepper, oregano, thyme, bay leaf, and cinnamon stick into the pot.  Cook and stir until spices are aromatic, about 2 minutes.
Pour the crushed tomatoes, beef broth, and beer into the pot; stir in the tomato paste.  Bring chili to a simmer and cook until beef is very tender and the liquids have thickened, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
Mix the chili beans and chocolate into the chili. Simmer until the chocolate has melted and the chili is hot, 5 minutes. Remove cinnamon stick and bay leaf. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
