Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 cup quinoa
1 pound bacon, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 onion, chopped
1 (10 ounce) package baby spinach
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender and broth has been absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Cook and stir bacon and onion in a skillet over medium heat until bacon is cooked and onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer and drain mixture on a paper towel-lined plate. Cook spinach in the remaining bacon drippings until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir quinoa, onion-bacon mixture, and cilantro into spinach until evenly blended.
