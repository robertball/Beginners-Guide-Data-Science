Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower
1 sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®), thinly sliced
1 cup grated mozzarella cheese
1 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese
3/4 cup grated Gouda cheese
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup milk
1/2 cup bread crumbs, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a Dutch oven or baking dish.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until slightly tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove cauliflower and cool until easily handled. Break cauliflower into bite-size pieces.
Layer cauliflower, onion, mozzarella cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, and Gouda cheese in the Dutch oven; season with cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Pour milk over cheese layer. Cover Dutch oven.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove cover and stir mixture. Sprinkle bread crumbs over the top. Continue baking until top is browned, 20 to 30 minutes more. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.
