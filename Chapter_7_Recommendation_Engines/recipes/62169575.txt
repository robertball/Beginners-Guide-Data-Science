Cranberry Rice Pilaf Recipe

Ingredients:
1-1/2 cups jasmine or other long grain rice
3 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup dried cranberries
3/4 cup chopped onions
1 Tbsp olive oil
1/4 cup slivered almonds (or cashews, or pecans - whatever you have)
3 Tbsp chopped cilantro
2 Scallions, chopped (optional)
Salt & Pepper to taste (I use about a tsp of kosher salt and a few grinds of black pepper)

Directions:
In a dutch oven or a large skillet (with lid) sweat the onions in olive oil over medium heat untill soft and translucent (about 5 minutes)
Add cranberries and rice, mix well to make sure every grain of rice is coated in oil
Toast the rice for about 5 minutes
Add chicken broth, salt & pepper, give it a quick stir, cover the pot and turn heat up to high
Once the liquid comes up to a boil, reduce heat to very low, crack the lid open a bit and simmer for 22 minutes or until rice is tender all the liquid is absorbed.
When rice is cooked, remove from heat, add scallions (if using), cilantro and nuts, and stir just to incorporate (be sure not to stir too much, rice will become mushy). Also check and adjust your seasonings as necessary

Description: 
I've been making this dish for years - it's different from typical rice pilaf dishes in that the cranberries add the sweetness and the tartness that you don't expect in a savory dish. Oh and it's super hard to fumble.
