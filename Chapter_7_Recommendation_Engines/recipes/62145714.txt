1 cup sugar
3 Tablespoons flour

2/3 cup crisco non-butter flavored sticks
1 Teaspoon sea salt
6-10 Tablespoons ice cold water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375
Bring cherries, flour and sugar to boil.  Stir constantly.
Let boil about 1 minute or until filling begins to thicken
Remove from heat and stir in almond extract and food coloring
Set aside to cool
mix flour, crisco,  and salt in standing mixer with dough hook until mixture is crumbly like wet sand
While mixing at medium speed, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time until dough begins to come off the sides into a ball
Divide into 2 and roll out bottom crust on floured pastry cloth.
Carefully roll up the dough onto the rolling pin and unroll it into the pan.
Pour pie filling into dough.
Roll out top crust and cover the pie, crimping the edges.
Cut slits into top crust with sharp knife.
Slice 1/2 stick butter put pats all around top crust.
Sprinkle with about 2 Tablespoons of sugar.  (at Christmas I like to use green and red sparkling sugar)
Bake at 375 for 1 hour
Serve it while it's still warm with Blue Belle Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream!!
