Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, diced
1 small green bell pepper, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups long-grain white rice
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO*TEL®)
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 cup salsa
3/4 cup frozen corn
1 1/2 cups grated Cheddar cheese, or more to taste

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Pour oil into the pot and add onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Saute for 2 minutes. Add chicken and season with cumin, cayenne, and salt; stir to combine. Continue cooking until onion is clear and chicken is slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in rice and saute, allowing oil and spices to coat grains.
Stir black beans, diced tomatoes, chicken broth, salsa, and corn into the pot. Mix well. Cancel Saute function. Close and lock the lid with vent turned to Sealing. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 8 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Cover the top with Cheddar cheese and replace the lid. Let steam melt the cheese before serving, about 3 minutes.
