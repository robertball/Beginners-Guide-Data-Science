Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup shortening
1 egg
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
1 1/2 cups cold water

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. Cut shortening into the flour until it is the size of peas.
In a 2 cup measuring cup, beat the egg lightly. Add vinegar, then fill to 1 1/2 cups with cold water.
Add just enough liquid to flour mixture to hold the dough together. It should be approximately 4 tablespoons. Reserve remaining liquid for your next batch of dough.
Handle dough as little as possible. Roll out and use as desired.
