Ingredients:
1 lb. Ground Beef (80/20 -- don't go lean)
1 Jalepeno, seeded and chopped
1 Serrano, chopped
1 Onion, chopped (more if you want as a topping)
3 Garlic cloves, minced
1T Garlic granulated
1T Cumin ground
1T Chili Powder
1T Black Pepper course ground
2T Worcestershire sauce
1 pkg Flour Tortillas burrito sized (Mission brand)
1 can Refried Beans
Toppings:
Shredded Cheese
Tomato
Onion
Sour Cream
Picante Sauce
Avacado

Directions:
This will go really quickly because one of the secrets is cooking it on high.  Have all the ingredients chopped and ready.  Put the refried beans in a microwavable bowl and stir, set aside.
Put hamburger in skillet and cut up into small pieces.  Sprinkle all dry ingredients, garlic, and Worcestershire evenly over the top of the ground beef. Turn on high until the bottom is brown.
Put beans in microwave for 3 minutes.
Add onion and peppers (you can put a little in at a time if you're concerned about the heat :) Turn meat over.
Put covered tortillas in the microwave for 2 minutes.
Stir meat regularly until no longer pink.  Total time is about 7-10 minutes.

Description: 
My husband titled this recipe :)  It's his favorite and definitely has to eat several Tums before bed.  We've worked on this recipe together (me cooking, him eating) for years until I got a WOW several times in a row. Sometimes I even trade it for you know what?
