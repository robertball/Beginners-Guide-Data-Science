Description: 
THESE COOKIES earned me a first-place ribbon at the county fair. They remain my husband's favorites--whenever I make them to give away, he always asks me where his batch is!    I especially like the fact that the recipe makes a small enough batch for the two of us to nibble on.                              --Penny Ann Habeck                                                              Shawana, Wisconsin
