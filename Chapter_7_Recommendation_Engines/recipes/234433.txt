Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon honey
4 ripe bananas, each cut into 5 chunks
10 slices bacon, halved crosswise
20 toothpicks

Directions:
Whisk soy sauce and honey together in a large bowl; add bananas and stir to coat bananas in marinade. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Remove banana chunks and reserve marinade.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Wrap bananas with bacon and secure by threading a toothpick through the bacon. Dip wrapped bananas in reserved marinade and arrange on a baking sheet.
Broil in the preheated oven until bacon is browned and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes.
