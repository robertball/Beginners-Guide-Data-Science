Ingredients:
4 cups thinly sliced zucchini
2 cups all-purpose baking mix (such as BisquickÂ®)
5 large eggs, slightly beaten
1 cup canola oil
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup chopped Italian parsley
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
cracked black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon ground paprika, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Mix zucchini, baking mix, eggs, oil, onion, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; spread in the prepared baking dish. Garnish with paprika in a grid design, if desired.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cool before cutting into 2-inch squares.
