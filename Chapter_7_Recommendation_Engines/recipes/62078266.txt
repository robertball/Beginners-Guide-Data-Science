Ingredients:
2 avocados
1/2 cup diced tomato
1/4 cup diced onion
2 tsp. minced garlic
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. pepper

Directions:
Peel the avocados, and remove the pits.  Put all ingredients into a bowl, and mash with a potato masher until it's the consistency you prefer.  Chill if desired.  Serve with tortilla chips or veggies for dipping, or use the guacamole to top your favorite dish.
If any makes it to the next day you've got more willpower than I do!
