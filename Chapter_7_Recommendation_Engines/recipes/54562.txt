Description: 
I found a good sangria recipe and headed to the liquor store to purchase the alcohol. In line, ahead of me, was a man who said he has been a bartender for twenty years now, and that the recipe needed a few touch-ups if I wanted to make it like the Pros. So, here is what he professed to me, muchos thanks to the other submitters for their delicious versions.
