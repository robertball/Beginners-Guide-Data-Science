Ingredients:
1-1/4 Cups cooked whole black beans or 1-14.1 oz can black beans (rinsed and drained)
1/4 teaspoon dried cilantro
1/4 teaspoon ground garlic
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
1/8 teaspoon mexican oregano
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon cumin
2-4 tablespoons water
1/2 cups diced oaxacan cheese, diced into small peices
2 agua chiles or your favorite chile

Directions:
Roast chiles under broiler or on griddle until they blacken and begin to blister.  Turning frequently.  Once chiles are blistered on all sides remove and place them into paper bag for about 10 minutes to sweat.
Rinse and drain black beans.  Place them into blender with, cilantro, garlic, oregano, salt, cumin, onion powder and water.  Blend until smooth.  Heat in microwave for 1-2 minutes.  Then split mixture between 2 bowls.
Take chiles out of bag and remove skin gently not to tear the chiles.  Once skin is removed make a slit from top of chile to bottom.  Remove seeds.  Place cheese into each chile.  Place each chile into microwave for about 45 seconds.  Place 1 chile on top of bean puree.
Serve with tortillas and you favorite tequila.

I wanted to make my own version after seeing someone post pictures of this delicious dish!  You could easily sub the agua chiles for your favorite if they cannot be found in your area.  I like to eat mine with mexican creama and tortillas.
