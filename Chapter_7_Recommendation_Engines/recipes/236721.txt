1/4 cup sliced white onion

salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups cooked white rice

Directions:
Melt coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat; add tomato, onion, garlic, and scotch bonnet chile pepper. Cook and stir tomato mixture until onion is almost translucent, about 5 minutes.
Pour sardines and soybean oil into tomato-onion mixture; mash fish with a fork until incorporated. Cover skillet, reduce to low, and cook until sardines are heated through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve sardine mixture over rice.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite recipes. My favorite way to enjoy this is in the morning, for breakfast, with some good coffee. It is made from items that are almost always found in a West Indian/Carribean kitchen. Sardines can be substituted with any canned salt fish, but the soybean oil gives it the texture that is out of this world! Very tasty if you love spicy and if you love sardines!
