Ingredients:
2/3 cup sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa
2 1/2 cups milk
4 each  egg yolks (large)
2 tablespoons butter, cuut into small pieces
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 9 inch pie crust, cooked until golden brown

Directions:
Place a fine-mesh sieve over a medium bowl; set aside. In a medium saucepan, off heat, whisk together sugar, cornstarch, and salt. If making Chocolate Pudding, add cocoa powder. Very gradually (a few tablespoons at a time) whisk in milk, taking care to dissolve cornstarch. Whisk in egg yolks.
Whisking constantly, cook over medium heat until the first large bubble forms and sputters. Reduce heat to low; still whisking, cook 1 minute. Remove from heat; immediately pour through sieve into bowl. Stir butter and vanilla into hot pudding.
Scoop pudding into cooked pie shell and then top with whipped cream or with a cooked meringue topping.
Refrigerate till served.
