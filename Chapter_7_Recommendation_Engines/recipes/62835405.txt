Ingredients:
¾ cup plain yogurt
¾ cup mayonnaise
5 tablespoons lime juice
1 cup Cotija cheese grated fine (or Parmesan)
4 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
6-8 ears corn

Directions:
In a small bowl combine the yogurt, mayonnaise and lime juice. In another small bowl combine the Cotija (or parmesan) cheese, chili powder, cayenne pepper, cumin and salt.
Heat the grill to about 450. While the grill is heating, remove the corn from the husks. Grill the corncobs directly on the grill for 8 minutes turning every two minutes until kernels start to soften.
Remove the corn from the grill and apply a light coat of the yogurt mixture to each cob. Sprinkle each corncob (or brush on)  liberally with the Cotija cheese mixture, and they are ready to serve.
