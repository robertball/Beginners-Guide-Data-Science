Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup peanut butter
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons milk
40 miniature chocolate covered peanut butter cups, unwrapped & chilled
Sugar for rolling dough balls

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Unwrap peanut butter cups and store in fridge.
Sift together the flour, salt and baking soda; set aside.
Cream together the butter, sugar, peanut butter and brown sugar until fluffy. Beat in the egg, vanilla and milk.
Add the flour mixture; mix well. Shape into 40 balls, dip in white sugar, and place each ball into the greased mini muffin pan. Use the back of a Â½ tsp. to make an indentation into the balls (then placing the peanut butter cup will be easier and less messy).
Bake at 375 degrees for about 8 minutes. Remove from oven and immediately press a mini peanut butter cup into each ball.  Lastly, pop them back in the oven for about 1 minute; this makes them melty and more cohesive.
Cool and carefully remove from pan.
