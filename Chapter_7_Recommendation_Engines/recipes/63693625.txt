Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups Bisquick
2/3 cup buttermilk
1 tablespoon butter Crisco, melted
melted butter, for brushing

Directions:
1
Preheat oven to 450.
2
Mix the Bisquick, buttermilk and sugar together in a bowl.
3
Add the melted butter into the batter.
4
Stir until a soft dough forms.
5
Turn out onto a well floured work surface.
6
Knead 20 times (this is a very forgiving dough), and don't be afraid to get additional flour into the dough.
7
Roll 1/2 thick, or thicker if you prefer towering biscuits.
8
Place close together on an ungreased baking sheet.
9
Brush tops with melted butter.
10
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes; I usually find 8 minutes is enough.
11
When you remove the biscuits from the oven, brush the tops with melted butter again.
