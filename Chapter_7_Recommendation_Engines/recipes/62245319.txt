Ingredients:
2 pounds hamburger
1 cup crushed soda crackers
1 egg
2teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 cup medium chopped onions
1 cup evaporated milk
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
1 uncut loaf of long French bread
2 cups medium cheddar cheese grated

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
Mix everything but the bread and cheese well.
Cut the bread in half the long way.
Pat half of the meat mixture on each piece of bread, bringing it all the way to the edges.
Wrap each half in large heavy foil. Place on a baking sheet. Bake for 50 minutes, or until the meat is cooked through. Unwrap the bread and sprinkle with cheese. Return to oven until melted, about 8 minutes. Remove and let set about 5 minutes before slicing. Slice according to the meal, smaller for appetizers, thicker for dinners and lunches.

Description: 
A delicious combination of meatloaf and cheeseburgers that a friend's mom use to make for us when we were teenagers; we loved it then, and my kids love it now, as does anyone who tries it. I double the recipe on Sunday, slice the leftovers and pop them in sandwich baggies, and have lunches for the next few days. This is a dish to serve as a main course, an appetizer, or an on-the-go meal.
