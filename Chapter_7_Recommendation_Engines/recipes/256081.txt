Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes
cooking spray
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup chopped green onion
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
salt to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1 (10 ounce) can enchilada sauce
1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Boil sweet potatoes until tender, about 30 minutes. Cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Slip off peels.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x10-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Mash sweet potatoes with cream cheese in a bowl. Stir in black beans, green onion, chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper until well mixed.
Place 3/4 cup sweet potato mixture in the center of each tortilla. Roll up tortillas and place seam-side down in the prepared baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce over tortillas. Sprinkle Mexican cheese blend on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until the enchilada sauce is bubbling and the cheese is beginning to brown, about 25 minutes.
