Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 cup lowfat buttermilk
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
3 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
To Make Biscuit Topping: In a medium bowl combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and 1 tablespoon sugar. Mix well then stir in buttermilk just until all ingredients are moistened and dough forms a ball. Set aside.
To Make Berry Filling: In a large saucepan combine honey, 1 tablespoon sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, water, and lemon juice. Mix until smooth, then add berries. Simmer over medium heat, stirring gently, until thickened (about 10 minutes). Spoon berry mixture into an 8x11 inch nonstick casserole dish.
Drop biscuit dough onto berry mixture by tablespoonfuls.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until biscuits are lightly browned.
