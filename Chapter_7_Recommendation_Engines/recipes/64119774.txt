Ingredients:
1 egg
1/4 tsp. butter
1 hot dog bun
Hot sauce to taste

Directions:
Crack egg into a small bowl and whisk until whisked
Melt butter in non-stick pan over medium-high heat.
Pour egg into pan and cook. When the egg starts to bubble (about 1 minute), flip the front edge of the egg over, like you'd do with an omelet. Cook for another minute. Form to fit a hot dog bun. Add to hot dog bun. Splash hot sauce on the egg as desired.

I like a morning breakfast sandwich but I was out of bread. Luckily I had leftover hot-dog buns from my All-Star Game party, and a legend was born.
