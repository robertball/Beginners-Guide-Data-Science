Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 yellow onion, chopped
2 quarts vegetable stock
2 yuca (cassava) roots, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
2 Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 red potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 plantains - peeled, sliced into thirds lengthwise, and cut into strips
2 ears yellow corn, husked and cut into thirds
1 bunch green onion, chopped
lemon, juiced
1 bunch cilantro, chopped, divided
3 cloves garlic
1/4 teaspoon paprika, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 avocados, sliced

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in vegetable stock and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Combine yuca, Yukon potatoes, and red potatoes in the pot; simmer until softened, about 15 minutes. Stir in plantains and corn, simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Add green onion, lemon juice, 1/2 of the cilantro, garlic, and paprika. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer soup until flavors are well combined, about 5 minutes.
Pour soup in serving bowls and garnish with avocado and the remaining cilantro.
