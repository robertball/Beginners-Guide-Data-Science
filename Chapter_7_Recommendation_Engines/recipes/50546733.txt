Description: 
This recipe is super easy with a food processor!  Use this mayo on cold cut sandwiches or mixed with canned fish. Don't use Miracle Whip or salad dressing for this.  Neither one qualifies as mayonnaise and are not as thick as the real thing, which will make your result much runnier.  You can get the chipotle chiles in adobo sauce at a supermarket with a good variety of more authentic Mexican items.  They are either canned or bottled.Modified from: Chipotle Mayo
