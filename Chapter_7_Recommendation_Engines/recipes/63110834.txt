Ingredients:
4 medium zucchini or 6 small, scrubbed clean
salt and pepper to taste
Pam or other spray oil
1 16oz jar sauce of preference
1 cup part skim mozzarella
1/2 cup grated pecorino or parmesan

Directions:
Pre heat oven to 350 degrees
Slice, un peeled zucchini thinly(less than an 1/8 inch) on the diagonal. I use a cheap plastic mandolin for this.
Salt and pepper zucchini on both sides lightly after slicing.
Spray non stick skillet lightly with pam or other spray.
Over medium high heat, briefly sautee zucchini on each side and remove from pan.
Lightly spray a 9"x13" baking dish with spray.
Spread 1/2 cup sauce to bottom of pan.
Layer zucchini, overlapping slightly.
Spread another 1/2 cup of sauce over zucchini. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup grated cheese. And sprinkle 1/4 cup(or more) of mozzarella over all.
Add another layer of Zucchini, 1/2 cup sauce, 1/4 cup grated cheese, Top with 1/4 to 1/2 cup mozzarella.
Bake in a 350 degree oven uncovered, for 10 minutes or until cheese is melted.
