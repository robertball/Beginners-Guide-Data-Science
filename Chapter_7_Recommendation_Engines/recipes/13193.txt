Ingredients:
½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - finely chopped
1 tablespoon sherry
¼ teaspoon salt
2  egg whites
1 (14.75 ounce) can cream-style corn
4 cups chicken broth
2 teaspoons soy sauce
¼ cup water
2 tablespoons cornstarch
4 slices crisp cooked bacon, crumbled

Directions:
Mince chicken.  Mix together with sherry, salt, and egg whites in a large mixing bowl.  Add cream style corn, and mix well to blend.
Preheat a wok or large frying pan to medium high.  Add chicken broth and soy sauce, and bring to a boil.  Add chicken mixture, and return to boil.  Reduce heat.  Simmer for 3 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning.
In a cup, mix together water and cornstarch until well blended.  Add cornstarch mixture to simmering soup, stirring constantly.  Cook for an additional 2 minutes; soup will thicken slightly.  Crumble cooked bacon over individual servings.
