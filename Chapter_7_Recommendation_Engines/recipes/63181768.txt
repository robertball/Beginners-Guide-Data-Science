Ingredients:
2 c. all-purpose flour
3/4 c. white sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
2 eggs
1/2 c. milk
1 Tbsp. vinegar
1/3 c. vegetable oil
1-1/4 c. blend of raspberries, blueberries and blackberries (fresh or frozen)

Directions:
Combine milk with vinegar in a small cup and set aside for at least 10 minutes to “sour”.
Preheat oven to 375°F.
Grease 12 muffin cups or paper muffin liners.
In a large bowl mix flour, white sugar, salt, baking powder and cinnamon.
Add berries to flour mixture and mix to coat.
In a separate bowl whisk eggs.  Whisk in vegetable oil and soured milk.
Pour dry ingredients into egg mixture and stir just until combined.  You do not want to over-stir or you will end up with dense muffins.  This is a thick batter and will be lumpy.
Scoop batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake for 25 minutes or until tops are a very light golden brown and toothpick comes out clean.
Yields 12 muffins
