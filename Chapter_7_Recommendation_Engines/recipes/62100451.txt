Ingredients:
1 small loaf French bread
1 whole roasted red pepper (can use canned or fresh roasted)
3-4 medium sliced ham (like from a spiral sliced ham, or use several deli slices)
3-4 slices monterey jack cheese (use more or less of all these ingredients, depending on the size of your loaf of bread)
Slice bread length wise, sandwich style, but leave a thin piece of crust attaching the two halves. On one half, layer ham slices. Cut red pepper into slices and layer on top of ham. On the other half of the bread, place the cheese slices. Bake at 375 for 10-15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly, and ham is heated through.

Description: 
My employer gives us a spiral sliced ham every year, and I always am looking for ways to use it up, since it's just the two of us. I had some jack cheese and a partial jar of roasted red pepper, and thought it might be good, so we put it all together and it made a great, easy sandwich!
