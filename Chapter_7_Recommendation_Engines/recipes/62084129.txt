Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup chopped (about 1 medium) onion
1 t. finely chopped fresh Ginger
1 t. finely chopped fresh Garlic
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups reduced-sodium chicken or vegetable broth
One 14-ounce can reduced-fat coconut milk
2 1/2 cups (about 1 1/2 pounds) butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 1/2 cups basmati rice (or momâ€™s mixture)
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1/4 cup golden raisins

Directions:
1. In a 4-quart shallow Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion, shallot, curry powder, salt, coriander, and pepper. Saute until onion has softened -- 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger. Saute 2 more minutes.
2.  Heat oven to 375 degrees F.
3.  Stir in the broth and the coconut milk. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Cook 1 minute. Remove the pan from heat and stir in the squash, rice, almonds, and raisins. Cover tightly and place in oven. Bake 20 minutes. Carefully remove the cover and bake 15 minutes longer. Move to stovetop and cook on medium until lentils are cooked.  Add water as needed.

Description: 
Savory and hearty vegetarian recipe. I love the combination of raisins and nuts that give this recipe its wonderful texture. You'll love the incorporation of warm Indian spices.
