Ingredients:
1pkg Flour tortillas
1 1/2lb. Sliced ham
1 15oz can small chuck pinapple
1 jar favorite salsa
1 1/2lb. Mix of Cheddar/Mozzerella shredded cheese
1 container sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Using a griddle at med-high heat toast one side of tortilla.  On the other side of the griddle lay 2-3 slices of ham to heat so cheese will melt when ham is added.  When tortilla is toasted on one side turn over, sprinkle with cheese, layer with hot ham, spread desired amount of salsa over ham, sprinkle with desired amount of pineapple and fold tortilla in half.  Turn quesadilla over until cheese is melted and tortilla is desired crispiness. Cut in wedges with pizza cutter.  I like to mix sour cream and salsa in small bowl and dip it.  Repeat until everyone is full.
