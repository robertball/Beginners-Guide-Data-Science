Preheat your oven's broiler.
Arrange the slices of bread in a single layer on a baking sheet.
Mix together the olive oil and garlic powder in a cup or small bowl. Brush onto the slices of bread.
Cover each piece of bread with tomato slices, then sprinkle with as much cheese as you like.
Drizzle just a bit of the olive oil over the cheese.
Place basil leaves over cheese.
