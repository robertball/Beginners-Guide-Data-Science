Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups flour (you will use more but I start with this)
1/2 cup sugar
1 Tbsp. salt
2 Tbsp. yeast (quick-rise is the best I find)
1/2 cup oil
2 1/2cups warm water ( I like mine kinda hot)
1 eggs

Directions:
Activate yeast by combining 110 F water with yeast.
Mix remaining ingredients in bowl for a minute (electric mixer) then add yeast combo.
Add more flour until it starts to scrape the sides of the bowl- around 3 1/2 cups (use an extra 1/2 cup of flour to knead).Knead the dough for about 5 min then place it into a greased bowl and leave to rise for 1 hour.
Punch down and cut into 8 balls and then split each ball into 3 (making 24 buns). Put them on a greased silver pan (6 rows of 4) and let rise for 1 hr.
Bake at 350 for 14 mins, rotate pan, then turn on convection at 350 for another 14 mins (total 28 min...possibly 32 minutes).
Rub cold butter over buns and then turn out onto a cooling rack or clean tea towel.
