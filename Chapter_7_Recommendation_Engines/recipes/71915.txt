Ingredients:
1 (750 milliliter) bottle dry champagne
4 cups sugar
2 tablespoons vinegar
1 (2 ounce) package dry pectin

Directions:
Sterilize 5 half-pint jars. Set aside.
Pour the champagne into a large pot, and stir in sugar and vinegar. Bring to a full rolling boil, and stir in the pectin. Boil hard for one minute while stirring vigorously. Remove from heat, and ladle into sterile jars to within 1/2 inch of the top.
Wipe rims with a clean dry cloth, and seal with lids. Allow to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate. The jelly may take a few days to set.
