Ingredients:
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup quinoa, rinsed and drained
2 quarts water
1 bunch lacinato (dinosaur) kale, sliced
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 large shallot, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®)

Directions:
Bring chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan; stir in quinoa. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until quinoa is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.
Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan; cook kale in boiling water until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain. Heat olive oil in the same saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir shallot until softened, about 5 minutes. Add kale, cooking and stirring, until desired doneness. Mix quinoa into vegetable mixture and season with salt and Creole seasoning.
