Description: 
Some of my children don't like the blueberries in their pancakes, but like the blueberry syrup. I had a hard time finding a pancake syrup made with fresh blueberries, so I came up with this one.  It's not too sweet, so you can top your pancakes or waffles with whipped creme and whole blueberries for a treat. All the kids loved it!
