Ingredients:
2 boneless pork loin chops, butterflied
4 ounces crumbled blue cheese
2 slices bacon - cooked and crumbled
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
garlic salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
chopped fresh parsley for garnish

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a shallow baking dish.
In a small bowl, mix together the blue cheese, bacon and chives. Divide into halves, and pack each half into a loose ball. Place each one into a pocket of a butterflied pork chop, close, and secure with toothpicks. Season each chop with garlic salt and pepper. Keep in mind that the blue cheese will be salty. Place in the prepared baking dish.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or it  may take longer if your chops are thicker. Cook until the stuffing is hot, and chops are to your desired degree of doneness. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve.

Description: 
This is an amazing recipe I made up to make something fancier from good ol' pork chops. This is a rich recipe.  To add another twist, add fresh chopped apples and pecans to the blue cheese mixture. Yum! Enjoy!
