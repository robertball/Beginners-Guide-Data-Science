Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1/2 cup fat-free Greek yogurt (such as FageÂ®)
Topping:
1/4 cup quick oats
1 tablespoon quick oats
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste
1 egg white
2 teaspoons honey
1 teaspoon water
1/4 cup mild shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 280 degrees F (140 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions, about 3 minutes. Line the air fryer basket with parchment paper and spray with cooking spray.
Mix flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add pumpkin puree and yogurt. Stir to combine.
Place dough on a lightly floured surface; divide into 4 balls. Roll each ball into 8-inch long ropes. Join the ends together to form bagels.
Mix oats and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Whisk egg white, honey, and water together in another small bowl until smooth. Brush bagels with egg mixture; sprinkle oats and cinnamon on both sides.
Place bagels in the prepared basket and bake for 13 minutes. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over bagels and bake for 2 minutes more.
