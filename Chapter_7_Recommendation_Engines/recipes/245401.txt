Description: 
This is a fun drink to make for friends. Every time I serve it to someone new they are amazed that it tastes so much like chocolate cake. To drink, first lick sugar from the rim. Drink the shot and immediately suck on the lemon wedge. It tastes like chocolate cake when you suck the lemon.
