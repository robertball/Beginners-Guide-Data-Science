Ingredients:
4 ounces thinly sliced pancetta
1/3 cup Calabrian chili peppers in oil
12 ounces sliced salami
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
1/4 cup butter, at room temperature

Directions:
Add pancetta to a cold pan. Cook over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until pancetta just starts to crisp up, 4 to 5 minutes.
Remove pepper stems and, if desired, seeds. Reserve 2 or 3 tablespoons of the oil.
Separate salami pieces slightly and place in a food processor. Add the pancetta, chili oil, and Calabrian peppers. Pulse on and off until mixture is finely ground. Add olive oil and butter. Process until as smooth and spreadable as desired.
Transfer spread to a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight, for best flavor.

Description: 
I'm not saying this spicy salami spread is as good as traditional nduja, but it does take about 3 months' less time to make while still delivering most of the characteristics that make the Calabrian delicacy so amazing. And just in case you're not familiar with nduja, a few of those characteristics are a rich, spicy, super-savory flavor, and soft, luxurious texture. Present as a self-serve spread next to toasted bread or top with herbs for a crostini appetizer.
