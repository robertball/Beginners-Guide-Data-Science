Description: 
I found this recipe in my moms handwriting, marking her favorite passage in the family bible. I remember her saying the weather had to be perfect for this candy to set properly. We weren't sure what that meant but we knew it had to be a really nice day when we came home from school to find this waiting for us.  It was like a trip to the candy store.
