Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces
2 cups buttermilk
1 cup dry potato flakes
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
Â½ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry. Pour buttermilk in a shallow dish or bowl and add chicken pieces. Place in refrigerator and marinate overnight.
When ready to prepare, mix potato flakes, flour, poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Dredge marinated chicken in potato/flour mixture to coat. Set aside for 15 minutes to allow coating to stick.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fry chicken slowly over medium heat until golden brown and juices run clear.
