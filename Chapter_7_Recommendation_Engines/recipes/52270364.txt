Ingredients:
*Cookie*
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup choc chips
*Frosting*
6 oz. semisweet choc chips
2 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons milk
1 cup confectioners' sugar
*Toppings*
1/4 cup M&M's
1/4 cup Heath Bar pieces
about 6 Rollos, cut into quarters
2 oz. white choc melted
Add whatever toppings you have/like, ex...
1/4 cup pecan halves
1/4 cup mini marshmellows
1/4 cup flaked coconut
sprinkles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine butter, brown sugar and white sugar and mix till well blended. Add vanilla and egg until light and fluffly. Stir in the flour and the baking soda (dough will be stiff). Pat dough onto an ungreased 12 inch pizza pan or on a cookie sheet.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove cookie from oven and let it cool.
In a 3 qt. saucepan heat the chocolate chips, remaining butter or margarine, and milk over very low heat. Stir until chocolate is melted. Remove the chocolate mixture from the heat and stir in the confectioners' sugar. Beat until smooth, glossy, and of spreading consistency. If frosting is not glossy, stir in a few drops of hot water. Spread over the top of the baked and cooled cookie.
Immediately sprinkle with toppings. Press lightly into frosting. Drizzle top with the melted white chocolate.  Let stand until set.  Remove from pan if desired.  Cut into wedges.
