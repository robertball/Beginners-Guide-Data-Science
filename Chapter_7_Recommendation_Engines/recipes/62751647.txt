Ingredients:
1 1/4 cup unsalted butter
1 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
1 cup white sugar
1 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
3 eggs
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 13oz jar marshmallow cream
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 white sugar

Directions:
Cream together butter, peanut butter and sugars. Beat in eggs.
In a separate bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and   salt. Stir into batter. Roll into 1/2 inch balls.
Roll formed balls in white sugar and put on baking sheets.
Flatten each ball with a fork, making a criss-cross pattern.
Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F oven for about 9 minutes or until cookies begin to brown on top. Do not over-bake.
Cool completely.
Spoon a dollop of filling onto half of the cookies. Place the other half of the cookies on top of the filling to form sandwiches.
