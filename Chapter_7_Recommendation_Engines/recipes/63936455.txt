Ingredients:
1 medium head cauliflower, cut into bite-sized flowerets
1 cup finely grated low-fat sharp cheddar cheese (I have made with with low-fat and regular sharp cheddar and both were fine)
4 T mayo or light mayo (but not fat free)
4 T light sour cream
1 T fresh squeezed lemon juice
1/2 tsp. Dijon mustard
fresh ground black pepper to taste
3 T finely grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375F/190C/ Cut cauliflower into bite sized pieces. (To avoid the little broken pieces of cauliflower all over the cutting board, cut through cauliflower stem, then pull apart the flower end.) Put cauliflower in a small pot, add water to cover by a few inches, then bring to boil and cook 10 minutes, or until cauliflower is just starting to get tender. Drain into a colander placed in the sink.
While cauliflower cooks, whisk together mayo, sour cream, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and black pepper. Stir in finely grated sharp cheddar.
Spray a glass or crockery baking dish with olive oil or non-stick spray, then pour the well-drained cauliflower into the dish and spread out evenly. Use a rubber scraper to spread gratin mixture over the top of the cauliflower. (This is not a sauce that completely covers the cauliflower, more like a topping.) Sprinkle with parmesan cheese, then bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes, or until cauliflower is bubbling and lightly browned. Serve hot.
