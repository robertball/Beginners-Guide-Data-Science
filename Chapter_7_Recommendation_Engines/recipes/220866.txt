Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained
1 onion, chopped
1/2 cup fresh parsley
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 egg
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup dry bread crumbs, or as needed
1 cup oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Place chickpeas in a food processor; puree to a thick paste.
Place onion, parsley, and garlic in the food processor; puree with chickpeas until combined. Transfer to a bowl.
Whisk egg, cumin, coriander, salt, baking powder, lemon juice, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.
Stir egg mixture and 1 tablespoon olive oil into chickpea mixture until well mixed.
Slowly stir bread crumbs into chickpea mixture until it holds together but is not sticky. Adjust with more or less bread crumbs as needed.
Form mixture into balls and flatten into small patties.
Pour olive oil to 1 inch deep in a large cast iron skillet; place over medium-high heat.
Fry patties in hot oil until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.

Description: 
I love falafel, but I don't deep-fry them. This is how I make them in a pan. Serve with warm pitas, tzatziki, and your favorite diced vegetables. Enjoy!!!
