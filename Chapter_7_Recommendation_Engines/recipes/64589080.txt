Ingredients:
2 pieces of chicken breast, boneless
1 teaspoon sea salt
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil or coconut oil
3-4 cloves garlic, chopped or minced
2 cups cherry tomatoes
1 cup low sodium chicken broth
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Take chicken breast and lay on a clean board.  Top with clear wrap or parchment then grab your mallet and pound a few times to thin it out.  Flip over if necessary.  Season both sides with salt and pepper.
Heat a large pan over medium-high heat.  Add in oil and let it get nice and hot.
Carefully add chicken breasts into the pan and cook for about 2-3 minutes then flip over.
Toss in garlic then tomatoes and cook for 2 minutes lowering the heat to medium.
Pour in chicken broth then sprinkle in basil, oregano, parsley and red pepper flakes.  Cover and let cook for 5 minutes.
Enjoy!
