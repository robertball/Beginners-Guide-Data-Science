Ingredients:
12 zucchini blossoms
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs

salt and ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Gently dip zucchini blossoms in beaten egg and shake off the excess. Press into flour; coat with bread crumbs. Place breaded blossoms on a plate; do not stack.
Heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Fry blossoms, working in batches, until both sides are golden brown, about 5 minutes each side. Season with salt and black pepper.

Description: 
Pick the flowers off your zucchini plants as soon as you see some zucchini has started to come in under the flower. A very tasty treat! Try stuffing the blossoms with goat cheese before frying them!
