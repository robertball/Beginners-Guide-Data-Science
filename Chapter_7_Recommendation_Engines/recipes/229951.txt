Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds beef, veal, and pork meatloaf meat mix
2 green apples - peeled, cored, and diced
1 small white onion, diced
1 cup herb-seasoned stuffing mix (such as Pepperidge Farm® Herb-Seasoned Stuffing), crushed
3 stalks celery, diced
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup water
2 eggs
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix meatloaf meat, apples, onion, stuffing mix, celery, milk, water, eggs, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until ingredients are evenly combined.
Spread cream of mushroom soup into a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Spoon meat mixture into the loaf pan and use a spatula to gently flatten the top of the loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Cool in pan for 5 to 10 minutes.
Flip meatloaf pan upside-down onto a serving platter so the cream of mushroom soup is on the top of the loaf.

Description: 
I get bored of regular red sauce meatloaf. I've combined my version of holiday stuffing and turned it into a meatloaf. This alternative is delicious and full of veggies and apples. Instead of using bread crumbs, crackers, or oatmeal, try Pepperidge Farm® Herb Seasoned Stuffing! Perfect for fall-winter comfort-style dinners. Pairs well with traditional mashed potatoes and dinner rolls. After experimenting several times over the course of a few years, I've come up with what I call 'Meatloaf Stuffing'. You can use ground beef if meatloaf meat is not available. Enjoy!
