1/8 tsp salt

Whipped cream (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Heat large skillet with 2 Tbsp butter and add apples. Cook for 5 minutes or until softened.  Add 2 Tbsp brown sugar, salt and cinnamon.  Cook for 5 minutes and then add lemon juice.  Mix well and remove from heat and allow to cool.
In a medium bowl, mix flour, 1/4 cup brown sugar and chopped nuts. Add 2 Tbsp butter and mix with fingers (or fork) until combined .
Take cinnamon rolls and separate into 8 rolls.  Flatten into 4 inch circles.  Place each flattened roll into muffin pan, pushing to line cup.  Divide apple filling into each cup.  Sprinkle apples with sugar topping, pressing down lightly.
Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until tops are lightly browned. Cool on wire rack 5 minutes and serve with toppings or eat just as the are.
