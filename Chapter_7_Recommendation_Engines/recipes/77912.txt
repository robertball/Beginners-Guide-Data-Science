Ingredients:
6 medium beets
1 cup orange juice
2 tablespoons candied ginger
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1/2 cup walnuts
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
Scrub beets, leaving on root and 1 inch of stem. Place beets in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer 45 to 60 minutes or until tender. Drain.
Remove skins and cut beets into wedges. In a saucepan, combine remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil; simmer until thickened. Add beets and toss.

Description: 
Science says beets' anti-cancer chemicals inhibit skin, lung and liver tumors in mice. Beets also may help the heart by lowering artery-damaging homocysteine. You can use canned beets, but freshly cooked ones retain more nutrients.
