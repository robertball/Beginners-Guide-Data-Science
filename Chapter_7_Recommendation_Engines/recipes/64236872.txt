Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1 t baking soda
1 t baking powder
1 t salt
2 T cocoa powder
2 cups sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 cup buttermilk
2 t vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325.

In a large bowl, combine the sugar and oil.
Mix in the eggs, buttermilk, vanilla and red food coloring to desired color; stir until well combined.
Stir in the coffee and vinegar.
Combine the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients a little at a time, mixing after each addition, just until combined.
Generously grease and flour two 9" round cake pans.
Pour the batter into prepared pans.
Bake in the middle rack for 30-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Do not overbake.
Let pans cool on cooling racks until the pans are warm to the touch.
Slide a knife around the edge of the pans to loosen the cakes.
Remove the cakes from the pans and let cool completely.
Frost with cream cheese frosting.
