Ingredients:
4 pieces chicken, your choice, skinless or not (Breasts and thighs work best.)
2 tbs. oil
1/2 package taco seasoning
2 tbs. green onions, chopped, white tops and some green parts
4 tbs. butter, room temperature
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 -2 tbs. chipolte adobo sauce or Chipolte Tabasco to your taste
1 cup Mexican Cheese Blend, divided
Paprika or chile powder for garnish

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Mix the oil and taco seasoning in a small bowl and spread it over the chicken. Cover the chicken and bake for 45 minutes. If you are using large chicken breasts, they may require longer time in the oven.
Cream together the butter, mayonnaise, onions, chipolte sauce, and 1/2 the cheese in a bowl. Divide the mixture in 4 parts and top each piece of chicken with the mixture. Top with the rest of the cheese and garnish of your choice. If you have a broiler, brown the chicken for a few minutes until the cheese melts. If you don't have a broiler, cook in the oven, uncovered, for 5-10 minutes.
