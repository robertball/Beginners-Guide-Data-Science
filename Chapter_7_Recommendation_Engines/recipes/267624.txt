Ingredients:
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3 pounds beef chuck roast
2 cups beef broth
1 pound baby potatoes
1 1/2 cups baby carrots
1 medium onion, quartered
1 packet dry onion soup mix
1/4 cup water
2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic salt
1 teaspoon Dash freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Pour in 2 tablespoons oil. Add roast to hot oil and cook until browned all over, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Add broth.
Combine remaining oil, potatoes, carrots, onion, and soup mix in a resealable plastic bag. Seal and shake to coat evenly. Pour mixture into the pressure cooker and spread out evenly.
Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 60 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Remove roast from pot and place on a serving platter, leaving drippings in the pot.
Select Saute function and bring drippings to a boil. Combine water and cornstarch in a bowl and add to drippings. Cook, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Season gravy with garlic salt and pepper.
Slice roast and serve with vegetables and gravy.
