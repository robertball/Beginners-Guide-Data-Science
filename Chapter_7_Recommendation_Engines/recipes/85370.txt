Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin
12 ounces chorizo sausage
2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 ½ cups masa harina
1 (6 ounce) can canola cooking spray
cooking spray
1 cup salsa, at room temperature

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly oil an 8x8 inch pan.
In a skillet over medium heat, brown the chorizo. Remove from heat, and set aside to cool completely.
In a medium bowl, stir together chorizo and cheese. Divide mixture into four equal measures, and place a portion in the center of each chicken breast. Fold in the sides of the chicken breasts, and roll up.
Roll stuffed breasts in masa harina, and place seam-side down into the oiled pan. Spray the tops lightly with cooking spray.
Bake in a preheated oven until browned, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven, cool slightly, and top each chicken roll with 1/4 cup salsa.

Description: 
I have been making this for the past 5 years for company, parties, and just for my husband and I. It never fails to amaze everyone's taste buds! The chorizo is sweet yet mildly spicy, and the cheese complements the mixture of chicken and Mexican sausage. Sometimes, I use a  creamy tasting Mexican cheese instead of Monterey Jack. I serve this with rice and warmed flour tortillas. Add a black bean and corn salad and you have a fabulous meal!
