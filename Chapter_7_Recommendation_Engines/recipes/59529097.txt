Description: 
For this recipe I either start with a whole roasted chicken from my grocer's deli case or use leftovers from a roasted chicken dinner from the night before.  The meat has much better flavor than just sauteing it quickly.  These enchiladas are filled with creamy fire roasted green chile and chicken.Modified from: Chicken Enchiladas I
