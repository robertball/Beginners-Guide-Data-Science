Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 small tomato, chopped
garlic salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 egg
2 teaspoons water
1 teaspoon grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Prepare a skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Put the chopped tomato in the hot skillet; season with garlic salt and pepper.
Whisk the egg, water, and Parmesan cheese together in a small bowl; add to the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low. When the eggs have begun to set at the edges, use spatula or wooden spoon to scrape the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center, forming large soft curds. Continue scraping your spoon along the bottom of the pan to redistribute the eggs as they cook.
Cook until the eggs are set but still slightly moist, about 5 minutes.
