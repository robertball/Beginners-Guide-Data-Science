Ingredients:
1 T olive oil
1/3 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 bay leaf
pinch crushed red peppers
28oz canned tomatoes
1 1/2 slices bread, torn into 1" pieces
1 tsp to 1 1/2 tsp brown sugar
1 cup chicken broth
salt & pepper

Directions:
Heat oil in pan until shimmering.
Add garlic, onion, crushed red peppers, and bay leaf.  Cook over med/low heat until translucent (apx 3 to 5 minutes).
Stir in tomatoes with their juices and mash with potato masher until there are no pieces larger than 2".
Stir in bread and sugar and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium and cook stirring occasionally until bread has completely broken down (roughly 5 minutes).
Remove and discard bay leaf.
Puree solids by either using an immersion blender or regular blender.
Return all to pan, add chicken broth and return to a boil.
Reduce heat and season.
Serve with dash of olive oil and toasted croutons.
***NOTE:  Above results in a very rustic, thick and hearty soup (which I absolutely love).  If you want a completely smooth soup, run through a finely meshed sieve.  I've tried both ways and they're equally delicious (although you most definitely notice the lack of cream in the sieved soup - it's much thinner and lacks that *ommph*.
