Ingredients:
4 russet potatoes, sliced into 1/4 inch slices
1 onion, choped into slivers
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1 quart casserole dish.
In a medium-size saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Mix in the flour and salt, and stir constantly with a whisk for one minute. Stir in milk. Cook until mixture has thickened. Stir in cheese all at once, and continue stirring until melted, about 30 to 60 seconds.
Layer 1/2 of the potatoes into bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Top with 1/2 of the onions, sprinkle salt and then pour 1/2 of the cheese over the potatoes.
Add remaining potatoes, onions and salt.  Pour remaining cheese over the potatoes, and cover the dish with aluminum foil.
Bake 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
