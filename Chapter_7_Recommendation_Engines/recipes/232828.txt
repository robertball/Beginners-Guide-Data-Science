Ingredients:
2 cups milk
1/2 cup honey
6 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup ground cinnamon
1 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
Stir milk and honey together in a bowl; let sit for 5 minutes.
Sift flour and baking soda together in a large bowl; mix milk-honey mixture into flour mixture until dough is soft. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface for about 3 minutes. Roll dough using a rolling pin into a rectangle about 1/2-inch thick; cut into 24 equal pieces.
Roll each piece of dough into a l0-inch cylinder; fold ends together into a pretzel-shape. Mix 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup cinnamon in a bowl; sprinkle over pretzels. Arrange coated pretzels on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until pretzels are golden brown, about 8 minutes.
Mix melted butter with 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup cinnamon; brush warm pretzels with butter mixture.

My favorite food? Soft gooey cinnamon pretzels! The only problem, I can't always drive to the mall to get them, so here is a solution! Best when served warm.
