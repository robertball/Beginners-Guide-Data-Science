Ingredients:
2 pounds chicken drumsticks
2 (12 fluid ounce) cans Budweiser™ beer
1 teaspoon dried rosemary

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the chicken drumsticks in a 9x13 baking dish. Season with rosemary, salt and pepper. Pour the beers in with the chicken.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until the chicken is browned and meat slides off the bone easily. Just you wait! You are going to love it!

Description: 
Harold will eat anything but only drinks Budweiser™. I discovered cooking with beer when he spent all our grocery money on it one week. Anyway, it's quick and easy and you can substitute chicken with anything.
