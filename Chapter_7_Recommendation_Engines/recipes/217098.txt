Ingredients:
1 sprig fresh rosemary, leaves removed and chopped
1  lemon, juiced
2 teaspoons butter
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce
2 ½ pounds bone-in chicken breast halves, with skin
1 pound fingerling potatoes, scrubbed
2  carrots, peeled and cut in chunks
1  onion, chopped
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1  tomato, chopped
15  pitted prunes
20  pitted kalamata olives
¼ cup white wine
¼ cup chicken broth

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place the rosemary leaves, lemon juice, butter, garlic, soy sauce, and hot pepper sauce into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse several times to form a paste.
Rub the rosemary-lemon mixture underneath the skin of the chicken breast halves, and place chicken into a large Dutch oven. Arrange potatoes, carrots, onion, mushrooms, tomato, prunes, and olives around the chicken. Pour the white wine and chicken broth over the chicken and vegetables.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the potatoes are tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes, stirring chicken and vegetables with pan juices after 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer, inserted into the thickest part of a chicken breast and not touching bone, should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
