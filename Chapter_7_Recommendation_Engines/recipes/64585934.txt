Ingredients:
1 Batch Balsamic Cream Sauce by Kevin Watral
1- 20oz Buitoni Herb Chicken Tortellini
Equal amounts yellow and red cherry tomatoes
1lb (more or less, depending on your love of cheese) fresh mozzarella pearls
Fresh basil, to taste, minced, or sliced for visual appeal
12oz Trader Joe's Apple Smoked Bacon, cooked and chopped into bite-sized pieces

Directions:
Cook everything that needs to be cooked (tortellini, bacon, sauce).
While said things are cooking, cut cherry tomatoes in half, mince (or slice) the basil, and (if needed) slice the mozzarella pearls in half.
Drain the tortellini and chop the bacon.
The sauce should be done.
Place everything in a large bowl and pour sauce over top (or let guests serve themselves and pour their own sauce over), tossing to coat everything.
Serve and enjoy.

Description: 
Went to new place called Sweet Decadence at The Landing in Renton a while ago and they had a Caprese Salad there that I fell IN LOVE with.  This pasta dish is inspired by it, using a balsamic cream sauce to tie everything together like the balsamic vinegar would in the Caprese Salad.
