3 ounces spreadable chive-and-onion cream cheese
3 tablespoons butter, softened, divided
Dash pepper
1/2 cup cubed cooked chicken
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 (4 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
3 tablespoons seasoned bread crumbs
2 tablespoons finely chopped pecans

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine cream cheese, 1 tablespoon butter and pepper. Fold in chicken and mushrooms. Separate crescent dough into two rectangles; seal perforations. Spoon chicken mixture on each rectangle to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up, starting from a short side; pinch ends to seal.
In a shallow bowl, combine bread crumbs and pecans. Melt remaining butter; brush over entire surface of dough. Roll in crumb mixture. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown.
