Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds uncooked penne pasta
1/3 cup light mayonnaise
1 (8 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing
1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 (12 ounce) package broccoli coleslaw mix
2 Roma tomatoes, diced
1 cucumber, diced
1 (3 ounce) can tuna, drained
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
2 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the penne, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.
Combine the mayonnaise, salad dressing, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper in a blender; blend until completely mixed.
Place the coleslaw mix, tomatoes, cucumber, tuna, Cheddar cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, green onions, and the cooked pasta in a large bowl; pour mayonnaise mixture into the bowl; toss to coat. Serve cold.

Description: 
I created this pasta salad when I needed something to bring to a football party and didn't have time to go to the store. Since then, it's become a staple! Every bite is always eaten! Use whatever type of pasta you like. I like to mix varieties together.
