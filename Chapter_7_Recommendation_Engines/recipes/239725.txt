Ingredients:
2 over-ripe bananas, mashed
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup shredded zucchini
1 cup applesauce
3 eggs
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 36 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Mix bananas, white sugar, zucchini, applesauce, eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and baking powder in a sifter and sift into the banana mixture; add oats and mix until batter is just combined. Fill muffin cups with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool muffins completely in the tin before removing.

Description: 
This recipe is from my mother-in-law and it's the only way to get my husband to eat bananas and my kids to eat zucchini. I make them into muffins because they get eaten faster than the bread. But it's great either way.
