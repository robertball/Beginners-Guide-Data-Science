Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups quinoa flour
1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/4 cups flaxseed milk
3 eggs
2 Tbsp honey
2 Tbsp melted butter

Directions:
Mix the quinoa flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl.  Add the remaining ingredients and mix well.  The batter will be on the thinner side.  Pour 1/4 cup batter on a well greased griddle, skillet, etc. and cook for 2-3 minutes (till bubbles form on top), then flip and cook another 2 minutes.

Description: 
I recently (at 33 years old) learned I am gluten intolerant and have begun exploring gluten free cooking.  We love pancakes in my house and I created this recipe to fill the void-we all gobble them down!
