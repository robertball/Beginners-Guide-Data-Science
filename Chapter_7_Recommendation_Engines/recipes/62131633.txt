Ingredients:
4 16oz containers Sour Cream (I always use FF)
4 packets dry ranch dip mix
1 cucumber
1 bunch celery
1 red bell pepper
1 orange bell pepper
1 green bell pepper
1 package carrot chips
1 sleeve hard plastic punch glasses

Directions:
1.   Combine sour cream and dip mixes.  Chill in frig.
2.  Slice celery & peppers in long thin "sticks".
3.  Use a veggie peeler to create stripes on cucumber.  Then, slice into 1/8-1/4" slices.  Make an 1/8" slit into each cucumber round.
4.  Fill each cup about halfway w/dip.  Stand celery, carrots, and pepper slices in the dip, filling about 1/2 the glass.
5.  Garnish each cocktail w/2-3 cucumber slices, sliding the slit side on to the side of the glass.
6.  Serve each guest their own "cocktail" and let the double dipping begin!
