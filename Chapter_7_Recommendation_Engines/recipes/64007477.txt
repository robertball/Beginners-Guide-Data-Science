Ingredients:
1/2 bunch of asparagus
3-5 mini sweet bell peppers, or 1 normal sized-one
1/4 large head of cauliflower
1 cup of fresh green beans
1 tbsp of tuscan seasoning--or sub 1/4 tsp of black pepper, 1/4 tsp of fennel seeds, 1/4 tsp of minced garlic, 1/4 tsp of oregano, 1/4 tsp of basil (or 3-4 tbsp of fresh basil) and 1/4 tsp of rosemary
2-3 tbsp of olive or canola oil

Directions:
Chop up all the veggies to the size of your preference. (I went for around 1/2 inch in length with exception of the mini bell peppers.)
Layer the vegetables into a corningware dish. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Farenheit.
Sprinkle over your tuscan seasoning and drizzle your olive oil over your vegetables. Cover and roast in the oven for around 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Boil your entire package of pasta (I used rigatoni) according to the package instructions. (I like mine al dente, but you can boil them to the softness you like.)
When the roasted veggies are finished cooking, mix them into your pasta. At this point, additional olive oil may be added if desired. Serve warm or refrigerate and enjoy cold :)
