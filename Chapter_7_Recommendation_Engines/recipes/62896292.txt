Ingredients:
3 pounds small new potatoes
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup melted butter
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Place the potatoes in a large saucepan of water.  Cover; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat; gently cook potatoes until tender but still firm, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place potatoes on a foil-lined, rimmed baking sheet. Smash the warm potatoes with the heel of your hand or a small pan to flatten slightly and break the skin.
Mix together the olive oil, butter, and spices in a medium bowl; add the potatoes, a few at a time, and toss to coat well.  Return coated potatoes to baking sheet, leaving 1/2 inch space between each potato. Pour any remaining coating mix over potatoes.
Roast potatoes in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Crank heat up to broil, move potatoes to top oven rack and broil for 5 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. Remove from oven and serve immediately.

Description: 
New potatoes are par-boiled, tossed with spices, then baked and finally broiled. IF you have any leftovers, store in the fridge overnight and cube them for hash browns the next morning, or just smash them flat and fry them up as potato patties.Modified from: Bada Bing Bada Banged Potatoes
