Ingredients:
3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
3 tablespoons butter
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomato, with liquid
1/2 cup water, chicken broth or other liquid
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons chili powder or oregano
1 teaspoon mustard powder
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 teaspoon celery seed
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup red, yellow and/or green pepper strips
1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

Directions:
In a shallow dish or bowl, combine flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and ground black pepper. Coat chicken breasts with flour mixture. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and brown chicken on all sides. Remove from skillet, and drain on paper towels.
In the same skillet, combine the tomatoes, liquid of choice, brown sugar, vinegar and Worcestershire sauce. Season with salt, chili powder or oregano, mustard, turmeric, celery seed, garlic and hot pepper sauce. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, and return chicken to skillet. Cover, and simmer for 35 to 40 minutes, or until chicken is tender, no longer pink and juices run clear. Add peppers about 15 minutes before chicken is done.
