Ingredients:
8 Oz. (1/2 a Box) of Pasta (a tube-shaped pasta such as Rigatoni)
One Head of Broccoli
2-3 Plum Tomatoes (or some cherry tomatoes)
Tomato Sauce to taste (any type works)
6-7 Large Leaves of Basil
1 Tbsp Olive Oil
One Pot of Water
Topping of Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese (optional)

Directions:
Get two pots - one large, and one small. Fill the large one with water and get it boiling! Put about an inch of water in the small one, and place a steamer inside.
Chop broccoli into florets, and put it into the steamer. Put the lid on the pot and put it on the stove. Steam the broccoli until it is bright green.
Chop up the tomatoes, snip the basil into pieces, and sauté in olive oil until the tomatoes are softened (about three minutes).
Add Rigatoni pasta to the large pot when the water is boiling (leave the lid off). Boil the pasta, stirring occasionally with a wooden or pasta spoon. Check the package for cooking time.
Once the pasta is al dente, strain it. Once it is cool enough to handle, insert broccoli florets into the pasta tubes.
Place the pasta tubes and the sauté mixture onto a plate, top with tomato sauce, sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top if desired, and serve immediately!

Description: 
This is another one of my favorites. I came up with this recipe when I was a kid (at least, the idea of putting broccoli florets inside pasta tubes). I have made it at least once every year! It is a hearty pasta meal with broccoli florets stuffed inside pasta tubes and sautéed tomatoes on the side, all topped with tomato sauce!
