Description: 
I get so bored of just eating meat and eggs and more meat on a ketogenic diet (even if they are cooked in delicious fats)! That's why we highly encourage you to eat more vegetables. Of course, you have to stick to low-carb vegetables, but there are some great ones to choose from. And cucumbers are one of them.
