Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all purpose flour
1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/4 cups rolled oats
1 cup brown sugar (I use Splenda)
1/2 cup sugar (I use Splenda)
1 tbsp lowfat butter or margarine
2 individual cups applesauce (1/2 cup each)
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla
pinch salt
1 tsp baking soda
6 oz semi sweet morsels (1/2 pckg)

Directions:
Preheat to 350ยบ on top rack for crispier cookies, 325ยบ in the middle for more muffin-like.  Add all flour, oats, and sugar, one at a time and stir until blended. Add appleasauce, butter, and vanilla. Stir until smooth and then add salt and baking soda.
Add both eggs, break up yolks and stir until blended throughout.
Pour in chocolate chips and stir gently.
Drop by well rounded 1/8 cup scoops each cookie.
Spray cookie sheet with butter flavored spray and bake for 10 minutes.
Cookies continue to bake for a few minutes after they're out of the oven so, remove when they are lightly brown on top and golden brown around the edges to cool.
The cookies will be soft, fluffy and chewy.

Description: 
This recipe is healthy and easy.  Try using applesauce in cups. It keeps for a year in the cups; & goes bad in the jar quickly, so you have to throw it out.
  These are a cross between a muffin and a cookie in texture and are really yummy.  
  I hope you enjoy them.
