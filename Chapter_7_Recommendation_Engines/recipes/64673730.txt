Ingredients:
35-40 saltine crackers
1 cup butter
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 ½ cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 ½ cups toppings as desired such as pecans walnuts, crushed OREO cookies, pretzels, toffee bits, M&Ms;, or
drizzles of other melted chocolate

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300°F. Line a 15” x 10” x 1” pan with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Line up crackers in a single layer in rows on foil.
Meanwhile, using a candy thermometer, melt butter and brown sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and boil for 2 to 3 minutes (270 to 290 degrees if using a candy thermometer). Immediately pour over crackers and spread evenly with a spatula.
Bake 5 minutes or until the candy hardens (300 to 310 degrees if using a candy thermometer). Remove from oven.
Meanwhile, melt the chocolate chips in the microwave in 30-second increments at 50% power until melted. Spread over hardened caramel.
Sprinkle nuts or other toppings and press into the chocolate using a greased spatula. Cut into squares while warm.
Cool completely and store in the refrigerator.
