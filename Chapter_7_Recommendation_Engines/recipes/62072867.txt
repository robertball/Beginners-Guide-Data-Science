Ingredients:
Cooking spray
2 oz cream cheese
1/2 shredded cheddar cheese
1 tbs mayo
8 medium jalapeno peppers
1/4 cup egg substitute
3/4 cup cornflake crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350ÂºF. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, cheddar cheese and mayonnaise; mix well and set aside. Halve jalapenos lengthwise and remove seeds. (Oil and seeds from the peppers can be irritating - wear gloves or put plastic bags over your hands.) Stuff jalapeno halves with cream cheese mixture. Place egg substitute in a shallow dish. Place cornflake crumbs in a separate shallow dish. Dip stuffed jalapeno halves into egg substitute and then roll in cornflake crumbs to coat. Transfer jalapenos to prepared baking sheet and coat with cooking spray. Bake until filling is bubbly, about 30 minutes
