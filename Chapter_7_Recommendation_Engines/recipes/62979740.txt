Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package Pepperidge Farm cornbread stuffing
4 tablespoons light butter (like Land-O Lakes)
1 large onion, chopped
5 stalks celery, chopped (or 2 cups chopped)
16 ounces chicken broth (Swanson's fat free / low sodium)
1 teaspoon dried sage
1 tablespoon poultry seasoning
1 tsp black pepper
1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped

Directions:
Empty the packaged cornbread stuffing into a large bowl.
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
Add the celery and onion and cook until transparent, approximately 5 to 10 minutes.
Pour the vegetable mixture over cornbread mixture.
Add the chicken broth and mix well.  Add additional broth if necessary to get the necessary moistness.
Add salt, pepper to taste, sage, and poultry seasoning.
Pour mixture into a baking pan and bake until dressing is cooked through, about 45 minutes.
