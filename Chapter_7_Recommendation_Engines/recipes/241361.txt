Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) corned beef brisket with spice packet
1 tablespoon spicy brown mustard
2 cloves garlic, minced
22 fluid ounces IPA beer (such as Lagunitas® Wilco Tango Foxtrot)

Directions:
Coat corned beef with spicy brown mustard and place, fat-side down, into a slow cooker. Add garlic and seasoning packet to corned beef; pour in beer, covering beef completely.
Cook on Low for 8 hours. Remove corned beef from slow cooker and allow to rest for 15 minutes before slicing across the grain.

Description: 
This by far has been my most successful corned beef recipe that I've done. Instead of using Guinness® or an American lager like most recipes call for, I used a hoppy Lagunitas Wilco Tango Foxtrot IPA which cooked some amazing flavors into the corned beef.
