Ingredients:
1 small ripe cantaloupe
2 cups cold fat free milk, divided
1/3 cup sugar
1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin
1/4 cup light corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Cut cantaloupe in half; discard seeds. Scoop out pulp (there should be about 4 cups of melon). Place cantaloupe and 1 cup milk in a blender or food processor; cover and process until smooth.
In a saucepan, combine sugar and remaining milk. Sprinkle gelatin over top; let stand for 1 minute. Heat over low heat, stirring until gelatin is complete dissolved. Stir in the corn syrup, salt and pureed cantaloupe. Pour into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. pan. Cover and freeze until partially frozen, about 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
Place cantaloupe mixture in a blender or food processor; cover and process until smooth. Return to the pan. Cover and freeze until almost frozen, about 1 hour.

Description: 
Melon lovers are sure to enjoy this frosty dessert. A dish of the sherbet is a refreshing ending to a light lunch or dinner during the summer. It's also a great way to use up overripe cantaloupe.                                                Mary Dixson of Decatur, Alabama
