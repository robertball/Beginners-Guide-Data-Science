Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound ground beef
1 onion, chopped
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup milk
3/4 cup ketchup
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray 24 mini-muffin cups with cooking spray.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onions in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess fat and set aside to cool.
Combine flour, white sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk milk, ketchup, melted butter, eggs, and mustard together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until just moistened. Fold ground beef mixture and Cheddar cheese into batter; spoon into each muffin cup.
Bake muffins in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
My grandmother passed this recipe along years ago. She fixed them as a quick treat for her grandsons who had been hunting all morning. Now I take them to everything from baby showers to Christmas parties to game day gatherings. They are always a hit. I serve dipping sauces of mustard and ketchup. Easy!
