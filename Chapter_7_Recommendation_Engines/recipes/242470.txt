Ingredients:
1/4 cup King Arthur Coconut Flour, sifted after measuring
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
3 large eggs
3 tablespoons butter, melted
3 tablespoons honey
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 cup fresh blueberries, thoroughly dry

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly grease six wells of a standard muffin pan, or line them with lightly greased muffin papers.
Sift together the coconut flour and baking powder, and mix until well blended.
Stir together the eggs, butter, honey, salt, and vanilla and almond extracts until smooth.
Mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until there are no lumps. Gently fold the blueberries into the batter until evenly incorporated.
Scoop the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about half full.
Bake the muffins for about 16 to 18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let them cool for about 5 minutes in the pan, then transfer them to a rack to cool.
