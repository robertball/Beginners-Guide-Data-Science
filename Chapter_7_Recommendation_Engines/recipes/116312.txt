3/4 cup fresh or frozen Brussels sprouts, thawed and halved
3/4 cup sliced carrots
1/2 cup water

In a small saucepan, combine the first three ingredients. Bring to a boil. Cover and cook for 6-7 minutes or until crisp-tender; drain, reserving 1 tablespoon cooking liquid. In a bowl, combine the mayonnaise, horseradish, onion, salt, pepper and reserved cooking liquid; mix well. Add the sprouts and carrot; toss to coat.
Transfer to a greased 2-cup baking dish. Combine bread crumbs and butter; sprinkle on top. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 11-13 minutes or until lightly browned. Sprinkle with parsley.
