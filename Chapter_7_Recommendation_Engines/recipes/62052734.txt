Ingredients:
1 lean pork loin
1/3 cup sesame oil
1/3 cup vermouth
1/3 cup soy sauce
4-5 garlic cloves, minced
1 inch piece fresh ginger, minced

Directions:
Slice pork loin roast into 1/8 inch slices.  Skewer onto bamboo skewers.  Mix oil, vermouth, soy sauce, garlic and ginger.  Place pork kabobs in plastic baggie and add the marinade.  Be careful not to puncture bag with the tips of the skewers.  Marinade overnight in the fridge turning bag occasionally.  Heat the barbeque and grill for 3-5 minutes on each side till done.
I prepare many kabobs at a time and freeze the extras.  I just pull a few out of the freezer, add the marinade and grill.  YUM-YUM!

Description: 
This marinade has an intense flavor.  You either love it or you hate it.  My family and friends happen to love it and we make this often.  I'm always asked to bring this to share when we go camping.  This has been a family favorite for many years.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
