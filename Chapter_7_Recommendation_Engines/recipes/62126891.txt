Ingredients:
1 fresh focaccia dough
2 Tbsp olive oil
3 cups red onions, sliced into rings
2 garic cloves, crushed
1 red pepper, diced
3.5 oz raw prosciutto, cut into strips
3.5 oz mozzarella, sliced
2 Tbsp rosemary, chopped

Directions:
Heat the oil in a pan. Add the onions and garlic and saute for 3 to 5 minutes. Add the pepper and cook for 2 more minutes.
Cover the pan and cook over low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are slightly carmelized. Leave to cool slightly.
Spread the topping evenly over the focaccia. Arrange the prosciutto, mozzarella and rosemary over the top.
Bake in a preheated oven at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.

Description: 
Delicious as an appetizer or a light meal with a salad.  I use the fresh focaccia dough from my local deli, but this can also be made with your own recipe for focaccia or traditional pizza dough.
