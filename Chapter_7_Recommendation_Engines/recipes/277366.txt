Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 cup barley
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas - rinsed, drained, and dried
1 pinch smoked paprika, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 shallot, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 carrots, chopped
1 cup chopped fresh mushrooms
1 splash red wine
1 tablespoon harissa
1/3 cup vegetable broth
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup chopped almonds
1/2 cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 teaspoon honey
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Bring water and barley to a boil in a saucepan. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until barley is tender, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Drizzle the pan with 1 tablespoon oil.
Spread chickpeas in the oil and sprinkle with smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until crispy, about 40 minutes. Leave in the oven to cool for another 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat. Saute shallot and garlic in the hot oil until soft and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add carrots and cook until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in red wine. Cook until wine has almost completely reduced, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in harissa and cook for 1 minute. Pour in broth; cook until it has been absorbed, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl.
Stir chickpeas into the mixture and add 1/4 cup parsley.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Saute almonds in the hot oil until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside.
Prepare the lemon yogurt by stirring yogurt, lemon zest, honey, and lemon juice together in a bowl.
Prepare the dish with barley on the bottom, followed by chickpeas, toasted almonds, and lemon yogurt. Garnish with 1 teaspoon parsley.

Description: 
I added my own twist to this recipe and it came out really good. I used barley in this, but you can use whatever kind of grain you'd like.
