Description: 
love them for greeting guests with a little nibble to accompany a cocktail, for making sandwiches at lunch, or for snacking with whole grain crackers anytime of day. Bean spreads are filling, nutritious, and as decadent as you want. And you can easily alter ingredients for your own creative twist.
