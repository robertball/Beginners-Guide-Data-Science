Description: 
I don't quite know what happens when butter just starts to brown, but it takes on a wonderful 'nutty' aroma. Once the butter starts to simmer, watch very closely to make sure it doesn't burn. My husband loves vegetables cooked this way. I have used many different types of fresh vegetables and this seems to work with most any vegetable. (This recipe is for 1 1/2 pounds vegetables.)
