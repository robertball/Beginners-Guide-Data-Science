Ingredients:
1 15.5 oz can chick peas, drained, liquid reserved
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tsp. fresh ginger root, finely grated
1 tsp. lime zest
1 Tbsp lime juice (or about one lime)
1/4 tsp ground coriander
1 Tbsp chopped cilantro
1/4 cup tahini
2 tsp Thai chili oil or other hot chili oil (or to taste)
1/4 cup grapeseed oil (or other neutral flavored oil)
Pinch salt (optional)
1/3 cup dry roasted peanuts
Chopped cilantro, peanuts, additional chili oil for garnish, if desired.

Directions:
Combine all ingredients except grapeseed oil in a food processor.
Blend, drizzling in grapeseed oil and, if desired, about a Tbsp or so of the liquid from the chick peas, until you achieve your desired consistency.
Garnish with chopped peanuts, cilantro and if you like it hot, a little drizzle of that chili oil!
