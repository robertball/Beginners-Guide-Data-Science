Ingredients:
1/2 cup uncooked brown rice
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
2 eggs
1/2 cup frozen chopped spinach
1 (14.5 ounce) can peeled and diced tomatoes
1/2 cup cottage cheese
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup diced celery
1/4 cup sunflower oil

Directions:
Bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes. This should yield about 1 cup cooked rice.
Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add turkey and Italian seasoning. Cook and stir until turkey is browned and crumbly, 4 to 6 minutes. Add eggs and scramble with the turkey mixture until eggs are cooked, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Place spinach in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 1 minute, and then at 30-second intervals until easy to stir and warm to the touch. Drain excess liquid.
Transfer turkey mixture, cooked rice, and spinach to a large bowl. Add spinach, tomatoes, cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, celery, and sunflower oil and mix until well combined.

Description: 
This is a well-balanced recipe, though it is always wise to rotate a variety of foods in your dog's diet. This makes enough to feed my Boston Terrier for several days. It's much more wholesome than store-bought dog food, and costs about the same as canned dog food. Recipe yield depends on the size of your dog(s).
