Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 tablespoons ground nutmeg
2 teaspoons ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt

1 cup white sugar
1 cup unsweetened applesauce
4 eggs, lightly beaten
1 (15 ounce) can solid-pack pumpkin
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans with cooking spray.
Mix flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, baking soda, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl.
Combine brown sugar, white sugar, applesauce, and eggs in a large bowl. Add pumpkin and mix well. Add flour mixture alternately with water, mixing well between additions. Divide between the prepared loaf pans.
Bake loaves in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 65 minutes. Cool in pans for 10 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.
