Ingredients:
⅓ cup Worcestershire sauce
⅓ cup honey
⅓ cup oyster sauce
¼ cup soy sauce
6 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons vinegar
1 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon sesame seeds, or to taste
1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder (optional)
4 pounds chicken wings

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Whisk Worcestershire sauce, honey, oyster sauce, soy sauce, garlic, vinegar, thyme, sesame seeds, and Chinese five-spice powder together in a large bowl; add chicken wings and toss to coat completely. Let chicken marinate 30 minutes. Transfer chicken wings and marinade to a deep baking dish.
Bake wings in the preheated oven, turning and spooning marinade over wings every 20 minutes, until chicken is cooked through and sauce is thick and bubbling, about 90 minutes.

Description: 
These chicken wings never disappoint. They get devoured as soon as they get put on the table. The sauce is rich and dark so they are great for Halloween parties, just call them glazed bat wings for the holiday.
