Description: 
This frosting is not sticky-sweet like store bought frosting, and it the best i have found.  You can use 2 teaspoons of almond extract, or any other flavor instead of the vanilla. I found almond extract is good with a vanilla cake.
Also, i put the butter, shortening mixture in the frig, when i put the flour and milk in.
