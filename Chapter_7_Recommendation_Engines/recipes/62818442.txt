Description: 
This is the best recipe I have found for lactose-free bread.  This recipe produces a wonderful light and airy white bread that rises to perfection each time!  My machine takes 4 hours to make a loaf, so I start it at night before I go to bed and we have wonderful fresh bread for breakfast in the morning.  It's great for my lactose-intolerant husband...and our pet pig Gracee loves it!
