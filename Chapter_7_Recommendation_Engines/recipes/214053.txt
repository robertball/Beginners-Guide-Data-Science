Ingredients:
6 eggs
1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons canned chopped green chiles
1 tablespoon chopped pitted ripe olives
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper

Directions:
Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Drain. Cool the eggs under cold running water. Peel once cold. Halve the eggs lengthwise and scoop the yolks into a bowl. Mash the yolks with a fork.
Stir the mayonnaise, chopped green chiles, olives, chili powder, and cayenne pepper until well combined; spoon into the egg white halves.
