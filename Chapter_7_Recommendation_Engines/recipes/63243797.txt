1/2 tsp. terasi (shrimp paste)
1/4 lb. roasted peanuts, chopped
5 oz. grated coconut
1 tbs. palm sugar
2 tbs. tamarind water

Directions:
Grind the bumbu. Chop the peanuts into quarter-sized pieces. Combine all remaining ingredients in a bowl and mix.
Coat wok lightly with oil and heat to a medium temperature.
