Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive oil
6 carrots, thickly sliced (about 1/2")
1 onion, thinly sliced
2 stalks celery, thickly sliced
3 teaspoons sea salt
2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 head cabbage, shredded
5 potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 - 1.5 lbs marinated flank steak, cooked and shredded
STEAK MARINADE:
1 cup olive oil
1/2 cup light soy sauce
1/4 cup worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
2 TBSP lemon juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix ingredients for the steak marinade and pour into slow cooker.  Add steak (can be frozen) and cook on low for 6-8 hours.  If you can, turn steak at least once during cooking time.
Remove steak from slow cooker and shred; set aside and keep warm.
For faster assembly, I recommend peeling/chopping all veggies before you begin cooking.
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the carrots, celery and onion in the hot oil about 5 minutes.
Stir in the salt, pepper, cumin, turmeric, and cabbage and cook another 15 to 20 minutes. Add the potatoes; cover. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until potatoes are soft, 20 to 30 minutes.  Add the shredded beef for the final 5 minutes of cooking time.

Description: 
I've modified this dish to include marinated flank steak (or other inexpensive cut).  It gives the meal more depth and makes it a one-pot meal!  I also pump up the spices by quadrupling original recipe.  Tastes even better the next day--I make this at least once a week!Modified from: Ethiopian Cabbage Dish
