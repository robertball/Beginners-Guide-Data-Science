Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons butter
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons confectioners' sugar
1 (1.5 fluid ounce) jigger dark Jamaican rum
2 tablespoons creme brulee flavored ice cream
1 pinch ground cinnamon
1/2 cup simmering water
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Directions:
Combine butter, brown sugar, and confectioners' sugar in a large coffee mug; stir the mixture together with a fork until well combined. Pour in the rum, add the ice cream and cinnamon, and fill the remainder of the mug with simmering water. Mix the drink with the fork until the ice cream and butter have melted together to make a creamy topping. Sprinkle with a dash of nutmeg, and serve.

Description: 
All I could find were recipes for a quart of hot buttered rum mix...I don't have the room to store that much so I fiddled around with the measurements to do a single cup, and presto! Use creme brulee or French vanilla ice cream.
