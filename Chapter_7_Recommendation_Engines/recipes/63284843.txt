Ingredients:
3 large cucumbers (or 5 medium cucumbers), sliced
1 1/4 cups Sour Cream (Light or Regular)
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 tsp dill weed (dried)
1/8 tsp paprika
2-3 cloves fresh garlic, minced
2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
3/4 bunch green onions, diced (only use white to light green parts, discard dark green)
1/4 tsp salt, divided
1/8 tsp pepper

Directions:
Spread a paper towel on a plate and arrange cucumber slices in a single layer.  Sprinkle lightly with salt (using 1 part of divided salt.  You may need more salt depending on how large your slices are).  Place another paper towel on top and repeat until all cucumber slices are salted and nestled in the paper towels.  Place in refrigerator for at least two hours, but no more than six hours.
In a bowl, mix sour cream, apple cider vinegar, dill weed, garlic, paprika, green onions, sugar, pepper, 1 part salt.  Place in refrigerator at least one hour, but no more than four hours.
Mix salted cucumbers with sauce.  This can be served immediately but tastes bests after standing (in refrigerator) for 1-3 hours after mixing.

Description: 
I created this sour cream based recipe after trying several made with mayo - which I am not a fan of.  This is a flavorful dish!
