8 oz Sharp Cheddar shreaded, about 3 Cups
3 oz Gruyere shredded, about 1 Cup
4 Scallions, thinly sliced, optional
1 Cup Panko bread crumbs

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425* and set oven rack about 6" from bottom.
2.Bring a large of salted water to a boil. Add Macaroni and cook until is al dente, about 6 minutes. Strain saving 1 3/4 of the pasta water. Set aside.
3. Cook bacon in a large saucepan over medium heat until crispy  and most of the fat is rendered, 15 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate. Pour fat into a small heat safe measuring cup. Add enough olive oil to total 1/4 Cup of fat. Reserve.
4. Carefully wipe out the pan (or give it a quick rinse if really dirty).
5. Add Half-and-Half, add 2 tsp of pepper. Simmer over medium heat until reduced to 1 1/2 Cups, about 15 minutes. Add Cream Cheese and stir well until melted. Whisk in Cheddar and Gruyere until all cheeses are melted and sauce is smooth.

8. Toss bread crumbs with reserve bacon-fat mixture and pinch of salt  in a medium bowl. Sprinkle mix evenly over the top and bake until cheese is bubbly and breadcrumbs are lightly brown and crispy, about 10 minutes. Garnish with remaining Scallions, (optional, and serve.
