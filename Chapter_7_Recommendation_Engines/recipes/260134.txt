Ingredients:
¼ cup butter
½ cup minced celery
1 tablespoon onion powder
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ cup all-purpose flour
1 quart half-and-half
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon crushed dried thyme
½ teaspoon dried parsley
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth, or to taste
1 cup diced cooked chicken breast
1 cup finely shredded carrots
1 cup chopped fresh spinach leaves
1 (16 ounce) package potato gnocchi

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add celery, onion powder, and garlic powder. Whisk in flour and stir until light golden brown, about 5 minutes.
Whisk half-and-half into the flour mixture. Add salt, thyme, parsley, and nutmeg. Simmer, stirring until the mixture is well blended and smooth, 10 to 15 minutes. Whisk in chicken broth; stir in chicken breast and carrots. Bring soup to a boil.
Cook gnocchi in the boiling soup until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir in spinach; cook until liquid is slightly reduced, about 6 minutes.
