Ingredients:
1 Head of Cabbage
1 Can Cream of Mushroom Soup
1 Cup Milk
1/4 tsp Celery Salt
2 Cups Shredded Cheddar (or any cheese you prefer)
1 Small Can of Fried Onions

Directions:
Quarter the cabbage and remove the stem.
Boil in just enough water to cover until crisp-tender.
Drain and rinse in cold water to prevent further cooking.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and butter or spray 2 quart casserole dish.
Cut quartered cabbage into bite-sized pieces.
Mix soup, milk and celery salt in a bowl.
Cover the bottom of the casserole with a layer of cabbage.
Pour 1/4 of the soup mixture over the cabbage layer.
Cover that with 1/4 of the cheese.
Continue layering until all cabbage, soup and cheese are in the casserole.
Top with the fried onions.
Bake at 350 until bubbly and the onions are browned, about 1/2 hour.
