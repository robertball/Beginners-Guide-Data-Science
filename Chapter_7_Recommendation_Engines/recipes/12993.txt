Ingredients:
3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 medium head cabbage, sliced
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
3 cups water
1 (12 fluid ounce) can beer
1 tablespoon prepared Dijon-style mustard
1/4 tablespoon garlic powder
ground black pepper to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Bring potatoes, onions, and water to a boil, lower heat to simmer.
Add cabbage and mustard. Slowly add about 1/2 the beer (it will foam up a bit). Cover loosely. Let simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the beans, spices, and more/all of the beer to taste. Remove lid, let simmer another 10 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Add water if necessary. Re-spice if needed before serving.
