Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
2 (15 ounce) cans black-eyed peas, undrained
2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, undrained
1 cup water
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/4 teaspoons cumin
1 1/4 teaspoons dry mustard
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon sugar

Directions:
Place the bacon in a skillet and cook over medium-high heat until crisp and evenly brown. Drain on paper towels. When cool, crumble into small pieces.
Using the same skillet, add the peppers and onion; stir and cook over medium-high heat until transparent and tender, about 5 minutes.
Pour the black beans, tomatoes, and water into a large pot. Stir in the peppers, onion, salt, cumin, dry mustard, chili powder, curry powder, pepper, and sugar. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer 20 to 25 minutes. Serve hot sprinkled with bacon, and other toppings of your choice.
