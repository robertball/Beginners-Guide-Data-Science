Description: 
This is a yummy nutritious shake that you can have for breakfast or a snack. There are also variations you can make to make it healthier or tastier. For a healthier smoothie, add 1 tablespoon wheat germ. If you care more about taste than nutrition, use a chocolate-milk mix like Nesquick®, and use 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt in place of the plain yogurt and vanilla extract.
