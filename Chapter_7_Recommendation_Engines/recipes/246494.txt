Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless picnic ham, or more to taste
sea salt to taste
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup sorghum syrup
2 tablespoons brown mustard
1 tablespoon brandy
1 tablespoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
24 whole cloves
2 cups brewed coffee, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place ham fat side-up on a rack in a roasting pan. Score ham fat in a crisscross design; season with sea salt.
Mix brown sugar, sorghum syrup, brown mustard, brandy, dry mustard, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger together in a bowl for the basting mixture. Brush 1/3 basting mixture on top of ham and stick cloves into fat. Pour coffee into bottom of roasting pan.
Cook ham in the preheated oven, brushing with remaining basting mixture every 30 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 2 hours total.

Description: 
This is a mash up of two recipes with coffee added to give it a kick. It doesn't taste like coffee but I think it gives it a lift.
