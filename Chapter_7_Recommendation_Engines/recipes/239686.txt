Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell'sÂ® Condensed Tomato, Chipotle & Olive Oil Soup
1 medium onion, chopped
1/2 cup plain dry bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Thoroughly mix the beef, 1/2 cup soup, the onion, bread crumbs, egg, salt and black pepper in a large bowl. Place the beef mixture into a 13x9x2-inch baking pan and firmly shape into an 8x4-inch loaf.
Bake for 1 hour 10 minutes or until the meatloaf is cooked through. Let the meatloaf stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
Heat 2 tablespoons pan drippings, the remaining soup and the water in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat until the mixture is hot and bubbling, stirring occasionally. Serve with the meatloaf.
