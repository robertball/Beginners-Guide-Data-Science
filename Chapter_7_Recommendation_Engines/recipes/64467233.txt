Ingredients:
Cake:
1 1/3 cups of flour
1 tsp of baking powder
1/2 tsp of salt
1 stick of butter (softened)
1 cup of sugar
2 eggs
2 tsp of vanilla extract
1/2 cup of milk
Icing:
1 1/2 sticks of butter
3 cups of powdered sugar
A pinch of salt
2 tsp of vanilla extract
2 tbsp of milk (optional)
Food coloring

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 and line 36 mini cupcake tins.
Cake: Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Beat butter in a separate bowl with a mixer until creamy. Add sugar and beat until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, then add the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined.
Icing: Beat butter, powdered sugar, and a pinch of salt with a mixer until combined. Add vanilla and beat until creamy. For a smoother icing, add in milk. For a thicker frosting, leave the milk out. Add food coloring of your choosing.
