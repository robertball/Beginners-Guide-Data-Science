Description: 
These spiced green beans are back on the menu at our family gatherings again. For years, Grandma Wasnock had serve them on Christmas Day. We forgot about the recipe until my aunt served this dish at her daughter's wedding. That's when we found out the recipe came from a homemade cookbook my aunt received at her wedding shower. -John Wasnock, Medina, New York
