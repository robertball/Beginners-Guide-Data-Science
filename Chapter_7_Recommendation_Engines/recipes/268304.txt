Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
1 cup water
1 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup pomegranate, seeds only, or more to taste
16 candy stars

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a rectangular baking dish.
Combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Make an indention in the middle and pour in water, oil, and vanilla extract. Mix everything well into a smooth batter. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the surface is no longer shiny and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely.
Cut brownies into pointy triangles. Garnish each with pomegranate seeds and place a star-shaped candy on top.
