Ingredients:
30 frozen dinner rolls (Rhodes)
2 pounds ground beef
1 medium head cabbage
1 tsp celery salt
1 medium onion, chopped
1 Tbsp garlic salt
1/2 tsp pepper
2 cups grated cheddar cheese
2 cups mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Let dinner rolls thaw (about 3 hours) and rise until doubled in size. When the rolls have risen, brown ground beef in large skillet. Add chopped onion, cook until tender. Drain the grease from the beef mixture. Add celery salt, garlic salt and pepper. Shredd or finely chop cabbage and add to the meat mixture.Cover with a lid and continue to heat mixture at low temperature to steam the cabbage. For each bierock, combine 2 dinner rolls and roll flat on a greased countertop. Place some cheddar and mozzarella cheese on the thinly rolled dough and then place 2-3 spoonfuls of meat mixture on top of cheeses. Fold edges of dough over the filling, being sure to seal the edges. Turn the bierock over and place on a greased cookie sheet. Place bierocks about 2 inches apart. Bake in 350 degree oven for 25 minutes or until browned.
