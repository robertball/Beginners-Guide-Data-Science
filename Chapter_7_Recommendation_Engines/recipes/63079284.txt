Ingredients:
6 tbsp butter
1 cup chopped onion
1 lb white button mushrooms, sliced
1 tsp salt
2 1/2 lbs boneless chuck roast (or any other beef suitable for stew)
8 oz plain tomato sauce
2 tbsp Worchestershire sauce
1 tbsp granulated sugar
2 tsp paprika
1/8 tsp pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
melt the butter in a large dutch oven (or other large, heavy bottomed pot) over low heat. Add onion and mushrooms, sprinkle with salt, and cook until lightly browned, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the pot and set aside. Add 2 tbsp of oil to the pan and brown beef in 2 or three batches. When all the meat is cooked, return meat and onion to the pot.
Combine tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, paprika, pepper and garlic. Pour over meat mixture and stir well. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, over low heat for 2 1/2 hours or until meat is tender.
If you’re going to eat this all at once, add the sour cream, stir it in and let it heat through. If you’re going to freeze it, let the meat cool, then put in a freezer bag and freeze. To serve, thaw the meat completely, heat it over a low flame until hot, then add the sour cream, bring back to the temperature you want to eat it at and serve
