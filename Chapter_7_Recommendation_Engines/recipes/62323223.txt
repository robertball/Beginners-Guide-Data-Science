Ingredients:
1 cup of white distilled vinegar
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
5 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons paprika
2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
2 cups canola oil

Directions:
Place the first 7 ingredients in a blender (everything but the canola oil).
Blend on low to medium speed to combine ingredients.
While blender is running, remove the knob in the lid of the blender and S-L-O-W-L-Y add the oil in a steady stream through the open hole.
When all the oil has been added and the knob is back in place, increase to a high speed and process another minute or so until thick.

Description: 
This dressing is so good that I want to scoop it up and eat it by the spoonful!  I was trying to make something similar to the dressing in Max & Erma's Village or Third Street Chicken salads.  It's not quite it, but as close as I could get!
