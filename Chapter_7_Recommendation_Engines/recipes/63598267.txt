Ingredients:
1/2 Tbsp yeast
1 cup warm water (about 110 – 115 F)
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 tsp salt
1 Tbsp baking powder
4 Tbsp room temp unsalted butter, cut into pieces
shredded Mozzarella cheese
small jar of pizza sauce
olive oil
turkey pepperoni

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 400 F. Place the yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add in the water and stir gently to dissolve. Let sit for 10 minutes. Bubbles should form.
Meanwhile, in another bowl, mix together the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the butter pieces and use a pastry blender to cut together until it’s crumbly.
Add the dry ingredients to the stand mixer bowl. Attach a dough hook and turn to speed 2. Mix for about one minute until ingredients are incorporated. Scrape sides of bowl to make sure all dry ingredients are mixed. Turn mixer back to speed 2 and let it knead the dough for about 5 minutes.
Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper. Break off pieces of dough that are about a generous tablespoon. Shape into a small ball and place six on each baking sheet. You should end up with 18 small dough balls. Place them in a warm place to rest for 10 minutes.
Use a rolling pin and roll each dough ball into a small, thin round. Place back onto the baking sheet and very lightly brush with olive oil.
Bake each tray for 8 minutes. Until the bottoms are just browned. Remove from oven and cool.
Top with pizza sauce, cheese, and pepperonis.

My kids think I'm so mean because I won't buy them those little prepackaged lunch kits from the grocery store. This is a simple and healthier homemade version that they say tastes even better.
