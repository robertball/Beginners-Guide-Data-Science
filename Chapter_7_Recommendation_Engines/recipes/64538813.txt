Ingredients:
6-8 medium roma/plum tomatoes
1 small white onion
1/2 orange bell pepper
1/2 yellow bell pepper
1-2 jalapeno peppers
2 garlic cloves
1 lime
1 tsp salt
1 bunch cilantro, fresh

Directions:
Chop and combine the tomatoes, onions, bell and jalapeno peppers, and garlic. Note that if you use 2 jalapeno peppers, remove seeds from one of the peppers, if desired, to keep the heat down. If using cherry or grape tomatoes, after cutting, spin in  a salad spinner to remove excess juice.
Add salt and squeeze lime juice over vegetables. Remove cilantro leaves from the stems, finely chop and add to salsa. Mix well.
Refrigerate at least an hour before serving. Stir and adjust salt to taste. Enjoy with tortilla chips.

Description: 
I love fresh salsa during the summer, especially when I can use ingredients fresh from my garden. I also often make this with grape tomatoes, as I always seem to have an overabundance of them at the end of summer. If you use grape or cherry tomatoes, dice and then place in a salad spinner to remove excess juice before adding to other ingredients.
