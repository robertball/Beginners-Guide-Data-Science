Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked white rice
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 1/2 cups water, divided
2/3 cup light coconut milk
1/3 cup superfine sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Pour rice, cinnamon, and 3 cups water in a blender; blend until rice begins to break up, about 1 minute.
Transfer rice mixture to a large bowl and stir in remaining 1 1/2 cups water; let stand for at least 3 hours, whisking occasionally.
Strain rice mixture with a fine sieve into a large pitcher and discard rice.
Stir coconut milk, sugar, and vanilla extract into the pitcher. Chill completely and stir before serving over ice.

Description: 
A refreshing Mexican rice drink that's easy to make. I don't know if this version is traditional but I did have something similar at a very authentic Mexican restaurant.  Either way, it's still delicious!
