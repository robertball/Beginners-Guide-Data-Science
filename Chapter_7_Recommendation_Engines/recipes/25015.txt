Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup milk chocolate chips
2/3 cup peanut butter
2/3 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup shortening
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x9 inch baking pan.
In a medium bowl, blend together the butter, 1/2 cup peanut butter, white sugar, brown sugar, egg and 1 teaspoon of vanilla until smooth. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir  into the sugar mixture. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with chocolate chips. Let stand for a minute, then spread the chips to form a layer.
To make the topping, blend together the 2/3 cup peanut butter, confectioners' sugar and shortening. Gradually stir in the milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Gently mix in the whipped topping. Chill. When brownies and topping are both cooled, spread topping onto brownies and cut into bars.
