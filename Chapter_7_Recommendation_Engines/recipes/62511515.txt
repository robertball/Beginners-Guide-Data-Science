Ingredients:
Dry ingredients
* 1 cup whole wheat flour (a pinch more depending on the moisture of the mix)
* 1 1/2 cups of Large Flake Rolled Oats (smaller flake is ok too)
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1-3 Tbsp Cinnamon (depending on preference)
* 1/2 tsp Nutmeg (optional)
Wet ingredients
* 1/2 cup honey
* 1/2 cup oil (or applesauce, if you wish)
* 1 Tbsp Molasses
* 1 egg (beat with 1 Tbsp Water)
* 1 tsp Vanilla
Add-in ingredients
* 1/2 cup raisins
* 1/2 cup walnuts

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix all the dry ingredients together.
In a medium bowl, mix all the wet ingredients together. Hint: when measuring out the honey, spray the measuring cup with oil or baking spray - your honey won't stick.
Mix the wet and dry ingredients. Add the raisins and walnuts and mix. If the mixture seems too wet, add a bit of flour. If it isn't binding together very well, you may wish to add an egg white.
COOL the mix for 20 minutes in the fridge.
Preheat the oven to 335 degrees (lower temperature due to the honey in the recipe which will burn more easily).
Drop by teaspoonfuls onto your baking sheet (I recommend lining the baking sheet with parchment paper). Press down with a fork to ensure even cooking.
Bake for about 15 - 20 minutes or until golden on the bottom of the cookie. The cookies freeze very well and make a great snack! Enjoy.
