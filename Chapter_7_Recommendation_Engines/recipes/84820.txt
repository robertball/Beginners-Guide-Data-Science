Ingredients:
4 large ripe firm pears (Bosc, Bartlett, D'Anjou)
1 cup pear nectar
1 cup water
3/4 cup maple syrup
2 sticks McCormick® Gourmet Collection® Stick Cinnamon, slightly crushed
1 1/2 teaspoons McCormick® Gourmet Collection® Thyme Leaves
4 strips lemon peel

Directions:
Peel and core pears* from the bottom, leaving stems intact. Cut a thin slice off the bottom of each pear to provide a flat, even bottom. Set aside.
In a medium saucepan, add remaining ingredients. Bring mixture to a boil. Add pears and arrange standing with stems pointing up. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, 20-30 minutes or until pears are tender.
Remove pears from saucepan. Continue to cook liquid until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 15 minutes. Serve pears drizzled with sauce.
