Ingredients:
3lbs chicken pieces (thighs, drumsticks, bone-in breast)
6 oz container non-fat plain yogurt
1 egg (or 2 egg whites)
3/4 cup flour
1 1/2 cups toasted or plain breadcrumbs ( or crushed Ritz crackers)
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp garlic salt
1 1/2 tsp onion powder
1 1/2 tsp Old Bay Seasoning
3 Tbl chopped French's Onion Strings (optional, but yummy!)
1 Tbl dried parsley

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 degrees.
Line baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with non-stick spray
Wash and thouroughly dry chicken pieces.
Using two large ziploc-type bags, put flour in one. In the other bag, put bread crumbs, pepper, salt, onion powder, Old Bay, French's onion strings and parsley together and give it a shake to combine.
In a medium sized bowl, beat egg and yogurt together.
Use a pair of thongs and dip 1 piece of chicken into flour bag, covering thouroughly. Shake off excess. Then dip into yogurt/egg bowl, covering the chicken. Then place into bread crumb bag and cover the chicken completely. Then put the chicken onto waiting baking sheet.  Do this for all of your chicken.
Place into oven. For thighs/drumsticks, cook 35-40 minutes. If using breasts, check after 20 minutes for doneness. Use a meat thermometer to make sure that it is safe.
You want the coating to be nice and crispy!
