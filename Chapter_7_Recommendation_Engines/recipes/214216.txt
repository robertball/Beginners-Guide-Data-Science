Ingredients:
6 (4 ounce) boneless pork loin chops
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
2 shallots, minced
2 teaspoons dried thyme leaves
3/4 cup sweet port wine
3/4 cup blackberry juice
3/4 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
2 teaspoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons water
2 cups fresh blackberries

Directions:
Season the pork chops on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and pan fry the chops until they are lightly browned and no longer pink in the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Set the chops aside.
Heat 1 more teaspoon of olive oil in the skillet, and cook and stir the shallots and thyme until the shallots start to become translucent, about 1 minute. Pour in the port wine, blackberry juice, chicken broth, and balsamic vinegar. Bring the mixture to a boil, scraping off and dissolving any brown flavor bits from the skillet into the sauce. Cook until reduced by a third, about 5 minutes. Mix cornstarch and water into a paste, and stir into the sauce. Cook until thickened, stirring constantly, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, and stir in the blackberries. Simmer until berries are hot.
Return the chops to the skillet, and turn to coat with sauce. Serve hot, topped with sauce.

Description: 
I love pork chops. I love fruit with pork chops. The most common fruit accompaniment for pork is apple, but I wanted to try something a little different. I considered apricots (I love them too), but thought they are too sweet. After reading a number of different recipes, I settled on blackberries. They are tart and, I thought, would pair well with a sweet port to make the sauce.
