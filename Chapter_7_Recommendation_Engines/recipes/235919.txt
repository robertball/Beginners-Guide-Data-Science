Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
3/4 cup cornmeal
2 tablespoons baking soda
4 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups grated carrots
1 1/2 cups chopped tomatoes
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
1 clove garlic, pressed
1 (10.75 ounce) can tomato soup
1/4 cup olive oil
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking soda, baking powder, chili powder, oregano, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir carrots, tomatoes, celery, and garlic into flour mixture.
Whisk tomato soup and olive oil together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until batter is just combined. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle each muffin with black pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
Savory muffins with no sugar, only yummy vegetables. Great as a more flavorful 'biscuit' for 'biscuits and gravy'. Good any time of day! You can substitute garlic salt or seasoned salt for the salt if desired.
