Ingredients:
1  tablespoon water
1  tablespoon Worcestershire sauce for chicken
1  teaspoon lemon juice
1  teaspoon Dijon-style mustard
4  3-ounce boneless pork top loin chops, cut 3/4 to 1 inch thick
1/2  to 1 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning
1  tablespoon butter or margarine
1  tablespoon snipped fresh chives, parsley, or oregano

Directions:
For sauce, in a small bowl stir together the water, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and mustard; set aside.
2. Trim fat from chops. Sprinkle both sides of each chop with lemon-pepper seasoning. In a 10-inch skillet melt butter over medium heat. Add chops and cook for 8 to 12 minutes or until pork juices run clear (160 degrees F), turning once halfway through cooking time. Remove from heat. Transfer chops to a serving platter; cover and keep warm.
3. Pour sauce into skillet; stir to scrape up any crusty browned bits from bottom of skillet. Pour sauce over chops. Sprinkle with chives. Makes 4 servings.
