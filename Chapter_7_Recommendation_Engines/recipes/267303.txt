Ingredients:
Dressing:
1 medium red bell pepper, chopped
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup chopped yellow onion
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons honey
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
1/2 teaspoon garlic paste
Salad:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 peaches, sliced into eighths
1/2 pound kale leaves, veins removed
1/3 cup goat cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine red bell pepper, vinegar, onion, oil, honey, ginger, and garlic paste in a jar with a lid. Cover jar, shake, and refrigerate dressing 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place peaches and kale on the preheated grill. Toss kale continuously until softened and lightly charred on the edges, about 5 minutes. Cook and turn peaches until grill marks appear, about 3 minutes per side.
Place cooked kale in a serving bowl and toss with dressing. Top with cooked peaches and goat cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm.
