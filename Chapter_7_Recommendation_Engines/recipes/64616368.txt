Ingredients:
1 3-4lb whole chicken
1 large onion, rough chop
3 carrots, rough chop
3 stalks celery, rough chop
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 tsp poultry seasoning
12 frozen buttermilk biscuits, thawed (saves time)
all purpose flour to roll out biscuits

Directions:
Place chicken, onion, carrots, celery, salt, pepper and poultry seasoning in Dutch oven, cover with water, bring to a boil on high heat. Reduce to simmer, cover, until cooked through, about 40 minutes.
Remove the chicken from the Dutch oven, allow to cool, pull off the skin and fat, separate all the meat from the bones, refrigerate meat until needed.  Add the bones back to the pot, along with about 3 more cups of water, and bring the broth back to a simmer for another 40 mins-1 hour.
Place a large heat-proof bowl in the sink and place a large colander over the bowl, pour the contents of the pot through the strainer into the bowl. Return the chicken broth to the Dutch oven along with the meat and return to a boil.
Roll out biscuits in flour one at a time, using a pizza cutter, cut the biscuits into rectangle shape. Once the chicken broth reaches a rolling boil, carefully add the biscuits to the broth, stirring to keep them from sticking. Cook the dumplings at medium high heat until they stop floating and sink, approximately 10 minutes. Reduce heat, simmer 20 minutes.
