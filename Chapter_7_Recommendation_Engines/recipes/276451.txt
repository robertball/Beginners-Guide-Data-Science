Ingredients:
1/4 cup minced onion
1 tablespoon Italian-style salad dressing
1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
1 1/4 cups Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
5 cloves garlic, crushed
2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 (14.5 ounce) cans Italian-style diced tomatoes
1 (26 ounce) jar marinara sauce
2 teaspoons dried basil

Directions:
Saute onion and Italian dressing in a small saute pan over medium heat for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
Combine turkey, bread crumbs, garlic, sauteed onions, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper in a bowl; mix well.
Combine diced tomatoes and marinara in a second bowl; set aside.
Form 1/2 of the turkey mixture into 1 1/2-inch meatballs and layer them in the bottom of a slow cooker. Pour 1/2 of the tomato mixture over the meatballs. Form the remaining turkey mixture into meatballs and layer with remaining tomato mixture.
Cover and cook until no longer pink in the centers, about 4 hours on High, or 8 hours on Low.
