Description: 
I had pork, and cabbage a few days ago, and was wondering how I could reuse the rest of the left over pork stock. So when I was at Walmart I seen some Pork Kielbasa so I figured that would go well with the stock. It actually turned out really good. If you don't have any pork stock, You can use Better Than Bouillon Ham Base from Superior touch It is a stock base that many restaurants use. or I think chicken stock would be a good compromise.
