Ingredients:
1 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup honey
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 naan bread
4 ounces ricotta cheese
2 fresh peaches, sliced
1 (3 ounce) package prosciutto, torn into pieces
3 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil

Directions:
Combine balsamic vinegar, honey, lemon juice, and pepper in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce to low. Simmer until mixture has reduced down to 1/3 cup, about 15 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Grill naan until faint char marks appear, 2 to 3 minutes. Spread ricotta cheese over the charred side. Top with peaches and prosciutto. Sprinkle with basil. Drizzle with balsamic reduction.
Return flatbreads to to the grill. Grill with the cover on, until the cheese is melted and the bottom of the flatbread begins to char, about 7 minutes.
