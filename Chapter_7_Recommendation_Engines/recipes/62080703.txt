Ingredients:
1/4 cup rice flour
1/4 cup sorghum flour
1/4 cup tapioca flour
1/4 cup chestnut flour
1/4 tsp Xanthan Gum
1/2 cup cocao powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
8 ounces chocolate chips, dark chocolate,  or chopped milk chocolate
1/2 cup butter
1 1/2 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 tsp gluten-free vanilla

Directions:
Mix all flours, cocoa, soda, and salt - set aside
Melt half the chocolate with the butter and vanilla, and whisk a bit to cool
Mix eggs into the dry mix, and then slowly pour the chocolate in while mixing with hand or mixer
Fold in rest of chocolate chips
On parchement paper on your pad, drop Tbsp scoops roughly ball shaped, 2 inches apart
Bake 12 - 15 min at 325F until cookies spread and surface is a bit cracked, don't overcook - they'll be soft when you take 'em out, and will crisp and stay chewy
I dusted with icing sugar...looks nice with the dark chocolate

Description: 
These are probably the best gluten-free cookies I've ever made.  Not chalky, but chewy.  I haven't tried making these egg-free, but that might work.  I make a flour mix for baking that is quarter each of rice, sorghum, tapioca and chestnut flours, with a pinch of Xanthan gum, then use it in place of flour...sifting or whisking helps.  I also discovered Canoleo which is 100% canola margarine (soy-free!!!!)..I haven't baked with it, but maybe it will work for this recipe to make it soy-free.
