Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup water
1/2 teaspoon maple flavored extract

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the white sugar, brown sugar and water. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 3 minutes. Stir in the maple extract and vanilla, and remove form the heat. Let cool, and serve at room temperature. Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator. Be aware that it may crystallize a little if the container is not completely airtight.

Description: 
This was the syrup I grew up with.  It tastes fabulous without all the extra work on getting real tapped maple syrup.  It's also a cheaper way to have syrup, as these are things I always have in my cupboard.
