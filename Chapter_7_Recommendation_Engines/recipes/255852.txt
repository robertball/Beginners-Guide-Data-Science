Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1 ripe banana
4 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
5 cups chocolate chips
2 cups sweetened flaked coconut
2 cups chopped almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.
Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
Beat white sugar, brown sugar, and banana together in a separate bowl until smooth and creamy; beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until well mixed. Stir in vanilla extract.
Stir banana mixture into flour mixture until batter is well mixed; fold in chocolate chips, coconut, and almonds. Drop batter by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are beginning to crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
