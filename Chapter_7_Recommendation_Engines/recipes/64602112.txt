Beat the cream cheese and pumpkin until smooth.  Add the eggs, vanilla, and butter and beat together.  Next add the powdered sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg, and mix well.  Spread the pumpkin mixture other the cake mixture and bake for 50 min.  Make sure not to over bake as the center should be a little jiggly.  Allow to cool completely and serve.
