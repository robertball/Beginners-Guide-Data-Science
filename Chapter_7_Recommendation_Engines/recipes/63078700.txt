Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped
1 (16 ounce) can kidney beans (drained and rinsed)
1 (15 ounce) can black beans (drained and rinsed)
1 (15 ounce) frozen corn
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce (no salt added)
2 cups homemade chicken broth
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chilies, undrained [I used Rotel: 1 can mild, 1 can original]
3 whole skinless, boneless chicken breasts [used frozen]
Bill Echols Taco Seasoning:
1 tablespoon chili powder 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon paprika 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)
sour cream (optional)
whole tortilla chips (optional) I used them to eat this with...it is more like a chili than a soup.

Directions:
Place the onion, chili beans, black beans, corn, tomato sauce, beer, and diced tomatoes in a slow cooker. Add taco seasoning, and stir to blend. Lay chicken breasts on top of the mixture, pressing down slightly until just covered by the other ingredients. Set slow cooker for low heat, cover, and cook for 7-9 hours on low.
Remove chicken breasts from the soup and shred. Stir the shredded chicken back into the soup and serve topped with shredded Cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and crushed tortilla chips, if desired.
