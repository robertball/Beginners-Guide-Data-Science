Ingredients:
2 T olive oil
1 1/2 cup onions, chopped
1 cup bell pepper, chopped
3 cloves garlic
1 zucchini, chopped
1 can corn, drained
1 can beans (black, chili, whatever)
1 can tomatoes, diced
8 ounce can of tomato sauce
1/2 to 1 cup water (to taste)
2 T chili powder
1/2 T cumin
1/4 t cayenne
2 Serrano chilies, optional

Directions:
In a large, heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.
Add the onions, bell peppers, garlic, and serrano peppers, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.
Add the zucchini and corn and cook, stirring, until soft and the vegetables give off their liquid and start to brown around the edges, about 6 minutes.
Add the chili powder, cumin, salt and cayenne, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add the tomatoes and stir well. Add the beans, tomato sauce, and water (or stock), stir well, and bring to a boil.
Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes.
To serve, place 1/4 cup of brown rice in the bottom of each bowl. Ladle the chili into the bowls over the rice. Top each serving with a dollop of sour cream and spoonful of avocado. Sprinkle with Essence and green onions and serve.
