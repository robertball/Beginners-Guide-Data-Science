Description: 
This recipe is great hot or cold. I invented it in grad school when I had no time to cook. It's a quick and easy one dish recipe. I use it as a side dish for nice meals or a full meal for lunch. You can make it in 5 minutes or less and eat immediately. For extra protein you can add chicken breast.
