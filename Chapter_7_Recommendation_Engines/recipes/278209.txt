Description: 
I came up with this cake as a way to use up some extra pumpkin puree and a few really ripe bananas. It's a better-for-you cake that isn't overly sweet, but still chock-full of flavor. Make sure to use really, really overripe bananas for the best results. If you're looking for additional sweetness, feel free to add some kind of glaze to the top of the cake as well. Adjust the add-ins (i.e. the nuts and chocolate) and spices to suit your tastes.
