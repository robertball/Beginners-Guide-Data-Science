Ingredients:
8 veal shanks
28 oz canned whole tomatoes
5 garlic cloves
12 oz stout beer
1 lb fresh spinach
2 tbsp clarified butter
Salt & pepper, to taste
2 tbsp olive oil
1 thyme sprig
1 rosemary sprig

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300Â°F.
Season both sides of the veal shanks with salt and pepper.
Place your pot over high heat, heat the butter and oil, then add the veal shanks.
Sear the shanks on both sides until golden brown. Remove them from the pot and set aside.
Empty the can of tomatoes into a large bowl and squeeze them with your hands until crushed. Remove the crushed tomatoes from the juice and place on a large plate.
Add the garlic and beer to the pot and allow to reduce for about 5 minutes.
Return the shanks to the pot, then add the crushed tomatoes and a bit of the tomato juice, if desired.
Throw the thyme and rosemary sprigs into the pot.
Cover and transfer to the oven. Cook for 3 to 4 hours, or until the meat is fork tender.
Plate alongside your favorite veggies and sides. (It's great served over rice!)
Serve and enjoy!
