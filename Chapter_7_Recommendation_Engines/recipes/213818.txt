Ingredients:
2 large egg whites
1/2 cup white sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon lime juice
1 (7 ounce) package toasted flake coconut
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl. Gradually add the sugar, continuing to beat until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Add the salt and lime juice and continue beating until the egg whites form a sharp peak that holds its shape when you lift your beater or whisk. Gently folk the coconut and cocoa powder into the mixture.
Drop mixture by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake until golden brown and firm to the touch, about 20 minutes. Cool on the pans on wire racks. Store in an airtight container.
