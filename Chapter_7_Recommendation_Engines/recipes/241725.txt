Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
6 cups vegetable oil for frying
12 ounces frozen calamari rings, thawed and drained
salt to taste
2 tablespoons cocktail sauce, or to taste
1 lemon, quartered

Directions:
Stir flour, 2 teaspoons salt, paprika, and black pepper together in a shallow bowl.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Press calamari rings into the flour mixture until evenly coated, shaking off excess flour.
Working in batches, fry calamari rings in the hot oil until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer cooked calamari to a paper towel-lined plate; sprinkle with salt. Serve calamari with cocktail and lemon wedges.
