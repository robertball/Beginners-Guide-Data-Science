Ingredients:
½ teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon canola oil
2 tablespoons chile paste
2 cloves garlic, chopped
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch cubes
½ cup soy sauce
1  onion, sliced lengthwise into eighths
½ medium head cabbage, coarsely chopped
2  carrots, coarsely chopped
8 ounces soba noodles, cooked and drained

Directions:
In a large skillet combine sesame oil, canola oil and chili paste; stir-fry 30 seconds. Add garlic and stir fry an additional 30 seconds. Add chicken and 1/4 cup of the soy sauce and stir fry until chicken is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Remove mixture from pan, set aside, and keep warm.
In the emptied pan combine the onion, cabbage, and carrots. Stir-fry until cabbage begins to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining soy sauce, cooked noodles, and the chicken mixture to pan and mix to blend. Serve and enjoy!
