Ingredients:
1/2 lb. (about 3 links) Italian turkey sausage, casings removed
1 medium yellow onion, diced
2 carrots, peeled and coarsely diced
1 zucchini, cut into half moon shapes
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 can (15 ounce) cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
2 cups water
2 tsp better than bouillon chicken base
1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 tsp rosemary
1/2 tsp Italian herbs
1 bunch spinach, leaves chopped

Directions:
Set instant pot to sauté mode. Add the sausage and sauté, breaking it into pieces with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the water, bouillon stock, beans, zucchini onion, carrots, and garlic. Stir once.
Cover the pot and cook on high pressure for 3 minutes.
Use a quick release. Add the herbs, spinach, and stir until spinach has wilted down. Ladle into bowls and top with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This isn’t what I would say is an authentic or traditional minestrone. It’s simply my way of making a hearty minestrone that’s amazingly healthy and finished in under 15 minutes!  I prefer not to use salt or pepper in much of my cooking preferring to allow the flavors of the food to shine through
