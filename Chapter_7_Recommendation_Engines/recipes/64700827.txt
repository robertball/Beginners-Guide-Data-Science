Add grated carrots and oatmeal, simmer an additional 10 minutes. Add pureed veggies or baby food. Cool before serving.
Powdered egg shell (wash shells, bake @ 350 for 10 minutes, crush to powder) or
In a pressure cooker, take chicken bones and cook for about 45 minutes to 60 minutes in water  until they are really soft, put in blender and blend into a liquid. This way you get all the marrow and the calcium. Use this as some of the liquid.
