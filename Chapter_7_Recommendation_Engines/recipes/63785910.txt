6 boneless chicken thighs
Carrots, Chopped Into Big Chunks
Potatoes, Chopped Into Big Chunks
2 (10.75 ounce) cans  condensed cream of celery soup
salt and pepper to taste
1 (12 ounce) package refrigerated biscuit dough

Directions:
In a large pot over high heat, combine the chicken with enough water to cover, and boil for 15 to 20 minutes. Drain some of the water from the pot, reserving 3 cups in the pot. Remove chicken and allow it to cool, then pull it apart into bite size pieces; return to pot.
Reduce heat to medium, and add the cans of condensed soup. Season with salt and pepper. Pull the biscuit dough into pieces, and add to the soup. Simmer over medium heat for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the dough is cooked through.
