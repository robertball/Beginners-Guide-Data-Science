Pear Mimosa Recipe

Ingredients:
3 parts sparkling wine
2 parts sparkling pear cider

Directions:
Pour ice cold sparkling wine into a champagne flute first, then add the pear cider slowly so as not to fizz over.  Serve chilled, serve immediately.  Works with any sparkling fruit cider.  I've tried peach and apple as well, with wonderful results!  Also less labor intensive if you are like me and prefer fresh hand-squeezed oj from the back yard to the store-bought, artificially sweetened, 20% juice stuff.

Description: 
Ran out of orange juice one morning and was too hot and tired to squeeze more and... Viola!  It also tastes lighter than the orange juice version and doesn't diminish that lovely champagne fizz.  Perfect for the south, where its 85 degrees at 10 am for brunch out on the porch!
