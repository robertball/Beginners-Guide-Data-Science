Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 large onion, diced
2 1/2 cups trimmed and halved snow peas
1 cup sugar snap peas, trimmed
1 cup chopped bok choy
1 1/2 pinches curry powder
3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Cook and stir onion until slightly softened, about 1 minute. Add snow peas, sugar snap peas, and bok choy; stir-fry until bright green, about 8 minutes. Stir in curry powder. Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in feta cheese.
Push snow pea mixture into a mountain in the center of the skillet; let cook for 3 minutes. Push mountain down with your spatula and cook for 3 to 5 minutes more.

One day I just wanted a good stir-fry for lunch and curry powder spilt all over my veggies when I was cooking them! I guess you could say this was an accidental discovery!
