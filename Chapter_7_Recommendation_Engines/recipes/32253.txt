Ingredients:
1 (12 fluid ounce) can frozen lemonade concentrate, thawed
1 (6 ounce) can frozen limeade concentrate
4 1/4 cups water
1 (750 milliliter) bottle light rum

Directions:
In a large freezable container, mix lemonade concentrate, limeade concentrate, water and rum. Freeze for 24 hours.
When frozen, break up with a wooden spoon, stir and serve. Store remainder in freezer until needed. Be sure to stir before serving, as the alcohol tends to settle to the bottom.
