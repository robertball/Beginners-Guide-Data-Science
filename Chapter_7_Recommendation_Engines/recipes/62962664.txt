Ingredients:
one packaged corned beef brisket with spice packet
one 12 oz bottle of beer of your choice
crock pot

Directions:
Rinse the corned beef in cool water lay meat down flat in a crock pot.
Open the seasoning packet that came with the corned beef and sprinkle the seasoning packet over meat. Pour a 12 oz bottle of beer pour over the corned beef and the packet seasonings.
Set the crock pot on low cook for 6 to 7 hours. Remove corned beef from the liquid when done and slice thin on a meat slicer. Put on a pretty plate and add a very small amount of the cooking liquid about 1/4  to 1/3 cup just to moisten the meat not to much as the liquid is quite salty. Let everyone help themselves Serve with warmed french or rye bread and spicy mustard.
