Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) boneless pork loin
2 tablespoons onion powder
2 tablespoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season the pork loin evenly with the onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper; place into a roasting pan.
Cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
