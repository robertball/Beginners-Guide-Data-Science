Ingredients:
8 cardamom pods
4 4 inch cinnamon sticks, broken
12 whole cloves
1 can (11.5 oz) frozen cranberry juice concentrate
4 cups red wine
1/2 cup honey
Cranberries and orange slices, for garnish

Directions:
Cut a 6-inch square from a double thickness of cotton cheesecloth to make a spice bag. Pinch the caramom pods to break. Center the cardamom, cinnamon and cloves on the cheesecloth, bring up the corners and tie closed with clean kitchen string.
In a 3 1/2-to-6 quart slow cooker, mix the cranberry juice concentrate with water according to the directions on the can.  Stir in the wine and honey, add the spice bag. Cover and cook on low 4-6 hours or on high 2- 2 1/2 hours. Remove and discard the spice bag. Ladle the punch into glasses and garnish with cranberries and orange slices.
