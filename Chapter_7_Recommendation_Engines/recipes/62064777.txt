Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 egg, well beaten
1/2 cup italian seasoned breadcrumbs
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
1 1/2 cup shredded italian cheese (the asiago, romano, mozzerella combo pack)
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 tsp basil
1 tsp oregano
1 cup spaghetti sauce
extra shredded italian cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. In a small bowl combine shredded cheese, garlic, basil and oregano. In another small bowl, combine grated parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs.
Butterfly each chicken breast, and pound slightly to flatten. Fill each chicken breast with the shredded cheese mixture and 'close' the breast. Coat the outside of the chicken with some egg. Then coat the chicken with the breadcrumb mixture.
Place each breast side by side in a 9 x 13 baking dish. Bake for 45 minutes. About 5 minutes before its finished, pour the spaghetti sauce evenly over each breast and sprinkle some additional shredded cheese on top of the sauce, if desired. Bake until the sauce is bubbly and the cheese is melted, about 5 more minutes.
