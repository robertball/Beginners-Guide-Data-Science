Ingredients:
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
4 pounds bone-in country-style pork ribs
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 medium onion, sliced and separated into rings
1 (14.5 ounce) can beef broth
1/4 cup ketchup
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
3 whole cloves
3 whole allspice
1 garlic clove, minced
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, salt and pepper. Add ribs, a few pieces at a time, and shake to coat. In a large skillet, brown ribs in oil; transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with onion. Combine the remaining ingredients; pour over ribs.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/4 hours or until meat is tender. Remove ribs to a serving platter; keep warm. Strain liquid; skim fat. Serve sauce with ribs.

Description: 
Whenever I need a surefire company pleaser, I cook up these scrumptious ribs. Usually, I double or triple the recipe, since the ribs freeze well and keep their flavor when reheated. The meat's tender and tasty every time.
