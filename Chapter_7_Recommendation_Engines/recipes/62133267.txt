Ingredients:
3/4 cup honey
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup mirin
3 tbsp sesame oil
1/2 cup pineapple juice
1/2 cup orange juice (no pulp)
2 tbsp crushed ginger
1 clove minced garlic
Splash hot chili oil
1 tbsp crushed lemon grass (buy it in the tube to make it easy!)
Juice of 1/2 a lime
Peel of one orange

Directions:
Combine the liquid ingredients in a large mixing bowl, wisk until thoroughly combined. Add the ginger, garlic, and lemon grass.
Take the orange peel and scrape some of the pith off the back. Slice the orange peel into long strips and then chop very finely. Add to the marinade.
This is awesome on chicken.. great as a marinade for flank steak or tri tip!
