Ingredients:
4 Boneless Skinless Chicken breasts
2 Tbsp lemon juice (any kind)
2 Tbsp vegetable oil
2 Tbsp soya sauce
2-4 Tbsp dried basil

Directions:
Cut the chicken into strips.  Sprinkle your cutting board with basil and roll chicken strips until lightly coated.  In a bowl, wisk together lemon juice, oil and soya sauce.  Place chicken in bowl an stir gently with a large spoon until coated with liquid.  Let marinade for 5-10 minutes.  Do not leave in marinade for too long.  Lay strips on a broiler pan.  Broil until browned & no longer pink inside.  If you prefer to BBQ these, leave the chicken breasts whole and follow the same procedure - however let them marinade for 30 minutes.  BBQ until no longer pink inside.
