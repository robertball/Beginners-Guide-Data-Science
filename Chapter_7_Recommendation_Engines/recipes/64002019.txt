Ingredients:
2 tbs cold butter, cubed
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 very ripe large banana, mashed
1 egg
2/3 cup flour
1/2 scant tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/8 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp cinnamon, ground
1/8 tsp cardamom, ground (opt.)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 deg F and prepare a 6 serving muffin pan, greased or lined with paper cupcake liners. A small loaf pan, greased, may be used instead.
In a large bowl, using a fork, cream together the butter and the sugar. Add the mashed banana and the egg and mix well.
Mix the remaining dry ingredients together in another bowl. Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients a few tablespoons at time, stirring to form a batter.
Pour batter into loaf pan, or spoon into muffin liners about one-half to three-quarters full.
Bake 20-25 minutes for muffins or 25-30 minutes for a small loaf.
Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes (if you can wait that long!) ;)

Description: 
My dear Nana Edna was a young mother during the lean depression years of the 1930's. Frugality was a way of life for her and nothing EVER went to waste, even after she and my grandfather overcame the hardships they had endured and retired to a comfortable life in a sunny Los Angeles suburb. 

I could feel her spirit as I developed this simple recipe to use up one overripe lonely banana.
