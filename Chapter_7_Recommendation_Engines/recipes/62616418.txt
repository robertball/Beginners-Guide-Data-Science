Ingredients:
6 links Isernio’s Sausage, variety of choice
1 large onion, thinly sliced
3 bell peppers – yellow, orange and red, seeded and cut into ¼ inch strips
1 medium zucchini, cut into ¼ inch rounds
2 large baking potatoes, peeled and cut into ¼ inch thick half rounds
2 tablespoons fresh chopped oregano (or 1 teaspoon dried)
6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Salt and freshly ground pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet on medium heat, brown sausage on both sides, about 4 minutes or until lightly browned, set skillet aside. Sausage does not need to be cooked through, just browned on the outside. Place the onion, bell peppers, zucchini, potatoes and oregano in a large bowl. Drizzle generously with 5 tablespoons of olive oil and season well with salt and pepper. Mix well. Place the browned sausages and vegetable mixture on a large rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan, uncovered. Bake at 350°F for 50 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add salt and pepper to taste.
