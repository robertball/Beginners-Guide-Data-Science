Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup Raspberry Jam
Lemon Icing
1 cup confectioner's sugar
1 tbsp. lemon juice
1/4 tsp. lemon zest
1/2 tsp. vanilla
dash of salt

Directions:
Beat butter and sugar in large bowl with electric mixer until creamy.  Beat in egg unti light and fluffy.  Mix in flour, lemon juice and peel, baking powder and salt.  Cover refrigerate about 2 hours or until firm.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll out dough, a small amount at a time, to 1/4-inch thickness on well-floured surface with floured rolling pin. (Keep remaining dough in refrigerator.) Cut with 3-inch round cookie cutter. Transfer to ungreased cookie sheets or silpats.
Bake 8 minutes until lightly browned on edges.
Cool on wax paper slightly then spread approximately 1/2 teaspoon of raspberry jam on each cookie.
Make the Lemon Icing by sifting powdered sugar into a small bowl. Whisk in lemon juice, lemon zest and vanilla. Sprinkle in dash of salt and mix until smooth. Put a cookie on top of each cookie to make a "sandwich" cookie. Drizzle small amount of icing on each cookie until covered. Let stand until icing has set, then put in an airtight container or freeze.

Description: 
I used this basic lemon cookie recipe to make my Frosted Raspberry Sandwich Cookies that I give as Christmas gifts! The cookie itself is rather plain until you combine the raspberry jam and sweet tart icing! After that they're delicious!Modified from: Lemon Butter Cookies
