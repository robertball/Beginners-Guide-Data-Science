Ingredients:
350g high-quality mincemeat.
200g plain flour, sifted.
40g golden caster sugar.
125g unsalted butter, diced.
1 large egg, beaten.
Milk, to glaze.

Directions:
Lightly butter a 12-hole cake tin. Tip the mincemeat into a bowl and stir so that the liquid is evenly distributed.
Place the flour, sugar and butter in a food processor and process briefly until resembling breadcrumbs, then slowly add the egg through the feeder tube (or rub the butter into the dry ingredients by hand and stir in the egg).
Bring the mixture together with your hands, wrap in clingfilm and chill for an hour. Thinly roll out the pastry onto a floured surface. Cut out 12 circles with a fluted pastry cutter, large enough to fill the base of the prepared cake tin. Press gently into each hole, then fill evenly with the mincemeat.
Cut out another 12 slightly smaller circles and use to cover the mincemeat. Press the edges together with the end of a fork to seal. Make a small slit in the top of each, then brush lightly with milk. Chill for about 30 minutes.
While chilling, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Bake the pies for 20 minutes until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack and serve warm. Enjoy!
