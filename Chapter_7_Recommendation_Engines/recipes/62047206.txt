Ingredients:
Mollasses
Clean snow

Directions:
I read the Laura Ingall's Wilder books too and I know that the candy they made was of really thick Maple syrup or soem molasses. You just take a bowl and fill it with a lot of clean snow and drizzle the mollasses(or maple) over the snow and let it harden. then pick up the hard candy and eat it or save it for Christmas day!
