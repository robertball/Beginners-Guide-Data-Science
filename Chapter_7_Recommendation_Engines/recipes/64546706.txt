Prepare the dressing by putting the first five ingredients in a blender or food processor and add the oil in until it's all emulsified together. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Cook the pasta per package directions in boiling salted water
Once the pasta is done, drain it, but do not rinse and let cool just slightly.
Add about 2/3 of the dressing immediately  and toss to coat. Refrigerate in a covered bowl for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
Pull from the fridge, add the rest of the dressing , all the other ingredients and toss to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
A typical Greek orzo pasta salad, but what sets this aside is the dressing you prepare ahead of time and let soak into the hot pasta... and, oh yeah, pine nuts.
