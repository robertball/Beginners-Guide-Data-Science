Ingredients:
12 cups of Zucchini, shredded
4 cups of chopped Onions
5 tablespoons Salt
2 1/2 cups Apple Cider Vinegar
5 cups white Sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons Celery Seeds
1/2 teaspoon Black Pepper

Directions:
Shred the zucchini and chop the onions.
Put zucchini and onions in a bowl, add salt, and place in your refrigerator and let stand overnight.
Next day, rinse the salty brine off the zucchini and onions with cold water and drain well.
Mix the spices together so they do not clump.
Combine vinegar and sugar in a pan to cook on the stove, add the spices, zucchini and onion mixture, and a chopped red pepper. Heat until warm and cook all for 25 minutes.
In the meantime, heat your jars and put canning lids in simmering water.
At the end of 25 minutes, ladel the hot relish in hot jelly-size jars, put lids and rings on.
Within minutes, they should start sealing.
