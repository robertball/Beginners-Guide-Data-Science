Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 tablespoon finely chopped red onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon Thai chile sauce
1 teaspoon yellow curry paste
2 tablespoons coconut milk
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 egg
1 cup Italian bread crumbs
1 (1 pound) package crumbled tofu
1 (12 ounce) package vegetarian burger crumbles
1 cup chunky peanut butter
1 teaspoon Thai chile sauce
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 dash soy sauce (optional)
1 tablespoon canola oil
6 whole wheat hamburger buns
1/2 cup shredded carrots
1/2 cup shredded cucumber
1 tablespoon chopped green onion
2 tablespoons fresh mint leaves
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves

Directions:
Blend the black beans, red onion, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon chile sauce, curry paste, coconut milk, 1 teaspoon brown sugar, cayenne pepper, and egg in a food processor until smooth. Scrape the mixture into a large bowl. Fold the bread crumbs and burger crumbles into the mixture. Form the mixture into 6 patties and place on waxed paper. Put in freezer for up to 30 minutes for patties to set.
Prepare a grill pan or skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Cook the patties until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
Meanwhile, combine the peanut butter, 1 teaspoon chile sauce, 1 teaspoon brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, turmeric, soy sauce, and canola oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until the peanut butter is melted. Reduce heat to low and simmer until hot, 3 to 5 minutes.
Arrange patties on bottoms of hamburger buns. Drizzle sauce over each patty; top with carrot, cucumber, green onion, mint, and cilantro. Top with remaining bun halves and serve immediately.
