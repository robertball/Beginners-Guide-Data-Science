2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root
1/4 cup chopped lemon grass

In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat peanut oil.  Stir in garlic, ginger, lemon grass, red pepper, coriander and cumin and cook until fragrant, 2 minutes.  Stir in chicken and onion and cook, stirring, until chicken is white and onion is translucent, 5 minutes.  Stir in bok choy and cook until it begins to wilt, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
Fragrant, spicy, and absolutely delicious Thai chicken soup.   I've eaten a bit of Thai, and I think this comes very close.  Add noodles if you like with the cilantro.
