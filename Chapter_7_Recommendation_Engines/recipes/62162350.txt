3 c. cooked rice
2 eggs, beaten
2 c. grated mozzarella cheese
1 tsp. oregano

whatever toppings you prefer: pepperoni, chicken, peppers, onion, sausage, etc.

Directions:
Mix the rice, eggs and 1 cup of the cheese.
Put this into a greased frying pan, cover it, and cook on medium-low for 15 minutes. This will be your crust.
Combine the oregano, salt, garlic powder and tomato sauce.
Prepare the toppings.
Once the crust is slightly brown and beginning to set spread the sauce on the base and top with toppings.
Sprinkle the other 1 cup of cheese over the sauce.
Cover and cook 10 minutes at the same heat.
