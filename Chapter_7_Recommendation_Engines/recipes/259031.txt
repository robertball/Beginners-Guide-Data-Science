2 large large zucchini, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
sea salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Arrange sliced zucchini on a baking sheet. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and sprinkle lightly with sea salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until completely dried and chip-like, about 1 hour per side. Allow to cool before serving.

Description: 
If you are looking for an alternative to potato chips you have to give zucchini chips a try as a clean and healthy snack. Zucchini chips taste amazing and they are low carb, paleo and gluten free. They are simple to make but they do take time to bake. You could use a food dehydrator too if you have one (I don't).
