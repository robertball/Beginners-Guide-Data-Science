Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) boneless pork shoulder roast
1/3 cup lime juice
2 tablespoons grapefruit juice
2 tablespoons water
1 bay leaf
6 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil
1 large onion, thinly sliced
12 sandwich rolls, split

Directions:
Cut the roast in half; pierce several times with a fork. Place in a large resealable plastic bag or shallow glass container. Combine the next eight ingredients; pour over roast. Cover and refrigerate overnight, turning occasionally. Drain, reserving marinade. In a skillet over medium heat, brown the roast in oil on all sides. Place onion, roast and marinade in a slow cooker. Cover and cook on high for 2 hours. Reduce heat to low; cook 6-8 hours longer or until the meat is tender. Remove roast; shred or thinly slice. Discard the bay leaf. Skim fat from cooking juices and transfer to a saucepan; bring to a rolling boil. Serve pork on rolls with juices as a dipping sauce.

Description: 
This is an easy and flavorful dish that my family really enjoys. When I fix it for company, I usually prepare the meat the day before so I can concentrate on side dishes and relaxing with my friends.
