Ingredients:
1 cup cornmeal
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 cup milk
2 eggs, beaten
6 (4 ounce) fillets catfish
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Mix cornmeal, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper on a plate.
Beat milk and eggs together in a bowl. Dip catfish fillets in milk mixture, then gently press fillets into cornmeal mixture, coating both sides. Shake off excess breading.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet; pan-fry catfish in hot oil until the fish is golden brown and flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.
