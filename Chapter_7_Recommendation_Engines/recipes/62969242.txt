Ingredients:
1 bag (11.5 ounces) Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Chips
6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter
3 eggs
1 cup sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 bag (12 ounces) Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
1 cup (4 ounces) chopped walnuts

Directions:
In double boiler over hot water, melt Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Chips and butter
Place eggs and sugar in mixer bowl. Attach bowl and flat beater to mixer. Turn to speed 4 and beat until thick. Reduce to stir speed and add chocolate mixture.
Mix until combined, then stop and scrape bowl.
Stir flour and baking powder together in small bowl.
Continuing on stir speed, add flour mixture and Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips and walnuts and mix just until a thick dough forms.
Using sheets of plastic wrap, form dough into two logs, each 2 inches in diameter and about 12 inches long. As dough will be quite soft, use plastic wrap to hold dough in log shape. Wrap tightly; refrigerate at least 1 hour or until firm. (Dough can also be frozen; thaw in refrigerator before proceeding with recipe.)
Heat overn 375. Unwrap dough; with sharp knife, cut into 3/4 inch slices.
Place slices 1 1/2 inches apart on greased or parchment-lined cookie sheet.
Bake 12 to 14 minutes or until shiny crust forms on top but interior is still soft.
Cool on baking sheet; store in airtight tin up to 1 week.
