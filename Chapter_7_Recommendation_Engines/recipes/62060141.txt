Ingredients:
Sweet-N-Sour Dressing:
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup canola oil
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1 Tbsp soy sauce
salt and pepper to taste
Salad:
1 (3oz) pkg ramen noodles
1 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1 bunch broccoli, coarsely chopped
1 head romaine lettuce (torn into bite size pieces)
4 green onions, chopped

Directions:
For the dressing, combine the ingredients into a mason jar (or other jar with tight fitting lid).  Shake until blended.
For the salad, break the dry ramen noodles into small pieces, discarding the flavor packet.  Brown the noodles and the pecans in the butter in a skillet.  Drain on paper towels and allow to cool.  Combine the noodles, pecans, broccoli, romaine, and green onions in a salad bowl and toss gently.  Add 1 cup or more of the dressing, tossing to coat.
