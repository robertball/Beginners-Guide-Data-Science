Ingredients:
1 tablespoon coarse smoked salt
1 tablespoon coarse white decorator sugar
1 lime, cut into wedges
ice
1 fluid ounce tequila
3/4 fluid ounce lime juice
1/2 fluid ounce mezcal
2 fluid ounces club soda
1 tablespoon pomegranate simple syrup

Directions:
Mix smoked salt and white decorating sugar together on a small plate. Wipe the rim of a Collins glass with a lime wedge, then dip rim into salt mixture. Fill glass with ice.
Fill a cocktail shaker with more ice. Pour in tequila, lime juice, and mezcal. Cover and shake until very cold. Strain into prepared glass and add club soda. Slowly drizzle pomegranate simple syrup; the syrup will settle to the bottom of the glass, making for great color variation.

Description: 
This ombre pomegranate libation, made with smoky Mexican mezcal, gives a subtle nod to Day of the Dead celebrations. Much like tequila, mezcal is made from agave. But mezcal's smoky flavor comes from roasting agave hearts in an underground stone-lined firepit for several days before fermenting. See footnote for the recipe for pomegranate simple syrup.
