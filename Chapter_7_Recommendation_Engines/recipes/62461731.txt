Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 medium onions
2 stalks celery
2 carrots
5 garlic cloves
1 pound ground bison
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 pound ground beef
1/4 pound diced pancetta
1 cup milk
2 (28 oz) cans whole peeled tomatoes
1 cup dry white wine
1 quart low-sodium chicken stock
salt and pepper

Directions:
Using a food processor, finely chop the vegetables (separately).
In a 6 to 8 quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat.  Add the onion, celery, carrot, garlic and a pinch of kosher salt, and sweat over medium heat until the vegetables are translucent, about 10 minutes.
Add the bison, turkey, beef, pancetta and another pinch of kosher salt to the vegetables and brown over high heat for about 15 to 20 minutes, stirring and breaking up the meat with a potato masher.
Add the milk and simmer until the mixture is almost dry, about 10 minutes. Taste for seasoning.
Add the tomatoes and their juices and crush with the potato masher.  Add a pinch more salt if necessary.  Simmer for 15 minutes.  Add the wine and stock, bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, skimming off excess fat as it accumulates, for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until the sauce has thickened.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
The sauce will taste best the following day.  Can be frozen for up to 3 months.
