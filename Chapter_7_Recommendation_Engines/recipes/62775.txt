Description: 
This delicious gelatin salad is great for Christmas because of it's green color but so refreshing to eat on a hot summer evening.  Just a little cucumber makes it not too overwhelming.  I prefer using salad dressing but you can substitute mayonnaise.  The longer it sits in the refrigerator the better it is.
