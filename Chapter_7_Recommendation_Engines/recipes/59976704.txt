Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour for coating
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded 1/4 inch thick
4 tablespoons butter
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup Marsala wine
1/4 cup cooking sherry

Directions:
In a shallow dish or bowl, mix together the flour, salt, pepper and oregano. Coat chicken pieces in flour mixture.
Make a foil envelope (using two pieces of aluminum foil overlapping cross-wise with the sides folded up to keep moisture in) and melt the butter with the olive oil on a medium hot grill.
Brown the breaded chicken breasts in the butter/oil mixture, then toss in the mushrooms and pour in the sherry and marsala.
Fold the foil loosely to make a tent, and allow to cook until white all the way through (approximately 10 minutes).
