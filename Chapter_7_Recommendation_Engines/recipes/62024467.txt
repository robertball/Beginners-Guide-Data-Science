Ingredients:
2 T. olive oil
1/2 c. onion
8 oz. fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 can of condensed mushroom soup
2 chicken breasts
Salt and Pepper to taste
Freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese

Directions:
Preheat George Foreman grill or outdoor grill.  Sprinkle both sides of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.  Grill on outdoor grill about 10 minutes, or George Foreman grill for 7 minutes.  While the chicken is cooking, heat the olive oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat.  Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and saute until wilted, about 2 minutes.  Season mushrooms and onions with salt and pepper.  Stir in the soup and reduce heat to low.  Stir occasionally until sauce is heated through.  Transfer chicken to serving plates and smother with the mushroom sauce.  Garnish with lots of freshly grated Romano cheese.
