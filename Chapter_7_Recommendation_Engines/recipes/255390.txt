Ingredients:
1 bunch kale, stemmed and torn into pieces
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or to taste
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon ground red chile pepper
1 teaspoon ground oregano
salt to taste
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1 head cauliflower
1 teaspoon chipotle spice rub, or to taste
1 orange, peeled and cubed
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Spread kale on the baking sheet. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil on top. Coat with Parmesan cheese, red chile pepper, oregano, and salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Heat butter in a small skillet until melted and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in bread crumbs. Remove from heat.
Slice cauliflower into 1/2-inch "steaks". Rub 1 tablespoon olive oil and chipotle spice rub on top.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add cauliflower; cook and stir until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until just tender, about 15 minutes.
Place cauliflower steaks on a large serving platter; top with crisp kale and orange.
Whisk remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and vinegar together in a small bowl. Drizzle over orange. Sprinkle bread crumbs on top.
