Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package non-instant vanilla pudding mix
1 cup milk
1 cup shortening
1 cup white sugar

Directions:
In a small saucepan, cook pudding mix and milk according to package directions. Remove from heat, cover and chill completely.
Using an electric mixer, beat the shortening and sugar until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Gradually add the chilled pudding to the shortening mixture. Continue to whip until sugar is dissolved and you can not feel it with your tongue when you taste the filling.
Use a pastry bag to fill the lady locks. Freeze or serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a very simple cream filling. It can be frozen, and will not weep!  I usually double the recipe for 1 batch of lady locks (approximately 120 cookies.)  Use a pastry bag to fill cookies.  You can freeze the cookies after filling.
