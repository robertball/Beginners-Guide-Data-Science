Depending on thickness of steaks (mine were very thin ~1/2" thick), grill steaks 3 minutes per side on medium high heat until an internal temperature of 135-140 degrees F for medium rare steaks. For thicker steaks grill 8-10 minutes per side. Let steaks rest for 10-15 minutes. Slice into stripes and drizzle with Extra Vitgin Olive Oil for added flavor.
