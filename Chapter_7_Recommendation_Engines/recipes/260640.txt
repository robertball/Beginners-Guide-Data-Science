Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, or as needed
1/2 pound bay scallops
2 cups ground butter round crackers (such as RitzÂ®)
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
2 medium (1 1/2 pound) live cold-water lobsters

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add scallops; cook and stir until opaque, about 6 minutes.
Combine the cooked scallops and melted butter from the skillet, ground crackers, graham cracker crumbs, and poultry seasoning in a bowl. Mix well, adding additional melted butter if the stuffing is too dry.
Bring 2 inches water to a boil in a large pot. Place lobsters in pot; steam until bright red, about 20 minutes.
Lay cooked lobsters on the their backs on a work surface. Wear gloves and make an incision between the legs down to the tail using a heavy knife. Pry open the chest cavity and rinse out innards with warm water. Fill the chest cavity and tail with the stuffing until overflowing.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place stuffed lobsters on their back on a baking sheet.
Bake under the broiler until stuffing has browned, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is my grandmother's recipe for stuffed coldwater lobster. It is far and away my favorite meal, and if you feel like splurging you will not be disappointed. Also, this same stuffing is excellent for fish. Serve with more melted butter for dipping.
