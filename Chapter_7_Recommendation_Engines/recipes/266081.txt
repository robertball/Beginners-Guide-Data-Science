Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup smooth peanut butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup crushed banana chips
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine butter, peanut butter, brown sugar, white sugar, and egg in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy.
Mix flour, banana chips, salt, baking soda, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl. Blend into the creamed butter mixture. Dust your hands with flour and roll mixture into 3/4-inch balls.
Arrange cookie balls on ungreased baking sheets. Press down on each ball gently with a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
