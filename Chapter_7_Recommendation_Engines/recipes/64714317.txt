Ingredients:
Avocado Dressing:
1 avocado, pitted and skin removed
juice of 1/2 lemon
2 Tbsps plain Greek yogurt
1 tsp extra virgin olive oil
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/8 tsp cumin
salt and black pepper to taste
water or milk, as needed
Salad:
4 cups fresh mixed greens, rinsed and dried
1/2 cucumber, peeled and cut into 1/4" slices
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
4 slices bacon
2 eggs

Directions:
1. Make avocado dressing: Combine avocado, lemon juice, Greek yogurt, olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, salt, and black pepper in a small food processor. Pulse until mixture is smooth. Add water or milk to thin out dressing to desired consistency. Set aside.
2. In a medium non-stick skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove from pan and drain bacon on a paper-towel lined plate. Allow to cool, then crumble into small pieces.
3. Remove all but 1 Tbsp of bacon grease from skillet. Add eggs to pan, cover and cook over medium heat until whites are cooked through and yolks are just set, about 3-5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
4. Assemble salad: divide mixed greens, cucumber slices, tomatoes, and bacon crumbles on 2 plates. Drizzle with desired amount of avocado dressing. Top each salad with an egg. Serve immediately. Refrigerate any unused dressing, and use within a few days.
