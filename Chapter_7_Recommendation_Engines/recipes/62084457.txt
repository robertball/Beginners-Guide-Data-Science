Description: 
This is a recipe for a delicious dessert that my Czech grandmother (Babi) used to make for me when I was a child. I called it Babi's Pizza because when she would make it using strawberries it resembled a pepperoni pizza. You can use blueberries or even prunes in leiu of the strawberries... it's all delicious!
