Ingredients:
vegetable oil for frying
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 pound cooked bacon, crumbled
8 jalapeno peppers, diced, or more to taste
1/4 cup shredded processed cheese (such as Velveeta®)
4 green onions, chopped
3 tablespoons hot sauce (such as Tabasco® Chipotle Pepper Sauce) (optional)
1 egg
2 tablespoons water
1 (16 ounce) package wonton wrappers

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine cream cheese, bacon, jalapenos, shredded cheese, green onions, and hot sauce in a bowl. Mix well.
Whisk egg and water together in a small bowl.
Place 1 tablespoon cream cheese mixture on a wonton wrapper. Brush the edges of the wonton wrappers with the egg mixture using a small pastry brush. Fold wonton into a triangle; pinch shut. Repeat with the rest of the wonton wrappers.
Place wontons carefully in the oil, working in batches. Fry until golden brown and crispy, about 6 minutes.

Description: 
These wontons make a good snack or an appetizer. If you can't handle a regular jalapeno popper but still like jalapenos this is a good substitute. You can make them as spicy as you want. You can even make them ahead of time and stick them in the freezer!
