Ingredients:
-Diced Boneless Chicken with taco mix/seasoning
Red Potatoes with pepper, sauteed red onions and butter
Shredded Cheese
Tortilla
Cilantro
Roasted garlic

Directions:
-Set a pan on medium with grapeseed oil
-Mince garlic and cook till brown
-Cut of a 1lb or so of chicken breast, add taco seasoning
- while waiting for chicken to brown you'll want to microwave a red potato and chop it into small cubes.
-Cook until roasted brown for extra flavor and to minimize use of salt.
-Rinse pan, add a tablespoon of butter
-Sautee onions until you begin to smell sweetness
-Add the chopped potatoes to brown, you may add pepper, salt/season all seasoning
- Warm a few tortillas in microwave just enough to get soft and steamy
-on a cutting board, place tortillas and gather other materials
- add the chicken, potatoes, cilantro, and shredded cheese
-You'll need a clean pan on medium again with a bit of cooking spray for non stick purposes
-Wrap them up tightly in tortilla, using a spoon or tongs which worked best for me.
-Place the inner food closer towards you on the tortilla leaving just enough room to lift the back piece
-An easy way to roll is by starting with the left and right pieces on the sides, I'll call them flaps
-Fold them in then use your thumbs to pull the back flap over the food
-This is where you'd use a utensil to scoot the inner food closer to the back flap of the tortilla
-Keep that eye on the pan so it doesn't burn on it's own
-Make sure everything is tight then roll them
-Place the closure on the pan to brown just enough to melt the cheese down a little and keep the burrito nice and tight
-Then you can take the burritoes back to the cutting board for a nicely done angled cut down the middle
-Serve dish to you're liking and enjoy!

Description: 
This was fun for me and very simple. I used only pepper and butter on the potatoes with sautee'd onion so it needed more flavor to it. Season all salt would be the best way to go to enlighten the taste of the potatoes which will play a major role in the dishes' flavor depending on how large you chop the potatoes into cubes.....
