Ingredients:
2 packs of hot dogs (your choice and style)
1 pound block of cheddar cheese
2-24oz jars of spagheti sauce (any kind you like)
2-3 different vegetables of choice. I use bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms. But it will work with any.

Directions:
Slice all your hot dogs down the middle length    wise. Arrange them to fit into a bakng dish.
Slice your cheddar cheese into the thickness of your choice and put into sliced hot dogs. It doesn't have to fit perfect cause it will melt when you bake it. You may also choose to shredd it since you need to shredd a little bit to sprinkle on top once it's done cooking.
Cut your veggies into medium chunks and toss over and around the hot dogs. As many veggies as you like. There's no limit.
Dump your sauce over top of all ingredients making sure the sauce covers everything.
Bake at 350 degrees for about 30-40 min, or until piping hot. Sprinkle a little bit of shredded cheddar cheese on top and put back in the oven for a  couple of minutes, or until cheese is melted on top. Take out and let cool for 5 min, then serve.
