Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup cold butter
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons milk
6 medium tart apples, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices
TOPPING:
1/3 cup sugar
4 1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons cold butter

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Cut in butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Combine egg and milk; gradually add to flour mixture, tossing with a fork until dough forms a ball.
With lightly floured hands, press dough onto the bottom and up the sides of a 12-in. fluted tart pan with removable bottom. Arrange apple slices in a circular pattern over dough, starting at the outer edge and overlapping slices.
For topping, combine the sugar, flour and spices in a small bowl. Cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over apples. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until apples are tender. Serve warm or cold.

Description: 
The crumb topping gives this apple tart a delightfully sweet crunch in every bite. I like to make it year-round, but it's especially good in fall when fresh apples are at their best.  --Janet Briggs
