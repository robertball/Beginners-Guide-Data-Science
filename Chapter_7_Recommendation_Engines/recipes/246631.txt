Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 carrots, chopped
1 onion, chopped
4 large mushrooms, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups savory vegetable broth
2 cups quinoa
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon ground ginger
2 cups baby kale

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add carrots, onion, and mushrooms; cook and stir until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Pour broth into the pot; bring to a boil. Add quinoa, soy sauce, and ginger. Reduce heat and simmer until quinoa is mostly tender, about 17 minutes. Add baby kale; cook until wilted, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand until quinoa absorbs remaining cooking liquid, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
I've been experimenting with quinoa and vegetarian cooking. Came up with this last night and it was delicious! I wanted to save the recipe here and share it with others. I topped mine with some chopped avocado and chia seeds for extra health benefits.
