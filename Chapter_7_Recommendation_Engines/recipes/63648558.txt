Ingredients:
12 oz al fresco Tomato & Basil Chicken Meatballs
8 oz Tricolor Bow-Tie Pasta
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil (divided)
1 tbsp fresh garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 tbsp dried pine nuts
1/4 cup sun dried thinly sliced tomatoes
1 cup pinto beans, drained and rinsed
1 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
1/4 tsp salt
2 1/2 oz fresh baby arugula leaves, measures about 4 cups
Extra virgin olive oil Cooking Spray

Directions:
Cook the tri-color bowties (farfalle) in a large pot of boiling water according to package directions. Drain & RESERVE 1 cup of pasta liquid.
Heat a large skillet over medium high heat, coat with pan spray and 1 tbsp of the extra virgin olive oil. Saute the garlic and pine nuts, stirring rapidly for 45 seconds (be careful not to burn). Add the al fresco Tomato & Basil Chicken Meatballs. Cook for 2 minutes, and add the cup of reserved pasta liquid. Lower heat to medium.
Add the sun-dried tomato slices, pinto beans, black pepper and salt, simmer 2 minutes. To the skillet, add the cooked bowtie pasta, and toss the ingredients together. Cook for another 2 minutes.
Just before serving, toss in the baby arugula, give a careful stir to incorporate, and heat through for just 1 minute.
Serve immediately on a warmed platter and drizzle with the remaining 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil.
