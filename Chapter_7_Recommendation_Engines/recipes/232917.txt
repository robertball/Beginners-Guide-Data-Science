Ingredients:
2 cups buttermilk
2 room-temperature eggs, lightly beaten
1/3 cup 2% milk
1 1/2 cups quick cooking oats
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter, or as needed

Directions:
Whisk buttermilk, eggs, and milk together in a bowl until blended; add oats and whisk until oats are wet, about 30 seconds. Set aside until oats absorb some liquid, about 5 minutes.
Stir flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon into the oat mixture; whisk until completely blended into a batter.
Melt 1/2 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Ladle batter into the skillet and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula and continue cooking until browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining butter and batter.

Trying to eat healthier, but still trying to keep my men happy! I took 3 recipes, combined what I liked, and came up with this! You can leave out the cinnamon if desired. Would be amazing with homemade apple sauce!
