Ingredients:
1 pound firm tofu
canola oil for frying
5 medium Roma tomatoes, cut into wedges
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 bunch green onions, sliced, or to taste

Directions:
Rinse tofu and press using a tofu press to remove all water, about 15 minutes. Cut into 1/2x1x1-inch pieces.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fry tofu in the hot oil until golden, about 5 minutes.
Transfer fried tofu to a deep frying pan with tomatoes, water, tomato paste, sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce to medium-low heat and let simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Top with green onions.
