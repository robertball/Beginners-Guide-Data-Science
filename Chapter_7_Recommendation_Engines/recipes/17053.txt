Ingredients:
2 cups oil for frying
4 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons baking powder
2 tablespoons salt
2 1/2 cups warm milk

Directions:
In a large heavy bottomed frying pan, heat 1 inch of vegetable oil or lard to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt and milk; mix well.  When the dough has pulled together, form it into small balls and pat them flat.
Place 3 or 4 at a time into the hot oil. When the rounds begin to bubble, flip them over and cook until golden. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.
