Ingredients:
3/4 cup fat free half-and-half
1/4 cup whipping cream
1/4 cup fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (preferably 70% cacao), finely chopped
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch ground cinnamon
1/4 cup red wine

Directions:
Combine 1/2 of the half-and-half and 1/2 of the cream into a saucepan over low heat. Add chopped chocolate to the warmed cream mixture, whisking constantly (to prevent scalding) until chocolate is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in remaining half-and-half, remaining cream, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon.
Add red wine and allow to bubble for about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and pour into a coffee mug to serve.

Description: 
This take on hot chocolate is decidedly grown up and is the perfect serving size for one. I use a local red wine called “Misbehaving Red” that truly is one of a kind!
