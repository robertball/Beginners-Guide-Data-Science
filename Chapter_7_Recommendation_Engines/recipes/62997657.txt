Ingredients:
14oz coconut milk gata
8oz crushed pineapple
3tbsp sugar
6oz baby food bananas or one peeled chopped banana
1 cup Kiwi skinned and chopped

Directions:
In a medium mixing bowl add the 3 tbsp of sugar to the coconut milk and stir together well.
Add the coconut mixture to the banana and pineapple in a blender and liquefy.
Next pour in popsicle molds and carefully poke in the desired amount of kiwi in each mold. The mold is thick so the kiwi needs to be pushed in place to avoid them being to close together. Then set to freeze over night.
