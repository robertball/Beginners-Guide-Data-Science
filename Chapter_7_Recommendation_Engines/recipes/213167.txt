Ingredients:
3/4 cup tapioca pearls
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
2 large papayas - halved lengthwise and seeded

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Stir the tapioca pearls into the boiling water. Reduce heat to medium to keep water at a simmer. Cook, stirring frequently to keep the pearls from sticking to the bottom of the pot, until the water becomes thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain. Transfer the tapioca to a large bowl and cover with cold water.
Refill the pot with fresh water and bring to a boil. Once the tapioca pearls have cooled, drain the cool water from the bowl and transfer the tapioca to the boiling water. Remove the pot from the heat; cook and stir again until the pearls are clear, 5 to 7 minutes; drain. Transfer the tapioca to a clean bowl and cover with cold water. If the pearls are not completely clear, repeat the process until they are.
Pour the coconut milk into a small saucepan and place over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Once the coconut milk is simmering, stir the tapioca into the coconut milk until the pearls are evenly coated. Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool completely; spoon into the papaya halves. Store in refrigerator until ready to serve.

Description: 
Coconut tapioca is one of my favorites of all time. I also love the tropical fruit papaya. When I combined these two things together, it did make my day. If you are not a big fan of papaya, you may skip the papaya bowl; coconut tapioca by itself would be a good treat to your guests too!
