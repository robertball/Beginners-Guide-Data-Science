Ingredients:
1 Large Cauliflower;
60g (2oz) Butter;
45g(1½ oz) Flour;
300ml Whole Milk;
120g (4oz) full flavoured Cheese (Parmesan/Cheddar)  Grated;  I use both
Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper;
¾ Tsp English Mustard - (English is sharper but can use Dijon);
Handful or so fresh breadcrumbs
4 Streaky Bacon Rashers;
Crusty Bread.

Directions:
Remove the leaves, divide the cauliflower into sprigs;
Rinse, place in large pot and boil in salted water for some 5 minutes until tenderish but still has a bite in the stalk;
Drain, BUT reserving 150/200ml of the cooking water;
Heat Grill to max;
Melt 40g of the butter in a small pan, stir in the flour and cook for a minute or so;
Blend in the milk and bring to the boil, stirring until thickened, no lumps;
Add the reserved cooking liquor, 100g cheese, pepper and mustard;
Stir well until cheese melted;
Place cauliflower in a baking dish, pour the sauce over and scatter the remaining cheese over the top;
Sprinkle over the breadcrumbs and put cauliflower mixture under the hot grill until cheese on top is golden and bubbling;
Meantime, fry bacon rashers until crispy;
When cheese dish ready, sprinkle crispy bacon over the top and serve with crusty bread.
