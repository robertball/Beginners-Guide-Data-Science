Ingredients:
4 ounces light rum
3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper
2 1/2 teaspoons sea salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons dried crushed thyme
3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3/4 teaspoon ground cloves
6 pounds rib tips, cleaned and cut up

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Combine rum, lime juice, and brown sugar in a small bowl; set aside. Mix together black pepper, sea salt, allspice, cinnamon, thyme, cayenne pepper, and cloves in a small bowl.
Place rib tips in a resealable plastic bag and pour 1/2 of the spice mixture over them. Shake bag to coat evenly. Pour remaining spice mixture into the bag, reseal, and shake again to coat all pieces.
Remove rib tips from bag and place on a baking sheet. Reserve lime juice marinade for basting.
Bake in the preheated oven until meat pulls slightly away from bone, about 1 hour and 20 minutes, basting with lime juice marinade every 20 minutes.

Description: 
You've gotta try these juicy, flavorful 'riblets'.  I've been told that 'rib tips' are a Chicago thing. It's the top part of spare ribs, the 'rib tip'. There is a place in Chicago called Mississippi Rick's. They have the best Jamaican Jerk Rib Tips, this is very close to their Jerk Rib Tips. My family loves them. Serve with BBQ or jerk sauce, if you'd like.
