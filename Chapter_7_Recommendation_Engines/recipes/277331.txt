Ingredients:
25 fresh chestnuts
3 cups powdered sugar, divided
10 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
7 tablespoons heavy cream, divided
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg yolk
1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Score the skin of each chestnut with a sharp paring knife.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add chestnuts and cook for 25 minutes. Drain.
Peel chestnuts while still warm. Transfer to a food processor. Add 1/4 cup powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons butter, and 4 1/2 tablespoons heavy cream; puree until smooth.
Combine remaining 2 1/2 tablespoons heavy cream, white sugar, egg yolk, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl. Beat until quite thick, 6 to 7 minutes.
Beat remaining 8 tablespoons butter in a small bowl until light and fluffy. Slowly mix into the egg mixture. Gradually beat remaining 2 3/4 cups powdered sugar into the egg mixture.
Stir chestnut puree into the egg mixture, making sure to blend in well.

Description: 
My French grandmother always made a chestnut yule log or buche de Noel au marron every Christmas. Here is a recipe for the delicious chestnut cream filling. I had trouble finding a recipe for this filling, but I tweaked one until I got it as close as I could. Nothing will ever be as good as Mamie's, but this comes quite close! You can frost the cake of your choice with this cream.
