Description: 
The famous pie (Jim's Favorite) This pie comes with a story. My husbands mother made this for him growing up but she died in 1979. Many years later when cleaning a storage room his step mother came across an old recipe box and found this inside in her handwriting. I made it for him as a surprise and it almost brought tears to his eyes.
