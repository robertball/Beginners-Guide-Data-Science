Ingredients:
1 large can white tuna in water
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 1/2 T fresh wasabi paste, (or a little less if it is made from powder)
1 t fresh ginger (I like using the jarred ginger that is in a paste form)
1 T minced green onions
White bread

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together in a bowl. Spread over sliced white bread (wheat bread tends to compete with the flavors) or serve over lettuce.

Description: 
Wanting to do something different with the tuna in my cupboard, I threw together some ingredients that I had left over from a sushi party. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
