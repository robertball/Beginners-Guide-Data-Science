Ingredients:
2 large potatoes, cut with a vegetable spiralizer
2 Tbsp olive oil
6 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup parmigiano reggiano
1 large zucchini, spiralized
1 fresh hot pepper, or to taste
black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees C. Lightly oil a 9-inch pie pan.
Boil potatoes for about 1 minute, or until slightly softened, but not mushy. Drain well and pat dry with a  paper towel.
Press potatoes into lightly oiled pie plate- the bottom will not be totally covered like with a pie crust, this is ok-the egg mixture will create a crust on the bottom. Brush with a bit of the oil. Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.
Cut the hot peppers into rings.
In a large bowl, stir together beaten eggs, zucchini, cheese, hot peppers, and black pepper. Pour egg mixture into the baked potato crust.
Bake in preheated oven until center is set, about 20 minutes. The quiche will be browned on top and a knife inserted into the center will come out clean.

Description: 
Using a spiralized potato crust creates a unique crust for a quiche because it gets crunchy but allows the egg to nestle between the strings of potato creating a frittata-like dish. Good warm or cold.Modified from: Shredded Potato Quiche
