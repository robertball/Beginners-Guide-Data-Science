Description: 
If you are having trouble including these anti-inflammatory spices in your diet, here is an alternative to supplements.  Actually quite tasty!  I believe this tea is popular in Okinawa, Japan.  Just remember turmeric stains--I make mine in an old mason jar, wrapped in an old tea towel!

Turmeric is used for medicinal purposes in India.  It is an anti-inflammatory and may help with arthritis, skin diseases, Alzheimer's, digestive problems, infections and possibly cancer.
