Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach - thawed, drained and squeezed dry
1 teaspoon salt
1 (4 ounce) package feta cheese, crumbled
1/2 cup cottage cheese
1 egg, beaten
1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough
1 cup unsalted butter, melted

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Slowly cook and stir onion until tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in spinach and salt. Stir in feta cheese, cottage cheese and egg. Cook and stir until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to simmer.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Unroll phyllo dough sheets one at a time on a flat surface. Brush with unsalted butter. Cut into strips approximately 5 inches wide. Place 1 tablespoon of the onion, spinach and feta mixture at one end of each dough strip. Fold the end of the strip over the filling so that it forms a triangle. Continue folding the strip in triangles until a small, triangular stuffed pastry remains. Brush with unsalted butter. Repeat with remaining phyllo dough.
Arrange stuffed triangles on a large baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 12 to 15 minutes, until golden brown. Serve warm.

Description: 
The only tricky part of this recipe is working with phyllo, and once you get the hang of it, it's fun. Sometimes you get a bad batch of phyllo that rips and tears easily, so I always buy an extra just in case. I have frozen these before baking.  Just add a few minutes to cooking time when you cook them in a frozen state.  I have also doubled this recipe for large parties.
