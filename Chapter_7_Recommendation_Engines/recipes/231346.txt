Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter
8 eggs
1 cup coconut milk
1/3 cup arrowroot powder
1/4 cup chestnut flour
1 teaspoon lemon extract
1 (1 gram) packet stevia powder
1/2 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Put butter in a 9x13-inch casserole dish and place in the oven until butter melts and starts to brown, about 5 minutes.
Place eggs in a blender and pulse until smooth; add coconut milk, arrowroot powder, chestnut flour, lemon extract, stevia powder, and sea salt. Blend until smooth, 45 to 60 seconds. Pour batter over browned butter in the casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until pancake is set in the middle and edges are lightly browned, about 23 minutes.
