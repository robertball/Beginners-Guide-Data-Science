Ingredients:
2 medium green bell peppers chopped (you can sub Anaheim, poblanos, cubanelle)
1 large sweet onion chopped
4 large cloves garlic minced
1-3 jalapeno peppers seeds included minced  *see footnote
3  14.5 oz. cans regular diced tomatoes (If I have fresh tomatoes in season I use them instead of canned -see footnote)
1  10 oz. can diced tomatoes with green chilies
1  - 14 oz can fire roasted salsa style diced tomatoes
1 - 7 oz. can chopped green chilies
1 small fresh lime juice
1/2 bunch Cilantro chopped stems and all chopped (to taste)
1 teaspoon sea salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground Cumin
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon Spanish Paprika
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon onion powder

Directions:
For best results use a food processor to combine all ingredients.
Make sure you chop or mince ingredients as directed before adding to processor.
Pulse to desired consistency, I usually leave it a bit chunky. Store in air tight container until ready to serve.
Can be served right away, however much better if it has a few hours for flavors to meld together.
