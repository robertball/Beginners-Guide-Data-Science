Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/2 cup sour cream
6 tablespoons butter, melted
3 tablespoons orange juice concentrate

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, pecans, baking soda and salt. In another bowl, whisk the egg, sour cream, butter and orange juice concentrate. Stir into the dry ingredients just until moistened.
Fill paper-lined muffin cups three-fourths full. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to a wire rack. Serve warm.

Description: 
Sour cream makes every bite of these muffins moist, while orange juice concentrate provides pleasant flavor. I keep some in the freezer for a fast breakfast or snack.                           --Nellie Gobeli, Ava, Missouri
