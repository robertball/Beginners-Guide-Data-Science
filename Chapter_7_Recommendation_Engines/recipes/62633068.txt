Ingredients:
6 cups of chicken stock
4 teaspoons olive oil, divided
1 medium onion, diced
2 cloves garlic
1-1/2 cups Arborio rice
1/2 cup white wine
1 cup evaporated skim milk
1/2 cup Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese
1 cup frozen peas, thawed
Ground black pepper to taste
14 ounces smoked turkey sausage, cut into 1/2-inch slices on the diagonal
6 tablespoons fresh flat-leaf parsley

Directions:
Heat stock to a simmer, remove from heat and cover.
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add onion and saute until translucent. Add garlic and continue to cook for 1 minute. Add rice, coat with oil and cook 3 to 4 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring often, until absorbed by rice. Add 1/2 cup stock and continue to cook, stirring regularly until absorbed. Continue, 1/2 cup at a time, until all the stock is absorbed.
While the risotto cooks, add 2 teaspoons oil to a second skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage and saute, stirring only occasionally, allowing the edges to sear, about 10 minutes.
Once all the broth has been absorbed into the rice, add peas, evaporated milk, cheese, pepper to taste and continue to cook until combined.
Plate risotto, top with parsley and sausage.

Description: 
This dish is incredibly creamy and the nutty pecorino paired wonderfully with the salty, smoky turkey sausage I crisped up. The peas and parsley add a savory freshness. I lightened it by using evaporated skim milk instead of cream to finish the risotto and turkey instead of pork sausage.
