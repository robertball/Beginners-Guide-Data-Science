Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent rolls
4 ounces thinly sliced deli ham, julienned
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup milk
8 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
Dash pepper
1/4 cup chopped sweet red pepper
2 tablespoons chopped green onion
1 teaspoon butter
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Unroll each tube of crescent dough (do not separate rectangles). Place side by side on a greased baking sheet with long sides touching; seal seams and perforations. Arrange ham lengthwise down center third of rectangle.
In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and milk. Separate one egg; set egg white aside. Add the egg yolk, remaining eggs, salt and pepper to cream cheese mixture; mix well. Add red pepper and onions.
In a large skillet, melt butter; add egg mixture. Cook and stir over medium heat just until set. Remove from the heat. Spoon scrambled eggs over ham. Sprinkle with cheese.
On each long side of dough, cut 1-in.-wide strips to the center to within 1/2 in. of filling. Starting at one end, fold alternating strips at an angle across the filling. Pinch ends to seal and tuck under. Beat reserved egg white; brush over dough. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-28 minutes or until golden brown.
