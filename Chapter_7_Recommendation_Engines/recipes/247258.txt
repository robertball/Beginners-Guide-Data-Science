Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large rimmed baking sheet.
Place wings on prepared baking sheet.. Sprinkle with seasoned salt; mix to evenly season the wings. Arrange in a single layer.
Bake in preheated oven until crisp and cooked through, about 1 hour.
Turn on oven broiler; finish the wings under the broiler to crisp both sides, about 1 minute per side.
Melt butter over medium-low heat in a small saucepan. Add cream and garlic stirring until small bubbles form. Add grated cheese and continue to stir until well blended. Remove pan from heat.
