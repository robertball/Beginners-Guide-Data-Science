Ingredients:
4 cups chopped fresh or frozen rhubarb
2 Tbl lemon juice
1 cup sugar
1/3 cup cornstarch
1 can (20 ounces) cherry pie filling
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
2 1/2 cup sugar, divided
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/2 cup cold butter, cubed and divided
1 cup buttermilk
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 tsp vanilla extract
1-1/2 cups sugar
1 cup flour
1/2 cup cold butter, cubed

Directions:
In a large saucepan, cook rhubarb and lemon juice over medium-low heat for 5 minutes, stirring often to prevent burning. Combine sugar and cornstarch; add to rhubarb mixture. Cook and stir 5 minutes more until thickened and bubbly. Stir in pie filling; set aside to cool.
For cake, combine 3 cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Cut in 1 cup of butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. In a small bowl, beat the buttermilk, eggs and vanilla. Add to flour mixture; stir just until moistened.
Spread a little more than half of the batter into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. baking pan Spread cooled filling over batter. Drop remaining batter by teaspoonfuls onto filling.
For topping, combine remaining sugar and flour. Cut in rest of the butter until mixture forms coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over batter. Bake at 350Â° for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.

Description: 
Mom gave me the original recipe which is kinda a cross between a coffe cake and dessert bar, using a strawberry/rhubarb combination but I changed it to one with cherry, which I think gives it a richer flavor.
