Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground venison
1 medium onion, chopped
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped
2 (15.5 ounce) cans chili beans, undrained
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (15.5 ounce) can kidney beans, drained
1 cup water
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Low Saute function. Add venison and cook for 5 minutes, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Add onion and jalapeno peppers; cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Cancel Saute mode.
Add chili beans, crushed tomatoes, kidney beans, water, chili powder, cumin, oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder to the pot. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 20 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.

Description: 
Chili is one of my favorite ways to utilize the abundance of ground meat you get with a deer. I like to use my Instant Pot® to eliminate the mess it makes on the stovetop as it simmers. It is also done much quicker. I haven't seen a recipe here so I thought I would share. Top with sour cream, cheese, and onions if desired.
