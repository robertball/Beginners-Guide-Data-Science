Ingredients:
1 cup confectioners' sugar

1/4-1 teaspoon extract (i.e vanilla, lemon, almond etc)
assorted food coloring

Directions:
In a small bowl, stir together confectioners' sugar and milk until smooth.  Beat in corn syrup and almond extract until icing is smooth and glossy.  If icing is too thick, add more milk.
Divide into separate bowls, and add food colorings to each to desired intensity. Dip cookies, or paint them with a brush.
