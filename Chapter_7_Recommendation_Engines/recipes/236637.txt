Ingredients:
1 pound ground lamb
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup tomato paste
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 cups water
6 lasagna noodles, broken into 2-inch pieces
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 1/2 cups plain Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
5 fresh mint leaves, chopped, or to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground lamb in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add onion and garlic to lamb; cook and stir until onion is translucent, 3 to 6 minutes.
Stir tomato paste, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper into lamb mixture; cook until spices are fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add water, lasagna noodles, and balsamic vinegar to lamb mixture; bring to a boil. Cover skillet, lower heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove cover and simmer until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite and sauce is thickened, 5 to 7 more minutes.
Stir Greek yogurt, 1 tablespoon mint, and salt together in a bowl. Spoon yogurt mixture, about 2 tablespoons per addition, across top of lasagna mixture. Sprinkle feta cheese over top and garnish with chopped mint leaves.
