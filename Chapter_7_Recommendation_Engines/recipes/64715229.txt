Ingredients:
3 tablespoons salted butter
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons blackstrap molasses
1 tablespoon apple juice
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
¼ cup chopped hazelnuts
¼ cup chopped pistachios
1 cup raw pecans
¼ cup pumpkin seeds
½ cup dried cranberries, unsweetened
¼ cup dates, chopped
2 tablespoons canned pureed pumpkin
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
*Optional: 1 cup quick-cook oats, uncooked

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees.
In a small saucepan, melt butter, then stir in maple syrup, molasses, apple juice, vanilla, pumpkin, and pumpkin pie spice.
Stir with a whisk until ingredients come together and are warmed through.
In a large mixing bowl, combine remaining ingredients and toss to combine.
*We make a grain-free “sticky” granola with an almost toffee-like texture; if you prefer a more traditional granola, add oats to your mixture.
Pour mixture onto a parchment lined rimmed baking sheet, and bake at 200 degrees for 3-4 hours, or until dry.
Allow to cool - mixture will crisp as it cools.
Crumble into bite-size pieces and eat as a snack or serve with milk.
Store in a sealed, covered container up to one month.

Description: 
Made without grains, this pumpkin seed granola is sticky almost like a toffee.  If you choose to include oats, it makes a more traditional style.  Either way, the spices are spot-on for a pumpkin-spice, autumnal treat that's perfect for a breakfast or afternoon snack.
