Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package Bob Evans® Original Sausage Links
2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Cook sausage in medium skillet until no longer pink in the center. Drain on paper towels. Cut each link into 4 equal pieces. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. To prepare dough, combine cheese, flour, butter, paprika and salt; mix well. Wrap rounded teaspoon of dough around each piece of sausage, rolling dough in palms to form a ball. Place on ungreased baking sheet. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until slightly browned. Serve hot. Refrigerate leftovers. Serve with mustard or Ranch dressing for dipping.
