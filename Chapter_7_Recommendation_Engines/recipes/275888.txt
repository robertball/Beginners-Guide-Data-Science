Ingredients:
2 (1 pound) sugar pumpkins, halved and seeded
1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed
2 tablespoons butter
1 small onion, chopped
1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced
1 apple, peeled and cut into cubes
3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed
1 tablespoon maple syrup
ground white pepper to taste
salt to taste
3/4 cup water, or to taste
1/2 cup heavy cream (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Brush pumpkin flesh with olive oil. Place pumpkins face down on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until pumpkins are easily pierced with a fork, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven, let cool for 10 minutes, and peel away skin. Set pumpkins aside.
Melt butter in a large pot over low heat. Add onion and ginger and cook until soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add apple and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and mix in pumpkins. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until apple is soft, 10 to 15 minutes.
Puree soup using an immersion blender. Season with maple syrup, white pepper, and salt.
Add water and cream and heat until soup is hot, but not boiling. Taste and adjust seasoning.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite fall soups. You can also make it with roasted butternut squash. I like my soups thick so I usually don't add a lot of water, but that is optional. I used 2 fairly large sugar pumpkins, weighing about 2 pounds total.
