Ingredients:
1 (16-ounce) package elbow macaroni
1/2 stick (1/4 cup) butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 cups milk
1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, cut into chunks
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 (8-ounce) block extra sharp cheddar cheese, shredded, divided
1 (8-ounce) block Gouda cheese, shredded, divided
1 (4-ounce) wedge Parmesan cheese, shredded

Directions:
Start your smoke for 225 degrees and cook pasta according to package directions.
Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, melt butter; whisk flour into butter and cook over medium heat 2 minutes. Whisk in milk and bring just to a boil; remove from heat. Stir in cream cheese, salt, and pepper and continue to whisk until smooth.
Coat a disposable 9-1/2- x 11- x 2-inch aluminum roasting pan with cooking spray.
In a large bowl, combine 2 cups cheddar, 2 cups Gouda cheese, the Parmesan cheese, pasta, and sauce. Spoon mixture into roasting pan. Cover with aluminum foil and smoke for 45 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle with remaining cheese, and bake 15 to 20 more minutes or until heated through.
