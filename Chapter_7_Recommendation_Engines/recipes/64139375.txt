Ingredients:
9 inches unbaked pie shells
2 1/2 cups whole milk or 2 1/2 cups half-and-half cream, scalded
3 eggs, lightly beaten
3/4 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon real vanilla extract
ground nutmeg, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
In a large bowl whisk together eggs, sugar and salt.
Slowly whisk in scalded milk a little at a time to prevent cooking the egg mixture.
Stir in vanilla.
Pour, through a sieve, into the unbaked pie shell.
Sprinkle top with ground nutmeg.
Bake for approximately 40 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
Filling will look wobbly but will set up as it cools.
