Ingredients:
2 large eggs
1 2/3 cups very warm water
3 tablespoons canola oil
1 teaspoon vinegar
1 teaspoon sugar
2 3/4 teaspoon yeast
2 tablespoons pysillium husk (available at bulk foods or health food stores)
1/4 cup flax
1 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup tapioca starch flour
1/4 cup sweet rice flour
1/4 cup teff flour
1/2 cup millet flour
2 1/2 teaspoons guar gum
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 cup milk powder
3 tablespoons sugar

Directions:
Put ingredients in pan as in above order.  (I recommend mixing the flours together first and then adding in the order with the rest of the ingredients.) Because I use regular yeast (not bread machine yeast) I give a little stir with a spoon to mix the yeast into the wet ingredients.
I used the rapid bake cycle (2 hours) on the machine and chose the "dark" crust setting. I find it is important to bake gluten free bread for 50-60 minutes to make sure it is done in the center and does not collapse. If using a different bread machine check manual to use a setting that bakes for close to that length of time. Remove from pan after baking.  I used the Black & Dekker Bread Machine.

Description: 
We really enjoy this bread - all of us eat it when only my husband has to be gluten free.  You can also use the dough setting and scoop out dough onto baking sheets to make buns.  To smooth top of loaf or buns, wet fingers and smooth the dough before it rises.
