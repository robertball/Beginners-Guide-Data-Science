Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 pinch salt
3 cups milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Whisk sugar, flour, cocoa, and salt together in a microwave-safe bowl. Whisk in milk and vanilla extract. Microwave on high in 15 to 30-second intervals, whisking between each, until gravy thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes total.

Description: 
When I was growing up, we got to pick whatever we wanted to eat for our birthday dinner. I always chose chocolate gravy and biscuits. I usually use store-bought biscuits, but homemade ones are great too!
