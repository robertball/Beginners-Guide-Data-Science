Ingredients:
5 lbs of pork shoulder or 3 racks of Pork Ribs.
1 gallon of Manteca (usually buy it at a Mexican market)
6 bay leaves
2 tbsp kosher salt
1.5 tsp coarse ground black pepper
2 large yellow onions, cut into quarters with the skin on.
3 garlic cloves, whole
1 med/lg orange

Directions:
Cut pork shoulder into small pieces or ribs into 3 bone segments.
Heat up Manteca in a roasting pan. (Make sure its an actual roasting pan)
Once the Manteca is hot, add Pork.
Move the pork around in the pan so that all of it is covered by the Manteca.
Add the bay leaves, garlic, salt, pepper, and onions.
Juice the orange directly into the pan, and throw the squeezed orange halves into the pan as well.
Cook on Medium heat for 45 mins to 1 hour, or until the pork is tender enough to pull apart with a fork.  If you use ribs, the meat should just fall off the bone.
Remove the pork from the pan and transfer to a bowl or plate.
Remove meat from the bones if using ribs and break into smaller pieces while they are still hot.
