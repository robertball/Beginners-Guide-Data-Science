Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package refrigerated gnocchi
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 (6 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms
2 shallots, sliced
2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
2 teaspoons chopped fresh sage
3 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 cups baby arugula
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, shallots, rosemary, and sage. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Wipe skillet clean and add butter. Cook over medium-high heat until butter has melted. Add gnocchi and cook, stirring occasionally, until crispy, about 8 minutes. Stir in arugula and reserved mushroom mixture; season with salt and pepper. Garnish with Parmesan cheese and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.
