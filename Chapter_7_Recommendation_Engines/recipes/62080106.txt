Title:
Grilled "Stout" Skirt Steak Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 bottle Guinness Stout or other dark beer
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
2 tbs Crystal or other hot sauce
3 tbs chopped garlic
1 med onion diced
3-4 #'s skirt steak

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in large tupperware or ziploc bag and let marinate for at least 6, or as many as 24 hours.
Fire up the grill, as hot as you can get it.  Take meat directly from the marinade and grill 4-5 each side.  You want to get the meat almost "crusted" on each side (the sugars and beer will accomplish this). This will produce very juicy med-rare meat.  You do not want to overcook skirt steak or you may as well substitute an old sneaker in the recipe.
Let rest for 10 minutes or serve immediately.  You will love it, guaranteed!
