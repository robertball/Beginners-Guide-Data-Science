Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 cup butter flavored shortening
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease your cookie sheets.
Mix the sugar, shortening, egg, vanilla and almond extract until creamy. Mix in the flour, baking soda and cream of tartar. Make several small balls of dough. Roll out dough to about 1/8  or 1/4 inch thick. Cut into desired shapes with well floured cookie cutters. If desired, press candies, raisins, nuts or sprinkles into cookies. Place cookies onto the prepared sheets.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes, depending upon whether you like hard or soft cookies. Remove cookies and let cool on a rack. Serve warm with a glass of milk. They are also good with ice cream wedged in the middle of two cookies.

Description: 
This recipe is great for first time cookie makers and kindergartners. They are easy and lots of fun. The children in my classes have never messed up a batch of these cookies in the fourteen years I've been teaching kindergarten, and neither have my four adorable children.  You can use whole wheat flour in place of the all-purpose flour, if you wish.
