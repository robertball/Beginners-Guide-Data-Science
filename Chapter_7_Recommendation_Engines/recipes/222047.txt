Description: 
My family loves a variety of ethnic foods, but this is one of their favorites. My niece, who is of Spanish descent, lives with us and has tweaked my old Spanish rice recipe to make it just like her grandma's. My mother-in-law has also added this recipe to her school meals menu (minus the jalapeno), and it is a hit with the students and faculty.
