Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package linguine pasta
1 3/4 cups water
1/2 cup onion, diced
1/4 cup butter
1 1/2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/8 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (12 ounce) package imitation crabmeat, diced
1 cup whipping cream
1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the linguine, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Bring water, onion, butter, chicken bouillon granules, lemon juice, garlic powder, parsley, oregano, and pepper to a boil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to simmer until the liquid is reduced, about 10 minutes, then add the imitation crabmeat, and cook for 2 more minutes. Stir in the whipping cream and Swiss cheese until combined. Serve cream sauce over prepared pasta.
