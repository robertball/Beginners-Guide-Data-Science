Ingredients:
2 large portabella mushrooms, stems chopped and reserved
2 slices center-cut bacon or turkey bacon
1 cup fat-free liquid egg substitute (like Egg Beaters Original)
1 tsp. dried minced onion
1/4 tsp. chopped garlic
1/8 tsp. salt
Dash black pepper
1 wedge The Laughing Cow Light Creamy Swiss cheese, room temperature
1/4 cup shredded reduced-fat cheddar cheese
Optional topping: chopped chives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray.
Place mushroom caps on the sheet, rounded sides down. Bake until tender, 16 - 18 minutes. Leave oven on.
Meanwhile, prepare bacon in a skillet or in the microwave. (Refer to package for cook time and temperature.)
In a medium bowl, whisk egg substitute, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper.
Bring a skillet sprayed with nonstick spray to medium heat. Cook and stir chopped mushroom stems until softened, 3 - 4 minutes. Add egg mixture and scramble until fully cooked, 3 - 4 minutes.
Break bacon and cheese wedge into pieces and add to the skillet. Continue to scramble until cheese has melted and is evenly mixed, about 1 minute.
Blot away excess moisture from mushroom caps. Divide egg mixture between the caps and sprinkle with shredded cheese. Bake until shredded cheese has melted, 2 - 3 minutes. Eat!
