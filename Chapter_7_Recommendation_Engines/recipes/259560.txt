Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
3/4 cup minced onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken stock
4 cups uncooked jasmine rice
2 1/2 cups chopped cooked chicken
1/2 cup minced deveined and seeded yellow banana peppers, or to taste
2 teaspoons ground turmeric
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 cup corn kernels, fresh off the cob
1 cup frozen peas
1 cup diced carrots
1 cup diced seeded and deveined red sweet pepper
1/4 cup low-sodium chicken stock, or more as needed, divided (optional)
3 tablespoons butter, cut in small pieces

Directions:
Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Saute onions until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; saute until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add 4 1/2 cups chicken stock, rice, chopped chicken, banana peppers, turmeric, and salt. Bring soup to a boil.
Place corn, peas, carrots, and red pepper into the soup. Cover and reduce heat to low. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend, about 10 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons chicken stock if dry. Top with pats of butter.
Place Dutch oven on a heat diffuser to allow rice to brown on the bottom, 10 to 15 minutes. Cook and stir, adding chicken stock 2 tablespoons at a time if needed, until rice is tender but firm, 5 minutes more.

Description: 
This is an Americanized version of the Peruvian chicken and rice dish that is made with sal y complementos. I have adjusted the recipe to use ingredients available in the US and tweaked up the seasonings to avoid the need for aji amarillo sauce, which the Peruvians would have and use liberally, but Americans don't have it, and won't put on if you give it to them, but then complain the dish was bland! If you have some and want the dish spicier, just add it on top at the table.
