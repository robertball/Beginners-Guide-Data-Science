Ingredients:
1 (19.76 ounce) package Johnsonville® Italian Hot Sausage Links
1 (26 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
1 cup water
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta or cottage cheese
1 egg
1 tablespoon dried parsley flakes
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
8 dry lasagna noodles
4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
Sliced black olives (optional)

Directions:
Pan-fry or broil sausage according to package directions. Cut sausage in half lengthwise; cut into 1/4-inch slices. In a large skillet, combine the sausage, spaghetti sauce and water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes.
In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, parsley and oregano.
Spread one third of the sauce mixture over the bottom of a greased 13-inch x 9-inch baking dish. Layer with half of the noodles and half the ricotta cheese mixture. Sprinkle with half the mozzarella cheese. Top with a third of the sauce. Layer with the remaining noodles, ricotta cheese mixture and mozzarella cheese. Top with the remaining sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and black olives if desired. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.
Remove lasagna from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking.
Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for about 1 hour or until noodles are tender and sauce is bubbly. Let stand 5-10 minutes before serving.
