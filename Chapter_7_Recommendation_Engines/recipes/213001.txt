3 1/4 pounds pig's feet, rinsed and patted dry
1 1/2 cups vinegar
1 1/2 cups water
1/3 cup soy sauce
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns, crushed
3 bay leaves
1 tablespoon white sugar
salt to taste

Directions:
Combine the pig's feet, vinegar, water, soy sauce, onion, garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, sugar, and salt together in a stockpot; bring to a boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; allow the stew to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the meat pulls easily from the bones and the liquid has thickened, about 1 hour. Serve hot.
