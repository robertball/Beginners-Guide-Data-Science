Ingredients:
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup sour cream
2 eggs
1/3 cup canola oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup white sugar
1 orange - zested, peeled, and segmented
1 3/4 cups self-rising flour
1 pinch salt
7 ounces milk chocolate chips (such as Cadbury Baking Chips)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 16 muffin cups with paper liners.
Whisk milk, sour cream, eggs, oil, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until well combined. Whisk in sugar and orange zest. Stir in flour, salt, and chocolate chips in that order. Dice orange segments and gently fold into batter.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Orange and chocolate are heavenly together. Dust with powdered sugar if desired. If you like the chocolate melted,  lightly warm muffins in the microwave before serving.
