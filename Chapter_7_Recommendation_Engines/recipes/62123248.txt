Description: 
This is the potato soup recipe my grandma used to make: potatoes simmered in chicken broth with the addition of milk, rivels, and flour to add to the creaminess.  I crave this simple recipe every winter!  I have tweaked the recipe by adding extra vegetables occasionally, but this is the version I like best!
