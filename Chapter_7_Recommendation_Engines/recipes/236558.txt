Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
2 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon Tennessee whiskey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (12 ounce) bag semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together into a bowl.
Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat the first egg into the butter until completely blended; beat in the second egg. Add whiskey and vanilla extract; beat until smooth.
Mix flour mixture into creamed butter mixture until just incorporated; fold in chocolate chips. Form dough into 1-inch balls and place on a baking sheet, 1 to 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 9 to 12 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool.

Description: 
Here in Tennessee, we would put whiskey in our scrambled eggs if it was socially acceptable. Luckily, whiskey in your cookies is both acceptable and tasty! Get a glass of milk (or whiskey) to have with cookies.
