https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/729814.jpg
Ingredients:
4 fresh jalapeno peppers, quartered and seeded
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to about 3/4-inch thickness and cut into 8 strips each
2 slices pepperjack cheese, each sliced into 8 strips
8 slices bacon, cut in half
toothpicks
1 cup buffalo wing sauce
1 cup blue cheese salad dressing

Directions:
Preheat the oven broiler.
Place quartered jalapenos on a baking sheet, and broil just until they start to brown, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from heat, and allow to cool enough to handle. Leave the broiler on.
Stuff each jalapeno quarter with a pepperjack cheese strip, and wrap with chicken and bacon strips, securing with toothpicks. Arrange on the baking sheet.
Broil wrapped jalapenos until cheese is melted and bacon and chicken are cooked through, about 5 minutes on each side. Serve on a platter with buffalo wing sauce and bleu cheese dressing for dipping.

Description: 
This is a great appetizer recipe I created after eating White Wings at one of my favorite places in Austin. They are very tasty with or without the cheese.
