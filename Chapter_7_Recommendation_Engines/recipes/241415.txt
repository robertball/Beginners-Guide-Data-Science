Ingredients:
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
3/4 cup butter
4 cups vanilla wafer crumbs (such as Nilla®)
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 cup finely chopped pecans
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 cup ground almonds
3/4 cup Irish cream liqueur (such as Baileys®)
1/2 cup sour cream
1 1/2 pounds dark chocolate, chopped, or as needed

Directions:
Place chocolate chips and butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; stir until melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat to cool slightly.
Whisk vanilla wafer crumbs, confectioner's sugar, pecans, cocoa powder, and almonds together in a large bowl; stir in Irish cream liqueur, sour cream, and chocolate mixture to form a soft dough. Cover mixture with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
Form mixture into balls using a tablespoon-size cookie scoop; place on a baking sheet. Place baking sheet in the freezer until firm, about 30 minutes.
Melt dark chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Using a toothpick, dip each ball into melted chocolate to coat; place on waxed paper until chocolate is firm, about 10 minutes.
Place balls in candy cups; store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 6 weeks.
