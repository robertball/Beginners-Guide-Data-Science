Ingredients:
9 cups water
2 cups white sugar
5 tea bags
1 (6 ounce) can frozen lemonade concentrate, thawed
1 (6 ounce) can frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed
2 cups bourbon
1 (2 liter) bottle ginger ale, or as needed
16 sprigs mint (optional)

Directions:
Bring water to a low boil in a large saucepan. Stir sugar into water to dissolve. Add tea bags to water; set aside off heat to steep for 5 minutes.
Mix tea mixture, lemonade concentrate, orange juice concentrate, and bourbon together in a large container.
Put mixture in the freezer, breaking chunks into smaller pieces every few hours, until consistency is slushy but kind of flaky, melty frozen, about 24 hours.
Scoop a few of large heaping spoonfuls of the slush into a glass; then top off with ginger ale and garnish with mint to serve.

Description: 
This is the best summer cocktail! Men love it. Women adore it. I got it from a friend, and she always used Jim Beam®, but you can also use vodka or gin. Every time I serve these people beg me for the recipe and there isn't a drop left! If you like it less sweet, I suggest using ginger ale and scaling back on the sugar by 1/4 cup. I think this wouldn't affect the outcome too much. Seriously, you can use gin, bourbon, or vodka, but the bourbon is particularly refreshing in this! Ginger ale can be replaced with Sprite® or 7-Up®.
