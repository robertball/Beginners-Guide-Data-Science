Description: 
A great dinner for two! Chicken breasts marinated in oil, vinegar and Ranch-style dressing, then broiled to a beguiling finish. This is a wonderful chicken recipe that can be prepared in the morning and cooked when you get home at night. The longer you let it marinate, the better it tastes!
