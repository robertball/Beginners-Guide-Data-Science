Beat egg white in a bowl with an electric hand-mixer until stiff peaks form.
Gradually beat sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, into egg whites until fully incorporated. Stir salt and vanilla extract into egg whites until thoroughly mixed.
Fold coconut and corn flakes into the mixture.
Drop coconut mixture by the teaspoon onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until lightly crisp, 20 minutes.
Transfer cookies to wire rack to cool, at least 15 minutes.

Description: 
A fast and easy recipe that is great for mailing to friends and family, festively snowy white, and very tasty with a pleasantly crunchy and chewy texture. This recipe originally comes from my great-grandmother and has been handed down through four generations. My Grandma Sally makes these almost every year for Christmas and it is one of my favorite Christmas cookie recipes. The cookies will be chewy-crunchy when finished cooling, not gooey.
