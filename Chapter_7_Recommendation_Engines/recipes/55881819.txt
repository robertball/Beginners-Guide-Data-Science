Ingredients:
2 (6 ounce) frozen lobster tails
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon lemon pepper seasoning

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler.
Thaw the lobster tails partially and use kitchen scissors to cut the shells open lengthwise down the back. Brush the exposed meat with olive oil and season with lemon pepper. Place on a broiler pan with the opening facing upwards.
Broil the tails about 6 inches from the heat source until they are opaque and slightly browned at the edges, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe is great for those little frozen lobster tails and when you only have a few minutes.  The olive oil makes the lobster moister and the lemon pepper gives it a good flavor.Modified from: Easy Broiled Lobster Tails
