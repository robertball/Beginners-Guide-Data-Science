Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) package pork tenderloin, fat trimmed
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
2 cups water
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons minced garlic
3 dashes hot pepper sauce
1/2 cup mayonnaise
3 tablespoons white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 pinch lemon pepper, or to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Season pork tenderloin with salt, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; fry pork in hot oil until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer meat to a slow cooker. Add water, brown sugar, cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and hot sauce.
Cook on Low for 7 hours. Remove tenderloin to a platter and drain cooking liquid, reserving about 1/2 cup. Shred pork and return to slow cooker. Add enough reserved liquid to moisten meat.
Whisk mayonnaise, white vinegar, garlic powder, lemon pepper, and 1 pinch cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Serve mayonnaise sauce with shredded pork.
