Saute Onions & garlic until soft (not browned)in butter.  Add Shrimp until just pink (will cook more in the oven). Add Breadcrumbs & Parmesan cheese. Mix well.  Put Articokes under running water with the water going down in the center to help open them up.Drain uside down.
Scrape with a spoon to remove fury choke (careful not to remove too much of the meat of the heart). Place in large baking dish and stuff with the bread crumb mixture, besure sure to put as much stuffing in between the leaves as possible then a spoon full in the center on the heart. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes until stuffing is browned.
