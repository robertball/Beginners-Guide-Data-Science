Description: 
This is an older recipe that used the Kraft Garlic Cheese and Jalapeno Cheese Rolls which are no longer available.  I do have a copycat recipe for the garlic cheese roll but a/r won't let me post the recipe for the garlic cheese roll on this potato recipe, so see notes at bottom of this recipe page or look in my recipe box.
