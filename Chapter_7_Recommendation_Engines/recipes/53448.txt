Ingredients:
10 medium tomatoes
4 cups whole kernel corn, drained
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the cups of a 12 cup muffin pan.
Slice the tops off of the tomatoes, and scoop out the pulp and seeds. Place the pulp and seeds into a bowl, and stir in corn and melted butter. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon the corn mixture into each tomato until filled. Place tomatoes into the cups of the muffin pan.
Bake for about 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until heated through.
