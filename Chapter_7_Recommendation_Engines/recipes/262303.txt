Ingredients:
1 pound lentils
2 cups water, or as needed
salt to taste
1/2 (12 ounce) package bacon, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
3 tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
3 firm bananas, sliced (optional)

Directions:
Place lentils in a soup pot and cover with 2 inches of water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until lentils are soft, 25 to 30 minutes. Season with salt during the last few minutes of cooking.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Add onion; saute until transparent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cilantro; cook until tomatoes change color, about 5 minutes. Pour mixture over cooked lentils. Bring to a boil and cook until flavors blend, 3 to 5 minutes more. Serve with banana slices.
