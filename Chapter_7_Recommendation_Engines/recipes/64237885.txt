Ingredients:
8 medium carrots, cut into 1-inch chunks
4 celery ribs, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup butter, cubed
2 cans (10-1/2 ounces each) condensed beef consomme, undiluted (can also use 2 cups of leftover turkey stock/broth)
4-2/3 cups water, divided
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3 cups cubed cooked turkey
2 cups frozen cut green beans (can also use frozen peas)
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
DUMPLINGS:
1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons minced parsley
1/8 teaspoon poultry seasoning
3/4 cup 2% milk
1 egg

Directions:
In a Dutch oven, saute the carrots, celery and onion in butter for 10 minutes. Add the consomme, 4 cups water, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook over low heat for 15 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
Add turkey and beans; cook for 5 minutes. Combine the flour, Worcestershire sauce and remaining water until smooth; stir into turkey mixture. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5 minutes or until thickened.
For dumplings, combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Stir in parsley and poultry seasoning. Combine milk and egg; stir into flour mixture just until moistened. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto simmering stew. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in a dumpling comes out clean (do not lift the cover while simmering). Yield: 10-12 servings.

This is a perfect recipe for Thanksgiving leftovers. My husband and I love dumplings, and this mild-tasting, homey dish has flavorful ones floating on a tasty turkey and vegetable stew. It really hits the spot on chilly fall and winter days.
