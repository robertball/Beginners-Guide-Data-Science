Ingredients:
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 onion, thinly sliced
1 (4 ounce) packet saltine crackers, crushed
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease a 1 1/2-quart baking dish.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover pan and bring the water to a boil. Add asparagus, cover, and steam until just tender, 5 to 8 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet; cook and stir mushrooms and onion until the mushrooms have given off their liquid, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the asparagus, tossing vegetables just until hot. Remove from heat.
Mix saltine cracker crumbs, sharp Cheddar cheese, and black pepper together in a bowl; spread half the mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
Spoon the asparagus mixture over the crumb mixture.
Whisk the cream of mushroom soup and milk together in a bowl until smooth, and pour the soup mixture over the asparagus mixture.
Spread the remaining crumb-cheese mixture over the casserole and sprinkle with pecans.
Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
