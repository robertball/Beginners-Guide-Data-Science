Ingredients:
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup white vinegar
2 tsp salt
1 Tbsp dried basil
1/2 tsp. dried oregano
1/2 tsp. black pepper
1 lb firm tofu, drained and pressed, then cubed and GENTLY/sparingly crumbled.

Directions:
Place everything BUT the tofu in a bowl and whisk it together.
Add the tofu and stir gently to thoroughly saturate it with the marinade.
Allow the bowl to sit, covered, on the counter away from heat for one hour.
Use as recipe suggests, in place of genuine feta cheese. (The leftovers can be left in the bowl and marinade, covered in the fridge.)
