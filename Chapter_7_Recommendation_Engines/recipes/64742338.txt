Ingredients:
1 ½ cups cassava flour
1 teaspoon sea salt
4 tablespoons duck fat
¾ cup warm water

Directions:
Stir together cassava flour and salt.
Add duck fat and water and use hands to stir, continuing to knead until dough is soft and pliable (it should have the consistency of playdough).
Divide into 10 balls, and keep covered with plastic wrap in a bowl while you work.
Using parchment paper and a tortilla press or rolling pin, press tortillas into rounds.
Cook each in a dry skillet over medium to medium-high heat; wait for bubbles to form before flipping tortilla.
Carefully set aside as you work.
Tortillas can be eaten immediately or stored in a sealed container in refrigerator for 3 days.
