Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch chunks
1 teaspoon salt and pepper, or to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons curry powder
1/2 onion, thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened coconut milk
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed, diced tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 red potatoes, cubed
1 1/2 tablespoons sugar

Directions:
Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper.
Heat oil and curry powder in a large skillet over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes. Stir in onions and garlic, and cook until the onion is translucent - about 10 minutes more. Add more oil as the onion is cooking, if necessary. Then add the tomato and cook it for a little while. Add chicken, tossing lightly to coat with curry oil. Reduce heat to medium, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink in center and juices run clear.
Pour coconut milk, tomato sauce, potatoes and sugar into the pan, and stir to combine. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, approximately 30 minutes. Then, uncover and stir frequently until it is thick and the tomatoes break down and blend into the sauce.
If still runny, after another 30 minutes, mix 1T cornstarch with about 2T. cold water, add to the sauce and boil for one minute.
