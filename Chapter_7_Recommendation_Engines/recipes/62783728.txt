Title:
Rack of Lamb Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 rack of lamb (8 small lamb chops)
3 tbsp. round cornmeal
1-1/2 tsp. minced rosemary (dried works fine)
3 cloves garlic
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper
2-1/2 tbsp. Dijon mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400Â°
Combine the cornmeal, rosemary, garlic, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Mix well and set aside.
Coat the lamb chops with the mustard then coat with the cornmeal mixture.
Bake in a glass baking dish for 45 minutes. If you prefer meats on the more "raw side", test at 30 minutes. For medium, (where the center of each chop is just barely pink) 45 minutes is perfect.
Let sit for 5 minutes, then cut the chops to separate them from the rack and serve.
