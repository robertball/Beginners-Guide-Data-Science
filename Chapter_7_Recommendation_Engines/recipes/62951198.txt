Ingredients:
2 ½ cups old-fashioned rolled oats
1 cup chopped pecans
1 ½ cups packed brown sugar
1 cup (2 sticks) butter, room temperature
2 eggs
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
½ cup diced dried apples
½ cup pomegranate-flavored dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Spread oats and pecans on an ungreased jellyroll pan. Bake in preheated oven 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until light brown; remove from oven and set aside to cool. Leave oven on.
In large mixing bowl, beat brown sugar with butter. Add eggs, water and vanilla and beat until light and fluffy.
In separate bowl, mix flour, baking soda and salt. Stir into butter mixture along with cooled oats and pecans and dried fruits.
Drop dough by rounded tablespoons about 2 inches apart onto ungreased cooked sheets. Bake in preheated oven 8 to 10 minutes or until golden brown.
Cool slightly, then remove from cookie sheets and cool on wire racks.
