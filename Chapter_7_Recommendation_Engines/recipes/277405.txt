Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, cut into bite-sized pieces
3 stalks celery, sliced
1 medium green bell pepper, chopped
1/3 cup finely chopped onion, or more to taste
1 1/4 cups mayonnaise (such as Duke'sÂ®)
1 tablespoon vinegar
1 tablespoon mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and chopped

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and add water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat and immediately rinse with cold water, then set aside to cool.
Combine celery, green pepper, and onion in a large bowl. Add mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper and thoroughly mix together. Add cauliflower and eggs; toss lightly until mixed.
Cover and chill for until flavors have melded, 6 to 24 hours.

Description: 
I wanted to find a keto-friendly way to still have my potato salad with the Christmas ham. Came out so good, hubby went back for seconds. 
Essentially, you can just replace the potatoes with steamed cauliflower in your favorite potato salad recipe. I took my mom's creamy potato salad and changed the potatoes for cauliflower.
