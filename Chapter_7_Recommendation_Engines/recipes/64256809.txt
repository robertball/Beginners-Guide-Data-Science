Ingredients:
For the meatballs
1 lbs ground beef (80/20)
1/2 lb bulk pork sausage
2 Tbl fresh parsley, chopped
3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1/2 cup almond flour
2 eggs
1 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp dried onion flakes
1/4 tsp dried oregano
1/2 cup warm water

Directions:
Combine all of the meatball ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Form into 30 1? meatballs. Bake at 350 degrees (F) for 15 minutes OR fry in a large skillet over medium heat until cooked through. Pro-tip – try frying in bacon grease if you have any – it adds another level of flavor. Frying produces the golden brown color shown in the photos above.
