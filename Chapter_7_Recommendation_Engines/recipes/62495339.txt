Ingredients:
1 cup apple cider
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp nutmeg
1/8 tsp ground cloves
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 tbsp sugar mixed with 1 tsp cinnamon for sprinkling

Directions:
Place apple cider in saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Boil until reduced to about 1/4 cup (about 15 minutes).  Remove from heat and let cool.
Preheat oven to 350.  Grease or line 12 muffin cup tins with paper liners.
Whisk or sift together flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  Set aside.
Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in eggs, one at a time.  Mix in vanilla.
Mix in half the flour mixture.  Blend in buttermilk and reduced apple cider, then mix in remaining flour mixture.
Fill muffin tins 3/4 full.  Sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
