Ingredients:
2 medium baker potatoes
1/4 cup butter
2 1/2 cups sliced leeks (white & light green parts), well rinsed
2 garlic cloves, minced
Salt & freshly ground pepper to taste
2 cups chicken stock
2 cups water
4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2” pieces
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup sour cream
1 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese
2 Tbsp. sliced green onions or chives

Directions:
Wash potatoes and bake until done.  Set aside to cool.  Melt butter in Dutch oven and add leeks and garlic.  Season with salt and pepper and cook until softened.  Add broth and water and simmer over medium heat until leeks are tender, about 20 minutes.  Cook bacon until crisp and drain on paper towel. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise.  Use a large spoon to scoop pulp in 1 piece from each half.  Cut pulp into 1/2” cubes and set aside.  Coarsely chop potato skin and entire remaining potato and add to pot with leeks.
In a blender, puree in batches.  Return pureed soup to a clean pot and reheat over medium heat.  In a small bowl, whisk together milk and sour cream until smooth, then whisk into soup with 1/2 cup cheddar.  Stir in diced potato.
If soup is too thick, it may be thinned with water.  Season to taste and garnish with remaining cheddar, bacon and chives.  Serves 4.
