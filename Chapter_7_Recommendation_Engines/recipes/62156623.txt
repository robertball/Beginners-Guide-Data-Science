2 cans of blackeyed peas, rinsed and drained
2 c. of fresh or frozen corn, cooked and drained
1 c. (8oz.) of cooked cubed ham
2 tbsp. of chopped red onion
3 celery stalks, chopped finely
2/3 c. sour cream
2 - 4 shakes of tabasco
1 tbsp. ketchup
1 tbsp. dried cilantro (or 2 tbsp. fresh, chopped)
1 tsp. cajun seasoning

Directions:
Drain and rinse the peas.  Cook the corn until tender and, if fresh, remove from cob.  Combine warm corn, peas, ham, onion, and celery.
Seperately, combine sour cream, ketchup, cajun seasoning and cilantro.  Add two shakes of tabasco.  (If more spicy dish is desired, add more tabasco but remember, tabasco has more of an after effect in terms of spicyness!)
Pour dressing over ham and pea mixture.  Stir and serve immediately.
