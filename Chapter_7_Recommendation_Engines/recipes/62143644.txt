Ingredients:
1 head of cabbage, cored
Water to cover
1 lb ground chuck
1 pkg Sweet Italian Sausage, casings removed
1 small onion, chopped
1 cup minute rice
2 cans Italian seasoned diced tomatoes
1 T Chopped fresh basil leaves

Directions:
Boil head of cabbage with core completely removed in enough water to cover until outer layers are soft and pliable.
While boiling prepare a large casserole dish or a lasagna pan with non-stick cooking spray (olive oil variety preferred).
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
In a large bowl, combine ground chuck, ground italian sausage, onion, and rice.
Mix with a fork or fingers just until all incorporated. Do not over-mix.
Drain and rinse cabbage in cold water to prevent further cooking and to cool the leaves for handling.
Pull one leaf from the head of cabbage and place 2 to 3 inch football shaped ball of meat mixture in the center.
Roll the cabbage leaf over once, tuck in the 2 sides and then continue to roll up completely.
Place roll in the dish or pan.
Continue the process until all meat is gone.
Top the rolls with the tomatoes.
Bake covered at 375 degrees for 1 hour or until cooked through.
Top with chopped basil.
