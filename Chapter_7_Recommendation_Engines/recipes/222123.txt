Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package natural chocolate cake mix
1 (3.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix

1/2 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup warm water
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons confectioner's sugar for dusting on top of cooled cake (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup tube pan.
Mix cake mix, pudding mix, sour cream, oil, beaten eggs, and water in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven until top is springy to the touch and a wooden toothpick inserted comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool cake thoroughly in pan at least 1 1/2 hours before inverting onto plate. Dust with confectioner's sugar before serving.
