Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 cup butter, softened
6 eggs
2 1/4 cups white sugar
3/4 cup lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix 2 cups of flour and confectioner's sugar together. Cut in the butter or margarine. Mix well until the dough resembles pie dough consistency. Press the dough into a 9x13 inch baking pan.
Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Don't overcook.
Beat together eggs, sugar, 6 tablespoons flour and lemon juice for at least 1 minute, until frothy. Pour the mixture over the baked crust.
Bake the bars another 20 minutes, or until the lemon topping has set. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar when cooled.

Description: 
This is a really easy recipe  that my mom made before the lemon bar rage was on! Thick skinned lemons work the best. I suggest using real butter and eggs, I've tried using eggbeaters -- nowhere near as good!Modified from: Lemon Pie Bars
