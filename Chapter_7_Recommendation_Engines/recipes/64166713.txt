Ingredients:
1 packet active dry yeast
1 tsp sugar
1 1/2 cups warm water
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp salt
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Dissolve yeast and sugar in the warm water. Stir and set to the side.
Combine flour, olive oil, and salt in a large bowl. Mix with a spoon.
Pour Yeast mixture into the bowl and stir until dough forms.
Spread flour over a working surface and knead the dough for roughly 10 minutes until it is thin and elastic.
roll dough into a ball and place it into a clean bowl, then cover bowl with cling wrap. Let dough rise for 30 min, by then it should have roughly doubled in size.
Roll dough out into small circles, roll until you can roughly see through it.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick spray.
Place rolled dough on cookie sheet.
Spread marinara sauce, cheese and other desired toppings (make sure meat is pre-cooked). *too many toppings will make the dough cook unevenly. Be nice!
Place in oven for 15 min or until dough has hardened and evenly browned.
