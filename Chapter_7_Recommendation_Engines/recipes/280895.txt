Description: 
My raspberry-lemon bars are perfect for summer and easy to make. I start with a shortbread crust, then double the lemon filling that you'll find in most recipes, adding lemon oil and zest for extra flavor. Then let them cool, dust with powdered sugar, and top with fresh summer raspberries. Also good served with fresh whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
