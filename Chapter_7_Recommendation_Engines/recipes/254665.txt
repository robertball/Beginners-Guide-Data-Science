Ingredients:
3 potatoes, peeled and cut into small cubes, or more to taste
4 poblano peppers, halved and seeded, or more to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3 ears fresh corn, shucked, or more to taste
salt to taste
1/2 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.75 ounce) can creamed corn
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 cup milk

Directions:
Place potatoes in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place poblano peppers cut-side down in a baking dish. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil on top.
Bake poblano peppers until skin starts to blacken and blister, about 15 minutes. Allow peppers to cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Remove and discard skins; coarsely chop peppers.
Cut corn kernels off the cobs. Spread on a greased baking sheet; sprinkle with salt.
Bake corn kernels in the preheated oven, stirring every 5 minutes, until tender, about 15 minutes.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring frequently, until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in chopped poblano peppers, creamed corn, chicken broth, cilantro, and cumin. Blend soup with an immersion blender until smooth.
Bring soup to a gentle boil. Stir in potatoes, baked corn kernels, and milk. Season with salt. Simmer until flavors combine, 5 to 10 minutes.
