Ingredients:
1 large French baguette, cut into 1/2 inch slices
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes, drained

2 tablespoons chopped Italian (flat-leaf) parsley
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
24 small slices fontina or provolone cheese

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F.
Place baguette slices on a baking sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until toasted, turning once.
Meanwhile, combine tomatoes, olives, parsley, vinegar, oil and red pepper in a medium bowl.
Place 1 cheese slice on each toasted baguette slice; return to the oven. Bake for 2 to 3 minutes or until the cheese begins to melt.
Top each with about 1 tablespoon of the tomato mixture. Serve immediately as an appetizer.
