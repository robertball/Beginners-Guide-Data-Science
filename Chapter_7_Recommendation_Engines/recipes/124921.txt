Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
2 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
3 tablespoons sugar
1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
1/3 cup honey
1/2 cup nonfat dry milk powder
1 tablespoon salt
4 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add sugar, butter, honey, milk powder, salt and whole wheat flour; beat until smooth. Add enough all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto  floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down. Shape dough into traditional loaves or divide into fourths and roll each portion into a 15-in. rope. Twist two ropes together. Place in greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks.

My sister and I were in 4-H, and Mom was our breads project leader for years. Because of that early training, fresh homemade bread like this is a staple in my own kitchen. -Karen Wingate, Coldwater, Kansas
