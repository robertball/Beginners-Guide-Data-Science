Ingredients:
2 cups freshly brewed tea (I like orange pekoe, but of course you're free to use any kind of tea that you like!)
juice from 1/2 of a lemon
1 cup of sugar
1/2 cup of water
a small handful fresh mint leaves, or 1 tsp dried mint

Directions:
heat sugar, water, and mint in a saucepan over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is thick and syrupy.
Remove mint from syrup and let cool to room temperature. This is a good time to brew the tea.
Once you've brewed your tea, combine it with the lemon juice in a bowl with a lid. Add the syrup to the tea, and refrigerate it all to about 40 degrees.
Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the directions for sorbet.
*Note* This does turn out a bit icier than normal fruit sorbets, but it's still very refreshing!
