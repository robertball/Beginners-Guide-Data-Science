https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 cups flour
1/2 cup sugar
5 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
3/4 cup butter, cold
1 egg
2/3 cup milk
1 orange, juice and zest
1 cup blackberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425F. Grease the baking sheet.
In a mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. In another bowl, combine egg, milk, juice and zest. Stir into dry ingredients, then fold in blackberries.
Turn onto lightly floured surface and knead 10-12 times. Pat down to 1/2" thickness, and cut into triangles. (Note: My dough was way too sticky to pat out, so I ended up treating them like drop scones and used an ice cream scoop. My brother didn't have any trouble patting them out though.) Place 1" apart on baking sheet and bake 12-15 minutes.

Description: 
These scones are very moist and a bit more cakey than scone-like, but delicious nevertheless!!!
