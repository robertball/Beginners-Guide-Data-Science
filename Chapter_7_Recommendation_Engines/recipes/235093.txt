Ingredients:
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, each cut into 4 equal long pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 large whole wheat tortillas, cut into 1/2-inch strips
16 slices green olives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper.
Heat a non-stick skillet or spray a skillet with non-stick cooking spray over medium-high heat; cook chicken until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate to cool enough to handle.
Wrap each chicken piece with a tortilla strip, starting at 1 end and overlapping tortillas when starting a new strip and leaving a gap at the top for the 'face'. Place 'mummies' on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until until tortillas are crisp and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Cool mummies for about 5 minutes; place 2 olive slices on each 'mummy' for the 'eyes.'

Description: 
These chicken mummies are perfect for a fun but healthy Halloween dinner to fuel your little ghouls and goblins for a long night of trick-or-treating. They are also a hit at adult Halloween parties. This recipe can be tailored quite easily: chicken tenders can be marinated in your choice of marinade before cooking; different flavored tortillas can also change the look and taste. Serve with your choice of condiments; salsa, guacamole, and sour cream go well, as do barbecue sauce or even ketchup.
