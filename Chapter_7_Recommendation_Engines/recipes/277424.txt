Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup minced carrot
1 cup thinly sliced green beans
1 medium white onion, minced
3 large cloves garlic, minced
8 ounces ground beef
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 1/2 cups cooked white rice
1 large egg
3/4 cup soy sauce (such as KikkomanÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saute pan over medium-low heat. Saute carrots, green beans, onion, and garlic in the hot butter until onions are transparent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add ground beef to the vegetables and season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until ground beef is browned and crumbly and carrots are softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add rice and mix well.
Crack the egg into a bowl and beat using a fork. Mix into rice mixture until egg is no longer runny, 3 to 4 minutes.
Stir in soy sauce. Taste and add more soy sauce, salt, and pepper to taste. Mix rice well. When you're satisfied with the seasoning, turn off the heat and serve.

Description: 
My boyfriend loved ordering this Japanese beef fried rice in our favorite Japanese restaurant. For dinner one time, I decided to surprise him by making my own...he absolutely loved it. 
This is a quick and easy all-in-one meal...has rice, meat, and vegetables. If you want a little more meat, you can match it up with some chicken teriyaki or grilled barbecue ribs...yum!
