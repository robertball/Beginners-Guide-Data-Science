Ingredients:
1 pound dark chocolate chips
1/2 cup butter
4 eggs
1 dash vanilla extract
3 ripe bananas, or more to taste
1 cup all purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a deep baking pan.
Melt chocolate and butter in top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.
Mix eggs and vanilla extract together in a large bowl; mash bananas into egg mixture until well mixed.
Combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and baking powder in a separate bowl.
Mix chocolate mixture into the banana mixture; add flour mixture and stir until smooth. Pour mixture into the greased baking pan.
Bake in preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 60 minutes.
