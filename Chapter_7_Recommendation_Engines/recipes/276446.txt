Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup diced onion
1 (32 ounce) carton chicken broth
2 (15 ounce) cans cannellini beans, rinsed
1 bunch collard greens, stems removed and torn into 2-inch pieces
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 dash hot pepper sauce, or more to taste (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat; stir in onion. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken broth, cannellini beans, collard greens, vinegar, and Italian seasoning and bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until collard greens are tender, 40 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
A very healthy and tasty soup or vegetable side dish high in protein, fiber, and nutrients. Despite any reservations you might have (as I did!), you will like this dish. It was inspired by a recipe I saw on Dr. Oz's TV show in 2012. Eat as a hearty soup or over a bed of rice.  This can serve as a good lunch or, with chicken or fish, as a full dinner meal.
