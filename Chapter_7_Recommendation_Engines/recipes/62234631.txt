Ingredients:
3/4 cup Shortening
1/2 cup Sugar substitute (I used Splenda 1 to 1)
1/2 cup Brown Sugar substitute (I used the one that
is half substitute and have real brown sugar)
3 Eggs
1/2 teaspoon Vanilla
1 cup White Flour
3/4 cup Wheat Flour
1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda
1/4 teaspoon Baking Powder
1/4 teaspoon Salt
1 1/2 cup oats
3/4 cup Flaked Coconut

Directions:
Cream together the shortening, sugars, eggs and vanilla. In seperate bowl use a whisk and mix flours, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Mix flour mixture with shortening mixture. Mix in oats and coconut. Dough will be stiff. I actually mix with a well washed hand at this point to make sure its mixed really well. I use 1 ounce balls on cookie sheet seperated by at least an inch and a half. You can flatten just a bit if you don't like rounded cookies. Bake 10-13 minutes inpreheated 350 oven.

Description: 
While trying to come up with a cookie recipe my husband liked with very reduced sugar I came up with this one. They are made often to keep a supply for him. Although it has some brown sugar and whatever sugar is in the coconut, it gives him something to munch that does not seem to effect his sugar level drastically. These can also be made with real sugars if you really have a sweettooth.
