Ingredients:
Sauce:
1/2 pound lean ground beef
2 small zucchinis, chopped
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 tablespoons sucanat (crystallized sugar cane juice), or to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons dried basil
1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Pasta:
1 (16 ounce) package whole-wheat spaghetti
1 gallon water
salt

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef, zucchini, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Stir crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, sucanat, basil, sea salt, oregano, and black pepper into beef mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until flavors have blended, at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour for better flavor.
While sauce is simmering, bring salted water to a boil and cook spaghetti according to package directions. Serve sauce over hot pasta.
