Ingredients:
1 can coconut milk
1 tablespoon red curry paste
1/2 cup frozen peas or mixed vegetables
4 oz soft silken tofu (optional) cubed
1 tablespoon red curry paste
1 tsp granulated garlic
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp powdered ginger
1 TBLS fish sauce (or sub 2 tsp soy sauce)
1/2 cup frozen peas or mixed vegetables
1 tsp. lime juice (optional)
Cilantro, chopped (optional)to taste

Directions:
Shake the coconut milk in case it has settled in the can, open, and pour into medium saucepan.  Add curry paste, and stir to blend.  Add veggies.  Begin to heat over medium heat.  Dice tofu, if using, and add to coconut milk mixture.  Add fish sauce or soy sauce. Stir.  Sprinkle powdered spices over the liquid, and stir gently.  Dice tofu, if using, and add to coconut milk mixture.  Do not bring the coconut milk to a boil, as it will lose its flavor, but heat well, and continue to stir gently until hot.  Cooks using soy instead of fish sauce may want to add a bit of salt.  Just before serving, stir in lime juice juice and sprinkle with cilantro.

Description: 
Quick but tasty lunch or dinner for people on the go.  I prefer using freshly prepared chopped garlic, scallions and ginger to make this dish, but the powders are amazingly good in their place, and quick.  Lemon juice may be substituted for the lime juice.
