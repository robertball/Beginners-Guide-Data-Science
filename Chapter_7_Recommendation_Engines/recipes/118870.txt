Ingredients:
1/2 small onion, chopped
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon water
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup canned diced green chiles
1 (16 ounce) package pre-baked Italian bread shell crust
1 cup salsa
1 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese, divided
3/4 cup chopped fresh tomatoes
1/2 cup frozen corn, thawed
1/2 cup chopped green pepper
3 tablespoons sliced ripe olives drained
1/2 cup reduced-fat sour cream

Directions:
In a nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, combine the onion, chili powder, cumin, cinnamon and water. Cover and cook for 3-4 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in beans and chilies. Transfer half of the bean mixture to a food processor; cover and process until almost smooth.
Spread pureed bean mixture over the crust. Spread with salsa. Top with half of the cheese and remaining bean mixture. Sprinkle with tomato, corn, green pepper, olives and remaining cheese. Bake at 450 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Serve with sour cream.
