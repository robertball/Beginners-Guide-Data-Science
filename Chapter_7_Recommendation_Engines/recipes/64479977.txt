Ingredients:
2lbs ground hamburger
1 lb ground pork
2 eggs
1/2 cup whole milk
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
2 tsp garlic powder
1 1/2 tsp oregano
1/2 tsp onion powder
1 T salt
1 tsp black pepper
2 tbs parsley
1/2 loaf Italian bread (broken/processed into up to 2 1/2 cups bread crumbs)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350
In a food processor take the Italian bread and pulse until it's nothing but small crumbs. A few larger pieces is okay. Use 2 1/2 cups for this recipe.
Mix all of the ingredients in a bowl by hand.
Form meatballs but do not pack tightly. A loose meatball will be lighter and much more tender.
Place on a baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes.
Heat up a large pan with your favorite sauce.
When meatballs are done, place in sauce and heat on medium for an additional ten to fifteen minutes.
