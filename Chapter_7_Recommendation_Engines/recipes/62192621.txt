Ingredients:
1 egg white
1 teaspoon vanilla
4 cups whole almonds
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan.
Lightly beat the egg white; add vanilla, and beat until frothy but not stiff. Add the nuts, and stir until well coated. Mix the sugars, salt, and cinnamon, and sprinkle over the nuts. Toss to coat, and spread evenly on the prepared pan.
Bake for 1 hour 15 minutes in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until golden. Allow to cool, then store nuts in airtight containers.
