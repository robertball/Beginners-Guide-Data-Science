Description: 
I added a little crunch to the original recipe by using seasoned breadcrumbs.  This fish makes a perfect light meal that only takes a few minutes to assemble.  I purchase my tilapia in the frozen fish section at my local grocer in a bulk pack that has single fillets sealed separately so I can use only what I need and the remaining packets stay fresher longer in the freezer.Modified from: Easy Baked Tilapia
