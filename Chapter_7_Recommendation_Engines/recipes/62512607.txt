Ingredients:
1/2 Stick of butter (1/4 cup)
1/4 Cup brown sugar
2 Tbsp honey
1 Pinch ground cinnamon

Directions:
Soften the butter- either for a couple seconds in the microwave or leave it sit out until it is soft.
Put the butter in a mixing bowl- add brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger.
Whip the ingredients together- either with a hand mixer, or with a fork by hand.
Refrigerate for hard butter, leave out for spreadable butter, or microwave for a couple seconds for a butter glaze!
