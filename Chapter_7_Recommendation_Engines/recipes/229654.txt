Description: 
This salad is a combination of a fruit dip recipe I learned last week and an apple salad I saw in the grocery store. It was enough inspiration to come up with this delicious recipe for our cook-out this afternoon! I have two boys and a daycare and would recommend this recipe as super-simple to make with kids. Children love chopping apples (even littles can do this with a butter knife) and mixing the dressing. I used ¾ of my dressing and reserved the rest to use as fruit dip later.
