Ingredients:
1 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup whole-wheat flour
1 tsp coarse salt ( I use kosher salt)
1/2 tsp baking soda
3/4 cup ( 1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup packed light - brown sugar ( I use both dark or light depending on the stock in the pantry - no side effect on the cookies
1 large egg
1 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
1/2 cup mashed ripe banana ( about 1 large); you can use more than one banana.
1 cup old fashioned rolled oats ( I use old fashioned or instant oat interchangeably - no side effect)
8 oz semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped into 1/4" chunks ( the one I gave you did not use Nestle chocolate chips, I use dark Valhorna to drizzle on the top and semisweet Valhorna for the chips)
1/2 cup ( about 2 oz) coarsely chopped walnuts toasted ( Idid not use walnuts this time)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375. Whisk together flours, salt, and baking soda in a small bowl; set aside.
Mix butter and sugar in a mixer ( hand held works for me, recipe requires an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment) ; mix on medium speed until pale and fluffy.
Reduce speed to low. Add egg and vanilla; mix until combined. Mix in banana. Add flour mixture; mix until just combined. Stir in oats ( I normally put the oats together with the flour mix), chocolate chunks, and walnuts.
Using 1 1/2" ice cream scoop, drop dough into baking sheets lined with parchment paper ( I do not use parchment paper). Bake cookies until golden brown and just set, 12 to 13 mins. Cookies can be stored in airtight containers up to 2 days (fyi : mine can last longer than 2 days).
