Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 cup pumpkin puree
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup raisins
Icing (Optional):
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 4 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Cream brown sugar and butter together using an electric mixer. Add pumpkin, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, and egg; mix well.
Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in another bowl. Mix into pumpkin mixture. Stir in raisins.
Drop batter by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 11 to 13 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool, 8 to 10 minutes more.
Mix confectioners' sugar and 1/4 cup maple syrup for icing together in a bowl. Drizzle onto cooled cookies.
