Ingredients:
4 Flat Iron steaks.
Goulden's Spicy Brown Mustard.
8 (or more) Tetley/Lipton Tea bags cut open.
Salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat grill (I prefer charcoal)
Salt both sides of each steak liberally.
Rub a thick amount of mustard over each side of steak.
Sprinkle with tea until mustard is completely covered-very heavily.  (It won't be too much)
When grill is ready grill steaks until desired doneness.  This makes a delicious, flavorful crust and keeps the inside tender and juicy.

Description: 
Mustard and tea leaves add flavor and keeps steak moist.
My Dad made this when we were young and everyone (including my mother) was saying EWWWWW, yuck!  Well, after we tasted it we were literally begging for more!
