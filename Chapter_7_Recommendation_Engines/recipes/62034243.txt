Ingredients:
1 lb 	beef sirloin (I use a small London Broil)
1/4 C 	Minced onion
2 tsp 	Minced garlic
1/4 C 	Soy sauce
2 T 	Sugar
1 tsp	Black Pepper
Crushed Red pepper (cayenne) to taste ( I like alot
2 T	Sesame Seeds
2T	Sesame Oil

Directions:
Mix all ingredients above and place in a deep bowl.
Slice beef VERY thinly. It's easier to slice if the beef is slightly frozen. Once sliced,  add to the bowl with the marinade, make sure each piece is coated well and marinate for about 30 minutes in the fridge.
Cook slices on a medium grill until cooked through turning each slice once.
