Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup sliced scallions
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chipotle powder
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp - peeled, deveined, and cut in half
2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
5 (10 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper, scallions, cumin, and chipotle powder. Cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes. Add shrimp and stir frequently until bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 4 to 5 minutes. Add Monterey Jack cheese, reduce heat to medium, and stir until cheese is melted and mixed in with shrimp and vegetables. Remove from heat.
Place 1/5 of the filling mixture onto half of one tortilla. Fold empty side over the filling and press firmly to form a half circle. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling. Brush both sides of tortillas with remaining olive oil.
Place tortillas in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook until crisp and golden, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
