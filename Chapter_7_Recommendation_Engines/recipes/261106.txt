Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless country-style ribs, or more as desired
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 red onion, sliced
2 cups barbeque sauce (such as Famous Dave'sÂ®)
1 cup beef broth

Directions:
Season ribs with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
Place a layer of onion in the bottom of a pressure cooker. Add a layer of ribs. Repeat with remaining onion and ribs.
Combine barbeque sauce and broth together in a bowl; pour over ribs in the pressure cooker.
Close cooker securely and place pressure regulator over vent according to manufacturer's instructions. Heat until steam escapes in a steady flow and makes a whistling sound, about 5 minutes. Adjust heat until regulator is gently rocking. Cook for 25 minutes. Transfer the pressure cooker to the sink; cool the pot with cold water for about 30 seconds to release pressure quickly.

Description: 
I make these for a fast freezer meal. Boneless ribs and barbeque sauce are done in 20 minutes. Serve how you want. I put them in separate meals and freeze for later.
