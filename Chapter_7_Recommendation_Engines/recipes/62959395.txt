Ingredients:
Bread
1 cup milk, warm
1/3 cup water, warm
4 tbsp margarine
3 tbsp honey or sugar
3 3/4 cups bread flour
1 envelope or 2 1/4 tsp active yeast
1/4 cup golden raisins, blueberries or cranberries
2 tsp salt
Cinnamon Filling
1/4 cup sugar
2 tsp cinnamon

Directions:
Lightly grease a 9" loaf pan. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350.
To prepare the bread, starting with the milk and in order, working your way to the salt, place all of the ingredients in your bread machine bowl. Set your bread machine to “dough” and allow the machine to do its magic.
Once the bread machine is complete, turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll it out into a 8"x18" rectangle of equal thickness.
Brush the dough with 1-2 tbsp of melted butter and sprinkle with the cinnamon filling. Starting at the short, 8" end, roll the dough into a tight cylinder, pinching the seam underneath and setting the bread in the greased pan.
Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until double in size, 1 to 2 hours. If you need to step out for 2 hours, slow the rising process by refrigerating.
Bake until golden and when inserted in the center of the loaf, the instant read thermometer is at 200, about 50 minutes.
Let the bread cool completely before slicing.
