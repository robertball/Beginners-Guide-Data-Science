Ingredients:
1 cup masa harina (instant corn masa mix)
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon shortening
1 cup hot water
1 cup oil for frying

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the masa harina, salt and hot water. Gradually mix in the shortening and flour. If the dough seems dry, add a little more hot water. Form the dough into balls that will fit into the palm of your hand.
Line a work surface with waxed paper or plastic. Sprinkle with water. Flatten balls on the wet surface until about 1/4 inch thick.
Heat a griddle or comal over medium heat. Cook the gorditas on each side until they are cooked through.
Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium to medium-high heat until hot. Fry each gordita until puffed, pressing it down into the oil occasionally with a spatula. Drain briefly on paper towels, cut the tips off and stuff full of your favorite foods.

Description: 
Gorditas are similar to pita pockets but much heartier! Can be stuffed with just about anything! I make them with a mixture of corn masa mix and all-purpose flour.
