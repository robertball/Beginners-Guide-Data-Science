Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds boneless beef short ribs
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, sliced
1/3 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
For the Seasoning Mix:
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
For the Rest:
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2/3 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
6 whole pepperoncini peppers
1/4 cup unsalted butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season short ribs with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Heat oil in a pan over high heat. Add short ribs and sear until well browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer beef to a baking dish.
Reduce heat to medium-high and add onion and mushrooms to the pan. Season with salt. Saute until mushrooms are golden brown, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine kosher salt, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, dill, rosemary, thyme, and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl. Sprinkle seasoning mixture evenly over the beef.
Sprinkle flour over the onion and mushrooms. Stir to coat and cook for 2 minutes. Pour in chicken broth, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Stir and bring to a boil; remove from heat. Pour mixture over the beef and cover with pepperoncini. Place butter on top. Cover baking dish with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until meat is fork-tender and falls apart easily, about 2 1/2 hours.
Spoon sauce from the bottom of the pan onto the beef to serve. Skim off excess fat as desired.

Description: 
Recently the internet went wild for a delicious Mississippi pot roast wherein beef is braised in a slow cooker with butter, pepperoncini, and packets of powdered au jus gravy and ranch dressing. Guessing that the MSG from the latter two ingredients explained all the rage, I decided to mimic the flavors using from-scratch seasonings and boneless short ribs. It came out really well, especially when served over mashed potatoes with a garnish of parsley.
