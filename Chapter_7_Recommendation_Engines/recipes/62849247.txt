Ingredients:
6 eggs
3/4 cups salsa, strained
2 Tbsp sour cream, room temperature
1 1/2 cups shredded Mexican cheese
1 finely chopped tomato, seeded and strained of excess liquid
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
Mexican seasoning (packaged taco seasoning works well, but use sparingly as it is very salty)
fresh chopped cilantro to taste
1 coursely chopped jalapeno if desired

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Prepare a shallow 9x9 baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. In a large bowl, beat 6 eggs with a fork until they are slightly fluffy. Add sour cream and seasoning and beat until smooth. Add strained salsa, cilantro, onion, tomato and mix. Pour immediately into prepared pan. Take 3/4 cup of cheese and sprinkle across the top of the mixture. Gently stir it in with a fork. Bake UNCOVERED for approximately 20 minutes, or until firm. It is done when it does not jiggle, and feels springy when gently pressed with a spoon in the center. Top with chopped jalapeno and remaining cheese. Put back into the oven just until the cheese bubbles and turns golden. Let stand to cool for 10 minutes. Gently slice using a serrated knife, and serve. If desired, top with a dollop of sour cream or taco sauce. Enjoy!
