Ingredients:
3 cups water
1 cup dried red beans, rinsed
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 1/2 cups brown rice
1/2 (1.41 ounce) package sazon seasoning (such as GoyaÂ®), or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Place water and red beans in a pressure cooker. Close cooker securely and place pressure regulator over vent according to manufacturer's instructions. Adjust heat until regulator is gently rocking. Cook at high pressure for 30 minutes. Let pressure release naturally according to manufacturer's instructions, 5 to 10 minutes; unlock and remove lid.
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the water and beans from the pressure cooker. Stir in sazon seasoning and salt. Reduce heat to low; cook until flavors combine, about 3 minutes. Add rice. Cover and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes.
