Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
Dash salt
2 cups milk
3 egg yolks, beaten
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups flaked coconut, divided
1 (9 inch) pie shell, baked
MERINGUE:
3 egg whites
6 tablespoons sugar

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine flour an sugar; add salt, milk and egg yolks. Mix well. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is thickened and bubbly. Reduce heat; cook and stir 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla and 1 cup coconut. Pour hot filling into pie shell.
For meringue, beat egg whites in a mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar until mixture forms stiff glossy peaks and sugar dissolves. Spread meringue over hot filling. Sprinkle with remaining coconut. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden. Cool. Store in the refrigerator.
