Ingredients:
2/3 cup pecan pieces
1 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 cups quartered fresh button mushrooms
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic
2 teaspoons butter
1 1/4 cups water
1 (5.8 ounce) box couscous
1 (8.5 ounce) bottle sun-dried tomato pesto
1/3 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Spread the pecan pieces onto a baking sheet and place in a cold oven.
Heat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) to begin roasting the pecans. Roast until aromatic, 20 to 30 minutes.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the mushrooms, onion, and garlic in the melted butter until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
Return the skillet to the heat. Melt 2 teaspoons butter in the skillet. Stir the water into the butter; bring to a boil. Put the couscous in a glass bowl; pour the butter and water mixture over the couscous. Immediately cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow to sit until the couscous absorbs all of the moisture, 7 to 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Stir the toasted pecans, the mushroom mixture, the pesto, and Parmesan cheese through the couscous. Season with salt and pepper to serve.

Description: 
Roasted pecans, sauteed onion, mushrooms, and garlic marry beautifully with Parmesan, sun-dried tomato pesto, and couscous. If you wish, stir in cooked chicken and more veggies to make it a complete meal. I regularly add shelled edamame for a boost of meatless protein.
