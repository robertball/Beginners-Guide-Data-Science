Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups uncooked white rice
2 cups chicken stock/broth
1/8 tsp turmeric
1/2 tsp onion powder
1 medium onion chopped
1-2 Tbls oil

Directions:
Rinse uncooked rice under running cold water.  Heat oil in large frying pan over medium high heat.  Add uncooked rice, chopped onion, and tumeric.  Stir around in the pan for about 3-5 minutes.  The mixure should turn a very nice bright yellow color and become fragrant.  Pour in broth, bring down to a simmer, and cover.  Once liquid is gone, remove from heat and leave covered for about 15-20 minutes.  The rice will be very slightly under cooked but leaving it in the pan will allow the rice to continue to steam and soften.  Once you are satisfied with the steaming, stir in the onion powder.  The rice should be loose and not sticky. The rice is ready to eat. If you are planning on stir frying, please place it in the refrigerator to cool it down.  I portion the rice down to stir fry and add a few frozen peas, carrots, and scrambled eggs.
