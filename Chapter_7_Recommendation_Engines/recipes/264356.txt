Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup chopped rhubarb
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup wheat bran
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons molasses
1 1/2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin pan with paper liners.
Combine flour, rhubarb, brown sugar, wheat bran, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl.
Mix applesauce, oil, molasses, vinegar, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Pour over flour mixture. Slowly mix until a thick batter forms. Divide batter among the muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.
