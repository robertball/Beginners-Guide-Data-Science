Description: 
Great for the holidays, these pretty cookies make a wonderful gift too!

These nut cookies are shaped into balls, baked, and then immediately dipped into icing sugar (confectioner's sugar) before being left to cool.

My kids and I love this recipe more than any other cookie recipe - even more than chocolate chip!
