Ingredients:
1/3 cup olive oil
4 carrots, sliced
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 small head cabbage, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 small yellow potatoes, cut into bite-size cubes
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Saute carrots in hot oil until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add onion; saute until onion is fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Season carrot mixture with turmeric, cumin, pepper, and ground ginger; stir and let the seasonings toast until fragrant, about 1 minutes.
Stir cabbage and garlic into the carrot mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage wilts, about 10 minutes.
Stir potatoes into the cabbage mixture. Pour water into the pot and stir. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer, stirring every 10 minutes, until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is my favorite Ethiopian vegetable dish. I created it by mixing together a few different recipes I found. Hope you like it! Serve as a side dish with injera and other Ethiopian dishes. I recommend Doro Wat - an Ethiopian chicken dish.
