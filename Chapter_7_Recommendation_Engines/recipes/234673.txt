Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup chopped dried cranberries
1/3 cup butter, melted
1/2 orange, zested and juiced
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon brandy, or to taste
15 (2 inch) sweetened pastry tart shells
15 pecan halves
15 fresh cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix brown sugar, chopped pecans, dried cranberries, butter, orange zest, orange juice, egg, and brandy together in a bowl.
Arrange tart shells on a baking sheet and spoon pecan-cranberry filling into each shell about 2/3 full. Add 1 pecan half and 1 fresh cranberry to each tart.
Bake in the preheated oven until tart shells are lightly browned and filling is bubbling, 18 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
These are the product of early morning experimentation modifying an old butter tart recipe that I've been using for years. They are a combination of sweet and tart, look beautiful, and disappear very quickly!
