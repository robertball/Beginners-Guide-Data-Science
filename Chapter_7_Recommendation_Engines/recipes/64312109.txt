Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup(s) coffee, decaffeinated strongly brewed, chilled
1/2 cup(s) milk, fat-free
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon sugar substitute
1/4 cup(s) whipped dessert topping, fat-free
1 pinch cinnamon, ground for garnish (optional)
2 whole cinnamon sticks for garnish (optional)

Directions:
In a pitcher, combine coffee, milk, vanilla, and sugar substitute; stir well.
Fill 4 (10-ounce) glasses with ice. Pour coffee mixture over ice. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the whipped topping into each glass. Stir gently so that some topping mixes with coffee and some remains at the top of the glass. Garnish each with a pinch of ground cinnamon and a cinnamon stick, if using.
