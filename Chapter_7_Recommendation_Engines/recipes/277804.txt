Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.
Whisk egg whites, yogurt, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour into the prepared dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until starting to set, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, saute mushrooms and onion in a pan until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Spread mushroom mixture, sausage crumbles, and tomato over the parbaked egg layer. Cover with Cheddar cheese.
Continue baking until eggs are set and cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes.
