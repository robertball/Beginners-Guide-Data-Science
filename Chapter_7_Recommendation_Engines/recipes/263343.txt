Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
2 cups cracker crumbs
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon dried minced onion, divided
1 tablespoon garlic salt, divided
1 1/2 sticks butter, melted
2 cups milk
4 eggs

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain thoroughly.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly butter a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Layer 1/2 the cooked spaghetti into the bottom of the prepared pan. Sprinkle 1/2 the cracker crumbs, 1/2 the Parmesan cheese, 1/2 the parsley, 1/2 the minced onion, and 1/2 the garlic salt on top. Pour in 1/2 of the melted butter. Repeat with remaining spaghetti, cracker crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, minced onion, garlic salt, and butter.
Mix milk and eggs together in a bowl. Pour over the spaghetti mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 30 minutes. Cut pie in squares.

Description: 
I absolutely love how easily this spaghetti pie jazzes up a simple Italian meal. This is my ultimate dish I make whenever guests come over. Every guest has requested this recipe. Very versatile to suit your style/taste. You can halve the recipe and put it in the 8x8 pan. I usually don't measure the ingredients for the layers; I just eye it to my taste. I like the sauce cooked separately, to allow for flexibility in serving. Feel free to experiment !
