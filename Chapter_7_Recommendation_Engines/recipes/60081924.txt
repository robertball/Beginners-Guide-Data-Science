Ingredients:
2 cups vanilla wafer crumbs
2-4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 (14 ounce) package individually wrapped KRAFT caramels
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
1 cup chopped pecans
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix crumbs and melted butter. Press into the bottom of a 13x9.  Bake for 10 min and cool.
In a heavy saucepan over low heat, melt the caramels with the evaporated milk. Heat and stir frequently until smooth. Pour caramel sauce into crust, and top with pecans.  Chill.
In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar and vanilla; beat well until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Melt the chocolate, and blend into cream cheese mixture. Pour chocolate batter over pecans.
Bake in preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until filling is set. Let cool at room temp for a while.  Chill in refrigerator for 4 hours, or overnight.
