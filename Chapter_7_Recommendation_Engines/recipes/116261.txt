Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons shortening
4 teaspoons water
FILLING:
1 cup thinly sliced peeled apples
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
TOPPING:
1/2 cup butterscotch chips
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour and salt; cut in shortening until crumbly. Gradually add water, tossing with a fork until dough forms a ball. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Shape into two balls; roll into two 6-in. circles. Transfer to two 4-1/2-in. pie plates. Trim pastry 1/2 in. beyond edge; flute edges. Set aside.
Place apples in a bowl; sprinkle with the lemon juice, flour, sugar, cinnamon and salt. Toss to combine. Spoon into pastry shell. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven.
For topping, melt butterscotch chips and butter in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat; stir in flour with a fork until crumbly. Sprinkle over top of apple mixture. Bake 15-20 minutes longer or until apples are tender.
