Ingredients:
1/2 cup coconut flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 eggs, separated
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 cup coconut milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon coconut oil, or as needed

Directions:
Combine flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat egg yolks and butter together in a bowl until smooth; add coconut milk and vanilla extract and beat until smooth. Stir milk mixture into flour mixture until batter is evenly combined.
Beat egg whites in a bowl until foamy, about 2 minutes; gently fold into batter.
Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls into the skillet and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
I love breakfast. But when you're going gluten-free, wheat-free, or paleo, there aren't a lot of options. This recipe rocks when you need pancakes to save you from a blah breakfast morning. Yes, you can need pancakes. Great with syrup or fruit sauce. Let them cool and spread with cashew butter, sunflower butter, or even preserves for tea!
