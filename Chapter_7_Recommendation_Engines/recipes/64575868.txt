Ingredients:
1 egg white
1/2 cup low fat cottage cheese
1 tsp vanilla extract
4 tbsp coconut oil
1 cup Gluten Free oat flour
1/3 cup Dutch cocoa powder
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup dairy free mini chocolate chips
optional: 2 tbsp powdered sugar for dusting

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Prepare a baking sheet with parchment or slip mat paper.
Using a food processor or blender, mix together the egg white, cottage cheese, vanilla extract, salt & coconut oil.
Then add the baking powder, baking soda, cocoa powder and oat flour. Blend until the ingredients are fully combined.
Transfer the batter to a mixing bowl, add the chocolate chips and fold them into the batter to disperse them.
Using an ice cream scoop, drop scoops of the batter onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake 10-12 minutes at 375 degrees F or until the center of the cookies are firm and set.
Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool 5 minutes. While cookies are cooling, sprinkle powdered sugar on top to set. Devour!
