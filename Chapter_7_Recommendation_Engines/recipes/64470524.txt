Ingredients:
1 8 oz. pkg of Cream Cheese (softened)
1 8 oz. pkg of Non-Dairy Whipped Topping (thawed)
1/2 c. powdered sugar
1 tsp. vanilla
1 box of vanilla wafers
1 handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 egg-white beaten
2 T. sugar
1 kale leaf

Directions:
Combine cream cheese, whipped topping, vanilla and powdered sugar. Blend until smooth and fluffy.
Lay out vanilla wafers with the flat sides down, placing a few chocolate chips on top of each wafer.
Fill an icing bag with the cream cheese mixture, and gently squeeze the mixture on top of the chocolate chips and wafers. The chocolate chips should be a hidden surprise...
For your hipster friends and fellow-Gishers, garnish with sugared kale and rainbow sprinkles.
pinch off a few small pieces of the kale leaf and dip it in the beaten egg-white. Put 2 T. sugar into a small bowl and add the egg-white covered kale leaf into the sugar, coating as desired.  Add a few sprinkles and dig in!

Description: 
This is one of our favorite new recipes -- especially for the summer as they are no-bake.  The hipsters love the sugared kale garnish!  I can hardly keep them away :D
