Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup almond flour
1 tablespoon cocoa powder
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon powdered baking stevia*
Filling:
1 cup coconut butter
2 small ripe avocados
3 tablespoons powdered baking stevia
1 teaspoon peppermint extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon matcha powder
Topping:
3 tablespoons coconut oil
3 tablespoons cocoa powder
Â¼ teaspoon peppermint extract
6 drops liquid stevia

Directions:
Line an 8x8 baking pan with parchment paper.
Mix crust ingredients together and press into parchment lined pan.
Freeze for 15 minutes, while making filling.
If coconut butter is hard, gently warm in a microwave or over a double boiler just until softened.
Using an electric mixer, combine filling ingredients.
Pour and spread over crust ingredients and freeze while making topping.
Gently warm coconut oil and mix well with cocoa, peppermint, and stevia.
Spread over chilled bars and refrigerate for 30 minutes or overnight.
**Store in refrigerator; these will soften/melt at room temperature.  Consume or freeze within 24 hours to avoid losing the bright green color.
*If preferred, use any 1-to-1 low-carb sweetener.

Description: 
These bars are reminiscent of thin mints in flavor.  Keep refrigerated to maintain texture and enjoy right away after firm.  They're bright and refreshing and full of fats but low in carbs.  They actually come together very quickly!
