Description: 
I searched on the internet for braised cucumbers after watching 'Julie and Julia' for the umpteenth time. There weren't many recipes and they were all different. I took the information from all the recipes and meshed them together, deleting some ingredients and adding others. The dish turned out wonderful. This is a side dish that I have served with quite a few different types of main dishes. It seems to go with almost any type of food.
