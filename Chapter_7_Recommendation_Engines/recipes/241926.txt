Ingredients:
3 cups water
1 cup half-and-half
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup stone-ground grits
8 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup butter
1 pound bulk pork sausage
3 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1 orange bell pepper, chopped small
1 red bell pepper, chopped small

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bring water, half-and-half, and salt to a boil in a saucepan; slowly whisk in grits. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 20 minutes. Stir in Cheddar cheese and butter until melted. Cool.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Beat eggs and milk together in a bowl. Stir sausage, egg mixture, orange bell pepper, and red bell pepper into grits mixture. Pour grits mixture into prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, 45 to 60 minutes.

Description: 
Every time I make this someone wants the recipe. It is great if you have overnight guests. Make it ahead and enjoy the morning with them. Check for doneness by inserting a knife in casserole. If it comes out clean you are ready to serve. This is a great brunch recipe served with biscuits, sweet rolls, and fresh fruit.
