Ingredients:
2 tablespoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
8 ears corn, unhusked
4 limes
1/2 cup crumbled Cotija cheese (queso anejado)

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix together chili powder, kosher salt, and cayenne in a small bowl. Set mixed seasonings aside.
Remove most of the silk while leaving 2 to 3 layers of husk on each ear of corn.
Cook corn on the preheated grill until husks are slightly charred, turning every 3 to 4 minutes, for 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool slightly. Remove husks carefully, leaving stems on as handles.
Squeeze 1/2 lime over each ear of corn. Sprinkle each with mixed seasonings to taste and top generously with Cotija cheese.
