Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 slices EARTH GRAINS® Potato bread
24 fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons minced green onions
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 cup diced cooked crabmeat
1 egg, beaten
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
3/4 cup reduced fat Monterey Jack cheese
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup dry white wine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray. In a food processor, process bread to make small crumbs; you should have 1/2 cup fresh crumbs.
Remove stems from mushrooms. Set aside caps. Finely chop stems.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the chopped stems, green onions, and garlic, and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Stir in lemon juice, crabmeat, bread crumbs, egg, dill weed and 1/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese. Thoroughly blend the mixture.
Stuff mushroom caps generously with the green onion and crabmeat mixture. Brush the outside of the caps with remaining olive oil, and arrange in pan. Top with remaining Monterey Jack cheese. Pour wine into the pan around the mushrooms.
Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 15 to 20 minutes, until cheese is melted and lightly browned. Serve warm.
