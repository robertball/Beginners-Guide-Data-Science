Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch rainbow chard, stems removed and leaves chopped
3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 ounces chevre (goat cheese)
8 zucchini blossoms, stamen removed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a pan over medium heat; add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in chard and cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Add basil, salt, and pepper, and cook until basil is soft, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool completely, about 15 minutes. Place cooled chard mixture between 2 towels and press to remove excess moisture.
Stir chevre and chard mixture together in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Fill zucchini blossoms about 3/4 full with the goat chevre mixture, and pinch the ends closed. Place filled blossoms in a roasting pan; drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Roast in the preheated oven until blossoms are hot, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Oven roasting the squash blossoms, instead of frying, makes this a nice light summer dish. Pick your squash blossoms early in the day, and store in the fridge until ready to use. Top with some fresh basil pesto for added yum!
