Ingredients:
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 8 oz. can tomato sauce
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 slices bacon

1 - 16 oz. can large butter beans

Directions:
In a large bowl combine the brown sugar, tomato sauce, dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, vinegar and salt, set aside.  Cook the bacon until crisp, reserving one tablespoon of bacon fat.  Drain bacon, cool and crumble, and add to sauce mixture.  Saute the onion in the reserved bacon fat until translucent and add to sauce mixture.  Rinse and drain all beans except the baked beans.  Add all the beans to the sauce mixture and thoroughly combine.  Pour beans into a 9x13" baking dish that has been sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.  Bake at 350 degrees for one hour.  Allow to rest 10-15 minutes before serving.
