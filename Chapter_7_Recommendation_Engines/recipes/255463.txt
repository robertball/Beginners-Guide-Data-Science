Ingredients:
1 cup bread flour
1 cup spelt flour
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1 tablespoon quinoa
1 tablespoon sunflower seeds
1 tablespoon millet
1 tablespoon oats
1 tablespoon flax seeds
3/4 cup warm milk
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons bread machine yeast

Directions:
Mix bread flour, spelt flour, brown sugar, sesame seeds, quinoa, sunflower seeds, millet, oats, and flax seeds together in a bowl.
Combine milk and oil in the bread pan of a bread machine; add flour mixture. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture; pour in yeast. Knead dough according to manufacturer's instructions.
Turn out dough on a floured work surface. Punch down and separate into 16 pieces. Flatten into 5-inch diameter flatbreads.
Place flatbreads on 2 baking sheets; cover with plastic wrap. Let sit in a warm place until risen, about 1 hour. Remove plastic wrap.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly; slice in half.

Description: 
We love the wonderful nutty flavor of this bread and wanted to replace the sandwich rounds I was still buying. When sliced, they're the perfect size for a tuna sandwich or for toasting with butter and jam. Store in a plastic bag.
