Description: 
When we went over to Edinburgh for Hogmanay, our friends made this for us, along with a slice of haggis! This is a traditional Scottish sidedish, and goes well with a beef roast or chicken.  It is also a great way to use an often overlooked vegetable: the swede (a.k.a the yellow turnip, the rutabaga, or the swedish turnip).
