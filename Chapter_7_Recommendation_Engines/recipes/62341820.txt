Ingredients:
1½ cups Graham cracker crumbs
½ cup margarine or butter
1 cup peanut butter chips. Can use only semi-sweet chocolate chips if you do not have peanut butter chips.  Butterscotch chips will also work.
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 can Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk
1 tsp vanilla
Dabs of peanut butter
½ cups chopped pecans optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350º.
Melt margin and add vanilla.  Pour into a 9 x 13 baking dish.
Sprinkle Graham Cracker crumbs as evenly as you can over melted butter.
Pour Sweetened condensed milk over graham cracker crumbs…again as evenly as you can.
Sprinkle chips over top and slightly press (I used the back of a spatula).
Then, I put a few dabs of peanut butter on top.
Bake ~ 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.
Cool and cut.
