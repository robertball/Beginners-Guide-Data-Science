Ingredients:
1/4 cup honey
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons whole-grain Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon lemon juice
4 (4 ounce) fillets swai fish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Mix honey, mayonnaise, olive oil, mustard, and lemon juice together in a bowl.
Place each fish fillet on separate pieces of aluminum foil. Drizzle honey sauce over each fish fillet. Gently wrap the aluminum foil around each coated fish fillet, crimping the foil together over the top to seal into a packet.
Bake fillets in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 13 minutes. Place one fish fillet on each serving plate and top with leftover sauce from foil packet.

Description: 
Did you know that Basa can be as little as $3.99 a pound at most grocery stores? Yup and this hidden treasure is the most delicious, tender, fish I have ever had. It goes well with all fish recipes and is a great substitute for expensive fish. This recipe was so good my family wanted it again the very next day! Its sweet and tangy and just down right delicious.
