Ingredients:
2 cups brown or green lentils, uncooked
8 cups water or vegetable broth
1 1/2 pounds large gold or red potatoes, cut     into large cubes
8 ounces mushrooms, halved or quartered
1 large onion, chopped
2 large carrots, thickly sliced
2 ribs celery, chopped
2 bay leaves
2 vegetable bouillon cubes or 2 tsp. Better Than Bouillon, optional (use only if water is used instead of broth)
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon low sodium soy sauce, coconut aminos, or tamari
2 teaspoons dried thyme leaves
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/2 teaspoon rubbed sage
freshly ground pepper, to taste

Directions:
Pick over the lentils and rinse well. Put them into the pressure cooker along with the water or broth.
Start the water or broth heating in the pressure cooker while you chop the vegetables. Add all ingredients to the cooker and stir. Seal the cooker and bring to high pressure. Cook at high pressure for 10 minutes for electric pressure cooker or 8 minutes stovetop. Turn off heat and allow to sit for 15 minutes before using a quick-release method to release the pressure. (If you donâ€™t have a pressure cooker, you can simply simmer this covered on the stove until the lentils are tender, about an hour; add water as necessary.)
Check to make sure the lentils and potatoes are tender; if not, cook, covered but not at pressure, until done, adding water if it seems too thick. Remove the bay leaves, and check the seasonings, adding more poultry seasoning and salt, if desired. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley, if you like.
