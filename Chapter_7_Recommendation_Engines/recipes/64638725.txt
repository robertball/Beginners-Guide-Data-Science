Ingredients:
1 small bottle hot sauce
a few drops liquid dish detergent
1 gallon water

Directions:
Homemade hot pepper sprays are often effective squirrel deterrents. Mix a small bottle of hot sauce and a few drops of mild liquid dish detergent with 1 gallon of water, then pour the mixture into a spray bottle. Although dish detergent is optional, it helps the hot pepper spray stick to the leaves. Spray plants as needed, then reapply after watering or a rainfall.

Description: 
Repel squirrels naturally. Hot spices provide an extra benefit in the garden because they kill many insect pests. However, capsaicin also kills honeybees, ladybugs and other helpful insects. Use spices and pepper sprays carefully, and avoid using the substances if you notice beneficial insects in your garden.
