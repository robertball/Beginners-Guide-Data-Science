Ingredients:
3 lb. whole chicken (thawed)
16 oz. bag frozen brocoli cuts
2 cups dry white rice
10.5 oz. can cream of mushroom soup

Directions:
Remove gizzards and rinse chicken.
In large pot cover chicken with water, add salt and pepper.
Cover, bring to boil then lower heat to just a boil for 90 minutes or until meat is falling off bone.
Remove chicken from pot and let cool. Strain broth to remove all chicken parts.
After chicken cools enough to handle remove all meat from skin and bones. (I use about half the meat and save the rest for another meal).
Cook rice as directed on bag but use broth instead of water and butter.
Boil brocoli in broth until tender, drain. (Broth can be retained for another meal).
Once rice is done mix in can of mushroom soup and add brocoli and chicken.
Stir together and serve.
