Ingredients:
6 whole tomatoes
1 white onion, peeled and quartered
6 garlic cloves, peeled
3 jalapenos, stems removed
1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped
1 lime, juiced
1 teaspoon latin seasoning, or cumin
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne, optional
1-2 teaspoons salt to taste
1-2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Line roasting pan with tin foil.  Clean tomatoes and place them in a row on the pan.  On another small square of tin foil place jalapenos, onion and garlic; drizzle oil evenly and fold tinfoil closed.  Place on roasting pan also.
Pre-heat oven to low broil.  Place pan under broiler.  After about 5-7 minutes, or when tomatoes begin to char black, turn them.  Broil them for another 5-7 minutes.  Remove pan from oven.
Gently peel the skin off the tomatoes and place them onto a cutting board chopping them roughly.  Place them into a bowl.  Unwrap the onion, garlic and jalapenos.  Mince the garlic and add to bowl.  Chop the onion into small peices and add to bowl.  Chop jalapenos into small peices, remove seeds for less heat or leave in for more heat.  Add to bowl.  Mix together.  Add the lime juice, cilantro, latin seasoning, white pepper, cayenne pepper and salt.  Mix throughly and place in fridge for two hours to let the flavors come together.

Description: 
This is just like the red salsa they serve with your chips at the mexican restaurant.  No canned ingredients here, use fresh veggies from your garden.  Roasting the vegetables adds a great taste.
