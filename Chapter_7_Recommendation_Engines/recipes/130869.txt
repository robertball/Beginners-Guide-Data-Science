Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil from anchovies
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 cup white wine
1 1/2 pounds grape tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can stewed tomatoes, with juice
6 anchovy fillets
1/2 teaspoon salt
black pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon chopped parsley
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 small bay leaf

Directions:
Heat the anchovy oil in a saucepan over medium heat, stir in garlic, onions, and green pepper; cook for a few minutes until the onion softens and turns translucent. Pour in the wine, and simmer until reduced by half. Meanwhile, place the grape tomatoes, stewed tomatoes, and anchovies into the bowl of a blender; puree until smooth.
Season with salt, pepper, basil, parsley, oregano, and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 1 hour. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.

Description: 
This is a rich marinara with white wine and anchovies.  It's rather soupy, so simmer it as long as it takes to reach your desired consistency.
