Ingredients:
4 cups of collard greens with liquid (or any green); 8 cups water; additional 6 cups water; 1 cup Turkey drippings (fat and liquid); Turkey bones (any that are left); 2 cups cooked black eyed peas (or any bean); 3 cups shredded Turkey (white or dark meat); 1/2 cup mashed potatoes; 1/2 cup green bean casserole; 1/2 cup stuffing; 3 tablespoons cranberries or sauce (optional); 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional); salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Put greens in a large stock pot with 8 cups water and Turkey drippings and bring to a boil. Once boiling add Turkey bones. 2. Reduce to medium heat at a brisk simmer for 1 hour (longer if you have time). Stirring occasionally. 3. Remove any bones and skin from soup pot and throw away. Add black eyed peas, shredded Turkey and additional water. Stir and continue simmering for another hour. 4. In blender or food processor add green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, cranberries, stuffing and spices. Mix until blended. Add to soup pot and stir. This acts as a thickening agent. Simmer for another half an hour. 5. Turn off heat and you have a whole Southern Thanksgiving in every bite! 6. Happy Black Friday!

Description: 
I wanted to make a soup that included every part of Thanksgiving dinner. So, I did that on Black Friday and it turned out better (almost) than dinner the night before! Come home from a cold day of shopping to a nice warm bowl of soup that will make you feel like you are in the warmth of the South! My husband asks for it every year. Good for football parties, too!
