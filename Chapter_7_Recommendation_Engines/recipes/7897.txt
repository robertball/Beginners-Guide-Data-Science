Ingredients:
2/3 cup raisins
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
2 cups applesauce
1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place raisins in a small saucepan, and cover with boiling water. Soak for 5 minutes, then drain. Grease and flour a 9 inch tube pan.
Sift together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Blend in the eggs, then the applesauce. Beat in the flour mixture. Stir in raisins and walnuts. Spread batter evenly into prepared tube pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 80 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely; chill.

Description: 
This is a bit of an unusual cake, but great for Christmas. The chocolate mixed with raisins, applesauce, and spices gives a nice texture with a lot less work than plum pudding itself.
