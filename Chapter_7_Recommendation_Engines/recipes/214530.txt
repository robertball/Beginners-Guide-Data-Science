Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) beef tri-tip steaks, cut 1 inch thick
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon honey
Salt (optional)
3 cups tri-color coleslaw mix (with green cabbage, red cabbage and carrots)
1 Granny Smith apple
8 medium whole wheat flour tortillas (8 to 10-inch diameter), warmed

Directions:
Combine cinnamon and pepper; press evenly onto beef steaks. Heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Place steaks in skillet; cook 9 to 12 minutes for medium rare to medium doneness, turning occasionally.
Combine hoisin sauce and honey in large bowl. Carve steaks into thin slices; season with salt, if desired. Add steak slices, coleslaw mix and apple to hoisin mixture; toss to coat.
Place equal amounts of beef mixture down center of each tortilla, leaving 1-1/2-inch border on right and left sides. Fold bottom edge up over filling. Fold right and left sides to center, overlapping edges; secure with wooden picks, if necessary.
