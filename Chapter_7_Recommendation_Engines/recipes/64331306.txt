Title:
Zucchini, hazelnut, and millet croquettes Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 cups millet, cooked (in broth)
1 medium-sized zucchini, grated very fine (about 1 cup) or other veg like cabbage
1/2 cup hazelnuts â€“ ground or finely chopped
1 chia "egg"
1 plump clove garlic
1 large handful fresh basil, washed and chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425. Use two non-stick cooking sheets or line with parchment.
Grabbing it in small handfuls, squeeze as much moisture as you can out of the zucchini. Put it in a large bowl, and add all of the other ingredients. Mix everything together well.
Taking small handfuls, make small patties and flatten them onto the sheets.
Bake until crispy and golden brown, turning occasionally to cook both sides. Should take about 20 minutes all together!
