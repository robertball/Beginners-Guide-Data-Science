Ingredients:
1/2 cup dried porcini mushrooms
1 cup boiling water
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 onions, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup ground walnuts
1 bay leaf
salt and pepper to taste
2 pounds red snapper fillets
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Soak the porcini mushrooms in the water for 30 seconds. Drain, reserving the liquid, and chop.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat the olive oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the nutmeg, walnuts, bay leaf, mushrooms, and mushroom liquid; bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce reduces and darkens, 5 to 10 minutes. Press the snapper fillets into the flour and shake off the excess. Place the fillets into the pan and cover with the sauce.
Place the skillet in the preheated oven and bake until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley to serve.
