Ingredients:
1/2 c Crisco Butter Shortening
1/2 c Creamy Peanut Butter
1/2 c firmly packed light brown sugar
1/2 c white sugar
1 large egg
2 T milk
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 3/4 c all purpose flour
1tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
Sugar for rolling

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees
Cream together shortening, peanut butter, and both sugars.  Add egg, milk and vanilla.  Beat well.  Combine dry ingredients and add to wet ingredients slowly.  Form into 1 inch balls.  Roll balls in sugar.  Place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake about 12 minutes or until lightly browned.  Top each cookie immediately with an unwrapped hersey's kiss, pressing down firmly so that the cookie cracks around the edge.  Remove from cookie sheets to cool.
