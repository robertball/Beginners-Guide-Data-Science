1 large sweet red pepper(s), or other bell pepper, chopped
1 medium uncooked sweet potato(es), peeled, chopped into 1/4-inch pieces
3 clove(s) (medium) garlic clove(s), finely chopped
2 Tbsp chili powder, or to taste  (1-1/2 T was enough for me)
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp table salt, or to taste
1 tsp canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, minced
14 1/2 oz canned diced tomatoes, with juice

15 oz canned black beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup(s) avocado, diced
4 Tbsp reduced-fat sour cream
1 medium uncooked scallion(s), chopped

Directions:
In a large heavy pot or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat. When oil shimmers, add onion and bell pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir in potato, garlic, chili powder, cumin, coriander, oregano and salt; cook for 1 minute. Add chipotle, tomatoes and their juice, and broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
Stir in beans and simmer until potatoes are fully cooked, another 8 to 10 minutes.
Serve topped with avocado, sour cream, scallions and lime wedges.
Serving size: about 1 1/2 c chili, 2 Tbsp avocado, and 1 Tbsp sour cream per serving.
