Ingredients:
2 cups roasted peanuts
1 1/2 cups unsalted soy nuts (roasted soybeans)
3 tablespoons honey
5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Place all ingredients in a food processor with the knife blade; process 3 to 4 minutes. Add more oil for a smoother spread, less for a crunchier spread.

Description: 
You don't need to wonder what's in the peanut butter when you make your own. This recipe, sent to me by a pair of USA WEEKEND readers, is great-tasting and health-promoting. Soybeans and peanuts help control blood sugar and contain antioxidants, as do olive oil and honey.
