Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 egg
1-1/2 teaspoons almond extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
Frosting:
6 tablespoons butter, softened
3 cups confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 to 4 tablespoons 2% milk

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream butter and confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy; beat in egg and extracts.  Combine flour and salt; add to creamed mixture and mix well; chill 1-2 hours
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to 1/8-in. thickness.  Cut with floured 2-1/2-in. cookie cutters.  Place on greased baking sheets.  Bake 7-9 minutes or until lightly browned.  Remove to wire racks to cool
For frosting, in a small bowl, combine butter, sugar, vanilla and enough milk to achieve a spreading consistency.  If desired, tint with food coloring.  Frost cookies; decorate as desired.

Description: 
This cookie is part of my 12 Days of Christmas: Holiday and Celebration Cookies from Around the World collection that I make every year to give as gifts for the holiday season. The sugar cookie originates from Europe (Germany).  Settlers from Germany brought the recipe with them to North America and at one time these cookies were called Nazareth cookies. These are the best sugar cookies I've ever made. Thought I would share the recipe for the holiday season!
