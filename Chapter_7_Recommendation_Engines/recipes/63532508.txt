Ingredients:
•  1 pint jar
•  2 tbsp. whole mustard seeds
•  1 tbsp. whole allspice
•  2 tsp. whole coriander/or carraway seeds
•  1 to 2 tsp. red pepper flakes depending on heat   desired
•  1 tsp. dried ground ginger
•  2 crumbled bay leaves
•  2 medium cinnamon stick
•  6 whole cloves
6-7 whole cloves of garlic

Directions:
1. Clean and completely dry a medium-sized airtight jar (12-oz. or smaller). Thoroughly eliminate all residual odors from the jar and lid that may have accumulated from prior use.
2 Measure whole mustard seeds and whole allspice into jar, along with coriander/ or caraway seeds and red pepper flakes. Shake well to mix.
3 Add dried ground ginger to mixed seeds and pepper flakes and shake again.
4 Sprinkle a crumbled bay leaf and whole cloves over these ingredients.
5 Break a medium cinnamon stick in half and drop both pieces into the jar. Dry sticks may crumble when snapped; if this happens, simply add all broken shards.
6 Drop in a whole clove of garlic into each jar of cucumbers as the final spice element to this blend.
7 Use your mix immediately or seal the jar tightly for storage until use up to a month later.
