Ingredients:
1 pound dried pinto beans
2 ham hocks
1 large onion, diced
water to cover
7 ounces linguica sausage (such as SilvaÂ®), sliced
1 small head cabbage - quartered, cored, and thinly sliced
1 large potato, cubed
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place beans in a large pot and cover with water. Soak 8 hours to overnight.
Drain and rinse beans and return them to the pot. Add ham hocks and onion. Add enough water to cover ham hocks. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until beans are tender, 1 to 2 hours.
Remove ham hocks from soup and separate the meat from the bones. Return meat to the pot and discard bones. Add sausage, cabbage, potato, and tomato sauce to the pot. Bring to a simmer and cook until cabbage is softened, 30 to 45 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
