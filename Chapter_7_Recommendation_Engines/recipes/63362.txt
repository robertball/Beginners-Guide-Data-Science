Ingredients:
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup cooking sherry
3/4 teaspoon white sugar
3/4 teaspoon ground ginger
2 tablespoons cornstarch
3/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 large green bell pepper, sliced
1 large onion, quartered
1/2 cup whole cashews

Directions:
Whisk together the soy sauce, sherry, sugar, ginger, cornstarch, crushed red pepper, and garlic powder in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add the chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.
Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the bell pepper and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Place onion and bell pepper on a plate and set aside. Reduce heat to medium-low, stir chicken and marinade into the same skillet. Cook the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. Stir in cashews and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the onion and bell pepper, cooking until heated through.
