Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups chopped walnuts
1 cup flaked coconut
1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix
1 (3.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix
1 cup water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x15 inch pan. Sprinkle walnuts and coconut evenly over bottom of pan.
In a large bowl, stir together cake mix and pudding mix. Make a well in the center and pour in water, oil, and eggs. Beat on low speed until blended. Scrape bowl, and beat 4 minutes on medium speed. Pour batter into prepared pan. Set aside.
In a saucepan, combine cream cheese and butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until melted and smooth. Stir in confectioners' sugar. Pour cream cheese mixture in rows (lengthwise) over the top of cake mix. Using the tip of a knife, swirl the batter to create a marbled effect.
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.

Description: 
If you like sinful desserts, then this is for you. My husband just loves this cake and cannot get enough of it. You may use pecans instead of walnuts if you prefer.
