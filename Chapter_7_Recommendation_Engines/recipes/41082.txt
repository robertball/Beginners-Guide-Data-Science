Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups bread flour or all-purpose flour
1 package active dry yeast
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup milk
1/3 cup shortening
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup packaged instant mashed potato flakes
1 egg

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl stir together 1 cup of the flour and the yeast. In a medium saucepan heat and stir the water, milk, shortening, sugar, and salt just until warm (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F) and shortening almost melts. Stir in the potato flakes. Let stand for 1 minute. Add milk mixture to dry mixture along with the egg. Beat with an electric mixer on low to medium speed for 30 seconds, scraping the sides of the bowl. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, stir in as much of the remaining flour as you can.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes total). Shape dough into a ball. Place dough in a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease surface of the dough. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double in size (about 1-1/4 hours).
Punch dough down. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough in half. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Lightly grease two 8x8x2-inch or 9x9x2-inch baking pans.
On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion of dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut dough with a floured 2-1/2-inch round cutter. Place rolls in prepared baking pans. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly double in size (30 to 40 minutes).
Bake in a 375 degree F oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden. Immediately remove rolls from pans. Cool the rolls on wire racks.

For oven-fresh rolls without a lot of last-minute fuss, shape the dough in advance and let it rise in the fridge until the dinner hour approaches.
