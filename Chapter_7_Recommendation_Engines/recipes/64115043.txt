Ingredients:
1 pound whole wild plums (or pitted regular plums)
3-4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon fresh ginger root, minced
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper (use less if you like)
1 tsp soy sauce (or salt to taste)
1/4 teaspoon shallot or onion salt (optional)
As needed: sugar or other sweetener and/or vinegar

Directions:
Pick over the plums to remove any stems or debris and rinse them well. Place in a saucepan and add water just to barely cover them. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until skins have burst and plums are soft, about 20-30 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes.
Place a colander over a bowl. Put the plums in the colander and press with the back of a spoon to squeeze out the juice. (You could also do this in a cheesecloth bag.) Allow the plums to drain until all juice is removed.
Heat a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute the minced garlic and ginger in a tablespoon of water for 2 minutes, adding more water if needed to prevent sticking. Add the plum juice and the remaining ingredients. Bring to a low boil and simmer until mixture reduces and thickens by almost half. (It took mine about 15 minutes.) Taste to see if any sauce is sweet or sour enough; if not add sweetener or vinegar to taste.
