1 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 c butter
1 c brown sugar

Directions:
Mix together 1 cup sugar and cinnamon.
Quarter the biscuits with pizza cutter.  Dip in water after each cut to keep the biscuits from getting too sticky.  Dip biscuits into sugar mixture, and place in a heavily greased bundt pan.

Description: 
I gave this recipe to my daughter who has 6 children.  They love this, and it is so simple they can make it themselves which they love to do.  If desired, a thin mixture of powder sugar frosting can be poured over warm biscuits.Modified from: Monkey Bread V
