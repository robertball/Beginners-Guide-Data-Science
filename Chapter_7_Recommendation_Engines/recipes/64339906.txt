Ingredients:
1 1/2 c. all purpose flour
1/2 c. shortening
3/4 t. salt
4-5 T ice water

Directions:
Mix salt and flour together with a fork.
Cut in flour with fork and fingers--sift the flour and shortening through your fingers.  No need to use pastry cutter. Mixture will have very small lumps, but look uniform.
Add water 2 T. at a time, stirring until bowl sides are getting clean. When it's ready, it should stick together and feel like Play-Doh.  Form into a ball and roll out on a floured surface.  When it's in the pie plate and edges are crimped, even if it will be baked with a filling (like pumpkin) prick it generously before baking.
