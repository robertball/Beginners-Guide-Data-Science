Ingredients:
1 1/4 c flour
1/4 t baking soda
1/2 c (1 stick) margarine or butter, softened
1/2 c loosely packed brown sugar
1/2 c finely chopped walnuts
1/2 t vanilla extract
1 1/2 T cornstarch
1/2 t ground cinnamon
1/2 t ground ginger
1/4 t ground nutmeg
1 scant cup granulated sugar
1 can (15 oz) pumpkin
1 1/2 c light cream
2 eggs
2 T molasses

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a large bowl, combine the flour and baking soda.  Add the margarine, brown sugar, walnuts and vanilla.  Blend well.  Press the mixture, a small amount at a time, into a 9 inch pie plate, building up the sides and fluting the edge.  Cover the fluting with a strip of aluminum foil to prevent overbrowning.
In another bowl, thoroughly combine the cornstarch, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and granulated sugar.  Add the pumpkin, cream, eggs and molasses.  Pour into the crust and bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until the center is set.
