Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups white sugar
3 large eggs
3 3/4 fluid ounces Meyer lemon juice
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 (9 inch) pastry shell, unbaked

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place sugar, eggs, and lemon juice in a blender; blend until smooth, about 3 minutes.
Pour melted butter into the blender and blend for 30 seconds more.
Transfer lemon filling to the pastry shell.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is just set, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow pie to rest until completely set before serving, about 15 minutes more.

Description: 
A tangy sweet and sour treat, the Meyer lemons make it sweeter than a traditional lemon pie, but still keep that citrus kick.
