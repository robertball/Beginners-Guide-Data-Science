Ingredients:
1 medium sweet potato or yam, peeled and coarsely chopped
3 medium to large carrots, peeled and coarsely sliced
3-4 tbsp. water

Directions:
In a medium pot, cover carrots and sweet potatoes with water and boil for about 20 minutes until yams, and especially carrots, are very tender.  If the carrots aren't thoroughly cooked, they'll leave telltale little nuggets of vegetables in the puree.
Drain the yams and carrots and put them in the food processor with two tablespoons of water.  Puree on high until smooth - no chunks should remain.  Stop occasionally to push the contents from the top to the bottom.  Add water, as necessary, to make the puree smooth, but the less water, the better.
