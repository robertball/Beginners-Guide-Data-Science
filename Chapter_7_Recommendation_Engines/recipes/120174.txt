2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups sugar

1 (8 ounce) container frozen reduced-fat frozen whipped topping, thawed
1 (20 ounce) can reduced-sugar cherry pie filling

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy. Add cream of tartar and vanilla; beat until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until stiff glossy peaks form. Fold in saltines and pecans.
Transfer to a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until lightly browned and edges begin to crack. Cool on a  wire rack. Spread whipped topping over crust. Carefully spoon pie filling over top.
