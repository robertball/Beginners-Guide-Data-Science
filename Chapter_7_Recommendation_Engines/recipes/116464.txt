Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups sugar, divided
1 1/3 cups applesauce
2 (3 ounce) packages red or green Jell-OÂ® mix
2 envelopes unflavored gelatin
1 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
In a large saucepan, combine 2 cups sugar, applesauce, red or green gelatin, unflavored gelatin and lemon juice; let stand for 1 minute. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Boil for 1 minute. Immediately pour into a cold 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Refrigerate for 3 hours or until firm.
With a spatula, loosen gelatin from sides or pan. To remove, invert onto waxed paper. Using kitchen scissors or small sharp cookie cutters dipped on hot water, cut into 1-in. squares or shapes. Place on waxed paper. Dry at room temperature for about 8 hours or until slightly sticky. Roll in remaining sugar. Store in an airtight container.
