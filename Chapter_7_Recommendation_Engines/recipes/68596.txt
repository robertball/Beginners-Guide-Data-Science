Ingredients:
1 (1.2 ounce) package brown gravy mix
1/4 cup whipping cream
1 tablespoon vinegar
6 New York strip steaks, cut 1-inch thick
1 tablespoon white wine
1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
salt and pepper to taste (optional)

Directions:
Prepare gravy mix in a small saucepan according to package directions. Stir in cream, vinegar, white wine, and peppercorns. Simmer over low heat for a few minutes just to blend the flavors.
Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season steaks with salt and pepper (if desired) and place in the hot skillet. Fry for 7 to 10 minutes per side, or to your desired degree of doneness. The internal temperature of the steaks should be at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for rare meat.
Remove steaks to a serving platter or individual plates, and drizzle each one with the gravy. Garnish with peppercorns and fresh parsley for special occasions.
