Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup water
7 tablespoons lard

Mix flour and salt together in a large bowl. Mix in water a little at a time. Rub in lard until dough comes together in a ball.
Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Divide the dough into 6 pieces; roll out each piece to 1/16-inch thickness.
Heat a dry, heavy skillet or flat griddle over medium-high heat. Cook each piece until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.
