Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup white sugar
1/2 vanilla bean, split in half lengthwise
1 cinnamon stick
1/2 lemon, juiced
2 pounds ripe quinces

Directions:
Combine water, sugar, vanilla bean, and cinnamon stick in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil and stir until sugar has dissolved. Boil for 1 minute, then remove sugar syrup from heat.
Fill a large bowl with water and stir in lemon juice. Peel, halve, and core quinces. Depending on their size, cut each into quarters or 8 pieces and immediately submerge in lemon water to prevent browning.
Add quinces to saucepan with sugar syrup and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat and simmer until quinces are soft and have turned lightly pink, about 50 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.
