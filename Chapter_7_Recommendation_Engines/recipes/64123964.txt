Ingredients:
1 1-inch knob fresh turmeric
1 1/2-inch knob fresh ginger
2 teaspoons ghee
1 cup full-fat coconut milk
1 cup coconut water
1 tablespoon manuka honey

Directions:
Peel both the turmeric and ginger, then grate them finely into a mortar or a molcajete (I use this one.) Spoon the ghee into the mortar or molcajete, and grind the ghee into the turmeric and ginger with your pestle until they form a fine paste.
Pour the coconut milk and coconut water into a saucepan, and spoon in the paste made with turmeric, ginger and ghee. Turn the heat up to medium-high and warm the ingredients together until little bubbles just begin to creep up the sides of the pot. Turn off the heat and cover the saucepan, allowing the turmeric and ginger to steep about 3 minutes. Strain the golden milk through a fine-mesh strainer or tea strainer into a tea pot. Stir in the Manuka honey and continue stirring until it dissolves. Serve warm.
