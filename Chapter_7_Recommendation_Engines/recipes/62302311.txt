Ingredients:
1 16-oz. jar roasted garlic alfredo sauce
2 Tbsp. capers
8 no-boil lasagna noodles
1/2 of a 15-oz. container ricotta (or cottage) cheese
6 oz. mozarella shredded (1 1/2 cups)
1-1/2 tsp. finely shredded lemon peel (zest)
1/4 cup finely shredded parmesan cheese
3/4 lb chicken, cooked and cut into small pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly coat a 2-quart square baking dish with cooking spray; set aside. In a saucepan combine alfredo sauce and capers. Bring to boiling over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Spoon 1/3 cup of sauce mixture into prepared dish. Top with lasagna noodles. In a bowl stir together ricotta (or cottage cheese), 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese, and 1 teaspoon of the lemon zest. Spoon half the cheese mixture over noodles. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons Parmesan. Top with half the chicken. Spoon half the remaining sauce over chicken layer.
Top with more noodles, remaining ricotta/(cottage cheese) mixture, and remaining chicken. Add more noodles, remaining sauce, and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.
Cover with foil. Bake for 60 minutes. Let stand, covered, on wire rack for 10 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with remaining lemon zest. Makes 8 servings
