Ingredients:
10 slices cooked ham
1 cup chopped fresh broccoli
1 small onion, chopped
1 tablespoons Dijon mustard
5 slices Swiss cheese
5 Slices pepper jack
1/2 c. shredded cheddar
1/4 c. mayo
2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent roll dough

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Boil broccoli and onion together til tender. Drain. Rinse with cool water. Mix in medium bowl with mayo and dijon. Unroll crescent roll dough, and arrange flat on a medium baking sheet. Pinch together perforations to form a single sheet of dough. Using a knife or scissors, cut 1 inch wide strips in towards the center, starting on the long sides. There should be a solid strip about 3 inches wide down the center, with the cut strips forming a fringe down each side. Layer: Sliced ham, then sliced cheese (alternating sides), evenly spread shredded cheddar.  Spread the filling along the center strip. Fold the side strips over filling, alternating strips from each side. Pinch or twist to seal. (some filling will be visible.)
Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until deep golden brown.
