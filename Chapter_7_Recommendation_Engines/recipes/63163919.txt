Ingredients:
1/4 cup sesame seeds
1/2 cup vegetable oil less 2 TBS
1/3 cup light soy sauce
1/3 cup rice vinegar
1 teaspoon sesame oil
3 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 cups shredded, cooked chicken breast meat
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/3 cup chopped green onion
1 head of Iceberg Lettuce
1 small pack of  maifun (rice stick noodles)
Oil to fry the rice stick noodle

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add sesame seeds, and cook stirring frequently until lightly toasted. Remove from heat, and set aside.
Cut the lettuce into 1/4 inch strips.
Heat the oil; throw in a few noodles to test the temperature, the noodle should puff up immediately. Break up the noodles and put in a little bunch at a time because it puffs up to more than five times its size.
In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine vegetable oil, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, sesame seeds, ginger, and pepper. Shake well.
Pour sesame dressing over pasta, and toss to coat evenly. Gently mix in chicken, cilantro, and green onions and top with the fried rice stick noodle
