Ingredients:
1 1/2 C white whole wheat flour
1/4 cup wheat germ
1/2 envelope (or 1 1/8 tsp) Rapid Rise Yeast
1 Tbl vital wheat gluten
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 oz water
1 Tbl honey
1/2 Tbl olive oil (I used evoo)
*1 heaping tsp ground flax mixed with 3 tsp hot water

Directions:
Combine 3/4 cup flour, wheat germ, undissolved yeast, vital wheat gluten and salt in large mixer bowl.
Combine hot water (not too hot, around 110-115F) with honey and oil. Add to flour mixture with thickened flax and beat until well mixed; let rest 5 minutes. Beat in 1/2 cup flour until well mixed. Stir in remaining flour until soft dough forms.
Knead on lightly floured surface for 5 to 6 minutes. Cover and let rest 10 minutes.
Cut dough into 8 equal portions; shape into balls.  Flatten each dough ball into a 3-1/2 inch circle on a lightly floured surface. (I gently stretched them like a pizza crust)
Place on a greased baking sheet, 2 inches apart. Prick each sandwich thin multiple times with a fork (to ensure an even rise). Lightly brush with water. Cover and let rise in a warm draft-free place for 30 minutes, until puffy.
Bake in preheated 350Â°F oven for 13 to 15 minutes until bottoms of sandwich thins are lightly browned.
Move thins to cooling rack and cool completely before slicing.

These worked very well but I little on the small side. Inspired by lady sparkle's copycat recipe and breadworld's recipe and tweaked to suit us.
