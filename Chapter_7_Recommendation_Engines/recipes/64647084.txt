Ingredients:
1 large spaghetti squash
2 cups tomato sauce or marinara
6-8 mini-meatballs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Poke about 10-12 holes in your spaghetti squash then place on a foil lined baking sheet.  Place in the oven and set timer for 35 minutes.  Remove from oven and let cool for a few minutes.  Reduce oven to 350 degrees.
Slice spaghetti squash in half and remove seeds with a spoon then use a fork to remove the threads into a large bowl.  Add in sauce and toss.
Take a muffin tin. (Mine were fairly large for a hearty helping)  Add a layer to fill about 1/2 of the tin then add in a meatball in the center and cover with more squash.  Bake for 25 minutes.
They will easily remove with a tablespoon.
*If you love parmesan cheese then go ahead and top with some and enjoy!

Description: 
During Blizzard Colbie I was home making a bunch of new recipes and after reviewing what I had in the freezer it was exciting to find a container of mini-meatballs and sauce that I made a few weeks ago. I always make extra meatballs and freeze some for later.  This came it very handy.

We were inviting some neighbors over and we all love spaghetti squash and since we were doing a buffet style dinner I decided to do individual servings of spaghetti squash with a mini-meatball nestled inside and it was a hit!  Our friend's son Austin took the rest home!  I just love cooking for friends and fam
