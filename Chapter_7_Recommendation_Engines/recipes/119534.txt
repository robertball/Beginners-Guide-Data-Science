Ingredients:
1 (16 pound) turkey
6 cups water
3/4 cup egg substitute
2 pounds day-old white bread, cubed and toasted
2 medium onions, chopped
2 celery ribs, chopped
1 tablespoon poultry seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon rubbed sage
1/4 teaspoon pepper
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
GRAVY:
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
2 cups boiling water
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions:
Remove giblets from turkey. In a saucepan, bring water, giblets and neck to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1 hour or until tender. Remove giblets with a slotted spoon; dice. Set aside 3 cups cooking liquid. In a bowl, combine egg substitute, bread crumbs, onions, celery, giblets, poultry seasoning, salt, sage and pepper. Add reserved cooking liquid; mix well. Just before baking, loosely stuff turkey with about 8 cups stuffing. Place remaining stuffing in a greased 2-qt. baking dish; refrigerate. Skewer turkey openings; tie drumsticks together. Place on a rack in a roasting pan. Brush with butter; sprinkle with paprika.
Bake uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F for turkey and 165 degrees F for stuffing, basting every 30 minutes (cover loosely with foil if turkey browns too quickly). Bake additional stuffing for 35-40 minutes.
For gravy, dissolve bouillon in water. In a saucepan, whisk flour and 1/4 cup pan drippings until smooth. Gradually add bouillon mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Serve with turkey and stuffing.
