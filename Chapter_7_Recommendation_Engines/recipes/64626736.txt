Ingredients:
1 can refrigerated Pizza Dough

2 TBSP brown sugar
1 TBSP Worcestershire sauce
1 TBSP Dijon mustard

Directions:
1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Spray 9×13-inch baking dish with nonstick spray.
3. Flour your cutting board and roll out your pizza dough. With a rolling pin, roll out the dough till it’s roughly 12 x 18 inches.
4. Next place the swiss cheese across the dough. 5.Once the dough is covered with cheese slices you can add the deli sliced ham over the cheese.
6. Gently roll up the dough. When you reach the end use your fingers to seal up the roll-up with your fingers.
7.  Next cut the roll into 1 inch slices.
8. Next, in a baking dish, put the roll-up slices on their side.
9. In a sauce pan, combine the butter, brown sugar, worcestershire sauce, dijon and poppy seeds. Stir over medium heat until it becomes a glaze like consistency.
10. Next take the glaze mixture and with a brush, brush it over the tops of the roll-ups in the baking dixture.
11. Finally cook in the oven at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.
