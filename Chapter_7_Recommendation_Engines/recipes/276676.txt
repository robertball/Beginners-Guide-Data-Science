Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/4 cup melted coconut oil
1/4 cup coconut sugar
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1 cup white rice flour
3 tablespoons cinnamon sugar, divided
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix eggs, oil, coconut sugar, and vinegar together in a large bowl.
Mix flour, 2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar, baking soda, and salt together in another bowl. Slowly incorporate into egg mixture; don't worry if dough seems like batter.
Drop by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet quickly. Sprinkle tops with remaining cinnamon sugar as desired.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before enjoying.
