Ingredients:
Cake:
2 c. flour
2 c. sugar
2/3 c. cocoa
1 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
2 eggs
1 c buttermilk
1 c oil
1 c hot water
1 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
Frosting:
1 box powdered sugar
1/2 c cocoa
1 stick butter
1 tsp vanilla
1 c pecans, optional

Directions:
Add dry ingredients to a large bowl; stir well with wire whisk.  Add eggs on one side of the bowl; use a fork to quickly beat them (just to beat the eggs, not to mix into the dry ingredients).  Add remaining ingredients and gently stir all with whisk until well combined.  Batter will be thin.
Bake in 9 x 13 pan at 325 for 30-35 min, or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool while making frosting.
Frosting can be made two ways: method 1 yields a more 'buttercream' type frosting, while method 2 yields a more 'fudgy' type frosting.  Either way is delicious.
Method 1: Soften the butter in mixing bowl, sift in the powdered sugar and cocoa.  Beat with electric mixer until smooth; add vanilla and nuts. Spread over cooled cake - OR -
Method 2: Melt butter in large saucepan; add cocoa, stirring until dissolved.  Stir in powdered sugar, mix thoroughly over low heat.  Add vanilla and nuts and pour over hot cake. Cool 10 - 15 minutes before cutting cake.
