Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package linguine
1 (2 ounce) can anchovy fillets with oil
1/2 onion, minced
3/4 cup chicken stock
1/4 cup white wine
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/8 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
12 ounces bay scallops
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the linguine, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the anchovies with the oil in the skillet until the anchovies melt into the oil, about 2 minutes; add the onion and cook until translucent, 3 to five minutes. Stir in the chicken stock, wine, garlic, parsley, and seafood seasoning; lie the scallops into the liquid; season with salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until the scallops are opaque, about 7 minutes. Serve over the cooked linguine.

Description: 
I love scallops, particularly bay scallops. This is a quick and easy way I've found to prepare them. It has become a regular at my house. If you prefer a thicker sauce, make a slurry out of a teaspoon water mixed with a teaspoon of cornstarch and stir into the boiling liquid to tighten it up. Serve with crusty bread for an easy weeknight meal.
