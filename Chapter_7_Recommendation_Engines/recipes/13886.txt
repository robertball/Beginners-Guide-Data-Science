Ingredients:
1/2 cup uncooked white rice
3/4 cup water
4 green bell peppers
1 onion, chopped
4 tablespoons olive oil
8 ounces textured vegetable protein
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 cups tomato sauce

Directions:
Combine rice and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
Cut tops off peppers, seed insides, and arrange peppers in a large baking dish.  Chop usable portion of the tops.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute chopped peppers and onions in oil until soft. Stir in textured vegetable protein and parsley. Reduce heat to low, and continue cooking for 5 minutes. Mix in cooked rice and 1 1/5 cups tomato sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon the mixture into the peppers, and top each with remaining tomato sauce.
Cover, and bake about 45 minutes. Uncover, top each pepper with mozzarella cheese, and bake until cheese is melted.
