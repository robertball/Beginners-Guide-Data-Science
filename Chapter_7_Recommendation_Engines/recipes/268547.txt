Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 1/2 pounds assorted sliced wild mushrooms
salt
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or more to taste
1 splash dry white wine
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream, or more to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and cook until mushrooms release their juice, about 5 minutes. Keep cooking until liquid evaporates and mushrooms are soft, about 5 minutes more. Stir in parsley and pour in white wine. Add cream and season with salt.
