Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
10 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (8 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon dried oregano
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 cup pecan halves
3/4 cup pine nuts, divided

Directions:
Stir cream cheese, mayonnaise, and balsamic vinegar together in a bowl until smooth.
Mix Cheddar cheese, feta cheese, Parmesan cheese, oregano, onion powder, and garlic powder together in a separate bowl. Stir Cheddar cheese mixture into cream cheese mixture.
Pulse pecans and 1/4 cup pine nuts in a food processor or blender until crumbly. Mix remaining 1/2 cup pine nuts into pecan mixture. Spread about 1/4 of the pecan mixture onto a plate.
Form cheese mixture into two 5-inch balls. Roll each ball in the pecan mixture until fully coated, adding more pecan mixture as needed.

Description: 
I just wasn't satisfied with the ingredients in other cheese ball recipes. So, I made my own and took it to a Christmas party, where it was enjoyed by all. You can also experiment with other Greek-themed ingredient options such as sun-dried tomatoes, Kalamata or green olives, pepperoncini, etc. Surround cheese balls with your favorite crackers.  For a true 'Greek' theme, try toasted pita chips.
