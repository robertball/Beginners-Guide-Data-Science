Ingredients:
2 slices thick-cut bacon, cut into small dice
1 large onion, cut into medium dice
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
2 bay leaves
1 1/2 cups leftover mashed potatoes
2 (8 ounce) bottles clam juice
4 (6.5 ounce) cans minced clams (clams and juice separated)
1 cup water
9 new potatoes, cut into 1/2 -inch cubes
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
Salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
In a large soup kettle, fry bacon over medium heat until bacon crisps, about 5 minutes. Remove bacon; set aside.
Keep 2 tablespoons bacon fat in pan. (If necessary, add oil to yield 2 tablespoons.) Add onion and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add thyme and bay leaves; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds or so.
Whisk in mashed potatoes, clam juice (bottled and what you've drained from the clams) and 1 cup of water. Add new potatoes and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat; continue to simmer, partially covered, until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in clams, cream and parsley; season with salt and pepper.
Heat through and serve, garnishing each bowl with reserved bacon.
