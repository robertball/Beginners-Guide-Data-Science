Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin
1/4 cup cold water
1 cup white sugar
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups milk
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup flaked coconut
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
3 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked
2 tablespoons flaked coconut

Directions:
Sprinkle gelatin over cold water; set aside to soften.
Combine 1/2 cup sugar, flour, and salt in a saucepan. Gradually stir in milk. Cook over low heat, stirring until it boils. Boil for 1 minute, and remove from heat. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in softened gelatin. When partially set, beat with a rotary mixer until smooth. Blend in vanilla and 1 cup coconut.
Whip the cream until stiff. Gently fold into coconut mixture.
In a clean bowl, beat egg whites until frothy. Beat in cream of tartar and 1/2 cup sugar. Continue beating until egg whites form stiff peaks. Fold into coconut mixture. Pile filling into cooled pie shell. Sprinkle with additional coconut.  Chill pie for at least 2 hours or overnight.

Description: 
This is a delicious, yet not-too-filling pie. It does remind you of a blanket of snow on Christmas morning.
