Description: 
This is a traditional mojito recipe, very similar to the drinks I enjoyed in Varadero, Cuba.  The muddling and the order of the ingredients helps ensure that all the flavors are well blended. Serve with a straw and a decorative stir stick to keep the different flavors well mixed together. Mint sprigs may be used for a garnish instead of lime wedges. Enjoy!
