Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
1/4 cup low fat margarine
2 1/2 cups shredded reduced fat Colby cheese
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain.
Stir together pasta, margarine, cheese, diced tomatoes, sugar, and salt.  Place in a 9 x 13 inch pan.
Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 40 to 60 minutes.  The pasta will stick up and brown slightly, so you may want to cover with foil.

Description: 
This recipe was given to me by a friend and coworker.  She knew that I would make it low fat as soon as I read it.  My family has enjoyed it with a salad and fresh bread or rolls. This may be made ahead and placed in the refrigerator for 24 hours or in the freezer for 1 month.
