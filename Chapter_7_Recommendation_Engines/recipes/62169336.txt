Ingredients:
Filling:
1 envelope unflavored gelatin
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/3 tsp. ground ginger
1/4 tsp. ground allspice
1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg
Dash of ground cloves
1 cup dairy eggnog
3 eggs, separated
1 cup canned pumpkin
1/4 cup granulated sugar
Crust:
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup very finely chopped pecans
3 Tblsp. sugar
6 Tblsp. butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
In saucepan, combine the unflavored gelatin, brown sugar, salt, and spices.  Stir in eggnog.
Beat egg yolks until combined; stir into saucepan along with canned pumpkin.  Cook and stir over medium heat until gelatin dissolves and mixture thickens slightly.
Remove mixture from heat; pour into large bowl and chill until partially set.
Meanwhile, beat egg whites until soft peaks form.  Gradually add the granulated sugar, beating until stiff peaks form.
Fold egg whites into eggnog mixture; pile into crust.
Chill until firm, at least 4 hours.  Garnish with whipped cream and pecan halves.
Crust:
In a small bowl, combine cracker crumbs, nuts, sugar, and butter.  Press firmly into bottom and sides of 9-inch pie plate.  Bake at 375 for 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove and cool until filling is ready.

Description: 
For anyone who thinks most pumpkin pie is too bland, this is a rich, spiced, sensational (if unorthodox) pumpkin pie.  You can use a standard single pie crust, or for something extra special, the pecan-graham cracker crust listed.   This recipe originally came from Mountain Measures, a cookbook from Charleston, WV that is now sadly out of print, but I modified it to suit my own tastes.
