Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder

1/2 cup milk
2 1/2 cups huckleberries
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup boiling water
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.) Grease the bottom of a 9 inch square pan.
In a large bowl, cream 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup sugar. In a separate small bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Stir into butter mixture. Stir in milk; mixture will be thick and lumpy. Spread batter into the prepared pan.
In a large bowl, combine berries, 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup boiling water. Pour over the batter in the pan. Dot the top with remaining 1 tablespoon of butter.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes.

Description: 
This is a family recipe from my husband's mom and grandma. I like it better than the traditional cobbler. This works well with blueberries and blackberries also!
