Ingredients:
MEATLOAF:
2 lb. 96% lean ground beef
1/2 cup Quaker Oats®
1/2 cup catsup
1 egg
1 small onion (diced) minus 1/4 cup
2 teaspoons prepared mustard
1 teaspoon parsley flakes
1 teaspoon Italian herb
1 teaspoon chives
1 teaspoon basil
1 teaspoon Morton Lite® salt
TOPPING:
1/4 cup catsup
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 teaspoon parsley flakes
1/4 teaspoon Italian herb
1/4 teaspoon chives
1/4 teaspoon basil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Put the meatloaf ingredients, holding back 1/4 cup of the diced onion, in a large mixing bowl & smash them together with your hands until fully blended. Form the mixture into a loaf & place it in an ungreased 5x9 loaf pan. Form it to the shape of the pan & "paint" the top, edge to edge with 1/4 cup catsup. Sprinkle the top with the remaining (1/4 cup) onions and 1/4 teaspoon each of parsley flakes, Italian herb, chives & basil. Cook for 60-70 minutes or until done. The onion & herbs will be starting to brown. Refridgerate leftovers.

Description: 
This juicy and flavorful meatloaf is also very healthy. As with any good meatloaf,it can be a main entree or sliced & sandwiched in your favorite bread. The seasonings make it go well with potatoes & green beans or pasta & garlic bread. This recipe has never let me down.
