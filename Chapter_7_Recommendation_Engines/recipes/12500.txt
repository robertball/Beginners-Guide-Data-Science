Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless chicken
2 pounds flank steak
2 pounds pork tenderloin
¼ pound salt pork, sliced
4  onions, chopped
¼ pound sliced ham
2 cups peeled and cubed potatoes
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups chicken broth
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie

Directions:
Cut chicken, beef, and pork into 1 inch cubes, and place in a large bowl.  Stir in onions.  Cover, and refrigerate overnight.
Arrange salt pork evenly in the bottom of a 3 quart casserole dish with a cover.  Layer with 1/3 of the meat mixture and 1/3 of the potatoes; season with salt and  pepper.  Roll out half of the pastry a little bit thicker than for a normal pie and arrange on the potato layer, cutting a small hole in the middle.  Repeat with 2 more layers of meat and potatoes seasoned with salt and pepper.  Cover with remaining pastry, and cut a small hole in the middle of that layer too.  Slowly add enough chicken stock through the hole until liquid appears. Cover dish.
Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 45 minutes, or until liquid simmers.  Reduce temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).  Bake for 5 to 6 hours more, or until top crust is a rich golden brown.
