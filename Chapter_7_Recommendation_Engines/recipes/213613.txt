Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup sesame seeds
1/2 cup white vinegar
1/3 cup teriyaki sauce
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
4 teaspoons granular no-calorie sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
3 stalks celery
4 green onions, chopped
2 carrots, cut into matchsticks (optional)
1 yellow bell pepper, sliced (optional)
1 small cucumber, sliced (optional)
1 small white onion, sliced (optional)

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the sesame seeds, and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Scrape into a metal mixing bowl, and cool to room temperature.
Whisk the vinegar, teriyaki sauce, black pepper, red pepper flakes, ginger root, and sweetener into the sesame seed mixture. Stir in the celery, green onions, carrots, bell pepper, cucumber, and onion into the sesame dressing until evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate until cold before serving.

Description: 
Celery -- you buy it, knowing you'll throw away most of it. But wouldn't you like to use it up? And those scallions and carrots, too... Well, here's a recipe that revitalizes your fresh veggies by steeping them in a vinegar and water solution. This is a combination of several different recipes for Asian-style cucumber salads. I like to pour it over a salad, but you could just pick out the veggies and them solo. Use any veggies you like -- I've chosen the ones I most often have waiting around!
