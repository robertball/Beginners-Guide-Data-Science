Ingredients:
2 sticks of butter, melted (or mostly melted, both are fine)
2 c. BREAD flour
1 tsp. kosher salt (table salt is fine as well)
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 t. cinnamon (adjust to your liking)
1/4 c. white sugar
1 1/4 c. brown sugar, lightly packed (light or dark, darker means chewier cookies!)
1 whole egg
1 egg YOLK
1 oz. milk
1 1/2 tsp. vanilla
2 1/2 c. quick cooking oats
3/4 c. butterscotch chips
3/4 c. chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Put 2 sticks of butter in small saucepan on low & melt entirely, some medium-small chunks left are fine.
Meanwhile, Sift together (or not, I'm not a fan of sifting) bread flour, salt, baking soda, & cinnamon in a medium bowl.
Pour melted butter into large mixing bowl. Add white & brown sugars & mix on medium, until incorporated. Slow mixer & add egg, egg yolk, milk, and vanilla. (Yes, it's supposed to look like that!)
Add dry ingredients, in about 3 portions, slowing mixer each time you add more. Scrape down sides of bowl & continue until just mixed.
Add Oats & chips, or your preferred additions.
**I prefer a more spread out, chewy cookie, so I do NOT chill the dough before cooking, but if you prefer chewy, more condensed cookie, then chill dough thoroughly (About 1-2 hrs).
Scoop 6 large tablespoons per sheet, appx 2 inches apart onto parchment paper (NOT the same as WAXED), or silpats (if you don't have these, invest in 1 or 2 or 10.) I use a 1 TBSP. mechanical ice cream scoop, overly stuffed. If you prefer smaller cookies or if you've chilled the dough, they will spread less, so feel free to make adjustments accordingly as to how many per sheet.
Bake 10-12 mins @ 350 degrees, or until just brown around edges & underside. Obviously, for a softer, cookie, 10 minutes should be great, for crispier cookies, bake a little longer. I bake 11 mins exactly on silpats.
Cool on baking sheet for about 2 mins, especially if you are undercooking them, as they are hard to transfer fresh out of the oven. Move to wire racks to completely cool.
This last step is very important, ENJOY the fruit of your labor!

Description: 
This is a wonderful basic Oatmeal Cookie recipe that is really a melding of two of my favorite's, Alton Brown's Chewy Chocolate chip cookies & another Chewy Oatmeal Cookie recipe. I find it is VERY forgiving, and VERY flexible. But this is my favorite way to make them. I wrote a lot of information & kinda broke the recipe down here for beginners, (most if this information are in parenthesis) because I feel this is simple go to recipe that is really fun to learn to make. You pros can skim through for the important parts. ENJOY!
