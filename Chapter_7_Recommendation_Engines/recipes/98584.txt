Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup margarine
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup chopped fresh mint leaves

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.
Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.
