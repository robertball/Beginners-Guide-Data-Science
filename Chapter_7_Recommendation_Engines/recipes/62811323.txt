Ingredients:
1 lb. White American Cheese (NO substitutions!)
1/3-1/2 cup Milk
1-2 tablespoons diced Jalapenos
1/2 teaspoon liquid from drained can of jalapenos OR 1/2 teaspoon vinegar
1/2 cup diced onion
1/2 cup diced tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2-1 teaspoon cumin
20 Small Round Corn Tortillas quartered
2 Quarts Oil (for deep fry)

Directions:
Combine diced cheese, milk, jalapenos, jalapeno liquid/vinegar, garlic salt, and cumin. Place in slow cooker and cook on low, stirring occasionally for about an hour or until cheese is melted thoroughly.
While the cheese is almost melted, deep fry quartered tortillas at 400F until crisp and golden. Be careful not to overfill the fry basket, and shake occasionally to keep chips from sticking together. Lightly salt chips when removed from oil.
When cheese dip is melted, stir in onions and tomatoes and top with cilantro. Serve with freshly fried corn tortilla chips.
Alternatives are baking chips instead of frying them and cutting tortillas to desired shapes as opposed to triangles.
