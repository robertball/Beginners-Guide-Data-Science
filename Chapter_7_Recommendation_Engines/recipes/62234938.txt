3 mashed very rip bananas

1/2 cup low fat yogurt
1/4 cup vegetable oil

1 egg
1 tsp vanilla

1 tsp baking soda
pinch of salt
1 tsp cinnamon
dash of nutmeg
1 cup walnuts or any dry fruit, nut or seeds (optional)

Directions:
Combine bananas, baking soda and yogurt and allow to rest for 5 minutes (the whole house should smell like bananas by now).
Combine oil, sugar, egg and vanilla and blend well together.
Sift the remainder of the ingredients (minus the nuts).
Combine the banana mixture to the oil mixture then add to dry ingredients until moistened. Fold in the nuts.
Lightly oil or line a loaf pan with parchment paper and spoon batter in.
Bake in 350Â°F 50-60 minutes.

Description: 
Who doesn't love Banana Bread?! My recipe is quite low in fat and calories but doesn't lack in flavor what so ever. No one will believe there's only 1/4 cup of oil in the whole loaf. The surprise ingredient is plain yogurt.
