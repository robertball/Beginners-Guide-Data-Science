Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked rolled oats
1 cup whole wheat flour
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1 egg
2 cups milk
2 tablespoons applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 ripe bananas

Directions:
Place the rolled oats into the jar of a blender and blend until the texture resembles coarse flour. Whisk together the blended oats, whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a bowl; set aside.
In the blender, blend together the egg, milk, applesauce, vanilla, and bananas. Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and stir just until moistened. Let the batter stand for 5 to 10 minutes.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by 1/3 cupfuls, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
