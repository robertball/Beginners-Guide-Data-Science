Ingredients:
1/4 cup white sugar
1 vanilla bean, crushed and broken into chunks
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup unsalted butter
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place 1/4 cup of sugar and the vanilla bean in a food processor fitted with a metal blade.  Pulse to chop the bean, then add walnuts.  Pulse again until finely chopped.  Remove from food processor. Add the butter and flour.  Mix until well blended.
Pinch off 1 inch square pieces of dough and shape into balls.  Shape the balls into crescents, about 2 inches long.  Place about 1/2 inch apart on cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F and bake for additional 10 to 15 minutes, until cookies are dry.  Let cool on wire racks.
