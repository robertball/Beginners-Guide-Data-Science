Description: 
This hearty slow cooker dinner will fill your kitchen with a delicious aroma and isn't that same old chicken and cream-of-something slow cooker meal. Serve it with a crisp green salad and a loaf of crunchy bread for a stick-to-your-ribs dinner. This tastes better the longer it cooks, so letting it cook on Low for an entire work day will only improve the taste.
