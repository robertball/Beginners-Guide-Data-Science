Ingredients:
12 large flour tortillas
1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 liter vegetable or canola oil
For the ground beef filling:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large red onion, sliced
3 pounds ground beef
1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste
4 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons celery salt
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Special equipment: Wooden skewers or round toothpicks

Directions:
Lay out tortillas and sprinkle about 1/8 cup cheese on each. Begin heating vegetable oil to 350 degrees F in deep-fryer.
In a large skillet heat olive oil over medium-high heat and saute onion until translucent. To this pan, add ground beef, tomato paste, chili powder, cumin, celery salt, and salt and pepper, and cook until browned. Divide meat mixture into equal amounts in the pan. Then using a slotted spoon to leave excess liquid behind, transfer meat mixture to the center of each tortilla and fold the tortilla into a closed packet and secure using a wooden skewer or round toothpicks. Deep fry chimichangas until golden brown. (Alternatively, you can skip the deep frying step altogether by arranging the chimichanga packets on a baking sheet and bake until cheese melts and tortillas begin to firm up, about 5 to 10 minutes in a preheated 350 degrees F oven.) Remove skewers/toothpicks before serving.
