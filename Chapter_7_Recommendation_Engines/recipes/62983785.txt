Ingredients:
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/3 cup sugar
3/4 cup warm water (110° to 115°)
3/4 cup warm 2% milk (110° to 115°)
2 eggs
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1-1/2 teaspoons salt
4-1/2 to 5 cups all-purpose flour
FILLING:
1-1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
TOPPING:
1-1/2 cups packed brown sugar
3/4 cup butter, melted
3 tablespoons half-and-half cream

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in warm water. Add the milk, eggs, butter, salt, remaining sugar and 2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (dough will be sticky).
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down. On a lightly floured surface, roll into an 18-in. x 12-in. rectangle. In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, butter and cinnamon; spread over rectangle to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal. Cut into 1-1/2-in. slices.
In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, butter and cream; pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. baking dish. Place rolls, cut side down, in brown sugar mixture.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 350° for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown. Cool in dish for 5 minutes; invert onto a serving platter. Serve warm. Yield: 1 dozen.
