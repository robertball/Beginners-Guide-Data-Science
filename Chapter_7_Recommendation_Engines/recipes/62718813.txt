Ingredients:
2 c flour
2 tsp baking powder
salt (opt)
1/2 c vegetable oil
1/4 c milk

Directions:
Quiche Crust: Ingredients - 2 cups of flour, 2 tsp. of baking powder, salt (opt.), 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup of milk. Directions: Mix the flour and the baking powder together. Add salt if you wish, but if so, add only sparingly. Mix the oil and milk together, and then pour into the flour. Stir only until mixed. The mixture will be rather coarse and granular, but it will roll out well. Do not overmix. Mold into two balls, and wrap with plastic. Allow to sit for 15 minutes. Each ball will make one 9 inch piecrust. If you are using a larger french quiche pan, then use a bit more of the dough. Roll out between two sheets of wax paper. Place the pastry in the quiche or pie plate, and prick the bottom with a kitchen fork. Line the inside with wax paper or aluminum foil. Put two cups of dry beans into the piecrust, and bake at 400 deg. for 12 minutes. Save the beans for the next piecrust session. The shell is now ready for filling and cooking. Makes 2-9" crusts or 1 larger crust
