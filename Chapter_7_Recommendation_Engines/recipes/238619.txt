Ingredients:
2 tablespoons grapeseed oil or olive oil, divided
1/2 sweet onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1/4 teaspoon saffron threads
1/4 teaspoon fennel seed
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 (24 ounce) jar ClassicoÂ® Tomato and Basil Sauce
3 cups seafood stock
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
12 ounces cod (or other lean white-fleshed fish fillets), cut into bite-size pieces
1/4 teaspoon crushed rosemary
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/2 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft but not browned, about 5 minutes.
Crumble in the saffron; add the fennel seeds and the red pepper flakes. Cook for 1 minute.
Add the Classico sauce, seafood stock and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Bring to a boil; reduce the heat to low and simmer until the onion is tender, about 20 minutes.
Place the fish in a bowl and sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and the rosemary, thyme, and marjoram. Add the shrimp and the remaining tablespoon oil. Toss gently to coat.
Place the fish and shrimp into the tomato base mixture. Cook over medium-low heat until the shrimp is opaque throughout and the fish begins to flake apart, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This quick Mediterranean-inspired seafood soup has an herbed tomato base and is full of seafood! I love serving crusty French bread alongside to soak up the broth.
