Ingredients:
20 saltine crackers
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
10 (4 ounce) links sausage (such as EckrichÂ® Smok-y Breakfast Sausage)
5 slices American cheese

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Lay crackers salt side down on a baking sheet. Spread tomato paste on top.
Microwave sausages in a microwave-safe plate until heated through, about 1 minute. Slice in half lengthwise, making sure not to cut all the way through. Place sliced side-down onto the crackers. Quarter each slice of cheese and lay over the sausage.
Broil until the cheese is melted, 2 to 5 minutes.
