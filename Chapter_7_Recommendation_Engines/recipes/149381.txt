Ingredients:
4 small boneless skinless chicken breast halves
4 teaspoons TACO BELL速 HOME ORIGINALS速 Taco Seasoning Mix
2 cups thinly sliced peeled potatoes
1 cup KRAFT Mexican Style Shredded Cheese
1/2 cup TACO BELL速 HOME ORIGINALS速 Thick 'N Chunky Salsa
1/4 cup BREAKSTONE'S or KNUDSEN Sour Cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Sprinkle chicken evenly with seasoning mix. Place 1/2 cup of the potatoes on center of each of four large sheets of heavy-duty foil; top each with 1 chicken breast, 1/4 cup of the cheese and 2 tablespoons of the salsa.
Bring up foil sides. Double fold top and both ends to seal each packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Place in single layer in 15x10x1-inch baking pan.
Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until chicken is cooked through (170 degrees F) and potatoes are tender. Remove packets from oven. Let stand 5 minutes. Place one packet on each of four dinner plates. Cut slits in foil with sharp knife to release steam before opening. Top each serving with 1 tablespoon of the sour cream.
