Ingredients:
8 ounces ice-cold sushi-grade yellowfin tuna steak, diced
1/4 cup coconut milk, or to taste
2 tablespoons chopped cashews
2 tablespoons sliced red onion
1 tablespoon minced serrano pepper
1 tablespoon torn cilantro leaves
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
salt to taste
1 lime, juiced
1 pinch red pepper flakes

Directions:
Stir tuna, 1/2 of the coconut milk, cashews, red onion, serrano pepper, cilantro, ginger, and salt together in a bowl; add lime juice and stir. Drizzle in remaining coconut milk until desired consistency is reached. Transfer tartare to a bowl and sprinkle red pepper flakes over the top.

Description: 
Feel free to tweak this any way you want, including adding more coconut milk. My wife is on record as preferring twice as much as I used here, which will give you a looser but much more luxurious mixture. This also needs a good amount of salt to bring the flavors together, so taste and adjust carefully. You could certainly use other salty seasonings like soy and/or fish sauce, but you already knew that. Serve with taro, wonton, or sweet potato chips.
