Description: 
This recipe comes from my mother, who is a fabulous cook. She has made these meatballs for parties and family celebrations for years, and they have become a favourite for potluck buffets. They are so easy and very addictive. Great as an appetizer, or served over cooked rice for a tasty meal.
