Description: 
This is a refreshing, light dish that can be used as a main protein for a summer meal or as an appetizer for a dinner with guests. If you have trouble finding langostinos you can always substitute shrimp. This is a gluten-free and dairy-free dish, so can be good when you are dealing with potential food allergies.
