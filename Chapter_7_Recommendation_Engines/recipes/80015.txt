Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef round
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chili-seasoned diced tomatoes, undrained
1 (11 ounce) can Mexican-style corn, undrained
1 (7.5 ounce) package corn muffin and bread mix
1/2 cup instant mashed potato flakes
5/8 cup milk
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
Chopped cilantro

Directions:
Brown ground beef in large nonstick skillet over medium heat 8 to 10 minutes or until beef is not pink, breaking up into 3/4-inch crumbles.  Pour off drippings.  Add tomatoes, corn and 1 tablespoon corn muffin mix; bring to boil, stirring frequently.  Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile combine remaining corn muffin mix, potato flakes and 1/2 cup milk in medium bowl.  Stir until blended, adding enough of remaining milk until batter is just stiff enough to hold its shape.  Stir in cheese.
Drop batter in 12 mounds on top of simmering beef mixture.  Cover skillet and continue cooking over medium-low heat 15 to 20 minutes or until biscuits are done (the tops will appear dry).  Garnish with cilantro.
