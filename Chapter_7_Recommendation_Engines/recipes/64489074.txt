Ingredients:
Five Bell Peppers (assorted colors)
Four Cups of Cooked Rice (brown rice is recommended)
1 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 tsp Olive Oil
One Large Shallot, minced
One Handful of Cherry Tomatoes, halved
2 Tbsp Tomato Paste
1 tsp Fresh Marjoram
¼ Cup Grated Parmesan Cheese
One Sweet Italian Sausage (optional)
1½ tsp Olive Oil (if you are preparing this recipe with sausage)
1 Tbsp Chopped Olives (optional)
A Topping of Tomato Sauce (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375° Fahrenheit.
Chop up tomatoes and shallots, and sauté them in 1 Tbsp olive oil until softened (about five minutes). After this, add tomato paste and marjoram, and sauté for an additional minute. If you are preparing the recipe with sausage, chop the sausage up and sauté it in 1½ tsp Olive Oil until brown (at least ten minutes).
Put all these sautéed ingredients in a bowl, along with rice, olives (if using) and cheese, and mix well.
Slice tops off of peppers, de-seed, and core. Fill with stuffing mixture, place in a baking dish with sides (coated with 1 tsp Olive Oil), bake for 30 minutes, and serve with tomato sauce if desired.
