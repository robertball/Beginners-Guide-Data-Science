Ingredients:
2 cups cooked turkey (white, dark or a combination)
1 teaspoon powdered onion or garlic (dried chives would work, too)
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
3 Tablespoons heavy cream or milk
2 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent roll dough

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, break turkey apart with your fingers.
Add cream cheese, spices, and cream.
With hand mixer, blend until well combined and about the consistency of peanut butter. (If too thick, add more cream.)
Unroll croissants. Each tube should yield 4 "squares". Use your fingers to stretch the squares a bit, making sure the dough doesn't have any holes.
Place approximately 2-3 Tablespoons of the turkey mixture (an ice cream scoop is about the right size) of the chicken mixture on each rectangle. Fold the corners up and form into bundles, making sure there are no tears or holes in the dough.
Arrange balls on a large, greased baking stone or baking sheet. Brush tops with butter (optional).
Bake in the preheated oven 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.
