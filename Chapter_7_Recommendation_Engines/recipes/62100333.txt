Ingredients:
1 Pkg. Knorr's Dry Vegetable Soup Mix
1 can Kidney Beans
1 can Pinto Beans
2 Whole (diced) Roasted Sweet Red Peppers w/garlic (Forelli's in the jar)
1/2 small crescent sliced Onions
1/4 cup Beef Broth
1/4 cup White Wine (any kind)
1/2 heaping tsp. Eros Pista Hot Paprika (Hungarian Univer Jar)
1 can Cream of Potato (+ clean can with water and add to pot)
1 can Cream of Chicken (+ clean can with water and add to pot)
1 tsp. Black Pepper
4 UNcooked Whole Leg Quarters (Remove skin if preferred but fine if left on)

Directions:
Add all above ingredients to a 5 qt. Crock Pot. Put the chicken in last and push down to cover with juice.  Put lid on and cook on high for 4-1/2 to 5 hours then adjust to low. Let cook until ready to eat.
Serve with rice or egg noodles and biscuits!
It does not come out as a cream sauce, it actually was a clear base - even with both cans of cream of's.

Description: 
I thought all's we had was just some chicken quarters to eat one night. While going through my cubbord, I just decided to start tossing things into the crockpot. The results were fantastic. Considering I've never done that before, I decided to write everything down that I did, just in case it came out good. Good thing!
