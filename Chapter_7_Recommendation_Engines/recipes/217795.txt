Ingredients:
3 bunches fresh asparagus, trimmed
3 tablespoons butter
1 red onion, chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
3 quarts chicken stock
1/2 cup cooking sherry
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Chop the asparagus. Set aside 2 cups of the asparagus tips.
Melt the butter in a stockpot over medium heat. Cook the asparagus, onion, celery, and garlic in the melted butter until beginning to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the sherry and chicken stock; bring the mixture to a gentle boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 45 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool at least 30 minutes.
Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway. Hold the lid in place with a folded kitchen towel and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Return the blended soup to the stockpot; stir in the reserved asparagus tips and the heavy cream. Cook over medium heat until soup is hot and the asparagus tips are heated through but still crunchy, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This is an easy, delicious recipe I got from a local restaurant. I make this every spring when asparagus is abundant here. I think because of the sherry this soup has a wonderful nutty flavor. This can easily be made as a low-calorie soup by using 1 tablespoon olive oil instead of the butter, and by omitting the heavy cream. Just add a little cornstarch to thicken, if needed.
