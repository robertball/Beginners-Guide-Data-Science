Ingredients:
1/2 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained
1/2 cup PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese Spread
1/2 cup grated sharp white Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup grated Asiago cheese
1 baguette

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Combine the first 4 ingredients in the bowl of food processor; pulse until well blended, stopping occasionally to scrape the side of the container. Set mixture aside.
Cut baguette into 24 slices, each about 3/4-inch-thick and being careful not to cut all the way through to bottom of baguette. (The baguette should stay intact, but the slices will be easy to break off.)
Spread a generous amount of the cheese mixture between each of the slices.
Place prepared loaf on baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes or until the bread is crisp and warmed, and the cheese is melted.
