Ingredients:
2 1/5  cups self-rising flour
1 cup low fat margarine
1 can club soda
2 1/2 cups chopped left over chicken or turkey
3 1/2 cups frozen mixed veggies
4 tsp low sodium chicken bouillon
3 cups water
2 tbsp cornstarch

Directions:
In a medium bowl cut margarine  into the flour until it resembles course meal, and add enough club soda to form a ball, then refrigerate dough for a few hours.
In a medium saucepan combine chicken(or turkey), mixed veggies and water and bring to boil, add the bouillon, and  enough cornstarch to thicken it all.
After dough had refrigerated divide the dough into 5 balls, put 1 ball aside for the tops, roll out the dough on lightly floured surface then gently line an onion soup bowl with the dough (as you would  a pie plate)
Put 1 1/2 cups of the thickened filling in to the dough lined bowl, repeat for the other 3 onion soup bowls, any dough above the side of bowl can be folded over the filling
Roll out the last dough ball and make 4 cut outs with a cup slightly larger than bowl opening, then put the top inside the bowl
Bake at 400 for about 45-50 minutes or crust is golden brown
Let stand 10-15 minutes before sserving

** Sorry about the high sodium count i did my best to use the lowest sodium ingredients. i guess if you use a different self rising flour, I used Gold Medal it is high in sodium you can try a different brand**
