Description: 
This goes very well on many different meats. Summer is coming. I know those BBQ pits are going to be busy. I know mine is! Try it out; you won't be disappointed. Give me a rating and let me know what I can change if I need to. Let me know how it went! Store in a sealed container in a cool, dry place.
