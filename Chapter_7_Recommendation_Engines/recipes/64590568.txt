Ingredients:
1 pound pork tenderloin, sliced into medallions
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons Cindy's Tuscan Blend
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 yellow/orange pepper, thinly sliced
1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced
1/4 cup low sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Season both sides of sliced tenderloin with salt and pepper.
Heat your large pan (I love my braising pan for this recipe) over medium-high heat.  Add in oil and let it get very hot.
Cook the first side for 5 minutes then flip over.  While cooking on the other side add in garlic and Tuscan Blend or seasonings above.  Add in peppers and onions and let cook for 3-4 minutes; string with a wooden spoon.
Add in chicken broth then cover and reduce to simmer for 10 minutes. (The liquid will reduce)
When ready to serve stir in balsamic vinegar then bring the pot to the table and serve.

Description: 
Here is another great one-pot meal that is also ready in 30 minutes!  We just love our Paleo Recipes and especially one-pot that are great for entertaining.  I made this for friends and brought the pan to the table!  Perfect....

If you don't have Cindy's Tuscan Blend then use the following (this is not my blend but a good substitute for this recipe) 

1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
