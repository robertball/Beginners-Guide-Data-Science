Ingredients:
1 pound new potatoes
1 pound beef sirloin steak
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
8 cups mixed baby salad greens
1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
2 tablespoons minced shallot
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon dried tarragon

Directions:
Place potatoes into a pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until tender but still firm, about 10 minutes. Drain and cover to keep warm.
Preheat oven to broil or preheat a grill for medium-high heat. Season both sides of steak with salt and pepper. Broil or grill steaks for 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.
Meanwhile, whisk together oil, vinegar, mustard, and tarragon for dressing; season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.
Divide greens, tomatoes, and shallots among 4 plates.  Cut warm, unpeeled potatoes into quarters; slice steak into 1/4 inch thick strips.  Top salad greens with steak and potatoes; drizzle dressing over salads.  Serve warm.
