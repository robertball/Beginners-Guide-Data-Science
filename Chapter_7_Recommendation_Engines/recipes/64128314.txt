Ingredients:
14 oz. rinsed mussels
i bottle Shipyard Fuggles IPA
½ cup red onion or ½ medium size onion
4 garlic cloves – chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Rinse the mussels thoroughly with cold water and remove all beards from shell edges. Discard any open shells that don't close after squeezing or tapping.
Place large sauté pan on burner on high with oil. Let the oil heat up about one minute then add the onions and sauté until they are translucent.
Add garlic and cook until slightly brown.
Add mussels, salt and pepper and 1 cup of Shipyard’s Fuggles IPA (enjoy the rest while you are cooking!).
Cover for 1 ½ - 2 minutes. When all mussels have opened, add butter and parsley and allow the sauce to thicken a bit.
The mussels are ready to serve along with a side garlic bread.

Description: 
I saw this being cooked by the chef at Inn at Peakes (Peake's Island, Maine) one Saturday on WMTW.  We love them cooked this way! You'll enjoy real Maine flavors if you use Maine Mussels and Portland's Shipyard Brewery's Fuggles IPA.
