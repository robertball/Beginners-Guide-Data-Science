2 TBSP. butter
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper

1/4 cup seedless raisins
4 TBSP sour cream

Directions:
Saute the onion and garlic in the 2 TBSP. butter.  When the onion and garlic are lightly browned, add the salt, pepper and the soup.  Stir well, then add the curry, shrimp, and raisins (do NOT leave out the raisins, it's surprisingly AMAZING with the curry).  Heat thoroughly, then add sour cream and a few drops of lemon juice.  Serve over rice.  Enjoy!
