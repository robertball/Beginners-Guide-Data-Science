Ingredients:
3/4 cup pecans
2 ripe peaches
4 cups baby spinach, rinsed and dried
1/4 cup poppyseed salad dressing

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Arrange pecans on a single layer on a baking sheet and roast in preheated oven for 7-10 minutes, until they just begin to darken.  Remove from oven and set aside.
Peel peaches (if desired) and slice into bite-sized segments.  Combine peaches, spinach and pecans in a large bowl. Toss with dressing until evenly coated, adding a little additional dressing, if necessary.
