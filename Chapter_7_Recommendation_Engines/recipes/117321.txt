Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup sugar, divided
2 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees), divided
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 egg
1 teaspoon salt
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in 1 cup warm water.  Add the oil, egg, salt, 2 cups flour, and remaining sugar and water.  Beat until smooth.  Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 40 minutes.
Punch the dough down.  Turn onto a floured surface; divide into 36 pieces.  Shape each piece into a 6-in. rope.  Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 25 minutes.
Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.  Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, cream the butter, Parmesan cheese and garlic powder.  Serve with breadsticks.

My kids love these nice tender breadsticks, and so down anyone else who tastes them.  Any leftovers are great with butter and honey for breakfast the next day. -Elaine Anderson Aliquippa, Pennsylvania
