Ingredients:
6  bone-in chicken breast halves, with skin
½ cup ranch-style salad dressing
1 cup bread crumbs
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon cracked black pepper
1 teaspoon sage
½ teaspoon salt

Directions:
Marinate the chicken in the ranch dressing overnight (or for at least 4 hours).
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, sage and salt and mix well. Coat the marinated breasts in the breading mixture and place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, then REDUCE HEAT to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for 30 minutes or until done and juices run clear.

Description: 
I know, I know, EVERYONE makes baked chicken. Well, this one is good! Leave the skins on, at least while baking - or actually indulge and eat it with the skin on when baked!
