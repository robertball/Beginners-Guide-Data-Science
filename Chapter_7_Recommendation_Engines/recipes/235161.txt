Ingredients:
1/4 (17 ounce) bottle creole butter and jalapeno injectable marinade (such as Tony Chachere's®)

1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 marinade injector
1 (7 pound) pork shoulder roast
1 pinch Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®), or to taste
fresh ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix creole butter and jalapeno marinade, beer, honey, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce in a large cup. Fill marinade injector with beer marinade. Place pork shoulder in a baking dish; inject with marinade. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours.
Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Transfer pork to a large roasting pan and tightly cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until very tender, about 12 hours. Drain and discard about 3/4 the pork juices; shred pork.
