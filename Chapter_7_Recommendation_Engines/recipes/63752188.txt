Ingredients:
3 cups sugar
2 tablespoons cornmeal
1 Cup or 2 sticks of margarine or butter, melted
6 eggs slightly beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 tablespoon vinegar
2 unbaked pie shells in pie pans ***(you can use the cheap pie shells, but the brand name ones really make the pie) as I have used both...and got more compliments when I used the name brand (more expensive) pie shells!

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a large bowl, mix dry ingredients w/Fork --- mix sugar and cornmeal. Then Add melted margarine and mix thoroughly.
Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing after each addition. Add all liquids, taking care to end with vinegar. Mix well. Divide filling among each unbaked pie shell. Place pies on large cookie sheet and Bake for approximately 45 mins to 1 hour.
