Description: 
This recipe tastes just  like the Dorothy Lynch Salad Dressing I grew up with in Kansas. If you've never tried it, it's a dressing on the sweeter side with nice hints of celery. It's my favorite salad dressing. I've started making it with this recipe since I moved to Seattle, as I haven't found it in any of the stores.
