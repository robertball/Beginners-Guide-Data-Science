Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) package refrigerated pie crust
2 fresh pineapple, cut into pieces
4 thin slices deli ham
4 thin slices deli-style turkey
4 slices Swiss cheese
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Cut each pastry sheet into four wedges. Pat pineapple slices dry with paper towels. Top four pastry wedges with one slice each of ham, turkey, cheese and pineapple, folding meat and cheese to fit if necessary. Top each with a pastry wedge; seal and crimp edges with a fork. Cut slits in pastry.
Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Brush lightly with egg. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
