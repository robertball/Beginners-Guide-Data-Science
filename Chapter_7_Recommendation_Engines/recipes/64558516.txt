Ingredients:
Stage 1
•	1kg black Eye Beans (1 pkg)
•	2 cups of Ketchup
•	2 cup of your house made BBQ sauce (see my other recipes)
•	1 cup of BBQ Spice rub (see my other recipes)
•	2 tbls of dry mustard powder( ½ cup of yellow mustard will also work)
•	½ oz liquid smoke
•	2 tbls black  pepper to taste ( I like peppery beans so I add more but you can add less)
•	*Optional  ½ cup Franks/ Pete’s hot sauce
•	Bacon (including some drippings)
•	Vidalia Sweet Onions
•	3 ounces bourbon
Stage 2
•	2 cups of Black Strap Molasses
•	1 cup of Brown Sugar

Directions:
Prep:
Soak overnight (8hrs +) in water (add a stout beer for flavor if wanted) Boil till tender (3.5 – 4 hours) Drain and place in roasting pan
Cut 2lbs of bacon into 1 inch pieces and cook halfway
Add Bacon (including half the drippings) and Onions to roasting pan
Add first batch of ingredients and cook covered for 2 hours at 275
Add Molasses and brown sugar (top up with beer or water if fluids are low)
Cook Covered for 1 hour at 250 then remove cover and cook for an additional hour or until the beans are the correct texture.
Cooking time is subjective depending on your oven by the end of Stage 1 the beans should be reddish and of a heavy soup or stew consistency, you may need to add a cup of water to reconstitute. I add a bottle of beer then water as needed.
Stage 2 adds the sweetness to the mix and this will also start to caramelize, darken and thicken the sauce, by the end of stage 2 the sauce should be thicker, reddish brown
Stage 3 is by feel / taste because it is uncovered it will thicken quickly and may burn so keep an eye on it and stir frequently. Remove from heat when sauce is dark brown and desired thickness.
Hint- If you really want a flavor explosion then add some Pulled Pork or Burnt Ends to this recipe (both available in my recipes)
