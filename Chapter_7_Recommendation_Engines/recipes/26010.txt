Ingredients:
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, room temperature
1 egg white
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 2/3 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
2 teaspoons grated lime zest
1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 eggs
1 cup sour cream
2/3 cup orange marmalade
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Butter a 9 inch springform pan. In a small bowl, whisk together egg yolk, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon lemon peel and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla. In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour and 1/3 cup sugar. Add butter and process until coarse crumbs form. With machine running, add yolk mixture and blend until moist clumps form. Press dough onto bottom and 1 1/2 inches up sides of prepared pan. Freeze crust 10 minutes.
Brush crust lightly with egg white. Bake until crust is pale golden, about 15 minutes. Cool on rack while preparing filling. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and 1 2/3 cups sugar until smooth. Beat in cornstarch, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, orange zest, lime zest, 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in sour cream. Pour filling into crust.
Bake in the preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes, or until puffed and cracked around edges and center moves only slightly when pan is gently shaken. Allow to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate overnight.
In a saucepan over medium heat, boil marmalade and 2 teaspoons lemon juice until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Spread warm glaze on top of cake. Chill cake 10 minutes. Remove pan sides and transfer cake to serving plate.
