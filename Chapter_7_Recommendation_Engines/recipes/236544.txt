Ingredients:
4 cups chicken broth, divided
1/4 cup matchstick-cut carrots
1 tablespoon matchstick-cut fresh ginger
2 green onions, thinly sliced with white and green parts separated
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 cup shredded cabbage
2 eggs, beaten
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat 3 1/4 cups chicken broth in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add carrots, ginger, and white parts of green onion; bring soup to a boil.
Whisk remaining 3/4 cup broth and cornstarch together in a bowl until dissolved.
Stir cabbage and green parts of green onion into the soup. Drop beaten egg, a spoonful at a time, into soup, stirring after each addition to prevent clumping. Stir cornstarch mixture into soup and season with salt and pepper. Stir soup until cornstarch thickens the soup, about 2 minutes.

Description: 
Not satisfied with many of the egg drop soup recipes I have come across here and elsewhere, I decided to try coming up with my own. It's not the prettiest looking soup around, but it is closer in taste and substance to what I was looking for. I may add some sweet corn next time I make it to add a little sweetness to it.
