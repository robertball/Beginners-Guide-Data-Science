Tomato Paste - 1/4 cup
Stevia Powder - 1 tsp
Apple Cider Vinegar - 1 Tbsp
Ginger Root, Raw - 1 Tbsp
Onion Powder - 1 tsp
Cinnamon, Ground - 1/2 tsp
Salt - 1/4 tsp
Pepper - 1/8 tsp

Directions:
Place all ingredients in a blender of food processor and blend until smooth.

Submitter: 
Smye Sarrel
Description: 
Although I prefer this with 1/4 c of honey rather than the stevia when using on the grill, this certainly gets the job done as a dipping sauce. Turns out  we use a LOT less when we brush it on before grilling, and eat a lot more of the stuff when dipping. Thus, I give you, the dipping go wild version of this tasty barbecue sauce.
