Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/8 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup white wine
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Season the chicken breasts with garlic powder, poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper. Place the breasts in a 9x13 baking dish. Whisk together the wine, Worcestershire sauce, and vegetable oil in a small bowl; pour the wine mixture over the chicken breasts. Cover the entire dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven about 45 minutes; uncover the dish and spoon the liquid from the pan over the breasts. Recover with foil and bake until the juices run clear, another 20 to 30 minutes.
