Ingredients:
1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 cup cashews, ground
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup Thai sweet chili sauce
2 tbl spicy mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Slice chicken breasts in half, lengthwise, to reduce thickness.
In a small saute pan, place honey, thai pepper sauce and mustard. Heat until just boiling, remove from heat.
Place ground cashews in a bowl.
Dip each chicken breast piece in sauce mixture, then into cashews, turning each time, to coat.
Place chicken on rack in pan.
Cook at 350 for 35 minutes, uncovered. Turn to broil for 2 or so minutes, to acheive extra crispness.
Any remaining sauce may be served over chicken or rice.
