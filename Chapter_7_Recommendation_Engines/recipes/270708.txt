Ingredients:
1 pound Italian hot sausage links
1/2 cup finely sliced green onions
1/4 cup diced onions
1/2 cup finely chopped carrots
1/2 cup finely chopped water chestnuts
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
16 spring roll wrappers
avocado oil cooking spray

Directions:
Remove casing from sausage and cook in a skillet over medium heat until slightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add green onions, onions, carrots, and water chestnuts. Cook and stir until onions are soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Season with soy sauce, salt, and ginger. Stir until filing is well combined and remove from heat.
Lay a spring roll wrapper at an angle. Place a scant 1/4 cup filling in the center of the wrapper. Fold bottom corner over filling and tuck in the sides to form a roll. Use your finger to lightly moisten edges with water. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling. Mist each roll with avocado oil spray.
Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (198 degrees C). Place lumpia rolls in the basket, making sure they are not touching; cook in batches if necessary. Fry for 4 minutes; flip and cook until skins are crispy, about 4 minutes more.
