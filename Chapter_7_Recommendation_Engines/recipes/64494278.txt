Description: 
A recipe I just recently retrieved from my Mom's original Good Housekeeping cookbook, which she bought in the late 50's or early 60's and has hung on to all this time.  The only brownies I ate growing up.    A real childhood comfort food and my favorite brownies ever!  These are cake-like, not fudge-like so please go by your tastes.
