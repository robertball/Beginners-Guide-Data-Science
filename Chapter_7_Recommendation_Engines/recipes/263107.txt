Ingredients:
Cabbage Slaw:
1/2 small head red cabbage, shredded
1/4 red onion, grated
3 tablespoons chopped cilantro
1/2 cup sour cream
1 lime, juiced, divided
1 tablespoon honey
1 chipotle chili pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
kosher salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste
Guacamole:
3 avocados
1 jalapeno pepper, minced
1/4 onion, minced
1/2 teaspoon sriracha sauce, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon dried oregano
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground red chile pepper
4 (6 ounce) tilapia fillets
1 tablespoon canola oil

Directions:
Place cabbage and red onion in large bowl with cilantro. Mix sour cream, 1/2 the lime juice, honey, chipotle pepper, cayenne pepper, kosher salt, and freshly ground black pepper together in a separate bowl. Pour dressing over the cabbage mixture. Let marinate, 30 minutes to overnight.
Combine avocados, jalapeno pepper, minced onion, and sriracha sauce in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper; mash to make the guacamole.
Combine the remaining lime juice, brown sugar, paprika, oregano, garlic powder, salt, cumin, and ground red chile in another bowl. Sprinkle evenly over tilapia fillets.
Heat oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add tilapia; cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes per side. Serve fish topped with slaw and guacamole.
