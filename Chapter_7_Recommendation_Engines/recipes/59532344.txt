Ingredients:
4 roma (plum) tomatoes, small dice
1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes, packed in oil
3 cloves minced garlic
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup fresh basil, stems removed
salt and pepper to taste
1 par baked French baguette
3/4 cup grated Parmesan/Romano cheese blend

Directions:
Preheat the oven on broiler setting.
In a large bowl, combine the roma tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt, and pepper. Allow the mixture to sit for 10 minutes.
Cut the baguette into 3/4-inch slices. On a baking sheet, arrange the baguette slices in a single layer. Broil for 1 to 2 minutes, until slightly brown.
Divide the tomato mixture evenly over the baguette slices. Top the slices with mozzarella cheese.
Broil for 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.

Description: 
Buy the par baked loaf of french bread found in your local grocers bakery section, I use either roma or vine ripened tomatoes, whichever happens to be on sale, they both work well for this recipe.  Sprinkle the tops with the grated cheese blend, its much lighter then the heavy mozzarella called for in the original recipe and doesn't mask the tomato flavor.Modified from: Double Tomato Bruschetta
