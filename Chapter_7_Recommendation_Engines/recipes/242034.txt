Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 cups rolled oats
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1/4 cup flax seed meal
2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup honey
2 egg whites
4 teaspoons almond butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 ounces semisweet chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 2 baking sheets with cooking spray.
Whisk oats, pastry flour, flax meal, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda together in a large bowl. Stir honey, egg whites, almond butter, and vanilla extract into oats mixture until dough is well-blended; mix in chocolate chips. Scoop dough into 36 balls and place on prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden and set, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, lightly loosen each cookie from the baking sheet, and continue cooling on the baking sheets for another 10 minutes.

Description: 
In an effort to find clean, healthy treats, I fell upon a few recipes about a year ago that inspired me. So I started playing around with ingredients and tweaking it each time. I finally produced something that my kids and husband love. In fact, I make a batch at least two times a week. I call them breakfast cookies because they are healthy enough to eat in the morning! No sugar added, naturally sweetened with honey and chocolate chips to lure the kids. No preservatives or additives, just wholesome goodness!
