Description: 
I'm only submitting this ridiculously simple recipe because I've been making this since I was a kid. It's one of my favorite sandwiches, however, when I request this in a restaurant/diner; they look at my like I've got two heads! They think I'm asking for a Tuna Melt (which is different) so it ends up taking me a good five minutes to explain that all I want is a grilled cheese with tuna!
