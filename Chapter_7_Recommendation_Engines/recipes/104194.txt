Ingredients:
2 cups half and half
1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
1 cup sugar
6 tablespoons cocoa
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon Morton® Table Salt
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)
Morton® Rock Salt for Making Ice Cream*
Crushed ice*

Directions:
Combine ingredients; mix well. Pour into freezer container. Freeze according to Freezing Directions.
Follow manufacturer's instructions for assembling ice cream maker. Fill freezer tub with a mixture of one (1) part Morton(R) Rock Salt for Making Ice Cream and eight (8) parts crushed ice to a level well above the line of the mixture in the ice cream container. Pack ice down firmly and let stand 5 minutes. For a hand-cranked model, turn crank slowly, increasing speed as the mixture begins to freeze. When the ice cream is frozen, the crank will be difficult to turn. Electric ice cream makers will shut off automatically. To harden the ice cream, remove the dasher; seal container. Drain off ice and salt mixture; repack freezer tub with a mixture of three (3) parts crushed ice to one (1) part rock salt. Let stand at least 1 hour.
