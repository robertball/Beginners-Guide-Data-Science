Ingredients:
4 (7-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1/4 cup hoisin sauce
1/2 cup soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 small red chilies, chopped
2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/3 cup water
Steamed rice (optional)
Steamed vegetables (optional)

Directions:
Combine hoisin, soy sauce, garlic, chilies and brown sugar in bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat. Set aside for 10 minutes to marinate
Heat large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken (reserving marinade) and cook until no longer pink in centers (about 5 or 6 minutes per side). Remove chicken from pan; cover and keep warm.
Add reserved marinade. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and cook until thick and syrupy (at least 5 minutes). Serve chicken over rice, drizzled with sauce.
