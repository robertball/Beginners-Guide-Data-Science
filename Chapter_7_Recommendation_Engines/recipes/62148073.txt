Ingredients:
1 onion, minced
1 bell pepper, chopped
2 tsp garlic
1 tsp olive oil
2 tbsp butter
1 cup water
2 chicken bouillon cubes
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 1/2 cups pepper jack cheese shredded
1 chipotle in adobo sauce (these are very spicy so start with one)
1 tsp cumin
2 cans corn
1/2 cup mild salsa (chipotles give it the spice so watch out if putting medium or hot salsa)
2 tbsp chopped cilantro

Directions:
Saute onion, garlic and pepper in olive oil and butter until tender.
Add water, cumin and bouillon cubes to the mixture;
Bring to boil then simmer.
Meanwhile in a blender or magic bullet add 1/2 can of corn, 1-2 chipotles, and 1/2 cup of the cream until well blended and thick.
Add this mixture to the pot, along with the rest of the cream, cheese, corn and salsa.
Add cilantro last.
Serve with crusty bread
You could always add a rotisserie chicken chopped up and serve with tortilla chips :)
