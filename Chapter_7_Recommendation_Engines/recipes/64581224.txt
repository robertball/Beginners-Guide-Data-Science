Ingredients:
FOR CHICKEN MARINADE
2 chicken breasts, cut into strips
1tbsp ground coriander
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
4tbsp vegetable oil
2tbsp clear honey
FOR PEANUT SAUCE
1tbsp vegetable oil
2tbsp Patak's mild curry paste
2tbsp brown sugar
2tbsp peanut butter (be generous)
200ml coconut milk

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix chicken strips, ground coriander, chopped garlic, 4tbsp veg oil, and honey. Leave to marinade while preparing the sauce.
Prepare your choice of rice (I prefer Basmati but it also goes very well with jasmine rice.)
Heat 1tbsp vegetable oil in a pan. Add the curry paste, brown sugar, and peanut butter.
When all combined, slowly add the coconut milk and bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat. Allow to simmer for 5 min.
Meanwhile, heat a large frying pan and fry the chicken with the sauce until cooked.
Mix in with the sauce and serve over basmati or jasmine rice.
