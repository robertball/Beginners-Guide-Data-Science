Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons boiling water
1 1/2 teaspoons instant coffee powder
1/2 cup smooth apricot jam
1/4 cup milk
2 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups cake flour
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
Combine butter and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
Stir boiling water and coffee powder in a small bowl until coffee is dissolved. Stir in apricot jam. Mix into the creamed butter mixture.
Stir milk and baking soda in a small bowl until baking soda is dissolved. Add vanilla extract. Stir into the creamed butter mixture.
Combine cake flour and salt in a bowl; add to the creamed butter mixture. Stir well until a dough forms.
Fill a cookie press with dough. Pipe dough onto the baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
These biscuits can be described as 'uzo uzwa ienergy' which is 'You will feel the energy' in a South African language. These biscuits can be eaten after a hard day of work or when you seriously need a pick-me-up. They will not appeal to children too much (maybe teenagers) but are a firm adult favorite.
