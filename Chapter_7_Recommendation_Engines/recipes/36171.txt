Ingredients:
4 eggs, separated
1 cup butter
1 2/3 cups white sugar
1 cup brewed black tea, cold
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
1/3 cup dry bread crumbs
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup chopped hazelnuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch Bundt pan.
In a large bowl, cream together the egg yolks, butter and white sugar until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in the black tea. Toss together the flour, baking powder, bread crumbs, cocoa powder, and hazelnuts; fold into the tea mixture until just incorporated.
In a large clean glass or metal bowl, whip the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold the egg whites into the tea batter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake for 60 to 70 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the center, comes out clean. Cool cake in the pan for at least 20 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely.

This is an Austrian recipe that was passed on from one generation to the next in my family. The secret of this cake's full flavour and softness: Prepare it one day in advance before eating it!
