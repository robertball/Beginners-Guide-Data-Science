Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 cup vegetable shortening
3 tablespoons Almond Breeze Vanilla almondmilk, or more as needed
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
3/4 cup honey
2/3 cup Almond Breeze Vanilla almondmilk
4 eggs
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees F.
In medium bowl, mix flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt. With pastry blender or 2 knives, cut shortening into flour until texture is crumbly. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the almondmilk over mixture and mix with fork until mixture comes together in a ball. If necessary, sprinkle a little more almondmilk over the mixture.
Sprinkle a little flour over a 12-inch square of waxed paper. Place ball of dough in center; pat into disc. Sprinkle with flour and top with another square of waxed paper. Roll very thinly into 12-inch circle. Remove top piece of waxed paper and turn crust upside down over a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Fit into pie plate and remove waxed paper. Crimp edges.
To make the filling, beat the rest of the ingredients and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt with electric mixer on low speed in a large bowl until well-mixed. Pour into crust.
Bake 50 to 55 minutes or until knife inserted 1 inch from edge comes out clean. Cover edges of crust with strips of foil to keep from over-browning, if necessary. Cool completely, about 2 hours. Store in refrigerator.
