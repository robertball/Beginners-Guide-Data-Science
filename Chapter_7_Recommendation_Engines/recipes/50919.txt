Ingredients:
2 cups biscuit baking mix
2/3 cup water
3 cups chili with beans
1/2 pound hot dogs, sliced
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together the baking mix and water to form a smooth dough. Set aside.
Spread half of the chili into the bottom of a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish. Make a layer of the hot dogs over the chili. Cover the hot dog layer with cheese, then top with the rest of the chili. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the biscuit dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Lay the dough over the contents of the dish, and poke a few slits to vent steam.
Bake for 15 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top crust is golden.

Description: 
This is a good way to get a good hot meal on the table on weeknights.  I serve it with raw veggies and dip. It is also an ideal way to use up leftover chili.
