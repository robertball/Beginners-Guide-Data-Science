Description: 
Yellow raisins and pecans. This makes a very tasty hand pie.  My mother used to make this when I was a kid.  Eggs were 15 cents per dozen, butter 15 cents per pound.  She considered this expensive, and only made this for special occasions--church socials etc.  My mother never cut this pie smaller than quarters.
