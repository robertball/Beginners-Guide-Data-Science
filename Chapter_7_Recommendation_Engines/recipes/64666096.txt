Ingredients:
1# breakfast sausage
3 TBS unsalted butter
3 TBS  AP flour
Salt to taste
1 TBS black pepper
2 tsp granulated garlic powder
5-6 Cups whole milk

Directions:
In a sauce pan over medium high heat add Sausage and cook crumbling as you go until browned.  Add butter and flour and cook over medium heat for about 3-5 minutes. Add salt pepper and garlic cook for 1 minute.  Then add the cold milk all at once.  Whisk or stir constantly until the mixture comes to a boil.  Once the mixture boils keep sturing until the gravy can coat the back of a metal spoon. Add more salt as needed to taste. Allow gravy to stand for a few minutes before serving. If you desire a thinner gravy add more milk. If you want a thicker gravy continue to cook until the desired thickness is reached. But remember this will thicken as it cools so I recommend taking it off the heat alittle early and allowing it to thicken as it cools.
