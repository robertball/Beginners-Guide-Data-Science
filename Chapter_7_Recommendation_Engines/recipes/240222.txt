Ingredients:
butter for greasing
1/2 cup honey
2 tablespoons milk
9 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices
1/4 cup grated fresh ginger
3 tablespoons grapeseed oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cardamom
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly butter a large baking dish.
Whisk honey and milk together in a bowl until smooth.
Place sweet potatoes in a large bowl. Add honey-milk mixture to sweet potatoes and toss to coat; soak for 10 minutes. Drain 1/2 of the liquid from the bowl.
Mix ginger, rosemary, grapeseed oil, cardamom, black pepper, cloves, and salt with the sweet potatoes until coated. Spread potatoes in a single layer in the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Flip potatoes and continue cooking until tender and browned, about 20 minutes more.
