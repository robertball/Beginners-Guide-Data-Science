Ingredients:
5 raspberries
1/2 ounce Lemon Thyme Simple Syrup (recipe below) or other simple syrup
1/2 ounce fresh lemon juice
Ice
11/2 ounces raspberry vodka
Plain or citrusy sparkling water (such as lime La Croix) or club soda as needed
1 lemon thyme (or regular thyme) sprig
1/2 slice lemon

Directions:
Use a muddler or a wooden spoon to mash 3 of the raspberries with the syrup and lemon juice in the bottom of a tall narrow glass. Fill glass with ice, add vodka and stir vigorously with a long spoon until well chilled. Fill glass with sparkling water. Top with remaining raspberries, thyme sprig, and lemon. Cheers!
Lemon Thyme Simple Syrup: Heat 1 cup sugar,  1 cup water, and 1 small bunch of lemon thyme sprigs in a small saucepan, stirring, until bubbles form and sugar is dissolved. Let steep in pan off the heat 10 minutes, strain out thyme, and store syrup in fridge. Makes about 11/2 cups.

Description: 
A fruity summer cocktail that's a good way to use fancy herbs and that totally random  raspberry vodka someone left at your last party. It's also a pretty nifty cocktail to serve to friends named Lucy on their birthdays. :)
