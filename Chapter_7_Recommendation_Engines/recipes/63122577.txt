Ingredients:
Stirfry:
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1/4 cup onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
1/3 cup each of: chopped carrots, broccoli, zucchini and any other vegetable of your choice
1/2 cup cubed tofu or paneer (optional)
1 can coconut milk
3 tbsp fresh pesto
Rice:
1 cup basmati rice
2 cups filtered water
pinch of salt
Garnish:
1 cup julienned purple cabbage
Juice of 1/2 lemon
1 tsp salt
1 tsp vegetable oil.

Directions:
Bring the rice, water, and salt to a boil in a pot with a lid then cover and reduce heat to low. Total cooking time for the rice should not exceed 20 minutes.
Next, gently sautee the garlic and onion in the oil until translucent. Add the chopped vegetables, tofu, coconut milk, and pesto. Stir to combine and then simmer for 7 minutes. The veggies should be tender-crisp.
While the veggies are cooking, mix the cabbage with lemon juice, salt, and vegetable oil. Set aside.
Serve 1/4 of the rice with a large scoop of the vegetables. The marinated, julienned cabbage is a lovely garnish and texture dynamic when placed on top.

Description: 
This is a very creamy pesto dish, but totally vegetarian (vegan if the pesto you buy doesn't have cheese). Try the sauce on pasta or over grilled meats or tofu.
