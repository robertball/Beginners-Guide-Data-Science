Ingredients:
3 large beets
2 Tbs olive oil
2 tsp sea salt
2 tsp white pepper for a spicier flair or black corn pepper

Directions:
Take a large (3 qt) saute pan with lid, fill half-way with water and heat on high to bring to a boil.
Wearing an apron (beets stain clothes) remove the beet skins and cut beats into 1 inch cubes.
Once the water begins to boil, turn it down to medium high and carefully slide beets into the water.
Cook for 15-25 minutes, depending on how crunchy or soft you like your beets. Remove and drain in a large colander. Place beets a large bowl.
Add 2  Tbsp olive oil, 2 tsp salt and 2 tsp. pepper. Adjust to your taste.
Place in the fridge for 1 hr to chill.
Enjoy!
