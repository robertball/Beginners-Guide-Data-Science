Ingredients:
Pickled Radishes:
3/4 cup white vinegar
3/4 cup water
3 tablespoons honey
2 teaspoons salt
1 bunch radishes, cubed
1/2 teaspoon whole mustard seeds
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 bay leaf
Seasoning Mix:
1 pinch coarse sea salt
1 pinch furikake (Japanese nori seasoning) (optional)
1 pinch toasted sesame seeds
Toast:
1 avocado, cut into 1/4-inch dice
2 slices whole-grain bread
1 bunch sprouted cilantro
1 lemon wedge

Directions:
Bring vinegar, water, honey, and salt to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove from heat.
Put radishes, mustard seeds, black pepper, and bay leaf in a pint jar with a lid. Pour hot vinegar mixture over the radishes. Let the radishes come to room temperature. Cover with lid and place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Mix coarse sea salt, furikake, and sesame seeds together in a small bowl to create the seasoning mix.
Toast bread until lightly brown, about 2 minutes. Top each slice with half the avocado. Top avocado with a portion of the pickled radishes. Sprinkle half the seasoning mix over radishes. Place a small handful of cilantro on top. Squeeze lemon over the toast.
