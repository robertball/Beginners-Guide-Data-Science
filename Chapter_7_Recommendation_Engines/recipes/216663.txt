Ingredients:
2 teaspoons tahini, divided
3 cups semolina flour
1 cup white sugar
1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
1/4 cup butter
2 cups plain yogurt
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
Syrup:
2 1/2 cups water
2 cups white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Smooth 1 teaspoon of tahini over the bottom of an 8-inch baking pan.
Mix semolina flour, 1 cup sugar, coconut, and butter together in a bowl.
Mix yogurt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl; stir until bubbly. Pour into the semolina mixture; combine batter well using your hands.
Pour batter into the prepared pan; dab the remaining 1 teaspoon tahini on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cake is set, 30 to 35 minutes.
Combine water and 2 cups sugar in a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil; stir to dissolve sugar. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Pour 1/2 cup of syrup over the baked cake.

Description: 
This recipe came all the way from Jerusalem, Palestine--especially for the month of Ramadan--from my aunt. This semolina has a special texture and is by far the best I've had so far. 
Enjoy!
