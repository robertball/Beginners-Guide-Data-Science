Ingredients:
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 onion, finely chopped
1 cup finely chopped cooked ham
1 cup finely chopped corned beef
1/2 clove garlic, crushed
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups sauerkraut, drained and minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup beef broth
1 egg
2 cups milk
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
4 cups fine dry bread crumbs
1 quart oil for frying

Directions:
In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-low heat. Add onion and cook until softened. Stir in ham, corned beef and garlic.  Cook mixture, stirring constantly for 1 minute.  Stir in 6 tablespoons flour and cook mixture over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes.
Stir in sauerkraut, parsley, and broth; cook for 3 minutes or until thickened and paste-like.  Spread mixture on a platter and chill for at least 3 hours.
Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a bowl, whisk together the egg, milk and 2 1/2 cups flour.  Shape the sauerkraut mixture by level teaspoons in to balls, dip them into the egg mixture and roll them in the bread crumbs.
Fry balls in batches for 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown.  Transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve warm.
