Ingredients:
4 oz unsweetened chocolate
1 pound powdered sugar (3 1/2 to 4 cups)
1 stick butter, room temp

1/3 cup milk

Directions:
Melt chocolate in microwave in high 1 1/2 to 2 minutes
Stir until all chocolate is completely melted and let rest until about at room temp (5 minutes or so)
Add powdered sugar, vanilla, and butter.
Beat with mixer, slowly adding milk, until you go a bit runnier than desired texture (frosting sets up in fridge)

Description: 
I'm calling this Tasty Kake Frosting, but the recipe itself is right off the Bakers Unsweetened Chocolate package.  John loved this frosting as it reminded him of Tasty Kakes - - - use only if planning to refrigerate cake as it takes a while to set up and is much better chilled than at room temp.
