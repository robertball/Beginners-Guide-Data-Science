1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1/2 medium head cabbage, shredded
5 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, sugar, ramen noodle spice mix, salt and pepper to create a dressing.
Place sesame seeds and almonds in a single layer on a medium baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 10 minutes, or until lightly brown.
In a large salad bowl, combine the cabbage, green onions and crushed ramen noodles. Pour dressing over the cabbage, and toss to coat evenly. Top with toasted sesame seeds and almonds.
