Ingredients:
2 lbs Pork Temple Cutlets
2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1 can of cream of mushroom soup
1/2 tbsp minced garlic
1 tbsp butter
1/4 tsp salt
pepper to taste

Directions:
In a good sized skillet on medium heat melt butter and add minced garlic. Saute until garlic is starting to caramelize slightly.
Stir in soup, Worcestershire, salt and pepper. Then add cutlets making sure they get covered in the sauce and cover skillet.
Cook on medium for about 10-15 minutes or until juices from meat runs clear, stirring often.
When meat is done use a slotted spoon to remove meat from sauce and cover to keep warm.
The sauce should be pretty runny at this point so turn the temperature up to medium-high and using a whisk to stir almost constantly,reduce the sauce until starts to darken slightly in color and becomes thicker like a gravy.
Take off the the heat and add meat back to sauce making sure all pieces get recovered in sauce.
Serve immediately.
Goes very well served over rice or egg noodles

Description: 
I noticed when I was on here looking for a new way to try cooking temple cutlets, that there are no recipes for them on here or anywhere else online(trust me google came up with nothing) So I decided to add my go to recipe for them. Temple cutlets are a hard to find cut in most places, in the part of the Midwest where I am from they are readily available.  If you can not find in the meat case of your local grocery ask somebody at the meat counter they should be able to get you some. I hope putting this on here opens others to trying these and adding their own recipes for them.
