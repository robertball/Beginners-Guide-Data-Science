Ingredients:
Cake:
1 tablespoon instant espresso powder
1 tablespoon hot water
3/4 cup LAND O LAKES® Unsalted Butter
6 ounces high-quality bittersweet chocolate baking bar, broken into small pieces
1 cup sugar
3 LAND O LAKES® Eggs
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
Espresso Whipped Cream:
1 teaspoon instant espresso powder
1 teaspoon hot water
1 cup LAND O LAKES® Heavy Whipping Cream, chilled
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons powdered sugar
1/8 teaspoon extra fine edible glitter

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F.
