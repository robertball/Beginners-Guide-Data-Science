Ingredients:
240g plain flour
2 egg yolks, beaten
1/8 teaspoon salt
Water as needed

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, mix the flour, egg yolks and salt with your hands. Add water as needed to form a ball. Knead until smooth.
Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out on a floured surface until it is thin enough to wrap the filling mixture. Cut the dough into 7.5x7.5cm squares.
To make the wantans, place 1 tablespoon of the filling in the middle of a wrapper and gather the edges on top. Twist to seal. Repeat until all the filling or all the wrappers are used up.
