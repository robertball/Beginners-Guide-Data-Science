1 large potato or 2 medium white potatoes - boiled & smashed
1 egg
1/2 tbsp of garlic powder
1/4 cup of finely chopped onion
1 tbsp of dijon mustard
1-2 tbsp of bread crumbs
1 tsp of italian seasoning or Old bay seasoning
1/4 tsp of cayenne
1-2 tbsp of olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients (minus the oil) in a bowl until it's well combined.
Proceed as you would with making burgers and scoop out handful and form patties.
Heat a skillet to medium heat and add the olive oil.
Pan-sear the patties until they brown and crisp up. Flip them over and do the same on the other side. It only takes a few minutes each side.
