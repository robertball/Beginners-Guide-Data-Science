1 pound boneless skinlesschicken breasts -- cut into strips
1/2 red or green bell pepper, cut in strips
2 tablespoons oil
1 can chicken broth
8 ounces tomato sauce
1 package taco seasoning mix

tortilla chips

Directions:
In a skillet with a cover, saute the chicken and pepper strips in the oil until chicken is opaque and peppers are tender.
Add chicken broth, tomato sauce, and taco seasoning mix. Bring to a boil and simmer, covered for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the instant rice, cover, remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes, until rice is tender.
Fluff with a fork, sprinkle with cheese and serve immediately, with tortilla chips, and fat-free sour cream if desired.
