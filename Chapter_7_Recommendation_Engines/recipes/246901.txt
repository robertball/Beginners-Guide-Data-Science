Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
3 stalks rhubarb, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 cups gluten-free flour blend
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup yogurt
1/2 cup coconut oil, melted
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter in a large cast iron skillet or Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add sugar and rhubarb; cook until rhubarb is soft, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat.
Mix gluten-free flour, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add yogurt, coconut oil, egg, and vanilla extract; stir thoroughly until batter is combined.
Drop cake batter over rhubarb mixture in the skillet. Spread it out gently until mostly smooth.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
Run a knife around the edges, place a plate on top and carefully invert cake onto the plate.

Description: 
This recipe is a major hit, always. 

If you want to use regular flour instead of the gluten-free, it will work very well. I did it that way for 30 years before we went gluten-free. Serve warm or at room temperature. I serve it with vanilla kefir from Grace Harbor FarmsÂ® on the top.
