Ingredients:
1 bunch kale
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Tear the kale leaves into bite-size pieces from the thick stems; discard the stems.
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir the garlic in the hot oil until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the kale and continue cooking and stirring until the kale is bright green and wilted, about 5 minutes more.
