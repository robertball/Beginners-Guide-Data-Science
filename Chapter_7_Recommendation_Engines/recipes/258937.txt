Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
½ cup butter-flavored shortening
1  egg
½ teaspoon vanilla extract
1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon baking soda
¼ teaspoon salt

Directions:
Mix sugar, shortening, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until well combined.
Stir flour, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; mix into sugar-shortening mixture until a dough forms.
Form dough into a roll 2 inches in diameter; wrap in waxed paper and twist the ends to seal. Chill dough until firm, about 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Unwrap dough; use a thin, sharp knife to make 1/8-inch slices. Place cookies on an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 8 to 10 minutes.
