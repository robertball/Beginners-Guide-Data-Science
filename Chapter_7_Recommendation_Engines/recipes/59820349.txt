Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1 TBS chili powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 can Rotel tomatoes
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
1 (15 ounce) can chili without beans
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
6 (12 inch) flour tortillas, warmed
2 cups shredded lettuce
1 cup chopped tomatoes
2 cups shredded Mexican blend cheese
1/2 cup chopped green onions

Directions:
Crumble ground beef into a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until evenly browned. Add onion, and cook until translucent. Drain grease, and season with chili powder salt and pepper. Stir in the rotel and refried beans until well blended. Turn off heat, but keep warm.
In a saucepan, combine the chili without beans, with a little tomato sauce. Mix well, and cook over medium heat until heated through. Turn off heat and keep warm.
Place a warmed tortilla on a plate, and spoon a generous 1/2 cup of the ground beef mixture onto the center. Roll up tortilla over the filling. Spoon a generous amount of the sauce over the top, and sprinkle with cheese and green onions. Line each buritto in a 9X13 inch pan.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes.
