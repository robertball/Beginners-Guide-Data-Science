Ingredients:
1/2 cup maraschino cherries, drained and cut into quarters
1/3 cup reserved cherry juice
1/3 cup water
1 1/4 cups flour
1 1/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
2/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 eggs
1/2 tsp almond extract
1/2 cup miniature chocolate chips
1 1/2 cups vanilla frosting
12 chocolate-covered cherries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350*.  Line 12 muffin cups with cupcake liners or grease bottoms and sides of cups.  In a small bowl, combine the cherry juice and water; set aside.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.  In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar until fluffy.  Beat in eggs and almond extract.  Add flour mixture, alternating with juice mixture, beating on medium speed until combined.
In a small bowl, dredge the cherry pieces and chocolate chips in a bit of flour; fold into batter.
Divide batter among muffin cups and bake 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out with a few crumbs.  Cool pan on a wire rack 5 minutes; remove cupcakes onto rack.  Cool completely.
Ice cupcakes with vanilla frosting.  Top with a chocolate covered cherry and store in the refrigerator.
