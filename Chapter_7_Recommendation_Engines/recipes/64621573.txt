Ingredients:
6 oz. Organic Valley Cream Cheese, softened
3 large eggs, room temperature
2 Tbsp Lifesource oat fiber
1 Tbsp psyllium husk powder
1 Tbsp Kraft Shredded Parmesan (powdered)
1 Tbsp Bobs Red Mill Golden Flax Meal
1 tsp Bread Machine Yeast
1.5 tsp. Rumford baking powder
1/2 tsp Swerve Sweetener, granular

Directions:
Line baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
Soften cream cheese in microwave just until it begins to melt and can be stirred (about 30-35 seconds).  Add eggs and whisk until you have a  creamy consistency.  Add the dry ingredients and whisk well.  Let rest for 10 minutes.
While the dough is resting and thickening, preheat the oven to 350F.
After 10 minutes, the dough should be stiff.  Divide into 6 portions and scoop onto baking sheet.  Using wet fingers, shape dough into desired shape and smooth the top.
Bake for 30 minutes; tops will be lightly browned, and bun will be springy to touch.
Transfer to cooling rack.
NOTE: This dough is amazing!  It's light, fluffy, moist, and tastes very close to traditional bread.  The mix makes 6 burger, sandwich, or hot dog buns; or 12 dinner  rolls.
