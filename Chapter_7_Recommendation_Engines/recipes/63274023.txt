Ingredients:
18-24 vanilla wafer cookies
16 oz. cream cheese, softened
1 1/4 c. sugar
1/3 c. cocoa
2 T. flour
3 eggs
1 c. (8 oz.) sour cream
1/2 t. almond extract
Canned cherry pie filling

Directions:
Line muffin pans with foil-laminated baking cups. Place one vanilla wafer on the bottom of each cup.
In a large bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth and lump-free. Add sugar, cocoa and flour and beat until smooth.
Add eggs and sour cream, and beat well.
Add extract. Measure out into prepared cupcake tins until they're almost full.
Bake for 20-25 minute at 325 degrees. Remove from oven; cool 5-10 minutes.
Spread heaping teaspoonfuls of sour cream topping (8 oz. sour cream, 2 T. sugar, and 1 t. vanilla extract; stir until dissolved) on each cup.
Cool completely in the pans; refrigerate. Garnish with a dollop of cherry pie filling just before serving.
