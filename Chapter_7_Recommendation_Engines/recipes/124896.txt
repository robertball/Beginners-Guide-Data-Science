Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves, cut into thin strips
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and well drained
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup, undiluted
3/4 cup milk
1 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
8 (8 inch) flour tortillas
Minced fresh parsley

Directions:
Coat a large skillet with nonstick cooking spray; cook and stir chicken and onion over medium heat for 6-8 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink. Remove from the heat; add spinach and mix well. In a bowl, combine soup, milk, sour cream and seasonings; mix well. Stir 3/4 cup into chicken and spinach mixture. Divide evenly among tortillas. Roll up and place, seam side down, in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan that has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Pour the remaining soup mixture over enchiladas. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Uncover and sprinkle with cheese; return to the oven for 15 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly. Garnish with parsley.

My husband is a pastor, so I fix meals for large groups often. This one is a favorite and a nice change from the usual beef enchiladas.
