Description: 
Fresh cilantro and cayenne give this tasty guacamole a kick. Makes four servings.
This is best used within the day, put the avocado pit in the dip and seal it tightly (to keep air from getting to it) to keep it from turning brown.  I also add a little olive oil to make it smoother in consistency.Modified from: Guacamole
