Ingredients:
1/2 c. all-purpose flour
8 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, pounded to uniform thinness
1/2 c. olive oil
2 T. butter
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium onion, chopped
3/4 c. wine (red or white)
3 (14.5 oz.) cans crushed tomatoes

1/4 c. chopped fresh parsley, divided, plus more for garnish

Stir in tomatoes, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Reduce heat to low and cook for 30 minutes. Add 1/8 cup parsley and Â½ cup Parmesan.
