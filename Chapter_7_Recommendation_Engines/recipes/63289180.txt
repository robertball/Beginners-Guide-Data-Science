Ingredients:
6 slices bacon, diced
2 leeks, whites only, sliced
1 onion, chopped
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
2 large potatoes, diced
6 cups frozen corn kernels
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into cubes
3 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
2 cups half-and-half
salt to taste

Directions:
In a large pot, cook bacon until crisp.  Remove bacon from the pan, and set aside.  Drain all but 1 tablespoons of the bacon fat from the pan.
Saute the onions in the bacon fat.  Add broth and the potato to the pot.  Cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.
Puree 2 cups of corn with 1 cup of the onion/broth mixture.  Set aside.
Add 4 cups of corn, chicken, and thyme.  Cover.  Simmer until the chicken is cooked and the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
Stir pureed corn & half and half into the soup, and simmer for 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Ladle into bowls, and sprinkle with the bacon and scallions.  Serve.
