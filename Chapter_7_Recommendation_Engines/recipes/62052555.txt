Ingredients:
4 medium sliced green tomatoes ( about 1/4" thick)
1/4 cup cornmeal
1/4 cup flour
1 egg
1/2-1 cup milk
1/2 cup oil for frying

Directions:
Mix all ingredients except tomatoes and oil.  Until batter is fairly thick.  Dip each slice of tomato into mixture and fry until golden brown on each side.  Drain in a colander with tomatoes standing up not lying flat, this keeps them crisper longer.
