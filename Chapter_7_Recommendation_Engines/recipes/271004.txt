Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
¾ cup white sugar
2  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
¾ teaspoon salt
¾ teaspoon baking soda
2 cups Easter-colored candy-coated chocolate pieces (such as M&M;'s®)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat butter and sugars together in a large bowl on medium speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs and vanilla extract. Add flour, salt, and baking soda and mix on low speed. Stir in milk chocolate candies.
Refrigerate dough for 1 hour for best results.
Scoop tablespoons of dough onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten slightly with your palm.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are flattened and light brown, 8 to 14 minutes. Cool on the cookie sheet for a few minutes, then remove and place on a cooling rack.
