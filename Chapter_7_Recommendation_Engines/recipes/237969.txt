Ingredients:
Gigi sauce
1 tablespoon butter
1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms, sliced
3/4 cup small prosciutto cubes
1 medium red bell pepper, diced
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1 1/2 cups homemade or store-bought tomato sauce
3/4 cup 15% or 18% cream
1/4 cup grated Canadian Parmesan cheese
2 green onions, minced
fresh basil, minced, to taste
Gnocchi
1 1/4 cups Canadian ricotta cheese
3/4 cup fresh basil, well packed
1/3 cup grated Canadian Parmesan cheese
1 egg
salt and pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
additional flour to make the gnocchi
1 teaspoon olive oil

Directions:
Prepare the sauce. In a large frying pan or skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, add a small amount of salt, add some pepper, and brown for a few minutes. Add the prosciutto cubes, pepper and garlic and continue cooking for a few minutes. Pour in the tomato sauce, cover, and simmer on low heat for 10 minutes. Add the cream, the Parmesan, green onion, and basil. Reheat and serve with the gnocchi.
Place all ingredients, except for the flour and olive oil, in the bowl of a food processor and mix until smooth. Add the flour and pulse just enough to mix everything up. Place the dough on a floured work surface and gently work the dough. Shape into balls the size of a marble. Using a fork, press the balls while rolling slightly; flour the fork if it gets too sticky.
In a pot of boiling salted water, cook half of the gnocchi at a time for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and continue with the 2nd half. Serve immediately or sprinkle with a bit of olive oil.

Description: 
Gnocchi are so easy to make, children can have fun putting them together and eating them up. Gnocchi can also be served as a side dish to a meat main course; in this case, omit the sauce and simply replace with melted butter and herbs or garlic.
