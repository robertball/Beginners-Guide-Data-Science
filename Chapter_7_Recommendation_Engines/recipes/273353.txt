Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 small zucchini, thinly sliced
1 small yellow squash, thinly sliced
1 small onion, slivered
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 (15 ounce) can vegetarian refried beans
8 (8 inch) whole wheat tortillas
1/2 cup reduced-fat shredded Cheddar cheese
2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed
1 cup salsa

Directions:
Spray a nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Add zucchini, squash, and onion; cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add garlic. Continue cooking until vegetables are tender, about 2 minutes more.
Spread a scant 1/4 cup refried beans over each tortilla. Set 4 tortillas aside to be the tops of the quesadillas. Spoon 1/4 of the vegetable mixture over the remaining 4 tortillas. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons Cheddar cheese over the vegetables. Cover with the reserved tortillas, bean-side down.
Wipe skillet out with a paper towel. Heat oil in the skillet over low heat. Add 1 quesadilla. Cook until browned and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining quesadillas. Serve each quesadilla with 1/4 cup salsa.

Description: 
These are delicious and very filling! The small amount of cheese really goes a long way - they taste cheesy but aren't oozing and loaded with fat. They also contain lots of fiber. For a very nutritious and yummy meal, I eat half of one, a salad with avocado, and an orange.
