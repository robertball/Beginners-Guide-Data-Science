Ingredients:
Pork Shoulder Roast 6 to 7 lbs
2 medium onions sliced into thick strips
2 tablespoons oil
Salt/Pepper to taste
Seasoned Salt or Pork Rub
2 cloves garlic minced
3 cubes chicken or pork bouillon
3 cups water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Heat oil in a dutch oven on medium heat. Add onions and saute until caramelized, about 10 minutes.
While onions caramelize, rub pork liberally with salt/pepper and season salt or pork rub. Remove onions to a plate. Add roast to dutch oven and brown well on all sides. Add cooked onions, garlic, water, and bouillon to the dutch oven. Cover dutch oven with the lid and place in preheated oven for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes reduce heat to 265 degrees. Cook an additional 5 hours or until internal temperature of pork registers between 170 and 205. Remove from oven, allow to rest 20 minutes and serve.
