Ingredients:
1 pound chicken tenders
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons freshly grated ginger
2 teaspoons fish sauce
1 lime, juiced
16 thin metal skewers
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 scallion, chopped

Directions:
Slice chicken in half lengthwise to get thin pieces. Prick lightly using a fork or a knife to help tenderize.
Combine soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, fish sauce, and lime juice in a large bowl, resealable plastic container, or large zip-top bag. Add chicken tenders, making sure marinade fully covers chicken. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade and thread onto metal skewers.
Meanwhile, add marinade to a small saucepan with cornstarch and bring to a boil. Boil until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off heat and transfer sauce to a small bowl for dipping.
Grill skewers on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the centers, about 5 minutes per side. Garnish with scallion and serve with sauce on the side.
