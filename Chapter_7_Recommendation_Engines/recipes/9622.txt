Ingredients:
5 1/3 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 pinch salt
3 tablespoons boiling water
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream the butter.  Add in cocoa, salt and boiling water, stirring until smooth.
Add powdered sugar and beat until frosting reaches a spreadable consistency.  If frosting seems too thick, add water.  If it seems too thin, add powdered sugar.
Spread on cooled cookies, such as Frosted Chocolate Walnut Goodies.
