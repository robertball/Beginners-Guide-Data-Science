Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup finely chopped walnuts
1 (6 ounce) bag HERSHEY®'S KISSES® Milk Chocolates
1 cup powdered sugar

Directions:
Beat butter, granulated sugar and vanilla in large bowl until fluffy.  Add flour and walnuts; beat on low speed of mixer until well blended.  Cover; refrigerate 1 to 2 hours or until dough is firm enough to handle.
Remove wrappers from chocolate pieces.  Heat oven to 375 degrees F.  Using about 1 tablespoon dough for each cookie, shape dough around each chocolate piece; roll in hand to make ball.  (Be sure to cover each chocolate piece completely.)  Place on ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until cookies are set but not browned.  Cool slightly; remove from cookie sheet to wire rack.  While still slightly warm, roll in powdered sugar.  Cool completely.  Store in tightly covered container.  Roll again in powdered sugar just before serving.  About 3 dozen cookies.
