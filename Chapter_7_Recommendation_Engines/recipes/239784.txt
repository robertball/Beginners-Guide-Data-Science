Description: 
This would make quite an eye-catching appetizer tray for your upcoming Halloween party. Come on, what kid wouldn't think you were the coolest parent ever, if you made some of these? Be sure to tear the cheese sticks in half as irregularly as possible, as this really gives it that stomach-turning realism. You can use ketchup instead of hot sauce, if desired.
