2 cups water
2 cups of coarsely grated kosher dill pickles (Claussen is what we use)

1 Tablespoon dried dill weed
1 Tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tsp salt

Directions:
In large saucepan, boil the water.
Add pasta and lower heat to medium, cook for approximately 15 minutes or until pasta is al-dente (but not squishy). Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
Remove pasta from pot and drain. Set aside.
Grate the pickles into a large bowl.
Add the mayonnaise and last 3 ingredients
Mix pasta into mayonnaise pickle mixture. Refrigerate 1 hour before serving.
