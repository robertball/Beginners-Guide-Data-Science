Ingredients:
1/2 recipe Oatmeal Dinner Rolls (see recipe)
3 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
1/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup powdered sugar
2 teaspoons milk

Directions:
ROLL dough on a lightly floured surface into a 16- x 12-inch rectangle; brush with butter.
COMBINE brown sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over butter, and top with pecans.
ROLL up, jellyroll fashion, starting at a long edge; cut into 3/4-inch thick slices. Arrange in two lightly greased 13- x 9-inch pans. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees) 30 minutes or until doubled in bulk.
BAKE at 375 degrees for 25 minutes or until golden brown. Whisk together powdered sugar and milk; drizzle over warm rolls.

Description: 
Avoid letting the temperature become too high during the dough-rising period; it will kill the yeast. If the temperature is too low, the dough will take longer to rise.
