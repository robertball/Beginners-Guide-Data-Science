Ingredients:
1 tablespoon Greek seasoning
1 tablespoon water
1 clove garlic
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/3 cup olive oil
1/4 cup wine vinegar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon white sugar

Directions:
Stir Greek seasoning and water together in a small bowl; let stand until seasoning is moistened, about 5 minutes.
Crush the garlic clove with the side of a knife; sprinkle kosher salt over garlic and mash garlic and salt together into a paste with the edge of the knife.
Whisk garlic mixture, olive oil, wine vinegar, lemon juice, lemon zest, Dijon mustard, pepper, and sugar into Greek seasoning mixture until combined.

Description: 
Greek salad dressing has a little too much bite for me, so I added some of the ingredients used in French vinaigrette. This is still fresh and tangy, and a nice dressing for summer salads.
