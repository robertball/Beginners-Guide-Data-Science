Ingredients:
1 (3.5 ounce) package non-instant chocolate pudding mix
2 cups milk
1/2 cup butter
1 cup water
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup all-purpose flour
4 eggs
2 tablespoons butter
2 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Prepare pudding with milk according to package directions.  Chill 1 hour in refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Grease baking sheets.
In a heavy saucepan, combine 1/2 cup butter, water and salt over medium-high heat.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low.  Pour in flour all at once and stir vigorously until fully incorporated and mixture forms a ball.  Remove from heat, let rest 5 minutes.  Then beat in eggs, one at a time, until well combined.
Drop dough into twelve equal mounds on baking sheets.  Spread each mound into a 4x1/2 inch rectangle.
Bake in preheated oven 35 minutes, until golden.  Remove from oven and make a one-inch slit in the side of each eclair.  Reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Return eclairs to oven for 10 minutes.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Prepare icing while eclairs are cooling.  Heat 2 tablespoons butter with chocolate in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring until melted.  Remove from heat and stir in confectioners' sugar, 2 tablespoons milk and vanilla.  Set aside.
To assemble:  Slice each eclair in half lengthwise.  Spoon about 1 tablespoon chocolate pudding into the bottom half of each eclair.  Replace tops and frost with chocolate icing.  Chill until serving.
