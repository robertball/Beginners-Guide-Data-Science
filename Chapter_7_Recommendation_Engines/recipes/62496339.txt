Ingredients:
1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 very ripe bananas, mashed
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/3 cup butter, melted
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 500 degrees F.
Lightly grease the top of a muffin tin then line with muffin papers. (If you grease the insides, the muffins can't "climb" up the sides and your muffins won't be as tall and puffy.)
In a large bowl, mix together 1 1/2 cups flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
In another bowl, beat together bananas, sugar, egg and melted butter. Stir the banana mixture into the flour mixture just until moistened. Fold in walnuts.
Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups so that the cups are full.
Place in oven and instantly reduce to 400 degrees F. Bake for 20-22 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean.
