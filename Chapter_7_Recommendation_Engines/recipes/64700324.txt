Ingredients:
2lb Pork Roast
1/4 cup Worcestershire Sauce
2tsp Coarse Black Pepper
1tsp Coarse Sea Salt
1tsp seasoning spoce rub - either McCormick Backyard Brick Oven rub, Montreal Steak seasoning rub, Pork Rub or your favorite rub!
1tsp onion powder
1/2tsp garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 500 degrees
Wash meat with water to wet exterior, pat dry
Apply Worcestershire sauce to exterior, use basting brush or paper towel to spread evenly coating entire roast
Season to taste, make sure to cover all surfaces (bottom and sides included)
Place roast fat side up in shallow roasting pan, I like to put it on a cake cooling rack inside roasting pan to allow  juices to drip and more evenly cook on bottom, place on middle rack of oven, close door tightly.
(Use Timer)
Active Cook @500d - 10min / pound for med, 12min / pound for med well, 14min/lb for well,
Once meat goes in oven, DO NOT OPEN OVEN DOOR UNTIL noted below.
Passive Cook - After roast has actively cooked for desired time above, turn oven off and let it continue to passively cook 20min/lb.
After Passive cooking, remove from oven and loosely cover with aluminum foil over top,  let roast rest for 5-7 min per lb. to allow juices to settle back down into roast.
Slice thin and enjoy!
