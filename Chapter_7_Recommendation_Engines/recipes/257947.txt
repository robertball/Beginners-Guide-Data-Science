Ingredients:
1 cup sorghum flour
1/2 cup quinoa flour
1/3 cup cornstarch
1/3 cup tapioca flour
1/3 cup potato starch flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon xanthan gum
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 cup warm water
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Grease a baking sheet.
Combine sorghum flour, quinoa flour, cornstarch, tapioca flour, potato starch flour, baking soda, xanthan gum, salt, and yeast together in a bowl. Stir water, olive oil, cider vinegar, and honey together in a separate bowl until honey is dissolved; pour over flour mixture and mix until dough comes together in a ball.
Place 1/4 cup dough between 2 sheets waxed paper or plastic wrap and roll until very thin using a rolling pin or tortilla press. Place on the prepared baking sheet and repeat with remaining dough; let rise for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes.

Description: 
I first made these to go with gyros. I folded mine over, and it was pretty close to the taste of a whole-wheat pita!
