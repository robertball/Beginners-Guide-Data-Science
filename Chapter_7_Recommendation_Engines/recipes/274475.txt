Ingredients:
2 large potatoes, peeled
4 large carrots, peeled
2 (32 fluid ounce) containers chicken broth
2 pounds chorizo sausage
1 onion, chopped
2 (29 ounce) cans pumpkin puree
1 cup unpacked brown sugar
2 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried sage
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pinch ground cloves
1 pinch dried thyme

Directions:
Shred potatoes and carrots using the grating attachment of a food processor.
Bring chicken broth to a boil in a large pot. Boil shredded potatoes and carrots in the broth until soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Use an immersion blender to blend until smooth.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo in the hot skillet until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon. Cook and stir onion in the chorizo grease until softened, about 5 minutes.
Pour blended broth into a slow cooker. Mix in chorizo and onion. Pour in pumpkin puree. Add brown sugar, butter, cinnamon, pepper, sage, rosemary, nutmeg, cloves, and thyme.
Simmer on High until flavors meld, about 1 hour.
