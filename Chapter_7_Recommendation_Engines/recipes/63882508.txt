Ingredients:
1 package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105-115F, 40-45C)
3/4 cup lukewarm milk (scalded then cooled)
1/4 cup sugar
1 tsp salt
1 egg
1/2 cup shortening, or softened butter/margarine
3 1/2 to 3/34 cups all-purpose flour (If using self-rising omit the salt)
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 cup sugar
18 to 24 large marshmallows
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir in milk, sugar, salt, egg, shortening/butter and 2 cups of the flour. Beat until smooth.
Mix in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle.
Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic - about five minutes.
Place in greased bowl and turn greased side up, cover and let rise in warm place until doubled - 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 375F (190C)
Punch down dough and divide in half. Roll each half about 1/4 inch thick and cut into 3 1/2 inch circles.
Mix cinnamon and sugar. Dip each marshmallow into butter, then into cinnamon and sugar mixture.
Wrap each dough circle around the marshmallow, pinching together tightly at the bottom.
Dip roll in butter, then in cinnamon-sugar mixture.
Place in greased medium muffin cups (2 3/4 inches in diameter) and let rise until double.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes.
