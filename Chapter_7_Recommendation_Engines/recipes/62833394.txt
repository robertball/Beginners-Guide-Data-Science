Ingredients:
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
1 garlic clove sliced paper thin (like in the movie Goodfellas)
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1 bunch of washed Broccoli Rabe. Remove, trim and clean the stems.
3 tbsp of water
2 tbsp olive oil

Directions:
Add 1 Tbsp olive oil, garlic and red pepper flakes to a hot pan. Saute for 45 seconds.
Add the cleaned stems and saute for another 45 seconds.
Add water.  Cook the stems about halfway through - about 3-4 minutes.
Add the rest of the broccoli rabe and season with salt.  Cover and com until tender.  About 5 minutes.
To serve:  take the cooked broccoli rabe and all its juices from the pan and add to your serving bowl.  Add the remaining tbsp of olive oil.
Enjoy.
The best part is dipping the crusty bread in those juices.
