Ingredients:
1/3 Cup peanut butter
3 TBSP vegetable oil
3 TBSP vinegar (rice, white wine or white vinegar)
2 TBSP soy sauce
Cayenne or chipotle pepper, to taste - use 1/4 tsp  or more if you like spicy
1 tsp sugar
1 clove garlic, finely minced
4 packs ramen noodle (discard seasoning packs) cooked
1/2 small cucumber, peeled & cut into matchstick size
1 green onion, thinly sliced
1/4 Cup chopped cilantro
1/8 Cup chopped salted peanuts

Directions:
Combine in a small bowl: peanut butter, oil, vinegar, soy sauce, pepper, sugar & garlic. Blend with a spatula or wooden spoon until smooth.
Let stand for 4 hours to blend flavors - however, it's ok if you use it immediately.
Cook pasta al dente and drain.
Add sauce to pasta.
Stir in cucumber and onion.
Garnish with cilantro & peanuts.
