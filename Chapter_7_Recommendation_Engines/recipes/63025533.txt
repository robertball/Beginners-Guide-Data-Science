Ingredients:
1 recipe Cream Biscuits
12 oz ground breakfast sausage (uncooked, like Jones or Jimmy Dean)
2 Â– 3 tbsp unsalted butter
3 tbsp all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
1 tsp Kosher salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
In a 12? inch cast iron pan, brown sausage over medium heat until it is no longer pink, crumbling sausage with a wooden spoon as it cooks.
Using a slotted spoon remove the sausage to a plate, leaving as much liquid in the pan as possible.  Lower the heat to medium and add butter to pan.
Stir in flour until it forms a continuous mixture (roux) with the butter/drippings and cook for about 1 minute, stirring continuously.
Whisk milk into the roux until no lumps remain, add salt and pepper, and allow the mixture to thicken as it comes to a simmer.
Once mixture has thickened to a gravy that coats the back of a spoon, lower the heat to medium-low and stir the sausage back into the gravy and heat the sausage through, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Serve immediately over hot biscuits.
