4 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
TO MAKE FILLING:  In a large bowl beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the feta cheese, dill weed and garlic powder. Beat until smooth and creamy.
Put a dollop of 1/4 of the filling on each breast, then roll and tie the breasts with cooking string to seal. Brush each breast with melted butter/margarine and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 20 minutes or until the juices run clear.
