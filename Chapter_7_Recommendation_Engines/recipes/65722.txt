1 (2 1/2 pound) boneless beef chuck roast
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle brown or amber ale
1/4 cup Kikkoman Soy Sauce
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
3 large onions, cut into eighths
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Coat beef with 1/3 cup flour. Brown beef slowly on both sides in hot oil in Dutch oven or large saucepan. Combine ale, soy sauce and allspice; pour over beef. Bring to boil; cover and simmer 1 hour.
Turn beef over and add onions; simmer, covered, 1 hour longer, or until beef is tender.
Meanwhile, blend remaining 2 tablespoons flour with water. Remove beef and onions to serving platter; keep warm. Pour pan juices into large measuring cup; skim off excess fat. Return 2-1/2 cups juices to pan; bring to boil. Gradually stir in flour mixture, cooking until gravy boils and thickens. To serve, cut beef across grain into thin slices and serve with gravy.
