Mediterranean Yogurt Dip Recipe

https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
16 oz strained (greek) yogurt
1 clove garlic, pressed
2 medium shallots, chopped
1/4 c. chopped mint
1/2 tsp ground coriander seed
1/2 tsp ground pepper
salt to taste
Note: strained or greek yogurt can be found at specialty groceries, or you can make it yourself. To make it yourself, line a fine sieve with a coffee filter. Put yogurt in the sieve over the filter, and allow it to drain over a bowl for at least an hour. It will be necessary to use about double the volume of regular yogurt to reach the same volume of strained.

Directions:
Combine all ingredients and mix thoroughly. Allow to chill for at least a half-hour.
If using fat-free yogurt, the addition of a teaspoon or two of good quality olive oil will enhance the flavor and texture.

Description: 
Almost like tzatziki, this garlicky dip is frequently requested by my guests year-round. It's great for dipping or spreading on sandwiches and wraps.
