Why be traditional during a football game with a meat chili? Everyone makes one... Go ahead and make my paleo seafood chili. It is hearty and full of flavor.

 Thank you City Fish for the amazing and fresh seafood! 

If you are adding beans to your diet, then go ahead and drain a can of red kidney beans and add to the pot. Enjoy and go Patriots!
