Ingredients:
1 cup raisins
2/3 cup sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup sour cream
3 egg yolks
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup chopped nuts
1 (9 inch) pie shell, baked
MERINGUE:
3 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon salt
5 tablespoons sugar

Directions:
In a small saucepan, place raisins and enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Turn off heat; set aside. In a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch, salt, cloves and cinnamon. Stir in sour cream. Beat in egg yolks. Add milk; cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until pudding comes to a boil and is very thick. Remove from the heat. Drain raisins, reserving 1/2 cup liquid. Stir liquid into filling. Add raisins, and nuts if desired. Pour into pie shell. For meringue, in a small mixing bowl, beat egg whites with salt until foamy. Gradually add sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time; beat until stiff and glossy. Spread over pie, making sure meringue covers all of filling. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until light golden brown. Serve warm or cold. Store leftovers in the refrigerator.

The aroma of this pie baking in my farm kitchen oven reminds me of my dear grandma who made this pretty pie for special occasions.
