Ingredients:
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
5 tablespoons boiling water
4 eggs, separated

Directions:
Grind chocolate chips in a blender, using short pulses.  Add boiling water and blend to melt the chocolate.  Add egg yolks, one at a time, blending well after each.
In a medium bowl, beat egg whites with electric mixer until stiff peaks form.  Fold egg whites into chocolate mixture gently.  Pour the mousse into wine glasses or other serving glasses and chill in refrigerator until set.

Description: 
This is an easy mousse that is still light, fluffy, and very tasty!  Substitute hot coffee for the water for a subtle flavor difference.  This recipe contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs.
