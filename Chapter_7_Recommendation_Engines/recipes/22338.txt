Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup rolled oats
1 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter, melted
4 cups peeled, cored and sliced apples
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 cup water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, combine flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon and melted butter.  Stir until crumbly.  Press half the oat mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish.  Cover with sliced apples.
In a medium saucepan, combine white sugar, cornstarch, water and vanilla.  Cook, stirring, until thick and clear, 10 minutes.  Pour over apples.  Cover apples with remaining crumble mixture.
Bake in preheated oven 45 minutes, until bubbly and golden.

Description: 
A moister version of Apple Crisp. I've used this recipe for many years. It has a thick sauce for extra moistness. I always get requests for the recipe when I make it! Tastes great served warm with vanilla ice cream!
