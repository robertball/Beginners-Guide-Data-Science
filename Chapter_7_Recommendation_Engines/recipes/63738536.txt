Ingredients:
4c wild grapes, well-rinsed.  May substitute with Concord grapes.
water
1/2c honey
1t lemon juice
2T cornstarch

Directions:
Place the grapes in a large pot.  Add water until they are just barely covered.
Bring to a high simmer for 30min, stirring occasionally.  As the grapes get soft and start to split open, mash them down with your spoon to push the innards out.  At all other times, leave the lid on.
Remove from heat and pour through a strainer into a large mixing bowl.  Press as much juice and pulp through the strainer as possible.  Discard the remaining fibrous and seedy waste.
Heat the honey until it flows easily.  Pour into the grape juice & pulp.  Add the lemon juice.  Stir.
Pour back into the pot and cover.  Bring to a simmer for about one hour, stirring occasionally.
Remove from heat and add the cornstarch one tablespoon at a time, whisking thoroughly immediately after each addition.
Pour into desired containers and place in the refrigerator until cool, or about an hour.  To store, keep in refrigerator.
