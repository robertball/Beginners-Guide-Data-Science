Description: 
This basting sauce is excellent brushed on grilled chicken or pork. This recipe makes 1 cup, but it's nice to double the recipe so you have extra to pass around for added flavor. This recipe is high in sugar, so just brush on the last few minutes of cooking so that the meat won't burn
