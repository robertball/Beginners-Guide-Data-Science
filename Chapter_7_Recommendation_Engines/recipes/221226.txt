Ingredients:
1 large Asian pear, peeled, cored and sliced
1/3 cup sherry wine
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup rice vinegar
1/8 cup brown sugar
3 cloves garlic, peeled
5 slices fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon hot chile paste (such as sambal oelek)
1 teaspoon sesame oil
4 pounds beef short ribs, trimmed
1 chopped green onion for garnish

Directions:
Mix pear slices, sherry wine, soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, hoisin sauce, hot chili paste, and sesame oil in a blender until smooth, about 4 minutes.
Arrange short ribs in a 9x13-inch baking dish and coat completely with marinade. Cover baking dish with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to marinate for 8 to 12 hours.
Remove short ribs to a plate and blot dry with paper towel to remove excess marinade.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Grill short ribs until firm, hot, and slightly pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
