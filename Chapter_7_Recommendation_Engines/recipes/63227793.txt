Ingredients:
4 slices of whole wheat bread
2 tablespoons margarine
1 medium onion, chopped
1 8 ounce can of sliced mushrooms
1 7 ounce package of "no fat" shredded cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cup of skim milk
4 eggs
1 tablespoon ground mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Spray a 9 X 13 inch baking dish with a no-stick cooking spray. Arrange the slices of bread in the baking dish.
Melt the margerine in a medium size frying pan and add the chopped onion, cooking over medium heat for five minutes or until the onions are soft.
Sprinkle the bread with the onions, mushrooms and cheese.
Mix the milk, eggs, mustard, salt and garlic powder together and pour the mixture over the bread. Lightly press the top of the bread slices to help soak up the liquid mixture. (Alternatively, the casserole may be refrigerated for several hours or overnight.)
Bake uncovered for 25 minutes, or until the top is a golden brown.
