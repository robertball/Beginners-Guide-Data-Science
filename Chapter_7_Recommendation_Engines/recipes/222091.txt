Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup nonfat plain yogurt
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir flour, baking soda, and baking powder in a small bowl.
Beat butter, yogurt, and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add egg allowing it to blend into butter mixture. Beat in vanilla extract. Mix in flour mixture until just incorporated. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2-inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Let stand on baking sheet two minutes before removing to cool on wire racks.

Description: 
I love this recipe. I could eat at least ten in one sitting which is why I exchanged some butter with non-fat plain yogurt. They still taste great and I feel a lot better about eating so many.
