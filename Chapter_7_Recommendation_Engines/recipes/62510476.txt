Description: 
Alot of recipes for a basic butter frosting usually use way too much powdered sugar, are overly sweet, and have no flavor. So I decided make up my own recipe for perfectly sweet vanilla butter frosting. I use less powdered sugar so you can taste the delicious butter and vanilla flavors instead of just powdered sugar. I like to use this frosting to frost cupcakes with.
