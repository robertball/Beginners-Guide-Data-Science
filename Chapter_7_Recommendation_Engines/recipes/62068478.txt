Ingredients:
1 lb. candied cherries (green and red)
1 lb. candied pineapple
1 lb. chopped pitted dates
1 lb. pecan halves
7 oz. flaked coconut
1 14 oz. can condensed milk
2 beaten eggs
3/4 c. sifted flour
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1 TBL brandy or rum flavoring

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line two loaf pans with was paper, set aside.  Mix ingredients well in very large bowl. Divide mixture evenly into pans, and bake for one hour. Best if chilled overnight. (note: it will seem like the recipe requires too little flour, but don't worry, it'll be perfect!)
