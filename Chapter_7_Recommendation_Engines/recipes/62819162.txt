Ingredients:
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (or one packet)
3/4 cup warm water
2 Cups all purpose flour
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in the warm water. Combine all purpose flour and kosher salt in a separate bowl. Add olive oil and honey to yeast mixture. Add flour mixture to yeast mixture and stir until dough comes away from the side of the bowl.
2. Place dough into a lightly floured bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Let rise until double, about 45 minutes.
3. Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees. Punch down dough. Either divide in 2 for smaller pizzas, or leave in one piece for large pizza. Pat dough out onto pizza pan sprayed lightly with cooking spray. Pierce crust with fork. Top with your favorite toppings and bake at 450 degrees for 12-18 minutes.
Makes 1 large or 2 small pizzas.

Description: 
This is simply a slight variation of the pizza crust recipe I found on a bag of Kroger brand flour. It is a soft crust and very easy to make.
