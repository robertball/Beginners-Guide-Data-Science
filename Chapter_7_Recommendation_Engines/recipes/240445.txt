Ingredients:
3 thick slices whole grain bread
1/4 cup coconut
1/4 cup chia seeds
1/4 cup half-and-half
2 eggs
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons unsalted butter, or as needed
1/2 cup fresh raspberries
1/2 cup vanilla yogurt
2 ounces maple syrup, or to taste

Directions:
Cut each bread slice into 4 even sticks.
Mix coconut, chia seeds, half-and-half, eggs, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until batter is smooth.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add butter.
Dip bread sticks in the batter until completely coated.
Cook coated bread sticks in the hot butter until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Place raspberries in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until softened, about 1 minutes. Mix yogurt into raspberries.
Dip French toast sticks in raspberry-yogurt sauce and top with maple syrup.
