Ingredients:
1/4 cup ketchup
1/4 cup apple juice
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon hot sauce (such as Frank's Red Hot Â®)
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
6 pork chops

Directions:
Mix ketchup, apple juice, olive oil, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, chili powder, hot sauce, and kosher salt together in a bowl; pour marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add pork chops to the marinade and seal bag. Marinate for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove pork chops from marinade and place on the hot grill; discard used marinade. Cook until pork chops are no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C).
