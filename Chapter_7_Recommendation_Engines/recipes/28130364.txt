Ingredients:
Pear Honey
6 ripe pears, peeled, cored, and roughly chopped
1-8 oz. can crushed pineapple with juice
1 ½ cups sugar
Coarsely grated zest of one lemon, plus 1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a large saucepan or 10-inch skillet (an electric skillet works well too.) Cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until pears are tender and mixture thickens, and takes on a golden honey color, about 30 minutes.
Mash the mixture with a fork, if smaller chunks of pear are desired. Cool to room temperature to serve. Store in the refrigerator in a sealed plastic container or glass jelly jar.
Makes about 2 ½ cups.
