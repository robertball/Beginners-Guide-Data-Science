Ingredients:
Dressing:
2 tablespoons chopped shallots
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon maple syrup
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
Slaw:
3/4 cup roughly chopped hazelnuts
3 tablespoons cane sugar
1 pinch cayenne pepper
2 small bunches lacinato (dinosaur) kale, stems removed
1/2 pound Brussels sprouts
3/4 cup cooked and cooled quinoa
2/3 cup pomegranate seeds
3 green onions, thinly sliced
2/3 cup shaved Parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish
Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil

Directions:
In a food processor, combine the shallots, vinegar, lemon juice, maple syrup, olive oil, salt and pepper and blend until smooth. Set aside.
Line a small baking sheet with Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil. Set aside.
In a non-stick pan over medium heat, combine the hazelnuts, sugar and cayenne. Stir with a silicone spatula until the sugar has melted and sticks to the nuts, about 5 minutes; turn down the heat to prevent burning if needed. Spread the sticky nuts out on the foil-lined sheet to cool. When the nuts are cool enough to handle, break them up by hand.
Stem the kale and chop well. Using a mandoline, shred the Brussels sprouts, discarding the tough ends. Combine both in a large salad bowl. Add the hazelnuts, quinoa, pomegranate seeds, green onions and cheese. Dress to your liking and serve immediately.
