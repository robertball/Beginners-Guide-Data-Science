Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat penne pasta
cooking spray
2 green bell peppers, cut into thin strips
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 cup fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (16 ounce) package spicy Italian turkey sausage, casings removed
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon dried oregano
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray; place over medium-high heat. Add green bell peppers, onion, mushrooms, and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until almost tender, 7 to 8 minutes.
Place turkey sausage in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir, breaking sausage up with a wooden spoon, until browned and crumbly, about 6 minutes. Add red pepper flakes, salt, black pepper, and oregano; stir in tomatoes. Simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Place penne in a serving bowl; top with sausage mixture and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
