Ingredients:
2 cups water, divided
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
3/4 pound fresh asparagus spears, trimmed
4 slices process American cheese, diced
1 bacon strip, cooked and crumbled

Directions:
In a small skillet, combine 1 cup water, bouillon, seasoned salt, lemon-pepper and white pepper. Add asparagus. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 8-10 minutes or until asparagus is tender. Remove asparagus; cool slightly.
Cut off several asparagus tips and set aside. Cut remaining asparagus into larger pieces. Place asparagus pieces and cooking liquid in a blender or food processor; cover and process until smooth. In a saucepan, combine asparagus mixture and remaining water; heat through. Reduce heat; stir in cheese just until melted. Garnish with bacon bits and reserved asparagus tips.

Description: 
Although I came from a large family, I had to adjust to cooking for two during the years I had a roommate. This soup is a springtime favorite.
