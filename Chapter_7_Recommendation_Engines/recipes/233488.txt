Description: 
Visit your local farmer's market to gather ingredients for this recipe that is super fresh, easy, and tasty! I like mine with chopped chicken to add a little protein and enjoy as a main dish with sides of corn bread, tortilla chips, and fresh guacamole. Try basil in place of parsley if you prefer.
