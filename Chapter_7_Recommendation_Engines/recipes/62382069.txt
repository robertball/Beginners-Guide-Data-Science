Ingredients
•	8 cups fresh blackberries washed and drained
•	1-1/4 cups sugar
•	1/4 cup all-purpose flour
•	1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
•	1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
•	2 tablespoons orange juice
•	1/3 cup butter
•	pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
Preheat oven to 475.
Lightly butter a square baking dish.
Combine sugar, flour, cinnamon and nutmeg in a large heavy saucepan.
Gently stir in blackberries and orange juice.
Over medium heat bring mixture to a boil then reduce heat to low and simmer 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter until it is melted.
Set aside and keep warm.
Roll out half the pastry as for a pie but cut it into an 8-inch square.
Stir blackberry mixture to evenly distribute the fruit and spoon half the mixture into the prepared baking dish.
Cover with the pastry square.
Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and spoon remaining blackberry mixture over the baked pastry.
Roll out the remaining pastry and cut into strips about an inch wide.
Arrange strips in a loose lattice weave over the blackberry mixture.
Sprinkle lightly with granulated sugar if desired.
Bake an additional 20 minutes or until browned.
