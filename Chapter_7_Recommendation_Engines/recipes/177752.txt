Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups Swanson® Chicken Stock
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon ketchup
2 teaspoons vinegar
1 pound boneless pork loin, cut into 1-inch cubes
12 medium mushrooms
1 large red onion, cut into 12 wedges
4 cherry tomatoes
4 cups hot cooked regular long-grain white rice

Directions:
Stir the stock, cornstarch, brown sugar, ketchup and vinegar in a 1-quart saucepan until the mixture is smooth.  Cook and stir over medium-high heat until the mixture boils and thickens. Remove the saucepan from the heat.
Thread alternately the pork, mushrooms and onion onto 4 skewers.
Lightly oil the grill rack and heat the grill to medium.  Grill the kabobs for 20 minutes or until the pork is cooked through, turning and brushing often with the stock mixture. Place 1 tomato onto the end of each skewer.
Heat the remaining stock mixture over medium heat to a boil. Serve with the kabobs and rice.
