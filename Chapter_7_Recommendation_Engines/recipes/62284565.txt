Ingredients:
1 chuck roast, about 3 lbs.
1 c. water plus 1 beef bouillon cube
1 envelope (dry) Lipton onion soup

Directions:
Heat the water in microwave and dissolve the bouillon.  Add dry soup mix and stir until dissolved.  Pour over roast in crockpot.  Cook on low 10 - 12 hours.
I usually make a day ahead, or the night before, and put the roast and juices in separate containers in the fridge.  After a few hours, all the fat is easily removed from the juice and I then use it to make a delicious gravy.
