Ingredients:
3 tablespoons room-temperature butter
1 tablespoon prepared horseradish
1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese
1/2 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
2 (6 ounce) rib-eye steaks

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Stir butter and horseradish together in a bowl until evenly mixed. Fold blue cheese crumbles into the butter mixture. Mix bread crumbs thoroughly into topping.
Grill steaks until they start to firm and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Transfer steaks to a broiler pan. Spread about half the blue cheese mixture atop each steak.
Cook steaks under the broiler until the crust becomes golden, about 3 minutes.
