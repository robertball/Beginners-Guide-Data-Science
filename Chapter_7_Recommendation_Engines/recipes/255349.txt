Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (8 ounce) boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-size pieces
2 links hot chicken sausage, cut into 1-inch slices
1  yellow onion, sliced
1  red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1  poblano pepper, sliced
1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
1 teaspoon sea salt
Â½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon arrowroot powder
2  eggs
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken and sausage; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 7 minutes. Add onion, red bell pepper, poblano pepper, jalapeno pepper, salt, and black pepper; cook, stirring often, until softened, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour chicken broth into the pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and stir in butter and arrowroot powder to thicken the stew.
Whisk eggs in a small bowl.
Increase heat to medium-high to bring stew to an active simmer. Remove from heat. Drizzle eggs in slowly, stirring with a wooden spoon until cooked through, about 1 minute. Stir in parsley.

Description: 
I have to start this recipe with OMG. I love my random paleo one-pot meals. It only took 30 minutes. This recipe was developed as I was taking the ingredients out of my refrigerator and this is what I created! Perfect dinner for 2.
