Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup powdered milk
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon honey
1 cup unsweetened apple juice concentrate, thawed
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease the doughnut pan with cooking spray.
In a large bowl, stir together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, powdered milk, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Make a well in the center and pour in the eggs, honey, apple juice concentrate and vanilla. Mix until well blended. Fill each depression in the prepared doughnut pan 2/3 full with batter.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops spring back when lightly touched. Allow doughnuts to cool before removing from pan.

Description: 
This recipe is for those donut pans that are advertised in some magazines.  They were an attempt to duplicate the delicious cider donuts that my husband and I had on vacation in New Hampshire.
