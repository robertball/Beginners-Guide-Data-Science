Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
2 carrots, sliced
1 large sweet potato, peeled and cut into cubes
1 sweet red pepper, chopped
1 cup reduced-sodium ready-to-use vegetable broth
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup 10% or 18% cream
1 (19 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 cup frozen green peas, thawed
Salt
1/2 cup plain yogurt
Lime wedges

Directions:
In a pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add garlic, curry powder and ginger and saute for 30 sec or until softened. Add carrots, sweet potato and red pepper and saute for about 5 min or until carrots start to soften.
Stir in broth and 1/2 tsp (1 ml) salt. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 10 min or until vegetables are almost tender.
Whisk flour into cream and stir into pan with chickpeas and green peas. Simmer, stirring, for about 3 min or until sauce has thickened and peas are hot. Season to taste with salt. Serve topped with yogurt and with lime wedges to squeeze over top.
