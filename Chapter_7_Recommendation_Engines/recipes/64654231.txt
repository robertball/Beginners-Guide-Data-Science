Ingredients:
2  tubes of refrigerated crescent rolls
2 Tbs. softened butter or margarine
1/4 c. packed brown sugar
1 Tbs. ground cinnamon
1/3 c. finely chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Unroll the crescent rolls and press the perforations (seams) together to form two rectangles.
Spread with softened butter or margarine to cover the entire surface.
Combine brown sugar and cinnamon, and sprinkle it over the dough.
Sprinkle the cinnamon mixture over the buttered rectangle of crescent roll
Sprinkle the walnuts if adding them
Fold each rectangle in half, starting on the short side.
Fold rectangle in half
Cut them into 8 strips. I like to use a pizza cutter!
Twist each strip. You can leave twisted in a long twist or try tying it in a knot. The knot can be tricky for little hands.
Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees for about 10 minutes until golden brown.
