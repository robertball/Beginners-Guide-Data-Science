Description: 
This is a BBQ sauce my grandfather created a long time ago and I grew up having my mother use it all the time when we grilled out. Add this BBQ sauce to foods such as chicken, pork chops, and ribs for a added flavor and a little kick. Vinegar and mustard base adds a different flavor to original BBQ sauce.
