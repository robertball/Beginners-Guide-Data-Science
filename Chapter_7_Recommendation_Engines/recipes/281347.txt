Description: 
If you like regular zabaglione, you're going to absolutely love the frozen version. Above and beyond the flavor, you're going to see what might be the best way to make ice cream without an ice cream maker. Quite often, frozen desserts that aren't made with a machine can have a weird, icy, crystallized texture, but not here. This stuff is incredibly smooth and creamy. Serve with fresh fruit.
