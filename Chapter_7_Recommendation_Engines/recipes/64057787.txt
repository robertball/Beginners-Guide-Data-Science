Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups chocolate cookie crumbs
1/4 cup melted butter
1 brick cream cheese (room temp)
1 1/2 cups peanut butter
1/2 cup icing sugar
1 cup cream or Bailey's
1 1/2 cup dark chocolate, shaved
icing sugar as needed

Directions:
In a bowl mix together the cookie crumbs with the melted butter.  Press the mixture into muffin cups lined with cupcake papers and put in fridge.
In a mixing bowl, whip together cream cheese, peanut butter, and icing sugar.  Divide evenly into prepared chocolate crusts and put in fridge.
In microwave safe bowl, heat up cream for about 2 min, or until just below boiling.  Add chocolate and stir.  For sweeter ganache add some icing sugar to your taste!  (I also used some milk chocolate, and some peanut butter chips). Stir until it is all melted, then put in fridge.  After about an hour remove from fridge and whip using hand mixer.  Spread evenly over tops of cheesecake cups.
Store in freezer, and take out about 30 min prior to eating.  These are the most delicious treat of alltime!! :)
