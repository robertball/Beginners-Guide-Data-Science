Ingredients:
6 4-ounce boneless pork chops, excess fat removed
Marinade
1/2 teaspoon lime zest
2 limes, juiced
1 tablespoon honey
1 shallot, minced
1 jalapeno, seeds removed, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon salt
Salsa
1/2 pineapple, cored and diced
1 medium tomato, diced
1/2 red onion, diced
1 jalapeno, diced
1 tablespoon fresh cilantro, chopped

Directions:
Combine marinade ingredients in a sealable plastic bag, add chops, shake and refrigerate for 2 hours.
In a medium bowl, combine salsa ingredients, mix, cover and refrigerate to allow the flavors to blend.
Heat grill to medium, remove chops from marinade and grill, about 5 minutes a side. Serve on a bed of or topped with salsa. One 4-ounce chop with the salsa is only 160 calories with 3 grams of fat and 1 of fiber!

Description: 
The tang of the lime marinade, the crisp edges of the grilled meat, the sweetness of the pineapple all came together in such a wonderful way.
