Ingredients:
1 Coors original beer (12oz) or similar
3 to 4 cups beef broth (made with Better than Bouillon paste)
5 small to medium russet potatoes, sliced
1 very small cabbage (or half a large cabbage), chopped
16 oz shredded or sliced baby carrots
1 large yellow onion, diced
1 cup sliced or diced celery
2 cups diced shitake mushrooms
2 teaspoons minced garlic
3-4 lbs boneless corned beef brisket
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a 6-quart crock pot, add beer and place corned beef with the fat side up.
Sprinkle pickling spices included with the corned beef on top of the fat (If there aren’t any in the package with the corned beef, don’t worry about it)
DO NOT trim off the fat yet.
Add cabbage, potatoes, onion, celery, carrots, mushrooms, and garlic around and on top of corned beef.
Add beef bouillon broth until it just covers vegetables.
Cover and cook on low heat overnight. Ensure crock pot is well away from potentially flammable items for safety.
In the morning, stir veggies and whole brisket, add salt and pepper to taste. Cover; continue to cook on low heat.
After 18-24 hours, the meat will be very tender. Remove only the corned beef brisket from the crock pot and place on a cutting board.
With a fork, gently peel the layer of fat away from the meat and discard.
Cut brisket crosswise to the grain of the meat (should be approx 1-inch slices) and shred with a fork.
Replace shredded brisket in crock pot and stir.
Serve and enjoy.
