Ingredients:
¼ cup olive oil
6 teaspoons garam masala, divided
4 small cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
<sup>&reg;</sup>eynolds Wrap(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil
4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
4 small yellow summer squash or zucchini, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
1 medium sweet onion, thinly sliced
½ cup plain yogurt
Cilantro leaves (optional)

Directions:
Mix the olive oil, 4 teaspoons garam masala, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl until combined. Tear four sheets (12x18 inches each) of Reynolds Wrap(R) Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil. Center one chicken breast half on a sheet of foil;  sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon garam masala on both sides.
Place the squash and onion slices on top of the chicken. Drizzle evenly with one-fourth of the olive oil mixture. Bring up foil sides. Double-fold top and ends to seal packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Repeat to make four packets.
Grill over medium-high heat in covered grill 20 to 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted into chicken registers 165 degrees F.
Open packets carefully by cutting along top fold with a sharp knife, allowing steam to escape; then open top of foil packet. To serve, top with yogurt and sprinkle with cilantro, if desired.
