Turn the heat down to medium and then add in the tomatoes, can of beans and garlic. Cook for about 4-5 minutes.
Add in basil and butter, and stir until combined. Season with additional salt and pepper as desired. Turn heat to low and let sit for about 5 more minutes.

Description: 
This is a healthy but delicous one pot chicken dish. For an even healthier alternative use boneless and skinless breasts or if you feel really decadent use bone in, skin on chicken thighs but increase the cooking time. The fresh basil and tomatoes make for an aromatice, easy weeknight or for company meal. I hope you enjoy.
