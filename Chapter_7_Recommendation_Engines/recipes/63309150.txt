Ingredients:
2 cups wood chips (not chunks)
small disposable aluminum pan
baby back ribs
barbecue sauce (your choice)

Directions:
Cover 2 cups wood chips with water and soak 30 minutes, then drain.
Place soaked wood chips in small disposable aluminum pan; set pan on burner that will remain on.  Turn on all burners to high, close lid, and heat grill until chips smoke heavily, about 20 minutes. (If chips ignite, extinguish flames with water from spray bottle.)
Scrape grill grate clean with wire brush; turn off burner(s) without wood chips.  Arrange ribs on cool side of grill and cover with lid (grill temperature should register about 275 degrees on grill thermometer).
Cook for 4 hours, until meat easily pulls away from bone, flipping ribs over and moving the ones close to the fire further away every 30 minutes.
Baste with barbecue sauce the last 30 minutes of cooking, if desired.  Baste one side, cook for 20 minutes; flip over and baste other side, and cook for 10 minutes more.
Lay on cutting board; cut into individual ribs and serve with extra sauce.
