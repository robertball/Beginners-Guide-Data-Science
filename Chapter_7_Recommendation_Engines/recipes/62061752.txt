Ingredients:
1 1/2  lbs. ground beef
1/2 lb. ground pork
3/4 cup corn, canned or frozen, thawed and drained
1/2 cup corn bread crumbs, plus more to thicken
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup pepper jack cheese, grated or shredded
1/2 cup onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup milk
1 egg, slightly beaten
3 jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp. kosher salt
1 tlb. freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
1.  Pre-heat the oven to 350 F and lightly spray a large baking glass (not a loaf pan) with nonstick spray.  Set aside.  Meanwhile, place the meat into a large bowl and set aside.
2.  Combine all of the other ingredients
in a medium bowl, and then combine with meat, mixing gently.  Shape meat into a ball, transfer to baking dish, and mold into a rounded loaf shape, about 10x6.
3.  Bake until internal temp is 160 F.  If crust gets too brown for your taste, place a sheet of foil loosely over the top while finishing.
