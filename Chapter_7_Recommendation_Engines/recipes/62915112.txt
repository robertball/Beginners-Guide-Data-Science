Ingredients:
Crumb Topping:
1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup butter, softened
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Cake:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk or Milk with 1 tsp vinegar
Strudel
1/4 cup buttter
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.
Mix 1/2 cup flour, brown sugar, 1/4 cup butter, and cinnamon together in a bowl until the mixture is the consistency of wet sand. Set the topping aside.
Beat 1/2 cup butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large mixing bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the egg and mix well. Stir in the vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, combine  2 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Mix the flour mixture into the creamed butter mixture alternately with the buttermilk, stirring just to combine. Spread half the batter into the prepared pan (the batter will be thick), creating a valley in the middle. Pour the strudel in the middle and continue spreading the last half of batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle with crumb topping.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
