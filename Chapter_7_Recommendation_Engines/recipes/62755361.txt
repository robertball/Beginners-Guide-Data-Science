Ingredients:
1 1/2 c. all purpose flour
1/4 c. cornstarch
1/2 tsp. salt
2/3 c. uncooked grits
2/3 c. sugar
2 tsp. lemon zest
1 c. butter, at room temperature
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
In a medium mixing bowl, sift together flour, cornstarch and salt. Stir in grits and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, add sugar and lemon zest, until moistened. Add butter and vanilla and mix at medium speed until smooth and creamy. Gradually add dry ingredients, until just combined. Line a cookie sheet or flat pan with wax or parchment paper. Place dough in the center of the paper, and cover with another sheet of paper. Roll dough out to 1/2 inch thickness, keeping the shape as close to a rectangle as possible. Chill for at least an hour. Preheat oven to 325. Once chilled, cut dough into 1 1/2 inch squares. Place shortbreads onto lined cookie sheets. Pierce the top of each cookie 2 times, with the tines of a fork, careful not to go through the cookie. Chill again, for 15-20 minutes. Bake on center oven rack for 20-25 minutes, until just lightly beginning to brown on the edges. Allow to cool on cooling rack.
