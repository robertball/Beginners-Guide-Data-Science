1-1/2 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. salt
3/4 c. oil

1 tsp. vanilla

3 eggs, separated

Directions:
Combine flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl.  Add oil, honey, vanilla, water, and egg yolks; beat well.  In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until they form peaks.  Gently fold beaten egg whites into batter. Pour into two 9" layer pans or one 13x9x2" pan, greased and floured.  Bake 4-6" from the bottom of a preheated oven at 300 degrees, for 25-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan(s).  Frost as desired.
