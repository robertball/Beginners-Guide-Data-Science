Ingredients:
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chiles, undrained
3 tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons ground cumin
4 cloves garlic, halved lengthwise
2 teaspoons salt
2 pounds chuck roast
8 (10 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
In a small bowl, combine the green chiles, chili powder, oregano, cumin, garlic and salt.
Place roast on a large sheet of heavy foil. Make 8 cuts in the meat and insert the garlic halves. Rub chili mixture all over roast and enclose in foil to seal.
Place in a roasting pan and cook in preheated oven until meat is fork tender, about 3 1/2 hours. Remove from oven. When cool enough to handle, shred meat into a large bowl. Stir in meat juices and serve in warm flour tortillas.
