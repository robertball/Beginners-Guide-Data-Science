Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 pound ground turkey
1/2 pound bulk Italian sausage
1 (10.75 ounce) can vegetable beef soup (such as Campbell's®)
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
1/4 cup barbeque sauce
1/4 cup ketchup
1/4 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard
1 teaspoon minced garlic, or to taste
2 dashes Worcestershire sauce
2 dashes browning sauce (such as Kitchen Bouquet®)
2 pinches seasoned salt (such as Johnny's Seasoning Salt®)
2 pinches ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix ground beef, ground turkey, Italian sausage, vegetable soup, eggs, bread crumbs, barbeque sauce, ketchup, yellow mustard, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, browning sauce, seasoned salt, and black pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Form into a loaf and place meat loaf into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until meat loaf is browned and no longer pink inside, 60 to 75 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let meat loaf rest for 10 minutes before cutting into 1/2-inch thick slices.
