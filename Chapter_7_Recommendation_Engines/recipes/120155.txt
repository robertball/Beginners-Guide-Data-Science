Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/2 cup fat-free milk
1/4 cup canola oil
1 cup chopped, peeled tart apple
1/4 cup raisins
CRUMB TOPPING:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons quick cooking oats
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon cold butter or margarine

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Combine the egg, milk and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in the apple and raisins. Coat muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray or use paper liners; fill two-thirds full with batter.
For topping, in a bowl, combine the flour, oats, brown sugar and cinnamon; cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over batter. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
