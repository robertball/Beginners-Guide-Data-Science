Ingredients:
3 cups flour
1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
6 tablespoons coconut oil, softened
1 cup hemp milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Fluff with a fork until mixture is evenly distributed. Drop in chunks of coconut oil. Mix by hand, breaking chunks apart, until dough is crumbly. Stir in hemp milk; do not over-knead.
Place dough on a lightly floured surface and roll it out to about 1/2-inch thickness. Cut into biscuit-size squares using a round cookie cutter.
Bake in the preheated oven until fluffy and lightly golden, about 15 minutes. And then eat them all! Just kidding. You should share... a few.
