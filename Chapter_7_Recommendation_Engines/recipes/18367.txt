To Make Filling: In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar. Stir in eggs, vanilla and lemon juice. Mix thoroughly.
To Make Crust: Combine crumbs, 2 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon. Cut in butter until crust forms small crumbs. Put one spoonful of crust into each cup cake liner and pat it down. Spoon a layer of filling on top of crusts.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. When tarts are fresh from oven, spoon cherry pie filling over top of each. Let tarts chill in refrigerator for 30 minutes to an hour.
