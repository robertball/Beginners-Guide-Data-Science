Ingredients:
Salt
1 small eggplant, peeled and thinly sliced
1 large tomato, sliced 1/4-inch thick
1/2 large onion, thinly sliced
melted butter (okay to use olive oil spray)
1 Tbs finely chopped fresh basil
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1/2 dsp dried summer savory (see footnote)
Pepper
Crust for a 9-inch pie, unbaked
1/4 c. grated cheese (yellow or a smoked white cheese)
3 eggs, beaten
1/4 c milk
1 tsp prepared mustard

Directions:
Sprinkle salt over both sides of the eggplant slices.  Place in a colander for 15 mins to allow the bitter juices to drain.  Rince and pat dry.  Brush both sides of the eggplant, tomato, and onion slices with melted butter (or spray with olive oil spray).  Arrange eggplant on a cookie sheet, leaving room for the tomatoes and onions (but do NOT add the tomatoes and onions yet!).  Bake eggplant at 350 degrees for 10 mins.
Remove from oven and add the tomatoes and onions.  Sprinkle with herbs and pepper and return to the oven and bake until lightly browned.  Remove and cool slightly.
Layer the eggplant slices on the uncooked pie crust.  Cover with grated cheese, reserving a few tablespoons, and then the tomato slices and onion slices.  Mix the eggs, mild and mustard and pour over the layer slices and cheese.  Sprinkle with the remaining cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees until the egg/milk mixture is firm (about 35-40 mins.).
