Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package spinach and cheese tortellini
1 (8 ounce) package cheese tortellini
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (8 ounce) package snow peas, trimmed
1 (4 ounce) package mushrooms, sliced
2 medium carrots, thinly sliced
2 green onions, cut into 2-inch pieces
1 large clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup light cream
1 (4 ounce) container crumbled Gorgonzola cheese, divided
1/4 cup butter
freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook both kinds of tortellini in the boiling water until they float, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain, return to the pot, and keep warm.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Cook and stir snow peas, mushrooms, carrots, green onions, garlic, and salt until vegetables are tender-crisp, about 3 minutes. Pour vegetable mixture into the pot with the cooked tortellini and toss.
Add cream, 1/2 the Gorgonzola cheese, butter, and pepper to the pot with the pasta mixture. Cook over medium heat until heated through and cheese has melted, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle remaining Gorgonzola cheese on top and serve immediately.
