Ingredients:
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 bird's eye chile, seeded and minced
1 tablespoon minced lemon grass
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1/2 cup coconut milk
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1 1/2 cups fresh green beans, trimmed and halved

Directions:
Puree the garlic, bird's eye chile, lemon grass, fish sauce, and coconut milk in a blender until smooth; set aside. Bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the green beans, and cook for 2 minutes; drain.
Heat the peanut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and stir in the green onions. Cook and stir 1 to 2 minutes until the green onions have softened and begun to brown. Stir in the pureed sauce, and bring to a simmer. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then add the green beans. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer the green beans until tender, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
HOT and spicy green beans!  Yummy for people that like heat on the side.  I think you could add a meat like shrimp or chicken to this to make it a main dish if you like.
