Ingredients:
3/4 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons dry sherry
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound shredded Cheddar cheese
3 tablespoons caraway seeds, for rolling

Directions:
Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl until fluffy and soft. Stir in the mustard, sherry, and 1 teaspoon of caraway seeds, mixing thoroughly. Beat in the Cheddar cheese and vegetable oil. Shape mixture into a ball and roll in the remaining 3 tablespoons of caraway seeds. Wrap coated ball in plastic and refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours.

Description: 
The caraway seeds add a nutty, rustic flavor that complements the sharp tang of the cheddar. My mother always made this for family Christmas parties, and it remains my all-time favorite recipe for cheese balls.
