Ingredients:
5 your favorite brats
12 oz your favorite beer (light American lagers works best)
1 medium white onion sliced
1/4 c roasted red pepper chopped
1 t Cajun seasoning
1/2 t smoked paprika
1/2 t salt
1/2 t black pepper
1/2 t thyme
1/4 t minced garlic
3 jalapeños sliced (optional)

Directions:
(optional) Grill onion slices on oiled grate over med-hot coals for 2-3 minutes each side.
Separate onion slices into rings.
Lay about 1/3 of the onion rings in the bottom of an aluminum pie tin. This will hold the brats up a little and allow the beer to get under them to prevent burning.
Place brats on onions.
Place minced garlic in the middle of the pan between the middle most brats.
Pour beer directly on minced garlic to spread the garlic.
Sprinkle chopped roasted red pepper around the brats.
(optional) Place jalapeño slices on top of brats.
Top with the remainder of the onion rings.
Combine dry ingredients in a mixing bowl then sprinkle on top.
Cover aluminum pie tin with aluminum foil.
Place in center of grill over direct med-hot coals.
Cook until done (appx 25-30 min)
