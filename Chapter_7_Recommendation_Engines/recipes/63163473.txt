Ingredients:
1 Cup Butter
1 Cup Brown Sugar
1 Cup Sugar
2 Eggs
1 Tsp Vanilla
2 Cups Flour
2½ Cups Finely Ground Quick Oats
1 Tsp Baking Soda
1 Tsp Baking Powder
½ Tsp Salt
1½ Cups Chopped Nuts (I used Pecans, Yum!)
12 oz Chocolate Chips
1 4oz Hershey Bar (Grated)

Directions:
Measure oatmeal, blend to a fine powder.  Cream butter and both sugars.  Add eggs, vanilla, mix with butter and sugar till smooth.  Whisk flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, baking soda; slowly add to butter mixture one cup at a time.  Mix till smooth.  Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar, and Nuts.  Roll into 2 inch round balls and place 2 inches apart.
Place in preheated oven 375º one tray at a time.  Also can be baked at a lower temperature 300º for 20 mins.  I tried both, I got a softer cookie at the lower temperature.

Description: 
I'm not sure where I picked this up, but I think it's the authentic one.  I know it makes some fabulous cookies, and since I've never been to a Neiman Marcus, I wouldn't know one way or the other!
