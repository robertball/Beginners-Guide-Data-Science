In a medium-size saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Mix in the flour and salt, and stir constantly with a whisk for one minute. Stir in milk. Cook until mixture has thickened. Stir in cheese all at once, and continue stirring until melted, about 30 to 60 seconds.
Layer potatoes in pan and pour cheese between and over the potato layers, and cover the dish with aluminum foil.
Bake 1 hour and 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Uncover and brown the last 10 minutes.

Description: 
Layers of potatoes baked with a simple cheese sauce make a hearty and comforting casserole. To avoid lumps in your sauce, add the milk just a little at a time as you stir the flour and butter. Experiment with different cheeses for variety.Modified from: Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes
