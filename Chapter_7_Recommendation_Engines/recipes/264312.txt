Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
1 carrot, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup vegetable oil for frying
1 eggplant, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons pitted Kalamata olives, sliced

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, carrot, and garlic until onion is golden, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer; turn heat down to low. Continue simmering, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in a separate pan over high heat. Fry eggplant slices in the hot oil until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Drain eggplant slices on paper towels.
Mash the tomatoes in the saucepan using a fork for a less chunky texture. Remove from heat. Add eggplant and olives; stir gently to incorporate.
