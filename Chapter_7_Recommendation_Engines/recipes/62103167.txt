Cayanne Pepper
Black Pepper
Garlic Powder

Fry with Butter and cook on low to medium heat till slightly pink on both sides.

Add Parmesian and Shreaded Cheese and simmer.
Pour over Noodles or Pasta and Serve.
Bon Appetite.

Description: 
This is a very modifiable recipe and all depends 
on the quantity of the spices you add. 
I love this Sauce over Egg Noodles or Fettuccini.
Be creative and have Fun!
