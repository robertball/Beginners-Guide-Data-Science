Ingredients:
Cake:
1 (10 oz.) jar Maraschino cherries, finely chopped
1/2 cup maraschino cherry juice
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 3/4 cups white sugar
3 large eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup milk
2 teaspoon almond extract
Glaze:
1 cup confectioners sugar
1 tablespoon maraschino cherry juice
1 tablespoon milk
1/4 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat over to 350°F (180°C). Generously grease a 12-cup fluted tube pan. Beat butter, sugar and eggs until light and fluffy. Add chopped cherries, 1/2 cup reserved cherry juice, flour, baking powder, milk and almond extract. Beat at low speed, stopping to scrape the bowl frequently. Increase speed to medium for 2 minutes, scraping the bowl occasionally. Pour into prepared pan and bake 45 to 55 minutes. Cool on wire rack for 15 minutes before turning onto serving dish.
Once cake has cooled completely, prepare glaze. Blend confectioner's sugar, cherry juice, milk and almond extract until smooth and drizzle over cake.
*Decorate cake with cherry halves and sliced almonds, if desired.
