Ingredients:
1 bottle of your favorite barbeque sauce, at least 18 ounce size. I prefer the Mesquite flavored sauce.
*The next four ingredients, use more or less to taste
~~2 TBS Worcestershire Sauce
~~1/4 cup A 1 sauce
~~1/4 cup other steak sauce
~~1 TBS liquid smoke, or to taste
1 Onion, tennis ball size, minced.
4 garlic cloves, (2 tsp minced)
1 TBS favorite grilling spice
2/3 cup Apple Butter
1 tsp ground allspice
1/2 to 1 tsp ground cloves
Salt and pepper to taste
***Optional Ingredients
If you would like to add some heat, add chopped hot peppers or desired amount of hot sauce.
If the sauce is getting too thick, you can thin it with a little apple juice.
At different times I have added Brandy flavoring and I have added bourbon to the sauce with fantastic results.

Directions:
Pour barbeque sauce out into sauce pan.
Add Worcestershire sauce, A1 Sauce, Steak sauce and liquid smoke and stir to blend.
Add onion and garlic and grilling spices. Stir well.
Add Apple Butter, allspice and cloves, stirring well.
Add peppers or hot sauce if you are using them.
Place on medium heat and when it's hot, turn heat down to low and cook for 4 or 5 minutes to allow flavors to blend.
Remove 2/3 to 1 cup of the sauce to use for dipping sauce during dinner. Serve the extra sauce well heated.
Baste meat while it is grilling.

Description: 
This sauce is sweet, spicy, and I have yet to find something it doesn't taste wonderful slathered all over. And the extra flavor from the Apple Butter gives it just the extra boost to make it absolutely  wonderful.
