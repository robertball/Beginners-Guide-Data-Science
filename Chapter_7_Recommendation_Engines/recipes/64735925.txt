Ingredients:
1 cup long grain rice
1 1/2 cups water
2 cups 2% milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Pinch salt
8 oz. sweetened condensed milk
3/4 cup raisins

Directions:
Rinse rice until the water runs clear, then strain to remove most of the water. Place rice in the Instant Pot.
Add water, milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt to the Instant Pot with the rice and stir well.
Place the lid on the Instant Pot and seal it. Select Porridge setting and start.
After the timer goes off allow the Instant Pot to release pressure naturally for 10 minutes before using the quick release method to release the remaining pressure.
Remove the lid from the Instant Pot and stir in sweetened condensed milk until combined. Then stir in the raisins.
Serve soon, as it is delicious when it is warm and fresh!
