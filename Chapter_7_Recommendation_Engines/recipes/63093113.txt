Ingredients:
1/2 cup orange juice
1/2 cup vegetable or canola oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon orange peel
1 teaspoon dried mustard powder
4 chicken breasts

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Pour orange juice and oil into a bowl.  Whisk in salt, paprika, orange peel, and mustard powder.
3. Arrange chicken breasts in a glass pan that's just wide enough to accommodate the breasts without touching.  Pour orange juice mixture over the breasts.
4. Bake for 30-45 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit.  Baste the chicken with the glaze every 10-15 minutes of baking.

Description: 
One of my favorite recipes!  The combination of paprika and mustard powder really offset the sweetness of the orange juice.  I tend to eyeball when cooking, so if you cook more breasts or use a large pan, make extra sauce to baste with.  I'll frequently use extra glaze when baking just so there's plenty to pour over rice once it's done!
