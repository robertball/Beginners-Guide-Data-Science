Ingredients:
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish, drained
2 (8 ounce) ham steaks, lightly scored on one side
2 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
In a microwave safe dish, mix together sugar, lemon juice, and horseradish. Heat in microwave on high for 1 minute; set aside.
Lightly brush ham steaks with oil, and place on hot grill.
Brush the ham steaks continuously with brown sugar mixture while they cook until grill marks appear on one side, about 5 to 6 minutes. Turn and continue to cook and baste until steaks are well glazed, 2 to 3 minutes longer.
Cut each steak in half and serve with remaining glaze.
