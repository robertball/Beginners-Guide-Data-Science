Ingredients:
1 cup white rice
2 cups water
1 tablespoon olive oil
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 cup apricot jam
1 cup Italian-style salad dressing (such as Wishbone(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
Â½ cup dried minced onion
1 (15 ounce) can diced pineapple, drained
1  yellow onion, chopped
1  red bell pepper, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until  rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chicken breasts on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.
Combine apricot jam, Italian-style salad dressing, and dried onions together in a bowl. Place browned chicken in a baking dish and pour jam mixture over the chicken; bake for 15 minutes. Add the pineapple, chopped onion and chopped red bell pepper; continue baking until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside, another 15 minutes. Serve over cooked rice.

Description: 
Got this recipe from a roommate and have received countless compliments in dinner groups. When I'm cooking for dinner group (a lot of people), sometimes I use a 16-ounce bottle Italian dressing with an 18-ounce jar of apricot jam.
