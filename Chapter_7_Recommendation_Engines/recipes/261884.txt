Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup sour cream
3/4 cup butter, melted
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups mashed banana
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon rum flavoring
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Mix sugar, sour cream, butter, and eggs in a large bowl using an electric mixer on low speed for 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape bowl and add bananas, vanilla extract, and rum flavoring; beat well.
Combine flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg in a bowl; mix well. Stir flour mixture into banana mixture and beat on medium speed until well mixed, 1 to 2 minutes. Fold in chocolate chips. Spread batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into bars.

Description: 
A very moist banana cookie bar. These never last long in my house. Dust with powdered sugar before cutting. I love these as a frozen treat. After cutting, package the bars in snack bags and freeze. Then just pull out a bag and munch whenever you want!
