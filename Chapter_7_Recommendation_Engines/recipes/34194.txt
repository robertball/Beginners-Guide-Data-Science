Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
2/3 cup evaporated milk
1 1/4 cups miniature marshmallows
1/2 cup butter
1 dash salt
1 1/4 cups cherry baking chips
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
3/4 cup chunky peanut butter

Directions:
In a large saucepan over medium heat, stir together sugar, milk, marshmallows, butter, and salt. Simmer for about 5 minutes or until mixture reaches soft ball stage, 240 degrees F (115 degrees C). Turn off heat. Add cherry chips and vanilla; stir until melted.
Pour mixture into a well-greased 9x13 inch pan, and let cool until firm.
In a microwave, or in a saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate chips and peanut butter. Pour over cherry mixture and spread evenly. Allow to cool completely before cutting.
