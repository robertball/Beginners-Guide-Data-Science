Ingredients:
WET INGREDIENTS:
1/2 c brown sugar
1/2 c quick oats
1 c mashed very ripe bananas
1/3 c milk
1/3 c oil
1 egg
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp maple extract
DRY INGREDIENTS:
1 1/4 c AP flour
1/4 c sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
pinch nutmeg
ICING:
1/2 c powdered sugar
1/4 tsp maple extract
1-2 tsp milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F. Grease, and/or line with paper baking cups, a standard muffin pan for 12 or a mini-muffin pan for 24.
Mix oats and wet ingredients together, and set aside. Whisk together remaining dry ingredients, then stir mixtures together just until combined. Spoon into prepared muffin pan.
Bake standard muffins at 375F for 16-18 minutes, minis at 400F for 10-12 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Let cool 5 minutes in pan. Remove muffins to a rack to cool completely.
Mix powdered sugar, maple extract, and enough milk to make a thick glaze. Drizzle on muffins when cool.

Description: 
These are delicious warm from the oven, and remind me a little of maple and brown sugar oatmeal. If completely cooled and iced, they're more like a maple-glazed donut. We enjoy them both ways and in my house these are called the YAY Muffins!
