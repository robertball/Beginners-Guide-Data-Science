Description: 
I know, you're probably thinking, 'Oh no! Another banana bread recipe!' But this one is a little different: the sour cream makes this one so moist it melts in your mouth. The flavor is just wonderful!  This one is great for gift giving and holidays. Loaves freeze well.Modified from: Banana Sour Cream Bread
