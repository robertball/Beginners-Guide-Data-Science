1 1/4 cups white sugar
2/3 cup butter (room temp)
1/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 eggs
3 cups all purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 tablespoon evaporated milk
3 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Combine first five ingredients (sugar, butter, honey,  vanilla and eggs) and mix until smooth.
Mix together dry ingredients (flour, salt, baking soda, cream of tartar). Blend into butter mixture 1/2 cup at a time, mix until smooth. Add evaporated milk and mix well. Dough should be stiff enough to roll into balls, but not so stiff that it crumbles.
Mix together remaining sugar and cinnamon.
Roll mix into dough balls by teaspoon measure. Then roll in cinnamon & sugar and place on baking sheet approx. 2 inches apart. Press down (very) lightly with finger tips or back of spatula.
Bake for 10 minute - or until edges begin to lightly brown. Let cool and enjoy!
