Ingredients:
3 leeks
6 tablespoons butter, divided
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 (15 ounce) cans chicken broth
5 small red potatoes, peeled and diced
2 slices crispy cooked bacon, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup water as needed
1 cup half-and-half

Directions:
Clean leeks by cutting off the roots and the tips of the leaves. Make a vertical cut from the root end to the tops, being careful to not cut through completely. The leeks will now open like the pages of a book, and any mud can be cleaned out between the leaves under the faucet. Slice the cleaned leeks into quarter-inch strips.
Melt half the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute leeks in hot butter until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes; transfer to a slow cooker.
Melt remaining butter in the same skillet over low heat. Gradually whisk flour into the melted butter until the mixture forms a clump of dough. Slowly stream chicken broth into the skillet, continually whisking until the broth is entirely incorporated; pour over the mixture in the slow cooker. Add bacon and potatoes to the slow cooker. Season mixture with salt and pepper; stir.
Cook on Low until the potatoes are soft, stirring water into the mixture if it gets too thick, at least 2 hours. Stir half-and-half into the mixture and continue cooking for 1 hour more.

Description: 
This recipe is my tribute to James Crockett, the host of 'Crockett's Victory Garden' on PBS in the 1970's. Jim would raise leeks the size of baseball bats and brag about leek and potato soup. His skill in teaching gardening inspired me to pursue a career in horticulture. This version of your soup is my tribute to you.
