Ingredients:
2/3 cup fresh or frozen corn kernals
2/3 cup diced red bell pepper
1 tbsp minced lime zest
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1 tbsp olic oil
salt and black pepper to taste
4 flour tortillas
2 2/3 cups shredded pepper jack cheese (~8oz)
2 avacados, sliced
3 tbsp fresh lime juice
Guacamole and sour cream, optional

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium low and brush grate with oil.
Toss avacados with lime juice, salt, and pepper and set aside.
Saute corn, bell pepper, zest, and cumin in 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat until vegetables are softened, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.
Top half of each tortilla with 1/3 cup cheese, half an avacado, 1/4 cup veggie mixture, and 1/3 cup more cheese, in that order.  Fold empty half of tortillas over toppings.
Grill quesadillas until cheese melts and tortillas are crisp, about 3 minutes per side.  Cut quesadillas into thirds.  Serve with guacamole and sour cream, if desired.
