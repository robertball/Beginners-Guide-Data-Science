Ingredients:
1 lb. Italian turkey or pork sausage, casings removed
1/2 lb. ground turkey or ground beef
1 white or yellow onion, diced
5 cups chicken broth
1 24 oz. jar marinara sauce (I use ALDI's organic)
1 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes
3/4 cup dry red wine
2-3 cloves minced garlic
1 tsp. dried oregano
1 tsp. Italian seasoning
cracked black pepper and sea salt to taste
8 oz. dried lasagna noodles, broken into pieces
Mozzarella, ricotta and/or freshly grated parmesan cheese for garnish

Directions:
Brown sausage, ground turkey (or beef) and onion in a skillet.
While the meats are cooking, combine remaining ingredients EXCEPT noodles and cheese into slow cooker.
Drain meat of fat and add to slow cooker.
Stir to combine, cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours.
Add broken lasagna noodles, cover again and cook for 30-45 minutes, or until noodles are tender.  Turn crockpot to high for this last step, as the slow cooker will lose heat from removing the lid.
Serve with cheese for garnish.
Can  be made on top of stove and add meatballs instead of ground sausage.
