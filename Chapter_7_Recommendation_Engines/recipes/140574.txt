Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons shortening
2 cups self-rising flour
1 cup milk
2 pinches garlic salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a well-seasoned cast iron skillet with the shortening, and place it in the oven as it heats.
Whisk together the flour and milk in a bowl, to make a thick but still runny batter.
Remove the hot greased skillet from the preheated oven, and quickly sprinkle a pinch of garlic salt over the bottom of the skillet. Immediately pour in the batter, and sprinkle the top with a pinch of garlic salt.
Return the skillet to the oven, and bake in the preheated oven until the cake has risen and the top is golden brown, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Hoe cake is a Southern bread that is cooked in an iron skillet, like cornbread.  This recipe stems back to my great-great grandmother.  My father has made this recipe for years, and it is always requested from his grandchildren.  A slice of hoe cake will warm your insides -- slathered with some homemade apple butter alongside of some butter beans, freshly sliced tomatoes and a good tall glass of sweet tea.  I promise your family will love this truly Southern recipe!
