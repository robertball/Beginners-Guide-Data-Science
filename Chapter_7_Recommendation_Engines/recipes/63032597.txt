Ingredients:
1 cup RAW spanish peanuts
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon fresh baking soda
1/4 pound of milk chocolate

Directions:
Grease a baking sheet, and set aside. In a glass bowl, combine peanuts, sugar, corn syrup, and salt. Cook in microwave for 4 minutes on High (700 W); stir and microwave for another 3 minutes; stir again, and if needed microwave again for 1 minute;  mixture should be bubbly and peanuts browned. Stir in butter and vanilla; cook 2 to 3 minutes longer. Watch closely as not to burn the peanuts.
Quickly stir in baking soda, just until mixture is foamy. Pour immediately onto greased baking sheet. Let cool 30 minutes, or until set. Break into pieces.
Temper milk chocolate, and dip cooled brittle pieces half-way into chocolate and place on parchment paper to cool and set.  Store in an air tight container.  Enjoy!
