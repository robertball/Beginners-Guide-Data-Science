Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
Cornmeal
Pizza toppings of your choice

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the oil, sugar, salt and 1-1/2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a firm dough. Turn onto a floured surface; cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
Roll into a 13-in. circle.  Grease a 12-in. pizza pan and sprinkle with cornmeal. Transfer dough to prepared pan, building up edges slightly. Do not let rise. Bake at 425 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until browned. Add toppings; bake 10-15 minutes longer.

Description: 
My aunt shared this recipe quite a few years ago. I like to double the recipe and keep one baked crust in the freezer for a quick snack or meal later.
