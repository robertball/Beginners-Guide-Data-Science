Ingredients:
6 TysonÂ® Fresh Chicken Drumsticks
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 large shallots, thinly sliced
1 jalapeno chile, seeded and finely chopped
3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup packed basil leaves, thinly sliced

Directions:
Heat oil in large nonstick skillet with tight-fitting lid. Add chicken, sprinkle with pepper, and cook over high heat until browned on all sides, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove chicken from skillet; set aside.
Add garlic, shallots, and jalapeno; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Return chicken to skillet; stir in broth, soy sauce, and sugar. Cover and cook 20 minutes, turning chicken once, or until juices run clear when thickest part of chicken is pierced or temperature on instant-read thermometer reaches 180 degrees F.  Sprinkle basil over chicken. (Refrigerate leftovers.)
