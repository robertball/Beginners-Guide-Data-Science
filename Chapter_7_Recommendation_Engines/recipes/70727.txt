Ingredients:
1 quart oil for frying
1 egg
1/4 cup milk
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons dry mesquite flavored seasoning mix
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
2 pounds cube steak, cut into bite size pieces

Directions:
Heat the oil in a deep fryer or heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
In a bowl, beat together the egg and milk. In a resealable plastic bag, mix the flour, mesquite seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Dip the steak pieces in the egg mixture, then place in the plastic bag, seal, and shake to coat.
In the hot oil, fry the coated steak pieces in small batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels.

Description: 
Tired of the same old chicken nuggets? Give these a try! Feel free to 'play' with the seasonings, but this is how my family likes them. Serve hot with barbeque sauce or salsa for dipping.
