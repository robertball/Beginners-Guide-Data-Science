Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable juice (such as V8®)
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley Ranch®)
1 teaspoon rubbed sage
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup Italian-seasoned dry bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup fat-free milk

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine the vegetable juice, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce in a saucepan over medium heat; cook until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes.
Mix the ground beef, garlic powder, onion powder, ranch dressing mix, sage, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Gradually sprinkle the bread crumbs into the meat while mixing so the crumbs are distributed evenly throughout; add the egg and milk and continue mixing. Shape the mixture into a loaf and transfer to a loaf pan. Pour about half the sauce over the meatloaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Cut the meatloaf into 6 even slices. Pour the remaining sauce over the slices to serve.

Description: 
I wanted a different twist to my meatloaf, so I added a package of dry Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing Mix. Instead of using ketchup for the sauce, I use V8 to add a different taste. Use the spicy if you want more of a kick to your sauce. My kids went back for seconds when normally I have to beg them to just eat meatloaf.
