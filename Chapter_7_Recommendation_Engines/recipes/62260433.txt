Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
.5 pound sea scallops, rinsed and drained
.5 pound frozen shrimp, defrosted and drained
1/2 c onion, finely chopped
1/2 pound mushrooms, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 medium tomatoes (or about 5 just over golf ball sized)
1/4 cup dry white wine (optional)
2 tablespoons pasta sauce
salt and white pepper
a few splashes white wine vinegar

Directions:
Chop mushrooms and onion.
Boil water in a small pan - drop tomatoes in for a minute, remove to ice water. Peel then chop - reserving all of the juice.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Without crowding, lightly brown scallops in batches. Remove scallops  to a casserole dish. Do the same with the shrimp. (Just a few minutes on each side, if that - do not cook through)
Stir onion and mushrooms into the skillet, cook until the onion is soft and begins to brown. Stir in garlic, tomatoes, wine, sauce, salt, andpepper. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 15 minutes. Uncover, and cook until thick, about 3 minutes. Mix in vinegar.
Spoon sauce evenly over scallops and shrimp.
Bake in oven until sauce bubbles and begins to brown at the edges, about 10 minutes.
