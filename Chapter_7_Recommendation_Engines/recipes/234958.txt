Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1/3 cup butter, softened
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 large egg
1/2 cup candy-coated milk chocolate pieces (such as M&M's®)
1/2 cup chopped peanut butter cups (such as Reese's®)
1/2 cup chopped chocolate-covered crispy peanut butter candy (such as Butterfinger®)
1/2 cup chopped milk chocolate candy bars (such as Hershey's®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.
Whisk 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Beat brown sugar, butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate large bowl using an electric mixer until creamy; beat in egg.
Gradually beat flour mixture into butter mixture until batter is just combined; fold in candy-coated milk chocolate pieces, peanut butter cups, chocolate-covered crispy peanut butter candy, and milk chocolate bars. Press batter into prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in pan for 10 minutes on a wire rack.
