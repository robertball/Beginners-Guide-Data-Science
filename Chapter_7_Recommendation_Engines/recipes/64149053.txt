Ingredients:
1¼ cups (5.5 oz) MixoFlour Gluten-Free Multi-Purpose Flour
½ teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
½ cup (1 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
½ cup creamy peanut butter
½ cup granulated sugar
½ cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
½ teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
In a separate bowl, cream together the butter, peanut butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat until smooth. Add the flour mixture and mix until smooth.
Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper to ensure easy release. Drop dough by rounded tablespoon on the parchment paper with 2 inches space in between each cookie. The dough can be frozen at this point for later use.
Press the dough flat with a floured fork, making a criss-cross pattern. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until cookies begin to brown. Slide the parchment onto a wire rack to allow the cookies to cool.
