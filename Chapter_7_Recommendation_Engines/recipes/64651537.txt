Ingredients:
3 cups cubed cooked chicken breast
2 avocados, cubed
1 mango, cubed into small pieces
1 jalapeno pepper, seeds removed, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1/2 red onion, diced
1 lemon, juiced
1 teaspoon fresh lime juice
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 bag of Tortilla cups

Directions:
Combine chicken, avocado, mango, jalapeño, red pepper and red onion together. Add in lemon juice, lime juice and salt then combine well.
When you are ready to prepare the cup set out the tortilla chips on a platter. Fill each cup with the chicken mixture then top with cilantro, serve immediately.
Note: This is a great way to use a store bought roasted chicken if you don’t want to put your oven on during the summer!

Description: 
My chicken bites in a tortilla cup with avocado and mango are the perfect summer time appetizer! Actually anytime! They are always a big hit at our lake house and when invited to an event I am asked to bring these! Give them a try!

If you do not want to use tortilla cup you can serve endive or crackers. You can even combine with pasta and make a meal. Enjoy
