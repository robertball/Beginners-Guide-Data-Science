Ingredients:
Crust:
3 cups graham cracker crumbs
2/3 cup white sugar
3/4 cup butter, melted
Filling:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
1/2 cup white sugar
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine graham cracker crumbs, 2/3 cup sugar, and melted butter in a mixing bowl. Mix until evenly moistened, then press into the bottom and halfway up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Place pan on a baking sheet.
Bake the crust in the preheated oven until lightly browned and toasted, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow crust to cool.
Beat cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixture until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in pumpkin puree until completely incorporated.
Fold whipped topping into pumpkin mixture; stir in nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice. Pour pumpkin mixture into graham cracker crust. Cover pie with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Gently remove pie from springform pan.

Description: 
This is a wonderful light whipped pumpkin pie. My husband doesn't like traditional pumpkin pie but loves this recipe I came up with. The cream cheese adds a wonderful flavor with a traditional pie taste but light/whipped. It is made with a homemade graham cracker crust.
