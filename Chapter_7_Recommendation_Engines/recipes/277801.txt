Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into strips
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon ground paprika
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
3 eggs
1 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Season chicken strips with salt and pepper.
Combine flour, Italian seasoning, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder in a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken strips and seal the bag. Shake the bag until chicken strips are well coated with the flour mixture.
Beat eggs together in a small bowl. Combine bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in another bowl.
Dip each chicken strip into egg until well coated, then dip in bread crumb mixture to coat. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, flipping halfway, until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, 35 to 40 minutes.
