Ingredients:
1/2 cup orange juice
1/4 cup lime juice
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Whisk together the orange juice, lime juice, cumin, garlic, and jalapeno pepper in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken breasts, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 2 to 4 hours.
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.  Remove the chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Place the chicken on a broiling pan.
Broil the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
I serve this flavorful jalapeno and citrus-infused chicken with yellow rice. When seeding the jalapenos, leave in as many seeds as you want - the more seeds, the hotter it will be.
