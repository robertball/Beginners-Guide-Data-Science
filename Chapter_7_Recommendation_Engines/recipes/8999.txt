Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter (optional)
1 large white onion, chopped
2 pounds fresh chicken livers
6  hard-cooked eggs
1 small white onion, finely chopped
1 bunch green onions, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons paprika
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided
1 head romaine lettuce
2 sprigs fresh parsley

Directions:
In a large skillet, heat oil and butter over medium high heat. Saute the diced onion until fairly soft. Add chicken livers and saute over high heat, stirring frequently. When livers are cooked through (no longer pink inside and the juices run clear), remove livers and onions from heat and place in a large mixing bowl.
Mash livers with a potato masher. You will need to use your fingers, removing the membranes as you go (the livers will be quite juicy; be sure to leave the juice in). In a separate bowl, mash the eggs and add to the liver. Add the grated or finely chopped raw onion  and chopped green onions and mix all together. The liver mixture should still be warm, and will slightly cook the onions. Season mixture with salt and pepper to taste and add at least 1 tablespoon paprika (more if desired, or if you're Hungarian!). Add 1 tablespoon chopped parsley. Mix well with a large spoon and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.
To Serve: Place lettuce leaves on plates, top with chopped liver and sprinkle generously with paprika and 1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley. Garnish with sprigs of fresh parsley. Enjoy!

Description: 
If this dish asks you, 'What am I, chopped liver?!' you can say, 'Yes!'. I'm particular about using Hungarian paprika, faithful to my roots! You can use a food processor to 'mash' the livers, but the result is too refined for my taste, too much like a pate; traditional chopped liver is lumpy! If you're willing to do the mixing with your hands, you'll get the best results. NOTE: Under NO circumstances should you add beef or any other kind of liver or filler; this will spoil the flavor. Enjoy!
