1 (7 ounce) package shirataki noodles, drained and rinsed

1 pinch stevia powder
1 cup peeled, seeded, and sliced cucumber
1 green onion, chopped

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook noodles in the boiling water until heated through, about 1 minute. Drain and rinse noodles under cold water.
Mix powdered peanut butter, soy sauce, sriracha sauce, and stevia together in a bowl. Add noodles, cucumber, and green onion and toss to coat. Refrigerate until flavors blend, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is my absolute favorite way to eat shirataki noodles! The sauce is very versatile as well. Eat with chopsticks or a fork…or your hands! I'm not judging you.
