Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart baking dish.
In a medium bowl, mix together the oysters, half-and-half, and Worcestershire sauce.  Spread evenly in the prepared baking dish. In a small bowl, mix together the crackers and butter. Sprinkle over the top of the oyster mixture.

Description: 
My family loves this recipe and begs me to make it every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Serve it with turkey, ham, duck or goose - it tastes great with any type of holiday meal. If you like green pepper, you may want to add 1/4 cup to this dish.
