Ingredients:
1 cup cottage cheese
1 cup butter, softened
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup raisins (optional)
3 tablespoons orange marmalade (optional)
1 egg white
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
Combine cottage cheese and 1 cup of butter in a bowl. Mix thoroughly, then gradually stir in the flour. Dough will be sticky. Divide dough into thirds and wrap with waxed paper. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Combine the remaining 1/4 cup of butter with the brown sugar, cinnamon, pecans, and raisins. Set aside. Roll one ball of dough at a time to a 9 inch circle on a floured surface, while keeping the remaining dough chilled. Spread 1 tablespoon of the optional orange marmalade over the circle. Gently press 1/3 of the nut mixture into the dough. Cut the circle into 16 wedges. Roll each wedge tightly, starting with the wide end. Place the cookie point-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. Beat the egg white with the water in a small bowl, then brush the mixture onto each cookie.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.
