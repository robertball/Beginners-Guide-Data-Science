Ingredients:
4 thin veal cutlets
Kosher salt
Freshly ground pepper
1 large egg
1/2 cup tapioca flour

1-2 cloves garlic, minced
1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

Directions:
Take the cutlets and lightly salt and pepper on each side.  Set aside.
Whisk egg in a large bowl.  Please tapioca flour and parmesan cheese in another large bowl or plate.  Dip each piece of veal in the egg to coat both sides then dredge in the flour and shake.  Stack on a plate.
In a large pan over medium high heat.  Add in oil and butter.  Once very hot add in veal and cook each side for 2 minutes.  (Try to use a pan that will fit all 4 pieces)
Add garlic into the pan and let it cook for 30 seconds.  Pour in sauce

Description: 
I love Italian dishes! Of course I do....  However when it's just Glenn and I preparing a great meal in one pot makes me very happy!  That means I get to spend more time with Glenn enjoying a glass of wine and catching up from our busy days.

I hope you enjoy this dish and you can do the same with eggplant or chicken!

Enjoy
