Ingredients:
¼ cup white miso paste
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1 tablespoon honey
½ tablespoon rice vinegar
4  bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix miso paste, butter, honey, and rice vinegar together in a bowl. Rub mixture on chicken thighs, making sure to rub under and over the skin. Place thighs in a large roasting pan with enough distance between them to roast evenly.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Thighs are the best part of the chicken, and this is a really quick way to make them delicious. The miso gives a delightful umami flavor that really saturates the chicken. The honey gives it a nice crisp and color. So very good and so easy.
