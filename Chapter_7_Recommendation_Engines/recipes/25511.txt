Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef chuck
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
24 (2 inch square) dinner rolls, split

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, thoroughly mix ground beef chuck, Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise and dry onion soup mix.
Spread even amounts of the ground beef onto the bottom half of each roll. Place top halves on, forming little sandwiches. If you purchased the rolls in aluminum foil pans, you may return them to the same pan for baking. Otherwise, place them on a baking sheet or baking pan. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until meat is cooked through.

Description: 
These mini hamburgers taste very similar to the popular mini fast food burgers! We make them every year for the Big Game, but they are great any time. They can be made ahead and frozen until needed.
