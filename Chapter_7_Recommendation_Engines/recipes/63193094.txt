Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of chicken soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 small can (4 oz.) of mushrooms, drained
1 (1 ounce) packet dry au jus mix**
3/4 cup water or beef broth
** or some beef boullion seasoning instead for hopefully a less processed flavor

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, onion soup mix, bread crumbs, and milk using your hands. Shape into 8 patties.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge the patties in flour just to coat, and quickly brown on both sides in the hot skillet. Place browned patties into the slow cooker stacking alternately like a pyramid. In a medium bowl, mix together the cream of chicken soup, au jus mix, and water or beef broth mixed with beef boullion seasoning. Pour over the meat. Cook on the Low setting for 4 1/2 5 hours, until ground beef is well done.
