Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons olive oil
¼ cup all-purpose flour
salt and pepper to taste
1 small onion, thinly sliced
2  portobello mushrooms
½ cup beef broth
2 teaspoons dried tarragon
5  canned quartered artichoke hearts
½ cup brandy
¼ cup lemon juice

Directions:
Lightly pound chicken breasts to even thickness. Dust chicken with flour, and add salt and pepper to your taste.
In a heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Place chicken in pan,  brown on both sides, and cook through; this will take about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from pan, and set aside.
Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, and saute onions and mushrooms over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes.
Add  beef broth, lemon juice, tarragon, and artichoke hearts to the pan: heat for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring gently. Stir in brandy, and simmer for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Return chicken to the pan, and heat through.

Description: 
I asked the man in my life which of my recipes he loved.  He knew instantly, but had to describe it since I usually don't name my recipes!  It didn't take long before I figured out 'the one with that great sauce' and the smile he gave me, meant this one.
