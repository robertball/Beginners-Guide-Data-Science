Ingredients:
2 large onions
1/4 cup olive oil
1 Tbs Italian seasoning herb blend (or more to taste)
2 tsp seasoned salt

Directions:
Preheat your grill for medium heat.
Peel the onions and slice them into 1/2-inch thick rounds.  Do not separate the slices into rings.
With a pastry brush, coat both sides of the onion slices with olive oil.  Sprinkle one side of the onion slices with seasoned salt and Italian seasoning herb blend.
Place onion slices on the preheated grill, seasoned side up.  Grill until starting to soften and lightly browned, then gently flip over and grill until tender and lightly browned on the other side.
