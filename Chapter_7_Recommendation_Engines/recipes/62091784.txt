Ingredients:
1 hard-boiled egg, sliced and seasoned
3 cups torn romaine lettuce or spring mix
1/4 cup sliced red, yellow, or orange bell pepper
2 tablespoons minced white onion
1/4 cup ranch dressing
3/4 cup clover or alfalfa sprouts
1/4 cup whole honey-glazed almonds
Crusty buttered pumpernickel bread to garnish (optional)

Directions:
Hard-boil an egg and set aside to cool.
Tear the lettuce into bite-sized pieces and throw into a serving bowl.
Sprinkle diced peppers and minced onion by hand, distributing evenly.
Pour ranch dressing across salad to taste.
Pull apart the sprouts till they are not densely packed and place them on top of salad into a nest-like shape.
Peel egg and slice, if desired.  Season with salt and pepper, as well as any other spices you like.
Arrange the egg slices in the middle of the salad and throw on the almonds around them.
Do not toss.  Serve with good pumpernickel bread and butter.
