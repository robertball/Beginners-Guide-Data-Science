Ingredients:
1 cube vegetable bouillon
1 cup water
3 cups peeled, cubed turnips
1/4 cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
salt and black pepper to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons sour cream
1/2 cup shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese
chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Place the vegetable bouillon cube into a saucepan with the water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the bouillon cube dissolves, about 1 minute. Stir in the turnips, onion, and garlic, return to a boil, and cook the mixture until the turnips are tender, about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook until most of the liquid has been evaporated, 10 to 15 more minutes.
Lightly stir in the sour cream to coat the turnips. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and top with shredded Cheddar cheese and parsley.
