Ingredients:
1-1.5 lb ground turkey
5-6 medium baking potatoes, peeled and quartered
1 15 oz can whole kernel corn, drained
1 8 oz can cream-style corn
1 small onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, crushed
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
3/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large skillet saute onion and 1 clove garlic in vegetable oil.  When onions are translucent add ground turkey and cook until browned.  If there is any excess fat, it can be poured off.
Meanwhile bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Once boiling add potatoes and cover.  Continue cooking at a boil until potatoes are tender, about 12-15 minutes.  Drain potatoes and let sit in pot, covered, 2-3 minutes.  Add milk, butter, salt, and 1 clove crushed garlic and mash.
Combine whole kernel corn with cream-style corn in a small bowl.
Into a 2-quart casserole dish, add ground turkey in an even layer.  Next, layer the corn mixture.  Add mashed potatoes on top of the corn, pushing downward and spreading to fill top of the casserole dish evenly.
Bake in oven 20 minutes, covered.  Take off cover for remaining 10 minutes of baking time.

Description: 
This is an easy recipe with basic main ingredients - turkey, corn, and potatoes.  Although simple to prepare, it is large on taste and has always been a favorite.  It also freezes and re-heats well, so I often make a few batches at a time. The potatoes can be cooked in chicken or beef broth for added flavor.  Enjoy!
