Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter, melted
40 gingersnap cookies, crushed
3 fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and mashed
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
4 fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced
1/4 teaspoon lemon juice
1 1/2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/3 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine gingersnaps and 1/3 cup butter in a bowl; press cookie mixture into a 9-inch baking dish to make a crust.
Mix mashed peaches with flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl until well blended. Gently fold sliced peaches and lemon used into mashed peach mixture. Pour peaches into prepared crust, lightly pressing the peaches down.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 40 minutes. Stir white sugar and 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a small bowl; drizzle butter syrup over peach filling.
Preheat the oven's broiler.
Return pie to the oven and broil until syrup is caramelized, 5 to 10 minutes. Let pie cool before serving.
