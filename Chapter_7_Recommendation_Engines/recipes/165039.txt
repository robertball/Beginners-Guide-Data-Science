Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 tablespoon lime juice
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste
10 cooked medium shrimp, shelled and deveined
5 slices peppered bacon, cut in half
1 (4 ounce) can whole green chili peppers, drained, and sliced lengthwise
1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced (optional)
1 lime, cut into wedges (optional)

Directions:
Whisk together the oil, lime juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Toss the shrimp in the marinade, then refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Preheat an indoor electric grill for medium-high heat.
Remove the shrimp from the marinade, and shake off excess. Wrap each shrimp with a strip of chili pepper, then half a bacon slice. Secure with a toothpick. Repeat with remaining shrimp. Cook on preheated grill until the bacon is crisp, and the shrimp is hot, 6 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle the shrimp with diced avocado, and garnish with lime wedges to serve.
