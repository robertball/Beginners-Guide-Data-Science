Ingredients:
1 large Pink Lady apple - peeled, cored and diced
1 large Bartlett pear - peeled, cored and diced
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 pinch salt
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
1 recipe pastry for a 9-inch double crust pie
2 tablespoons coarse granulated sugar, or as needed (optional)
1/2 cup dark chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Stir apple, pear, brown sugar, vanilla extract, cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk egg and water together in a small bowl.
Roll pastry out on a lightly floured surface; cut into circles with a 3- to 4-inch round cookie cutter. Spoon a small amount of apple mixture onto center of each pastry circle; fold circles in half and press firmly to seal edges. Crimp with a fork, if desired. Place pies on prepared baking sheet.
Cut 3 small slits in top of each hand pie with a sharp knife. Brush surface of pies with egg mixture; sprinkle with decorating sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 25 minutes; allow pies to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.
Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle melted chocolate over pies.

Description: 
Close your eyes when you take a bite of these and you can almost hear the crunch of leaves beneath your feet. These taste and smell like autumn, my favorite season. I like to add a drizzle of dark chocolate at the end; it makes them extra special!
