Ingredients:
about 1 cup mashed potatoesabout 4 cups white flour1 package dry yeast1/4 cup luke warm water (not hot!)1 egg1 teaspoon salt1+ teaspoon sugar1 cup milk7 tablespoons butter (more to grease pan)

Directions:
Peel, cut, and cook the potatoes.While the potatoes cook, put yeast, 1/4 cup warm water, 1 teaspoon or so sugar in a cup to proof (bubble up). Drain the potatoes, put them in the mixer, and mix with the regular blade.Use the potato pan to warm the 1 cup milk.Pull the milk pan off the heat and let the butter melt in the milk. Add the salt. Add the egg.Add some of the liquid mix to the mashed potatoes and mix.Add the rest of the liquid and mix.With the dough hook on the mixer, add the flour a cup or two at a time until you have a SOFT dough (not stiff). Cover the mixing bowl with a towel and let it rise 2 hours in a warm place until double in size.Punch the dough back down.Cover the mixing bowl with a plate (so you can put something heavy on top so the dough won't escape) and refrigerate overnight.(or use a plastic bag if you're pressed for fridge room--but keep an eye on it--you may need to punch it back down or it might pop the plastic bag) About 2 1/2 hours before you want the rolls done, roll out the dough on a floured board and cut into little rounds.Have about half a stick of melted butter ready to pour into a large glass pan (10 x 18??).Plop each little round on a bit of the buttered pan, turn it over on that spot, double it sort of in half and pinch it down in the middle. Cover the roll-covered pan with a towel and let rise 2 hours in a warm place.Preheat oven to about 400 and bake for about 30 minutes until browned on the bottom.
