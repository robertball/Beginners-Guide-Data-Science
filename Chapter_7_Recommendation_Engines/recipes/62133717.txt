shrimp vietnamese soup Recipe

Ingredients:
2 boxes of chicken stock (canned doesn't really work too well)
1 cup of shrimp or seafood stock
1 package of vermicelli noodles
2 tsp of minced garlic
2 tsp of minced or grated ginger
1 tbsp of vegetable oil
1 tsp hot sauce
1 tsp hoisin sauce
1 pack frozen chopped spinach (thawed)
20 cleaned (deveined/shelled) shrimp
salt/pepper to taste
2 green onions (aka "scallions"), chopped
* scallions, hoisin and hot sauce are optional

Directions:
Heat a soup pot over medium heat.
Although the spinach pack may read "Chopped", it tends to not be bite-sized. Run your knife through the thawed out spinach before adding to the pot.
Add vegetable oil, garlic, ginger and chopped spinach to the pot. Season with salt and pepper.
Lower the heat and put a lid on the ginger and spinach, for about two minutes.
After the spinach has cooked down a bit, add chicken and shrimp/seafood stock and put the heat back to medium. Put the lid on it and let the liquids merry together and heat through.
At this point if you're using the hoisin and hot sauce, i'd recommend you add it, a little bit at a time until it reaches the heat you'd like to taste.
Add the shrimp and vermicelli, cover for about 4 minutes and then add in the green onions and let it sit for 5 more minutes.
If necessary, adjust salt. If it's too salty for your taste, add some more hot sauce.
