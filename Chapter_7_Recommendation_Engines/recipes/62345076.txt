Ingredients:
4 cups apple juice (1 quart) - or other juice
1 cup kosher salt
1/2 cup brown sugar (optional)
1 tablespoon whole peppercorns
Rind of one orange or lemon (rind only no pith)
3 quarts ice cold water (a combo of ice cubes and water works well)
boneless pork chops or pork loin or turkey.

Directions:
Measure the apple juice into a saucepan and bring to a boil with the salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, and orange rind.
Let stand for about 10 minutes to develop the flavors, then add the ice water.  Stir and allow to cool completely (using ice cubes helps this)
Add the meat to the cooled brine.  For pork chops  brine in the refrigerate for 2 hours.  For Turkey brine for up to 24 hours.

Description: 
This is a not a marinade.  Brining is actually a chemical reaction that relaxes the very lean muscle structure of the meat.  It makes it so juicy you'll ask why you would do it any other way!Modified from: Pork Brine
