Description: 
This is an alteration of a simple preserve recipe. I add lemon aid, lemon zest and fresh lemon juice to add some tartness and crisp clean finish. It can be easyly altered to drizzle on, or glaze pork or chicken. 
As is great for all things toasted, pancakes, waffles, ice cream, etc.
Or for a spicy alternative add some cayenne pepper mix well and drizzle over your grilled pork chops or chicken!
Add some mint and dip your lamb lollipops!
