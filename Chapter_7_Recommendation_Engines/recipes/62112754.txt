Ingredients:
8 pork chops
1/2 to 1 lb mushrooms - cleaned and sliced
3 to 4 medium onions - sliced 1/4 inch thick(don't seperate)
seasoning salt
Pepper to taste
Non-stick spray
6 strips bacon (optional)

Directions:
preheat oven to 350F
Sprinkle chops with seasoning salt - set aside
using non stick spray - spray the bottom and sides of a 9x13 inch casserole/lasagna dish.  Cover bottom of dish with a single layer of onion slices.
Using a large frying pan on high heat - sear both sides of chops.
Place chops in single layer over sliced onion.
Place another single layer of onion slices over top of chops.
Evenly distribute mushrooms over onions (it's okay if they heaps over the top of the pan they will shrink)
Sprinkle seasoning salt and pepper over mushrooms.
Lay stips of bacon evenly across mushrooms (optional).
Using the non-stick spray - spray a large piece of tin foil (shiny side).  Wrap the top of the pan with the foil - sprayed side down.
Bake in oven for 1.5 - 2 hours.
Remove foil, remove bacon, push aside mushroom and onions to reveal top of chops.
Turn oven up to broil - and return chops for another 10 - 15 minutes until chops are browned.
You may either discard the extra liquid, or use to create your own gravy.  To make gravy, pour into a small saucepan and heat to bubbling.  Mix a tablespoon of flour with hot water in a seperate cup.  Slowly add small amounts of the flour mix to gravy as you whisk the liquid until desired consistancy.
Serve chops, mushroom/onion mix and bacon with some rice and buns. No knives needed!
