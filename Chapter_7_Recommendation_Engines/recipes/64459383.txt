Ingredients:
6 large eggs
3/4 cup skim milk
2 1/2 tbs Dijon mustard
1/4 tsp black pepper
1 tsp olive oil
2 slices Canadian bacon, diced
1/4 cup red onion, diced
1/3 cup cherry tomatoes, quartered
1 cup kale
1/2 shredded sharp cheddar cheese
12 slices whole wheat bread, crusts removed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 and generously spray 12 cup muffin tin with cooking spray. Whisk eggs, milk, mustard and black pepper and set aside. Heat olive oil in a skillet. Add Canadian bacon, onion and tomatoes. Cook about 5 minutes until bacon and onions are browned. Add kale and cook until wilted, stir into egg mixture. Stir in shredded cheese. Gently press bread slices into muffin cups. Ladle about 1/4 cup egg mixture into muffin cup. Let stand for 1-2 minutes to absorb. Top off with remaining egg mixture. Bake 20-22 minutes until egg sets. Cool slightly before removing from muffin tin.
