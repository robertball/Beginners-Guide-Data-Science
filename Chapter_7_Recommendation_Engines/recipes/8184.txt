Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 cup water
1/4 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1 teaspoon strawberry extract
1/4 cup chocolate syrup
3 drops red food coloring
2/3 cup confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons chocolate syrup

Directions:
Grease and flour a 12-cup bundt pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Blend the cake mix, water, oil, and eggs on low speed until moistened. Beat 3 minutes on medium speed. Pour 1/2 of the batter into the bundt pan.
Measure 1/2 of the remaining batter into a small bowl and stir in the strawberry extract and food color (as much as you want to make a pretty, dark pink color). Carefully pour this into the pan.
Stir 1/4 cup chocolate syrup into the remaining batter and carefully pour this into the pan on top of the strawberry batter.
Bake for about 40 minutes in a 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven. Cool 15 minutes.
Remove from pan and drizzle chocolate glaze over the top.
To make chocolate glaze: Mix together confectioners' sugar and 3 tablespoons chocolate syrup until smooth. If necessary, a few drops of water or a small amount of additional confectioners' sugar may be added until the desired consistency is obtained. Drizzle over top of the bundt cake.
