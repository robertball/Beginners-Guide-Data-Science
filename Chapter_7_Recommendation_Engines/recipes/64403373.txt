Ingredients:
1/2 Cup egg whites, 1 pat butter, 2 tbsp. chopped onion, 1 cup washed baby kale and spinach, 1/4 cup shredded Italian cheese, Natures Seasoning to taste

Directions:
Melt 1/2 pat of butter on medium low heat in a cast iron or non stick pan. Add onion and saut√© for about a minute until it starts to turn translucent, then add kale and spinach season with Nature's Seasoning or seasoning of your choice and cook until onions are translucent and greens are wilted. Remove from pan and set aside.
Melt remaining 1/2 pat of butter in the same pan on medium low and add egg white add seasoning, giving it a good whip with the fork and then run your fork around the edges giving it a little lift as you go. When eggs are 2/3 set, top 1/2 with your greens and onions mixture and sprinkle evenly with the cheese. Continue running your fork along the edges and when the cheese is nearly melted, use your fork to lift one edge slightly and with a flexible, bevel edged spatula gently slide the egg loose from the pan in one solid piece then fold it over so that the greens are on the bottom half of the eggs and give it a flip. after about 30 seconds, remove from the pan and serve.

This is delicious any time of the day. I like to eat mine with a slice of whole wheat toast spread with orange marmalade to balance the surprising richness of the omelet.
