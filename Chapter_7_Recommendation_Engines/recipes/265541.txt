Ingredients:
1/2 cup dried split peas
1/2 cup dry lentils
3 1/2 cups water, divided
1 clove garlic, diced
1/2 tablespoon diced fresh ginger
1 1/4 teaspoons salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon chile powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1 dried red chile pepper, crushed
2 bay leaves
2 cups cubed peeled acorn squash
2 cups cubed yam
2 tomatoes, diced
1/2 onion, diced

Directions:
Rinse and drain split peas and lentils. Place them in a large soup pot with 2 cups water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low. Add garlic, ginger, salt, turmeric, pepper, chile powder, cinnamon, cumin, crushed red chile, and bay leaves. Stir and let simmer until peas and lentils are soft, about 20 minutes.
Stir the remaining 1 1/2 cups water, squash, yam, tomatoes, and onion into the pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until squash and yam are tender, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is a delicious vegetarian/vegan stew I made while experimenting one night. It's very low fat and delicious! The squash and yam are very mellow, almost sweet flavors, but the Indian spices (especially the chile powder!) give it some kick. The preparation time is probably exaggerated... I'm just learning to cook, but it is a lot of veggie chopping. It's well worth it, though!
