Ingredients:
2 Loaves French Bread, cubed
8 oz Cream Cheese, softened
1 cup powdered sugar
2 cups plus 2 Tbsp Milk
2 Cups Blueberries (Frozen or Fresh)
3 tsp vanilla
8 Eggs
1/2 tsp Nutmeg
1 tsp Cinnamon

Directions:
1. MIx cream cheese, powdered sugar, 2 Tbsp milk and 1 tsp vanilla in a bowl until smooth and creamy.
2. Fold in 1 cup blueberries.
3. Cover bottom of 10X14 pan (I use a Pampered Chef Stoneware pan) with one layer of the bread.
4. Spread the filling evenly over the bread (If it's too thick to spread, you can add a little more milk).
5. Cover the spread with the remaining bread.
6. Whisk together 2 cups milk, eggs, nutmeg, cinnamon and 2 tsp vanilla in a large bowl and pour over the bread.
7. Sprinkle 1 cup blueberries over the casserole.
8. Cover tightly and refrigerate overnight.
9. Remove from refrigerator 30-60 minutes before baking.
10. Preheat oven to 375 degrees and bake covered for 45 minutes.
11. Uncover and bake until center is set, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
I made this for Christmas Morning brunch, perfect to put in the oven and go open presents while it bakes.  You can top with Syrup or Whipped Cream or nothing at all.  I found several different recipes similar to this one, but none had everything I wanted to do with it, so I thought I'd try to make my own.  I think it is a very good start, but please, let me know what you think!
