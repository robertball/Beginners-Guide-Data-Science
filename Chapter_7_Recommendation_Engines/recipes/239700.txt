Description: 
I was looking for a way to use spices that help with health such as turmeric, cinnamon, and cardamom pods, but I had spaghetti. So I made up this recipe. My family really enjoyed it. It's kind of a blend of the Indian recipes I've tried recently and regular spaghetti. My husband thought it might taste good with chicken added.
