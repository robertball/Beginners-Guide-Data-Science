Ingredients:
2 Heads of Cabbage
4Lbs. Ground Meat (Beef, Pork, whatever)
2 cups uncooked rice (preference is not instant rice)
2 eggs
2 cans of chicken with rice soup
1-2 cans golden mushroom soup
2 onions
Oleo
Marjoram, salt, pepper and other spices to taste (invent some new flavors)

Directions:
Cut core out of cabbages getting down as far as you can. Boil cabbage until leaves are falling off. Remove leave from water as they peel off and set aside.
Dice onions in the oleo until they are translucent.
Mix ground meat, cooked onions, chicken with rice soup and spices with the the rice in a large bowl. (Some people like to cook the rice, I like using it uncooked as it soaks up more of the flavor as they roast).
Take each cabbage leaf, lay it flat and trim the thickest part towards the bottom of the leaf to make them easier to roll. Take the darker outside leaves and line the bottom of the roasting pan with them.
Scoop up some of the meat mixture and roll it into the leaves. Place any extra leaves on top of the completed rolls. Cover pan with tinfoil and bake in the oven at 350 for 2 hours.
During the last 15 minutes, peel off top layer of cabbage and pour on the golden mushroom soup.
