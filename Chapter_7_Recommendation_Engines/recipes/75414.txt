Ingredients:
6  bone-in chicken breast halves
7 medium onions, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, chopped
Â¼ cup vegetable oil
6 medium tomatoes
1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
16  tostada shells
1 cup sour cream
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the chicken into a large pot along with 1/4 cup of sliced onion, garlic, and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until no longer pink, about 25 minutes. Remove chicken, cool, and shred meat. Discard skin and bones.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining onion slices, and fry until transparent. Place tomatoes into a pan of boiling water (you could use the leftover chicken water), and boil until they split open.
Place the tomatoes, the whole can of chipotle peppers, chicken bouillon into a blender or large food processor. Process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Pour this mixture into a large pan, and add the shredded chicken and cooked onions. Heat through.
To serve, each person spreads some sour cream on their tostada shell, and tops with a spoonful of the chicken.

Description: 
This authentic Mexican recipe I picked up while living in Mexico.  It has a spicy, smoky flavor from chipotle peppers.  It is perfect for a buffet where people can serve themselves and even better heated up as leftovers the next day! If this is too spicy for you, try using less chipotle peppers.
