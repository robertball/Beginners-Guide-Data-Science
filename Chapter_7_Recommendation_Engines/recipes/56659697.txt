This brings back wonderful memoryies of baking with my grandma when I was young. I don't have her recipe but this is exactly like the one she made right down to the frosting, we must have doubled ther recipe as we always made a 9x13, It is easy, moist,dense and flavorful. Thanks for sharing, I can't wait to make it for my family.
