Ingredients:
3 tablespoons soy sauce
¼ cup pineapple juice
3 tablespoons pineapple juice
¼ cup hot honey (such as Mike's Hot Honey(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
3 tablespoons hot honey (such as Mike's Hot Honey(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon brown sugar
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground ginger
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into strips
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons pineapple juice, 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons hot honey, garlic, brown sugar, salt, and ginger in a saucepan; stir until well combined. Cook over medium heat until sauce is just starting to boil, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and whisk in cornstarch until well incorporated. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture starts to thicken, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove teriyaki sauce from heat.
Thread chicken into skewers. Season both sides with salt and pepper. Brush chicken on both sides with teriyaki sauce, reserving remaining sauce, and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight for best results.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place chicken skewers on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 13 minutes. Remove from oven.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Brush skewers with more sauce. Broil each side for 2 to 3 minutes. Serve with extra teriyaki sauce on the side.
