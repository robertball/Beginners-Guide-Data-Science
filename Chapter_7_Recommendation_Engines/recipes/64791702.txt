Here’s a super-easy recipe for youall you need to do is layer the ingredients and bake. The juices from the chicken soak into the riced cauliflower while baking which makes this taste so good! Make it more spicy by using fresh jalapeños and their seeds, or go milder by removing the seeds. My family doesn’t like meals really spicy so I go one step further and use pickled jalapeños, which are even milder.
