Add onion, canned tomatoes, cans of beef broth, red wine and dry gravy mixes.
Cook slow cooker on low for 6-8 hours.
About 20-30 minutes before serving, if you want gravy to be thicker, mix some corn starch with water.  Remove the meat from the slow cooker.  Turn the slow cooker on high and stir the corn starch/water mixture into the gravy in the slow cooker.  Once it had thickened, place meat on serving plate with egg noodles, rice, or potatoes.  Pour gravy over the top.

Description: 
The cube steak is so tender after cooking in the crock pot all day.  My son is a big gravy fan, so I always ensure that I use extra ingredients so that he has enough.  Unfortunately, this site currently doesn't allow adding pictures, because the finished product looked yummy!
