Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package medium-firm silken tofu
vegetable oil for deep frying, or as needed
3 tablespoons potato starch
Sauce:
2 tablespoons water
2 teaspoons potato starch
2 tablespoons sake
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
1 tablespoon fish stock, or to taste
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 carrot, cut into matchsticks
3 dried shiitake mushrooms, sliced into long, thin strips, or more to taste
1/2 Welsh onion (shironegi), cut into matchsticks
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated, or to taste

Directions:
Cut tofu into squares. Place on a microwave-safe plate and cover with paper towel. Microwave until moisture is evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes.
Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover tofu squares generously with potato starch. Fry in the hot oil until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Place in a bowl.
Mix water and 2 teaspoons potato starch together in a bowl to make the thickening agent.
Combine sake, soy sauce, mirin, and fish stock in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and add carrots and mushrooms. Cook and stir until carrots are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the thickening agent. Cook and stir until sauce is thickened and flavors combine, about 2 minutes more.
Pour sauce over the tofu. Top with Welsh onion and ginger.
