Ingredients:
- Chicken pieces, a mixture of thighs and drumsticks; 8
- Lemons; 2 juicy ones, halved
- Garlic; 1 plump clove, finely sliced
- Olive Oil; 4 Tablespoons
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
In a shallow dish, put the chicken pieces.
Squeeze over them the lemon juice.
Sprinkle over them the garlic slices.
Add the olive oil and marinate for 15 minutes minimum but can also leave for a few hours!
Pre-heat the grill (broiler) to medium. If you have it too hot, the outside of the chicken will be cooked while the inside is still underdone.
Open the window and/or turn on the extractor!
Season the chicken pieces with salt qand pepper and place them in a grill pan.
Spoon over them some of the marinating juices.
Place the pan under the heat at a distance between 10 and 15 cms (4 to 6 inches).
Turn once, basting with more of the marinade.
The chicken is done when the skin is crisp all over, caramelised in places, and the juices from the thickest part of the thighs run clear when pierced with a metal skewer.
Serve hot or cold, with the cooking juices (NOT the marinade) poured over.
