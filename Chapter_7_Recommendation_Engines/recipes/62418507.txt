Ingredients:
1 lb. ground beef
1 meduim onion chopped
4 small cans baked beans (I use Campbells Pork n Beans)
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup ketsup
1 tbs mustard
1 tbs liquid smoke

Directions:
Brown the ground beef and onion together, pour off excess fat. Mix in remaining ingredients. Bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees. (Hint: to save from heating up my house in the summer I often put it on my gas grill on low for about the same time, keep a good eye on it and use a metal pan)
