**The ** Potato Salad Recipe

Ingredients:
2 - 3 lbs red potatoes, skins on
2 - 3 hard boiled eggs, chopped coarsely
4 slices (+/-) bacon
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
2 - 3 large ribs celery, chopped
3/4 c. sour cream
3/4 c. real mayonnaise, homemade or store-bought (homemade is better)
3/4 c. Miracle Whip or equivalent salad dressing
1 TB +/- prepared mustard
1 TB +/- dijon mustard
Kosher salt
Fresh ground pepper
Paprika

Directions:
Quarter the potatoes and boil them, skins on, until tender; about 25 minutes, depending on the size of your potatoes.  Drain them and cool until they're not too hot to handle, and slice them into bite-size chunks.
Meanwhile, cut the bacon into bits and fry until crispy and brown.  Drain on paper towels.
Put potatoes, eggs, bacon, onions, green onions and other remaining ingredients into a large bowl (adding salt and pepper to taste) and mix gently with a wooden spoon. Sprinkle paprika over the top and cover bowl; put into the refrigerator to chill for at least a couple of hours.  It's really best if left overnight -- but that presupposes it lasts that long ;0
