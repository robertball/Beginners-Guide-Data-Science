Ingredients:
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
5 1/2 cups flaked coconut
1 cup finely diced dried pineapple
1/2 cup finely chopped salted macadamia nuts
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon rum flavored extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.
Combine the flour, coconut, pineapple, macadamia nuts, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the sweetened condensed milk, rum extract, and vanilla extract. Drop golf ball-sized scoops of the dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until coconut is toasted, 12 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
I love the tropical taste of these chewy delights. It's important to dice the pineapple very small so it does not overwhelm the other flavors.
