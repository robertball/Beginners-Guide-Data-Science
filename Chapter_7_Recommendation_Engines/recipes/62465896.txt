Ingredients:
12 Puff Pastry Shells
1 cup of butter
1/2 cup flour
1 vidalia onion - chopped
3 cloves of garlic - chopped
1 green, red or yellow pepper - chopped
2 stalks celery - chopped
3 or 4 green onions - chopped
1/2 cup vegetable broth
2 lbs of crawfish tails
handful of parsley - chopped
3 tbs tomato paste
salt & pepper
cayenne to taste
hot sauce to taste

Directions:
Set oven to 400 degrees. Bake the puff pastry shells for 5 to 7 minutes until they stand up and start to brown a little. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Pull off center tops and save. Turn oven down to 350 degrees.
In a large skillet melt the butter & stir in the flour and cook to a light brown roux. Add the vidalia onion, pepper, celery & green onions. Cover & simmer for approximately one hour. Make sure to stir every so often. Add vegetable stock & tomato paste and stir until it's a creamy consistency. Stir in crawfish tails & parsley and cook for about 15 minutes until the tails are tender.
Spoon mixture into puff pastry shells until slightly overfilled. Put remainder into a pie dish and cover with the remaining puff pastry shell center tops to create a crawfish pot pie too.
Place the tray of puff pastry shells & the dish of pot pie in the oven and bake for about 15 minutes at 350 degrees or until the shells are golden brown & the filling has a nice shine to it.
