Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) beef strip steaks
1 garlic clove, halved
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup sherry or beef broth
1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons chopped green onion

Directions:
Rub steaks with garlic and sprinkle with salt and pepper; set aside. Melt butter in a large skillet. Add the sherry or broth, Worcestershire sauce and onion. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes.
Add the steaks and cook over medium heat for 3-7 minutes on each side or until the meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F, medium, 160 degrees F, well-done, 170 degrees F).
