Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 (16 ounce) package frozen stir-fry vegetables
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
salt and pepper to taste
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup cornstarch
salt and pepper to taste
1 (14 ounce) package firm tofu, drained and cubed
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup peanut sauce
1/4 cup chopped peanuts

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat, and cook the vegetables until tender. Mix in the ginger, and season with salt and pepper. Remove vegetables from skillet, and set aside.
Place the eggs in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix the cornstarch, salt, and pepper. Dip tofu cubes first in the egg, then the cornstarch mixture to coat.
Heat the remaining oil in the skillet or wok over medium heat, and cook the coated tofu 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Stir in the peanut sauce and peanuts. Continue to cook and stir until sauce has thickened and tofu is well-coated. Serve with the vegetables.

Description: 
This is absolutely the best way to eat tofu, especially for first timers. The tofu has a slightly crunchy exterior while the inside is nice and soft. I used to make my stir-fry with chicken or beef, but my husband won't have it any other way than tofu now! And my 2 year old loves it! It is a delicious, easy, quick, and inexpensive meal. Serve with Asian noodles or with steamed rice. Enjoy!
