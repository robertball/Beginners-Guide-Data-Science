Ingredients:
3 pounds boneless beef rump roast
1 large onion, sliced
3/4 cup reduced-sodium beef broth
1 (1 ounce) package au jus gravy mix
2 cloves garlic, halved
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Cut roast in half. In a large nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, brown meat on all sides over medium-high heat. Place onion in a 5-qt. slow cooker. Top with meat. Combine the broth, gravy mix, garlic and pepper; pour over meat. Cover and cook on low for 6-7 hours or until meat and onion are tender.
Remove meat to a cutting board. Let stand for 10 minutes. Thinly slice meat and return to the slow cooker; serve with pan juices and onion.

Description: 
It's easy to fix this roast, which has lots of onion flavor. Sometimes I also add cubed potatoes and baby carrots to the slow cooker to make a terrific meal plus leftovers. --Carol Hille of Grand Junction, Colorado
