Ingredients:
1 1/8 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar, divided
1/2 cup cold butter or margarine
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
In a bowl, combine 1 cup flour, oats and 1/2 cup brown sugar; cut in butter until crumbly. Press into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.
In a mixing bowl, beat eggs, vanilla and remaining brown sugar. Combine the coconut, walnuts, baking powder, salt and remaining flour; gradually add to egg mixture. Stir in chocolate chips. Spread evenly over crust. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown. Cut into bars while warm. Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
This recipe is my children's favorite (and mine!). For even more sweet flavor, they always ask me to dust the bars with confectioners' sugar.
