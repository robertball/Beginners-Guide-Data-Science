Ingredients:
1/2 cup crushed garlic
2 tablespoons butter
6 cups water
1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
1/4 cup chopped fresh tomato
3 eggs, beaten
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large pot over medium heat, cook garlic in butter until brown.  Pour in water and bring to a boil.  Stir in bouillon granules, reduce heat and simmer a minimum of 20 minutes.  Stir in tomatoes, whisk in eggs and season with salt and pepper just before serving.

Description: 
Simple yet delicious. Cook garlic slowly to bring out the sweetness (the longer it simmers in the broth the better). I serve a bowl of this with a few grilled skewered shrimp laid over the rim of the bowl and crusty bread as a starter.  Everyone that tastes it will want the recipe.  This recipe is even better if you use a low sodium prepared chicken stock in place of the water and chicken bouillon
