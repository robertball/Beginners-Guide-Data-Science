2 bottles beer (your choice!)
1/3 C lemon bottled lemon juice

Combine ingredients in non-reactive pan.  Bring to boil.  Add shrimp.  Simmer for approximately 3 minutes, depending on the size of shirmp used. Remove from heat and let sit for at least 5 minutes.  Drain.  Cool slightly and serve with dipping sauces of lemon butter and hot sauce.  I dip first in lemon butter and then hot sauce, but you will find what works best for you! You will need extra paper towels!
