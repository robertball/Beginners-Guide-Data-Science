Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1 1/3 cups packed brown sugar
1 egg
1/4 cup milk
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup finely diced peeled apple
1 cup raisins
VANILLA GLAZE:
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon butter or margarine, melted
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons milk

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream shortening and brown sugar. Beat in egg and milk. Combine the flour, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Stir in walnuts, apple and raisins.
Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until edges begin to brown. Remove to wire racks.
In a small bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar, butter, vanilla, salt and enough milk to achieve drizzling consistency. Drizzle over warm cookies.
