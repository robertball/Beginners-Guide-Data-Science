Description: 
These Italian meatballs use seitan (prepared by steaming and then ground) instead of meat, are easy to make and hold together very well. Loosely based on Chef Johns Italian Meatballs. The whole family enjoyed them and I will be making them again for sure.Modified from: Chef John's Italian Meatballs
