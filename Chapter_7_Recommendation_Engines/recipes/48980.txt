Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
4 (10 inch) flour tortillas
4 tablespoons Ranch-style salad dressing
1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced
1 tomato, chopped
1 cup shredded lettuce

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until crisp. Drain, crumble, and set aside.
Warm tortillas in microwave oven for 30 to 45 seconds, or until soft. Spread 1 tablespoon Ranch dressing down the center of each tortilla. Layer crumbled bacon, avocado, tomato and lettuce over the dressing.  Roll the tortilla around the other ingredients.

Description: 
My family loves B.L.A.T. sandwiches. The addition of avocado to the normal bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich makes so much sense to a girl born in California! We have been calling these 'BLATS' for years. Recently we decided to update our favorite treat  by using a tortilla in place of the bread, and Ranch dressing instead of mayonnaise. This recipe is so easy and tasty, the hardest part is cooking the bacon!
