Description: 
Pack in antioxidants. The ultimate in simplicity and refreshing taste, this coleslaw is flecked with green, red and yellow vegetables, the colors signifying the presence of antioxidants (cabbage is thought to have anti-cancer activity). I like its crispy, sweet-and-sour taste, unlike that of a creamy coleslaw.
