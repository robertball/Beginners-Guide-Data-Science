Ingredients:
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 Tbs fresh parsley, chopped
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 lb raw bacon
1 lb fresh asparagus
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a saute pan, add oil, garlic and parsley.  Saute over medium heat for 3 minutes.  Cut off ends of asparagus.  Lay 4 stalks in the center of each piece of bacon.  Drizzle garlic oil then wrap bacon around and secure with a toothpick.  Lay each bundle on a lined cookie sheet (I use Renoylds Release) and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Bake at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until bacon is cooked.
