Ingredients:
2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsalted butter, cubed and frozen for 20 minutes
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed and frozen for 20 minutes
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup ice water

Directions:
Pulse flour, butter, cream cheese, and salt in a food processor until you have flour-covered pea-sized pieces, about 15 quick pulses. Add water and process until all flour is dampened and dough clumps and almost comes together.
Crisscross 2 long pieces of plastic wrap to form an X and lightly dust with flour. Dump 1/2 of the dough into the center and wrap, pressing dough into a 3x4-inch block. Smooth wrapped surface with a rolling pin; flip and repeat. Repeat with remaining dough and more wrap.
Chill dough for at least 4 hours or preferably overnight, or slip into zip-top plastic freezer bags and freeze up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge before using.
