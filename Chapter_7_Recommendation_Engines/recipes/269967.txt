Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 15 minutes.
Place Brussels sprouts, olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix well. Spread evenly in the air fryer basket. Cook for 15 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through the cycle.

Description: 
No bells and whistles with this one, just delicious sprouts with crispy brown edges and soft insides. I've got a 10-quart fryer so if the sprouts look crowded in your basket, make two batches. Just place in a 170 degree F oven to keep warm.
