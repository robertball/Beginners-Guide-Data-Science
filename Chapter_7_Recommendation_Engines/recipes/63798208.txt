Ingredients:
3 Lg eggs
4 Cups heavy whipping cream
2 Cups sugar
3 Tsp vanilla
2 Cups fresh or frozen blueberries
1 10-12 oz package white baking chips
1 (1 lb) loaf french bread cut into 1 inch cubes
Sauce
1 10-12 oz white baking chips
1 Cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a large bowl, combine eggs, cream, sugar and vanilla. Stir in blueberries and baking chips. Stir in bread cubes; let stand 15 minutes or until bread is softened.
Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, 50-60 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
For sauce, place baking chips in a small bowl. In a small saucepan, bring cream just to a boil. Pour over baking chips; whisk until smooth. Serve with bread pudding. Yield: 12 servings.
