Ingredients:
6 medium baking apples, such as Rome Beauty or York Imperial
1/3 cup mixed dried fruit bits or raisins
1 (14 ounce) can EAGLE BRAND® Sweetened Condensed Milk
1 tablespoon water
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Core apples; peel a strip from the top of each. If necessary, cut thin slice from bottom of each apple so apple will stand upright. Place apples upright in greased 11x7-inch baking dish. Fill centers with fruit bits or raisins.
In medium bowl, combine sweetened condensed milk, water and cinnamon; pour over and around apples. Set dish in a 13x9-inch pan. Set on oven rack. Carefully pour boiling water into pan to 1-inch depth.
Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until apples are tender, occasionally spooning sweetened condensed milk mixture in bottom of dish over apples. Serve warm.
