Ingredients:
2 medium mangoes, peeled and cubed
2 1/2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice

Directions:
Puree the mangoes, honey, and lime juice in a blender or food processor until smooth.  Whip the heavy cream to soft peaks, and fold into the mango puree.  Beat egg whites in a clean dry bowl until stiff, then stir half into the mango mixture.  When well blended, gently fold the remaining egg white into the mousse until no streaks remain.
