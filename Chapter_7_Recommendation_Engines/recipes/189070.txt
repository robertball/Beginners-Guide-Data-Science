Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
4 cloves garlic, sliced
2 cups cherry tomatoes
3 cups penne pasta
3 3/4 cups chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1 1/4 cups fresh basil leaves, chopped
2 cups diced cooked chicken
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Coat a microwave-safe casserole dish with olive oil; stir in the garlic and tomatoes. Cover and microwave on High until tomatoes begin to burst, 4 to 5 minutes, stirring after 2 minutes. Remove garlic and tomato mixture from the microwave and crush the remaining tomatoes with a fork. Stir in pasta, chicken broth, salt, and pepper.
Cover and return to microwave. Cook on High until pasta is tender, 16 to 18 minutes, stirring after 10 minutes. Remove pasta from the microwave, then stir in the basil, chicken, and Parmesan cheese.
