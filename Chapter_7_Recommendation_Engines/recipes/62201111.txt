Ingredients:
1 can Black Beans, drained and rinsed
1 can Rotel tomatoes, drained very well
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt

Directions:
Combine beans, Rotel tomatoes, and garlic salt in a food processor, pulse until consistency of paste.
Spread on your favorite Nacho chips for a great beginning!
Hint; make sure the Rotel tomatoes are drained near dry or they will make the beans too moist.  I wash the top of the can before I open it and push the lid down until there is no more liquid dripping out.

Description: 
We use this black bean mixture instead of canned Refried Beans when making Nachos; adds a bit of pizzazz!
