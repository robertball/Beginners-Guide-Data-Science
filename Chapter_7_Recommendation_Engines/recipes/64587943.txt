Ingredients:
5 medium-size perfectly ripe bananas (no brown spots)
20 oz. can of crushed pineapple – not drained
1/4 cup coconut
3 cups of white sugar
3 Tbsp bottled lemon juice.

Directions:
Peel and slice the bananas and then put them into a large pot.  Add the rest of the ingredients and put on the stove to bring to a boil, stirring constantly.
After bringing to a boil, lower to a simmer and cook until thickened, still stirring constantly.  Cook until reduced down into a jam texture.
When properly thickened, spoon the mixture into sterilized glass jars and let cool.
At this point in the recipe, this jam can just be refrigerated and will keep for approx 4-6 weeks. The lemon juice in the recipe will keep the bananas fresh.
Or after putting the jam in the jars, you can seal the jars with sealing lids and rings and process in a water bath for 15 minutes. Just a note that if you process your Monkey Butter in this method, it will turn out to be a little pink instead of the mellow yellow color.

Description: 
Have you ever heard of Monkey Butter? This is crazy good!  Like monkeys swinging from the rafters good. Like Gorilla pounding on their chest good. Just a warning that it is on the sweet side, but crazy good. I’m thinkin’ I’m putting this on PB&J’s, english muffins and even over ice cream.
I know that your family will go “Ape” over this Monkey Butter.
