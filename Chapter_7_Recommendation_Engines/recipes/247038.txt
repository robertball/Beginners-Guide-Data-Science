Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) can SPAM速 with Bacon, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1 sweet yellow onion, cut into wedges
2 avocados - peeled, pitted, and cut into 1-inch cubes
4 large eggs
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 lime, juiced, or to taste

Directions:
Cook and stir SPAM(R) with Bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until just browned, about 7 minutes; remove from skillet and set aside.
Add just enough oil to the same skillet to coat; cook and stir onion and avocado until browned, about 7 minutes; keep warm.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat; crack the eggs into skillet and cook until whites are mostly firm, about 2 minutes. Flip eggs gently and cook until desired doneness is reached, about 2 minutes for over easy eggs; season with salt and pepper.
Stir SPAM(R) with Bacon back into skillet with onion mixture; drizzle lime juice over the top.
Divide hash onto 4 plates; place an egg on top of each serving.
