Directions:
Mix ingredients together until crumbly mixture is formed.  Place frozen rolls in pan close together.(about 1" inbetween rolls) Sprinle brown sugar mixture over top.  Let rise in cold oven overnight.  In morning, sprinkle with pecans.  Turn oven to 350 degrees, but do not remove rolls.  Bake for 20 minutes.  I brush rolls with butter when I remove them from the oven.  Serve warm.

These pecan rolls are so easy.  The smell of pecan rolls baking in the morning really gets the family out of bed quickly.  They are so delicious. I can smell them right now.
