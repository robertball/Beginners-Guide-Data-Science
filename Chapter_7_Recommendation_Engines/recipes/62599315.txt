Ingredients:
2 Tbls olive oil
1 medium-size onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)\
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups finely chopped mushrooms
1 Tbls chile powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup quinoa
4 large red bell peppers
1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 teaspoon pure msple syrup
Fresh cilantro for garnish

Directions:
In a saucepan over medium heat, saute the onions in the olive oil for 3 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent.  Add the garlic and mushrooms; suate about 5 minutes, until the mushrooms have released their moisture.  Stir in the chile powder and salt.  Add the quinoa and 1 cup of the tomato sauce (reserve the rest) and the water, lower the heat and cover, and simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring once.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350F and prepare the peppers.  Boil a pot of water.  Cut the tops off the peppers and remove the seeds.  Boil the peppers for 5 minutes and then drain them.
Combine the beans and maple syrup with the cooked quinoa mixture.  Stuff each pepper with filling and stand them upright in the baking dish.  Pour the remaining tomato sauce over the peppers and back for 15 minutes.  Remove from oven, garnish with cilantro and serve.
