Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 onion, sliced
1 (16 ounce) package baby carrots
4 potatoes, peeled and sliced
seasoned salt to taste
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium-high heat.
Form the ground beef into individual patties, and place each patty on a piece of foil large enough to hold the patty and some vegetables. Layer each patty with onion slices, carrots, and potato slices.  Season with seasoned salt, salt, and pepper to taste. Wrap foil around food, and seal each packet tightly.
Grill 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Carefully open each packet (the steam that escapes will be very hot), and serve.

Description: 
This recipe combines hamburgers with onions, baby carrots, and potatoes in individually cooked foil packets. This makes clean up a snap, and keeps the grill clean, too. This also works well with round steaks.
