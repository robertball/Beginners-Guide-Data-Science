Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups packaged seasoned stuffing
1 1/4 cups turkey or chicken stock
1 pound ground turkey
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 medium apple, peeled and grated
1/4 cup finely grated onion
2 teaspoons poultry seasoning
2 large eggs
For sauce:
2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries
1/2 cup orange juice
3/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon coarse grain mustard

Directions:
Preheat over to 350 degrees.   Line two baking sheets with aluminum foil and coat with cooking spray.
In a small bowl, stir together the stuffing and the stock.  Let the mixture stand for about 2 minutes to soften.
Place the turkey in a large mixing bowl.  Add the salt, pepper, apple, onion, poultry seasoning, eggs and stuffing mixture and stir until well blended.  Form the mixture into 1 1/2 inch balls and put them on the prepared baking sheets.  Bake until they're cooked through, firm and golden, about 20 minutes.
While the meatballs bake, make the cranberry dip.  In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stir together the cranberries, orange juice and sugar.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the mustard.  Use an immersion blender or food processor to puree the sauce.  Serve it on the side with the meatballs.

Description: 
From FamilyFun November 2012 issue. The best flavors of turkey-day are rolled together in these super-moist meatballs.  Because of their soft consistency, they should be served with forks rather than toothpicks.
