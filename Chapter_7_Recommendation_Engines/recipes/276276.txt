Ingredients:
Donut Muffins:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (13 ounce) jar chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)
Cinnamon-Sugar Coating:
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, or more as needed
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Powdered Sugar Glaze:
1 1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar, or more as needed
1/4 cup milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Whisk until combined.
Combine 3/4 cup sugar, milk, vegetable oil, egg, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Add flour mixture and stir until combined.
Place 2 tablespoons of batter into each prepared muffin cup. Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of Nutella(R) to the center of each and cover with 2 additional tablespoons donut batter, or until each cup is 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges and bottoms are browned, 18 to 22 minutes. Do not overbake. Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes; shake muffins out of the tin while still warm.
Melt butter in a small microwave-safe bowl in a microwave in 10 second intervals. Combine sugar and cinnamon in another small bowl. Dip donut muffins into the melted butter followed by cinnamon-sugar coating.
Mix powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Dip donut muffins into glaze.
