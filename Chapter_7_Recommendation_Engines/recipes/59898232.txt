Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
1/2 cup margarine
1/3 cup all purpose flour
4 cups milk
1 cup shredded colby-jack cheese
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded pepper-jack cheese
4 ounces cubed processed cheese food
1 tablespoon garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain well and return to cooking pot.
Lightly grease  a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the 1/2 cup margarine.  Stir in all purpose flour and cook for 2-3 minutes.  Slowly begin to whisk in the milk, a little at a time, making sure to dissolve any flour lumps before adding more milk. Cook flour and milk mixture until slightly thickened, and begin to whisk in the first three cheeses. Season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Pour sauce over noodles.  Stir to combine, pour into prepared baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes or until hot and bubbling around the edges; serve.

Description: 
A very rich and creamy version of macaroni and cheese.  If you don't have the suggested variety of cheeses listed in the recipe feel free to experiment with whatever you have in your fridge.  A great way to use up random cheese in the cheese drawer.Modified from: Four Cheese Macaroni
