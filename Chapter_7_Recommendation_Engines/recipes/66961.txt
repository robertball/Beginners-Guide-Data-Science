Ingredients:
3 cups uncooked white rice
3 cups water
1 (12 ounce) can fully cooked luncheon meat (such as SPAM®), cubed
3 (15 ounce) cans kidney beans, with liquid
1/4 cup butter
1/8 teaspoon dried onion flakes

Directions:
Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Stir together the luncheon meat, kidney beans with liquid, butter, and onion flakes in a large saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Spoon the beans over the cooked rice to serve.

Description: 
This is a recipe that my mom made for us while growing up.  We live in Minnesota, where SPAM originated, and my father is Puerto Rican; this was an ingenious way for my mother to weave the cultures together.  This is a quick and tasty meal, enjoy!
