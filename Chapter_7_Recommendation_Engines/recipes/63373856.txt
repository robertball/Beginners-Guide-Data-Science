Ingredients:
6 cups of chick peas rinsed
2 tablespoons of ground black pepper
1 teaspoon of salt (to taste)
4 tablespoons of garlic powder(personal preference on how much)
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 lemon juice

Directions:
* food processor or blender is needed*
the first step is to rinse the chick peas (or garbanzo beans whichever way you say it) then you want to break them up a bit in the blender or food processor. Then in order you want to add the following ingredients.
oil
salt
pepper
lemon
garlic
this is done so that the seasonings have enough moisture to mix in well so that every bite has all the flavors. I hope you enjoy this. I recommend that you place this in the fridge for at least 15 minutes before you serve it, with a dish like this giving it a chance to set will enhance the flavors.

Description: 
I have only recently gotten into Mediterranean recipes and i started playing around with different seasonings and blends for hummus. For those of you that don't know hummus is a chick pea based spread popular in Mediterranean cuisine. This one is one that i served as part of a theme week at work.
