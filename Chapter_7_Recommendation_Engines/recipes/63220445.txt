Ingredients:
1 lb Hamburger
1 pkg Taco seasoning mix
1 Head Lettuce
1 can kidney beans or black beans
2 Tomatoes
3-4 Green Onions (chopped)
Cheese, shredded
tortilla chips or Doritos
Western Dressing

Directions:
Brown hamburger with taco seasoning.
While ground beef is cooking, cut up lettuce, tomatoes and green onions and toss.
Once ground beef is good, rinse the beans and add to the ground beef mixture to warm.
Layer the salad, meat and chips as preferred on your plate.
Add dressing and cheese.
Note:  I prefer to crunch up doritos and toss everything with the dressing.  My husband prefers a layer of chips on the plate and topping it with untossed salad.  It's all good!
