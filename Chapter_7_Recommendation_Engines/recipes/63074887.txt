Ingredients:
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1  cups white sugar
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 (8 ounce) cans crescent roll dough
1/3 cup melted butter
1/3 cup white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 Tablespoons honey

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat the cream cheese with 1 cups of sugar, the vanilla extract & egg in a bowl until smooth. Unroll one can of crescent roll dough,  pinch together to shape each piece into a 9x13 inch rectangle. Press  into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Evenly spread the cream cheese mixture into the baking dish, then cover with the remaining pieces of crescent dough that is also shaped into a 9 x 13 rectangle
Drizzle the melted butter evenly over the top of the cheesecake. Stir the remaining 1/3 cup of sugar together with the cinnamon in a small bowl, and sprinkle over the cheesecake. Bake in the preheated oven until the crescent dough has puffed and turned golden brown, about 35 minutes, drizzle honey on top when you take out of oven. Cool completely in the pan before cutting into 12 squares.
