In a pot, bring the vegetable broth to a boil. Stir in the penne pasta and heated crushed garlic clove. Cook for 5 minutes, or until pasta is almost al dente. Remove and discard garlic clove.
Transfer the partially cooked pasta and broth to the skillet. Mix in the peas. Cover skillet, and continue cooking 10 minutes over medium heat, or until pasta is al dente and vegetables are tender. Toss with the Parmesan cheese to serve.
