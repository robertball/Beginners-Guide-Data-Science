Ingredients:
1/4 cup vanilla flavored vodka
2 tablespoons butterscotch schnapps
1 tablespoon iced tea
1 cup ice cubes
1 tablespoon caramel ice cream topping

Directions:

Description: 
For those of us with a sweet tooth.  This needs to be served really cold in order to get the flavors to blend. Shake it in a cocktail shaker until it becomes frothy and frosted.
