Ingredients:
The Rub:
1/4 cup paprika
3 tbsp coriander seeds or 2 tbsp ground
3 tbsp brown sugar
2 tbsp whole pepper corns or 1 tbsp coarse grind pepper
2 tbsp yellow mustard seed or 1 tbsp ground mustard
1 tbsp whole white pepper corns or 1-1/2 tsp ground white pepper
1-1/2 tsp garlic powder

Directions:
To prepare the rub, combine coriander sees, pepper corns and mustard seeds in a spice grinder.  Grind coarsely.  Add in remaining ingredients and mix well.  Rub is now ready to use.
Pat corned beef dry and cover all surfaces with your rub mixture.  Corned beef is now ready for smoking.
Prepare Your Smoker:
Place 10 lbs of charcoal brickettes into the fire pan.
Place 4 oz of lighter fluid into the center portion of the brickettes and ignite.
When charcoal is white, place two or three handfuls of a fruit tree wood chips suitable for smoking onto the whitened brickettes.  Wood chips should soak in a pan of water for at least 30 minutes prior to use.
Place your water pan above the fire pan, then place your corned beef on top of a grill above the water pan.
Cover and cook until internal temperature of the pastrami is 165*F.
Remove from the smoker and allow to cool covered on a counter top.
When pastrami is cooled to room temperature, serve immediately, thinly sliced on rye bread, or refrigerate or freeze for future use.
