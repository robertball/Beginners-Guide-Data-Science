https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 cup milk, room temp
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon chia seeds, soaked in
2 tablespoons water (see note)
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 cup flax seed meal
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 cups white bread flour
2 teaspoons active dry yeast

Directions:
Place all ingredients into bread machine in the order listed and mix on the "dough" cycle. Punch down dough after the cycle is complete and roll into a sandwich loaf and place in a well-greased bread pan. Allow dough to rise in a warm location for about 45-60 minutes, then bake at 375 degrees for 40 minutes.
Optional - brush the dough with milk or egg wash prior to baking.
* Note - prior to making this recipe, soak chia seeds in water to create a chia gel. I keep a fair amount of chia gel in my fridge and use about 2 tbsp of chia gel in this recipe, however food.com does not recognize Chia Gel as an ingredient.
