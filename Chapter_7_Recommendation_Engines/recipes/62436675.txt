Ingredients:
1 Cup sugar
1/4 Cup all-purpose flour
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp almond extract
1 1/3 tbs butter (about 4 tps)
14.5 ounce can of pie cherries (not cherry pie filling) I like dark Morello cherries from Trader Joes) Pitted Red Tart Pie cherries in water work as well.
Pastry for double crust pie.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425
In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, flour, cinnamon and undrained cherries. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, unti mixture thickens and boils. (about 6-7 minutes). Remove from heat and stir in almond extract.
Pour mixture into an 9 inch unbaked pie shell. Dot with butter. Cover with top crust, seal edges and crimp. If a lattice crust is not used, vent the top crust in several places. Bake at 425 until the top crust is brown.
