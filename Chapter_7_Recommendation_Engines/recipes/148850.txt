Ingredients:
1/2 cup beef broth
1/2 cup dry red wine
1 1/2 cups sliced mushrooms
1/4 cup finely chopped shallot
3 cloves garlic, crushed
3 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
3 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon butter
1 pound trimmed beef tenderloin, slightly pounded

Directions:
Pour the beef broth and wine into a large skillet, and stir in the mushrooms, shallot, garlic, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce. Simmer over medium heat , stirring frequently, until the mushrooms reduce in size, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Skim off 2 tablespoons liquid from the mushroom mixture, and pour into a small bowl. Whisk in the flour and blend to make a smooth paste. Stir the flour mixture into the mushroom mixture. Cook and stir as sauce thickens. Repeat as desired , adding small amounts of more flour to make a thicker sauce. Stir in the parsley. Pour the sauce into a pan, and keep warm until needed.
Using the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Place the tenderloin in the skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning once, until desired degree of doneness. Serve with mushroom sauce.

Description: 
I LOVE Steak Diane, but most of the recipes I find are made with way too much butter and/or olive oil. I wanted a lighter version, but with the same amazing flavor. So, after experimenting a bit, this is what I came up with. I think it is even better than those buttery, fatty versions. This recipe also yields lots of yummy gravy, so it's great with mashed potatoes.
