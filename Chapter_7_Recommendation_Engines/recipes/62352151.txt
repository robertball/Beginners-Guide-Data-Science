Roast peppers until the skins are blackened.  Place in a paper bag for 10 minutes to cool.  Peel off the skin.

Description: 
This is a great dish to serve when you're feeling like having something Italian.  You can char the peppers under the broiler or use the BBQ.  I do all the prep work on our gas BBQ then bring the ingredients inside and put them in the crock pot.
