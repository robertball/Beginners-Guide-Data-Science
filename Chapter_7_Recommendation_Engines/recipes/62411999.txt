Ingredients:
1/2 cup granulated sugar
4 teaspoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
5 cups fresh blueberries
2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats
1/3 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
6 tablespoons unsalted butter , cut into 6 pieces and chilled

Directions:
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Combine granulated sugar, cornstarch, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in large bowl. Add berries to bowl and toss to coat. Transfer to 8-inch square baking dish.
2. Process flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and remaining salt in food processor until combined. Add butter and pulse until dime-sized clumps form. Transfer crumble to bowl and pinch together any powdery parts. Sprinkle crumble evenly over berries.
3. Bake until filling is bubbling around edges and topping is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool on wire rack for at least 30 minutes. Serve. (Once fully cooled, the crumble can be wrapped with plastic and refrigerated for 1 day. Bring to room temperature before serving.)
