Ingredients:
210ml jar mediterranean sundried tomatoes, drained and diced
1 tablespoon olive oil*
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1/3 cup kalamata olives, diced
1/3 cup green olives, diced
3 cloves garlic, pressed/minced
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
fresh ground pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut in two lengthwise
your favourite crackers or bread

Directions:
Stir together olive oil, balsamic and cayenne pepper.
Dice olives into tiny pieces and add crushed garlic.
Add to olive oil mixture and blend well.
Season with pepper to taste.
Cover and refrigerate overnight* if possible to blend flavours.  Still decent to serve immediately.  Better if chilled for a few hours.
Slice cream cheese length wise and put on two plates or serving dishes.
Spoon Sundried Tomato Tapenade over cream cheese blocks and serve with crackers or bread.  Caution: this one goes fast!!
