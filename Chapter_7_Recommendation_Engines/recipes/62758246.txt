Ingredients:
2 T mustard oil
1 tsp black mustard seeds
1/3 tsp turmeric
1 tsp pre-packaged minced garlic or 2 whole cloves, sliced
4 dry red chilies, crumbled coarsely
1 lb green beans, cleaned and trimmed but not chopped
1 large baking potato (1/2 lb) cut in matchsticks
1/4 c water
1/2 tsp salt
1 - 2 tsp lemon juice

Directions:
Measure all spices and place in small bowls for quick access.
Heat oil over medium high heat.  When it is hot, add mustard seeds.  When they start popping, add the dry red chili, then after 10-15 secs (chilies will burn VERY quickly so watch it and DON'T INHALE).  Add the garlic and the turmeric and cook over med heat for about 30 secs or so.
Stir in beans and the potatoes.  Let fry with minimal turning for about 5 mins - let the potatoes start to brown a bit before turning.
When the potatoes have started to brown pretty well, add the water and salt.  Reduce heat to med-low, cover, and cook about 15-20 mins until veggies are thoroughly cooked.
Uncover, raise heat to med, and toss until any residual liquid has evaporated.
Remove from heat; sprinkle lemon juice on.
Serve with rice, naan, chapatti, or puri.
