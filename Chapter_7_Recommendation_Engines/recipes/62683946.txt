Ingredients:
3 large eggs
2 cloves garlic, finely minced
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
2 Tbls. finely chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup, more or less, seasoned bread crumbs
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Step one: Combine ingredients
Place the eggs in a small bowl and beat lightly. Add minced garlic, grated parmesan cheese, and chopped fresh parsley. Mix well.
Step two: Finish the stuffing
Slowly drizzle in the seasoned bread crumbs while mixing constantly. Use only enough bread crumbs to bring the mixture to a soft, spreadable paste. Add salt and pepper to taste. Be careful with the salt because of the amount of parmesan cheese that is already in the stuffing.
