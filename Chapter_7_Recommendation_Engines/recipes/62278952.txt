Ingredients:
1 full bowl (or gallon) of snow
1 can of sweetened condensed milk

Directions:
Place a large bowl outside when snowing. (or, if theres a lot of snow, you can pick up the clean, fresh snow)
When the bowl is full, add the sweetened condensed milk, and MIX WELL. (snow melts fast so make sure the bowl is REALLY filled with snow)
Another variation is, if your more a "fruity" person, you can use any smoothie mix and pour it over the snow (without the condensed milk). But make sure you don't put too much, otherwise it will turn into liquid.

Description: 
My mom would used to tell us that back home they would eat snow with thick, sweet milk Which can be easily known as sweetened condensed milk. This recipe is easy, and will be leaving you asking for more.
