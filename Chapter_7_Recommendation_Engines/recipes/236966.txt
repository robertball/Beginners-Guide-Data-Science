Description: 
This is a creamy spread that is cooked. My Aunt Erma Lee was a great cook. Feel free to adjust the sugar to your taste. This is a great spread for sandwiches with soup. Try spreading it on buns with hamburgers or sloppy joes for a new twist! Soars above store-bought! Can be kept under refrigeration for up to one week.
