Ingredients:
6 green tomatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes
3 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
16 green onions (white and pale green parts only), chopped
1 bunch cilantro, chopped
5 tablespoons soy sauce
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix green tomatoes, celery, green onions, and cilantro together in a 2-quart casserole dish. Whisk soy sauce, olive oil, brown sugar, vinegar, black pepper, salt, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl; pour over vegetable mixture. Toss to coat.
Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes; stir about 20 minutes into cooking to redistribute sauce.

Description: 
I love the tangy taste of fried green tomatoes, but they are, well...fried! And messy to make. I developed this recipe to help assuage my hunger for fried green tomatoes, and yes, it does the job quite well. Without all the grease and batter, the tangy taste of the tomato can really shine through!
