Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
3 slices thick cut bacon, cooked & finely chopped
4 ounces shredded cheddar cheese

3 tablespoons ranch dressing

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir bacon, cheese, green onion and ranch together in a small bowl; mix well.
Unroll crescent rolls on a clean surface and thoroughly close all seams.
Spread entire bacon and cheese mixture onto the pastry. Leave an inch of space from edges of pastry inwards empty.
Roll up pastry tightly.
Cut vertically into 9 pinwheels.
Lay each flat down on a lightly greased cookie sheet with two inches of space around each.
Bake until pastry is golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This dish is a delicious spin on the traditional ham and cheese pinwheel. Green onions add a nice kick to an already great combo - they'll be gone before you know it!
