Ingredients:
1/3 cup white sugar
1 package active dry yeast
1 1/4 cups warm milk (no hotter than 100 degrees F (38 degrees C))
1/4 cup melted butter
1 large egg, beaten
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
3 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
For the Top:
3 tablespoons butter, divided
3 1/2 ripe peaches
1/3 cup apricot preserves
2 tablespoons Demerara sugar

Directions:
Combine sugar and yeast in a bowl. Pour in milk, butter, and egg. Whisk together until sugar is dissolved. Stir in flour, a portion at a time, until mostly moistened, adding more if dough is too wet. Add salt and stir until a soft, slightly sticky dough comes together.
Cover dough with a damp towel and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.
Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1/2 tablespoon butter. Split peaches in half along the seam and slice halves into quarters, then eighths.
Transfer dough into the buttered baking dish. Use a spatula to spread dough out to the corners of the dish. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise once more until roughly doubled in volume, 30 to 45 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Arrange peach slices onto the dough, pressing them in lightly. Drizzle remaining butter on top. Sprinkle Demerara sugar over peaches.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake, not through a peach, comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
Heat apricot preserves up with a splash of water and brush glaze over the top of the cake. Let cool to room temperature before slicing.

Description: 
I've never been to Baltimore, so I can't comment on the current state of affairs, but what I can tell you is that this easy to make, yeast-based cake really is amazing. They say this recipe was brought to Baltimore by German immigrants, who apparently used to top it with caramelized onions. I don't know about onions, but any ripe, sweet fruit should work in this. Serve with ice cream if desired.
