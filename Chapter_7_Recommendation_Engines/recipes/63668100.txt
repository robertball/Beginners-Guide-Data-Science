Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
3-6 tablespoons milk, or as needed
2-3 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Place the butter and peanut butter into a medium bowl, and beat with an electric mixer. Gradually mix in the sugar, and when it starts to get thick, incorporate milk one tablespoon at a time until all of the sugar is mixed in and the frosting is thick and spreadable. Beat for at least 3 minutes for it to get fluffy.
