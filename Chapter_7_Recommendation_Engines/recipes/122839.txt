3 pounds boneless ham
1/3 cup honey

Directions:
Place ham on a greased rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 50-60 minutes. Combine honey, mustard and sugar; brush about 3 tablespoons over ham. Bake 10-15 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 140 degrees F and ham is heated through. Stir into remaining glaze; heat through and serve with the ham.
