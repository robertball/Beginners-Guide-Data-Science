Ingredients:
2 pounds beets, peeled and cut into chunks
4 cloves cloves garlic, peeled
6 peppercorns
2 bay leaves
Brine:
3 cups water, boiled and cooled
1 tablespoon salt

Directions:
Distribute beet chunks between two jars with lids. Add 2 cloves garlic, 3 peppercorns, and 1 bay leaf to each jar.
Combine water and salt in a bowl to make the brine; stir until salt is completely dissolved. Pour enough brine into the jars to completely cover the beets.
Screw on lids and let jars sit at room temperature until foam starts to appear on top, about 1 week. Transfer jars to a cool place (50 degrees F, 10 degrees C) for 2 to 3 days after foam appears. Store in the refrigerator.
