Ingredients:
1 small onion, chopped
5 medium carrots, peeled and chopped
2 teaspoons butter
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 cups water
1 medium yam, peeled and diced
7 small red potatoes, cubed
2 cups cauliflower florets
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
2 teaspoons curry powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon garam masala
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Puree the onion and carrots in a food processor or blender until finely ground.  Heat the butter and olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Cook the garlic until fragrant and lightly browned.  Pour in the carrot puree, bring to a simmer, and cook for 5 minutes.
Pour in diced tomatoes, water, yam, red potatoes, and cauliflower.  Season with turmeric, curry powder, cumin, garam masala, cayenne, and red pepper flakes.  Simmer until potatoes are soft, about 30 minutes.
