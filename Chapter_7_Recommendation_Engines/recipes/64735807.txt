Ingredients:
For the baharat blend:
1.5 tbsp strong paprika
1 tbsp ground black pepper
1 tbsp cumin
3/4 tbsp ground coriander
3/4 tbsp ground loomi (dried limes)
1/2 tbsp ground sumac
1/4 tbsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tbsp ground cloves
1/4 tbsp ground nutmeg
2 black cardamom pods, crushed
5 green cardamom pods, crushed
2 tbsp olive oil
1 chicken breast
2 chicken thighs
2 chicken legs
1/2 bunch fresh cilantro
1/2 fresh lemon juice
1.5 cups brown basmati rice
2 tsp olive oil
1 shallot, diced
1/8 cup shelled, raw pistachio nuts
1/4 cup raw cashews
1/4 cup shelled, raw almonds
1/4 cup golden raisins
1 cup chicken broth

Directions:
Mix all the dry spices together and set aside.
Add the lemon juice, oil, fresh coriander and all but 1 tbsp of the baharat blend to a zip top plastic bag. Shake gently. Add the chicken pieces. Seal and shake. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator for at least four hours.
Soak the rice in water for at least one hour. Rinse and drain. Add the nuts, raisins, and remaining tablespoon baharat blend. Mix well. Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 190°C. In a tagine or dutch oven, add 2 tsp olive oil and the diced shallot. Sauté until translucent. Turn off the heat. Add the rice mixture and toss.
Remove and discard the fresh coriander from the bag. Place the marinated chicken on top of the rice. Do not throw away the bag. Pour the broth into the plastic bag and shake gently. Pour contents over the chicken and rice. Cover and cook in the oven for 1.5 hours or until the rice is soft and the internal temperature of the chicken is 77°C.
Remove the cover and place under the broiler to crisp the chicken. Serve with fresh, chopped cilantro.
Notes/Footnotes: If you can’t find loomi aswad (dried black limes), use 1/2 tbsp Mexican tajin spice and reduce the paprika by three-fourths.
If you use white rice, reduce cooking time accordingly.

Description: 
Complex and intense baharat blend infuses roast chicken and basmati rice. I have made this like the combinations from the Gulf region by adding spices like loomi (dried lime). Keep this mix handy to add to soups, too.
