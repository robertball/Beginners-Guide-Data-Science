Ingredients:
8 large eggs
12 thick slices bacon
1/2 cup milk
1 TBSP olive oil
1 cup of shredded hash browns (from frozen bag)
1/2 onion, chopped
3 thinly sliced plum or grape tomatoes
1 TBSP Montreal Steak Seasoning
1/2 tsp Sriracha
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Place bacon slices in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown, but still flexible.
Spray a 12 count muffin tin with non-stick spray.
Wrap bacon slices around the inside each muffin cup.
In a medium sized saucepan over medium heat, caramelize the hash browns and onions in the olive oil until they are a deep brown, stirring often.
Whisk the eggs, milk, Sriracha, red pepper flakes, and Montreal Steak Seasoning together in a large bowl just until combined and then stir in the cheddar cheese.
Add to the bottom of each muffin cup, a thin layer of the caramelized hash brown and onion mixture.
Pour the egg mixture evenly into each muffin just to the top of each pocket.
Place into your preheated oven and bake until the egg mixture puffs and is just set in the center, about 10 to 15 minutes.
After 10-12 minutes, when the top of the muffins are just firm enough, arrange the tomato slices on top of the each muffin (2-3 each) and place in the oven for an additional 10 minutes until set.
Remove from the oven and serve immediately.
