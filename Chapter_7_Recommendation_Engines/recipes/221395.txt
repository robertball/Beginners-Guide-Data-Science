Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 head cabbage, chopped
1 onion, chopped (optional)
1 clove garlic
1/4 cup water
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Heat a large pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir ground beef until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in cabbage, onion, garlic, and 1/4 cup water; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Pour remaining 1/4 cup water into pot; bring a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until cabbage is tender, 7 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is an extremely reductive version of the traditional Polish dish, Golabki or Stuffed Cabbage Rolls. This recipe was given to my mother by her Polish mother-in-law several years ago. Simple Golabki is tasty, easy, and quick.
