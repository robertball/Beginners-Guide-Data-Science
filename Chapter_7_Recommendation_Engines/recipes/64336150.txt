Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour or Whole Wheat Flour
2 tsp Baking Powder
1/2 tsp Salt
2 Tbsp Sugar OR Sugar-substitute
1 Large Egg
1 1/2 cups Lukewarm Milk
1/3 cup Melted Butter

Directions:
Preheat your iron while you make the waffle batter.
Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, and butter or oil.
Mix together the wet and dry ingredients, stirring just until combined. The batter will be a bit lumpy; that's OK.
Cook the waffles as directed in the instructions that came with your waffle iron.
