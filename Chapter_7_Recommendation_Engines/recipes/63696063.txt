Ingredients:
1 lb sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks
3 T peanut oil
1 onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp fish sauce
1 tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp siracha or other chili sauce
1 can light coconut milk
1 8 oz package baby spinach
salt to taste

Directions:
1. Boil the sweet potato chunks in salted water until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.
2. Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Saute the onion until translucent. Add the garlic, fish sauce, and turmeric and saute for an additional minute.
3. Add the coconut milk and siracha and simmer for 5 minutes until slightly thickened. Stir in the sweet potatoes and heat through.
4. Place the spinach in the pot on top of the curry and cover. After a few minutes, the spinach will wilt enough to allow you to stir it into the curry. Season with salt to taste.

Description: 
This is a delightful curry, but is very basic in its seasoning. Feel free to add red curry paste or yellow curry powder if you want to increase the flavor. Serve with naan or over rice if desired.
