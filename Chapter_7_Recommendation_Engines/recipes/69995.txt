Ingredients:
1 bunch fresh asparagus spears
1 cup water
1 cup white wine vinegar
1/4 cup brown sugar
4 cloves garlic, crushed
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and julienned
4 sprigs fresh thyme
2 tablespoons Old Bay Seasoning TM
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon salt
6 whole black peppercorns

Directions:
Trim the bottoms off of the asparagus, and pack loosely into a 1 quart jar.
Combine the water, white wine vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, jalapeno, thyme sprigs, bay leaves, salt and whole peppercorns in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, and boil hard for 1 minute.
Pour the hot liquid over the asparagus in the jar, filling to cover the tips of the asparagus. Cover, and cool to room temperature. Store in the refrigerator for 24 hours to blend flavors before serving.

Description: 
Ok not quite dill pickles, but still good. These pickled asparagus spears are not spicy and have a flavor all their own.  I use them in Bloody Marys at my restaurant.
