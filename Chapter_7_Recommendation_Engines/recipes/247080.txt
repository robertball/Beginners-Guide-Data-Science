Teriyaki Chicken Tacos: Toss chicken with VH(R) Teriyaki Stir-Fry Sauce; refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or for up to 8 hours.
Purple Cabbage Slaw: Meanwhile, whisk together mayonnaise, lime juice, garlic and salt; toss with cabbage. Let stand for 30 minutes.
Spray grate of outdoor grill with PAM(R) Grilling for Grill Spray. Preheat grill to medium heat. Grill chicken for 5 to 7 minutes per side or until chicken is cooked through. Let stand for 5 minutes. Slice chicken.
Fill tortillas with sliced chicken, some of the cabbage slaw, avocado, cucumber and green onion. Serve with remaining cabbage slaw and lime wedges.

Grill vegetables for 3 to 5 minutes per side or until grill-marked and tender. (Eggplant should be soft; cook eggplant for 1 to 2 minutes longer if necessary.) Let vegetables cool slightly; chop coarsely. Meanwhile, cook fusilli according to package directions and drain.
Meanwhile, in large, deep skillet, heat Aylmer(R) Accents(R) Garlic and Olive Oil Petite Cut Tomatoes over medium heat until simmering. Simmer for 5 minutes. Add vegetables and cook for 5 minutes; toss with pasta.  Sprinkle with shaved cheese before serving.
