Ingredients:
1 (18 ounce) package thin boneless pork chops center cut
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup flour
1 tablespoon Archer Farms™ Extra Virgin Olive Oil
3 tablespoons Market Pantry™ Butter
1 lemon, juiced
1/4 cup white wine or chicken broth
2 teaspoons capers
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Season pork with salt and pepper.  Dredge chops in flour.
Heat butter and olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium high heat until butter is melted and foamy.  Cook chops 6 to 8 minutes, turning once, or until well browned on both sides. Remove to serving platter and cover to keep warm.
Add lemon juice, wine and remaining 2 tablespoons butter to pan.  Cook 2 minutes, scraping up browned bits.  Stir in remaining ingredients and pour over chops.

Description: 
A restaurant classic, 'piccata' sauce is made with capers and lemon juice for a sprightly contrast to mild pork chops; juices from the pan add depth of flavor. The same sauce also works well for flattened boneless chicken breasts.
