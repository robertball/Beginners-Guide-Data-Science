Description: 
This recipe was on the site from a recipe that had been handed down through generations of German families in northern Idaho.  I replaced part of the sugar with splenda, and used pure canola oil to eliminate the soy in regular vegetable oil. It was delicious, and gobbled up by the whole family.Modified from: German Coleslaw
