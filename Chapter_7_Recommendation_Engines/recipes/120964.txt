Description: 
The fresh flavor and crunchy texture of garden vegetables star in this tart colorful coleslaw. Lightly dressed with vinegar and oil, it's a refreshing summer salad. My mom fixed it often when I was growing up...and it continues to be requested often.                                                                  -- Pat Cole                                                              Polebridge, Montana
