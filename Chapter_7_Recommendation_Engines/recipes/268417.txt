Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 bulb fresh fennel, white part only, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 medium onion, cut into 8 wedges
4 cloves garlic, lightly crushed
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 cups chicken broth
1/4 cup all-natural marmalade (such as SmuckersÂ® Natural)
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine butternut squash, fennel, onion, and garlic on the baking sheet. Drizzle with oil and salt and toss until well combined.
Roast vegetables in the preheated oven until soft and lightly browned, 35 to 40 minutes.
Puree 1/2 of the vegetable mixture in a blender with 1/2 of the broth until smooth. Pour mixture into a large saucepan set over low heat. Puree the rest of the vegetables and broth; add to the saucepan.
Stir in marmalade and pumpkin and heat through over low heat. Stir in cream before serving. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Roasted butternut squash, fresh fennel, onions, and garlic are blended with spices, marmalade, and cream for a deliciously decadent soup that's the perfect starter for your holiday feast! My favorite way to garnish the soup is to whip up additional heavy cream until soft peaks form, then top each bowl with a small dollop. I then lightly drizzle each dollop with extra marmalade that's been melted in the microwave for 10 to 20 seconds.
