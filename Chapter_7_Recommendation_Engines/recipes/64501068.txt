Directions:
Chicken and Biscuits Casserole How about this on a cold winter's day?
Ingredients:
1 small onion
1 1/2 teaspoons butter
2 lbs chopped cooked chicken breasts or 2 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs
1 (10 3/4 ounce) can cream of chicken soup
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 cup milk
1/2 cup chopped pimiento or 1/2 cup sauteed red bell peppers or 1/2 cup jarred roasted red pepper
1 1/2 cups shredded mild cheddar cheese
refrigerated biscuits
Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Grease the bottom and sides of an 11x7 inch baking dish or 10 inch quiche dish.
Chop the onion.
Heat butter in a small nonstick skillet and saute until tender.
Combine cooked onion, soup, chicken, milk, pimiento, and mayo in a bowl and then turn into the prepared baking dish.
Bake for 15 minutes and remove from oven.
Sprinkle 1 cup of the cheese over the baked mixture.
Arrange biscuits decoratively in a single layer and sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup cheese over them.
Return casserole to oven and bake until biscuits are golden brown and sauce is bubbly, usually about 20 minutes longer.
This is RICH! You may sub sour cream for all or part of the mayo if you wish to cut back on the heaviness. I subbed fat free greek yogurt. Also -- I took the suggestion of adding a cup of cooked green peas. You could also add green beans. What a terrific idea!
