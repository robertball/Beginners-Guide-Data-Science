Ingredients:
4 chicken quarters
1/2 tbsp kosher salt
1/2 tbsp aluminum free baking powder
2 tsp smoked paprika
2 tsp black pepper
2 tsp garlic powder

Directions:
Mix all dry ingredients together and  coat on all sides of chicken.
Place in a greased cast-iron skillet and put in a preheated 275 degree oven.
Cook for 2 1/2 hours.
The skin will be crispy on top and the chicken will be juicy due to the fat that rendered out.  It will be very tender!  We ate this with some cauliflower mash and cooked broccoli.
