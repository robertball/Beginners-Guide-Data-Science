Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup light brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
7 egg whites, divided
3/4 cup chocolate chips, or more to taste
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped dried figs
1 pinch ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Combine flour and baking powder in a bowl.
Combine butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a separate bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in 6 egg whites, one at a time. Stir in chocolate chips and vanilla extract. Stir in the flour mixture with a wooden spoon until smooth. Stir in figs with the wooden spoon.
Divide the dough in two. Shape each half into a loaf about 12 inches long and 2 inches wide. Place the loaves 4 inches apart on the baking sheet; flatten tops slightly with your hand. Beat remaining egg white until foamy and brush over the tops. Lightly sprinkle cinnamon on the loaves after brushing on the egg white.
Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool, about 30 minutes.
Lower oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Cut the baked loaves into 1/2-inch-thick diagonal slices using a serrated knife. Lay slices cut-side down on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
This recipe is my own. The combination of figs and chocolate together is great. Before baking, very lightly sprinkle cinnamon on top of the loaves after applying egg wash. You won't be disappointed. Store in a sealed container.
