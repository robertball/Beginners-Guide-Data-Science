Ingredients:
1.25 pounds chicken meat - 1-inch cubes
2 (12oz) packages frozen french-cut green beans - thawed
1 red onion - halved and sliced
4 roma tomatoes - cut into eighths
2 chilies - seeded and diced - serranos, anaheims, or jalapenos work well
3 cloves garlic - minced
3 tsp cumin
1 cup chopped cilantro
6 tbsp soy sauce
3 tbsp white wine vinegar
salt to taste
cooking oil - canola or olive

Directions:
Heat a small amount of oil in a wok over medium-high heat.  Saute garlic and diced chilies for about one minute.
Add chicken, with half the cumin, garlic and soy sauce.  Saute until chicken is just done.
Set aside chicken mixture and juices in a bowl.
In the same wok, heat a small amount of oil and saute sliced onion in remaining cumin, garlic and soy sauce until just transparent.
Add tomatoes and saute about one minute (until just starting to soften).
Add thawed green beans, chicken mixture, and vinegar.  Saute together until green beans are just tender and flavors come together.
Add chopped cilantro and toss together.
Serve over white rice and enjoy!

Description: 
I put this recipe together to try and duplicate a favorite dish from a restaurant I love.  It's delicious and can be made fairly healthy with white meat chicken and not too much oil!
