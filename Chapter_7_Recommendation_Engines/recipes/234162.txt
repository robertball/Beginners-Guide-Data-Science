Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups raspberries
2 cups chopped pears
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup oil
2 large eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Place raspberries in a separate bowl. Spoon 2 tablespoons flour mixture over raspberries and toss until coated.
Combine pears, brown sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into pear mixture until batter is just combined. Gently fold raspberries and pecans into batter. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean, about 1 1/2 hours. Cool in pan for 20 minutes before removing loaf to cool completely on a wire rack.
