Ingredients:
4 eggs
1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups panko bread crumbs
1 1/2 teaspoons dried tarragon
2 cups all-purpose flour
8 razor clams, cleaned and dried
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Beat eggs, hot pepper sauce, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Mix together the panko and tarragon in a second bowl. Place the flour in a third bowl. Dip a razor clam into the egg, then into the flour, then back into the egg, then press the clam into the panko. Gently toss between your hands so any breading that hasn't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded clams onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.
Heat butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry clams until lightly browned, about 1 minute on each side. Do not overcook or they will become tough. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This dish is a definitely a treat after a cold night's dig for these delicious clams. You'll want to serve them up hot as clams can get rubbery if you let them set for a while. They are great served with tartar sauce or with nothing at all.
