Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
6 jalapeno peppers, or to taste, seeded and chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 pound chicken tenders, cut into bite-size pieces
1/4 teaspoon chicken seasoning blend, or to taste
1/2 (10 ounce) can pina colada mix
1 cup sour cream
1/2 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle bock beer

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the jalapeno peppers and onion until tender, about 8 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the skillet; add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the hot skillet. Sprinkle the chicken tenders with chicken seasoning, and cook and stir in the olive oil until slightly golden brown and no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a bowl.
Return the jalapeno peppers and onions to the skillet, and stir in the pina colada mix and sour cream. Bring the mixture just to a simmer, reduce heat, and simmer for 5 minutes; stir in the chicken, and mix in the bock beer. Simmer until the flavors have blended and the sauce has slightly thickened, 15 to 30 more minutes.
