Ingredients:
4 eggs
1 cup brown sugar blend (e.g., Splenda brown sugar blend, or 1/2 white sugar substitute and 1/2 dark brown sugar)
1 cup white sugar substitute (e.g., Stevia in the raw)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract or vanilla baking emulsion (e.g., Princess Cake & Cookie)
(optional) 1/2 teaspoon Pralines & Cream flavoring
1 cup olive oil
2 cups self-rising flour
2 cups rolled oats
2 cups semi-sweet dark chocolate chips (e.g., Hershey's Special Dark)
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Using butter or butter/margarine blend, grease a 15 x 10 baking pan.
In a large mixing bowl, blend at the lowest speed the dry ingredients. Gradually add the wet ingredients (oil, eggs, baking emulsion, flavoring) until completely mixed. Fold in chocolate chips. Spread the mixture evenly onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 18 minutes (until slightly pulled away from the side of the pan and uniformly browned on the top). Remove from oven, and let cool for 3 minutes before cutting into squares. Then cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Store in an air-tight container.
