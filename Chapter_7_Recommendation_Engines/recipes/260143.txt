Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa
2 cups water
1 dash hot sauce, or to taste
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (8 ounce) package tempeh, cubed
1 tomato, chopped
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon white wine
1 teaspoon lemon juice
2 leaves Swiss chard, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 pinch garlic powder

Directions:
Place quinoa in a pot; add water and hot sauce. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Heat sesame oil, olive oil, and minced garlic in a saucepan over medium heat. Add tempeh, tomato, and mustard; cook and stir until tempeh is coated in mustard, about 1 minute. Stir in wine and lemon juice; simmer for 5 minutes. Add chard; cook until wilted, about 1 minute. Sprinkle with garlic powder. Add cannellini beans; reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
Pour tempeh mixture into the pot with the quinoa; mix well.
