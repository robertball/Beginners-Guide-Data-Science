Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup grapeseed oil
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 (2 pound) salmon fillet, cut into 3-inch pieces

Directions:
Stir salt, paprika, cardamom, coriander, and black pepper together in a bowl. Add oil and maple syrup and stir until evenly combined.
Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat, about 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Dredge salmon pieces through the maple syrup mixture until evenly coated on all sides.
Cook salmon in the preheated pan until fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes per side.

Description: 
I am a salmon lover. This is a great recipe for a slightly exotic flavor of Indian inspiration with a maple twist. The flavor is exceptional, delicious, and unique.

 Orange zest may be added for an extra flavor twist.
