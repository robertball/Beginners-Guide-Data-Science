Ingredients:
16 Boston Bibb or butter lettuce leaves
1 pound ground chicken
1 tablespoon cooking oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves fresh garlic, minced
1/4 cup finely chopped red bell pepper
1 tablespoon low sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup hoisin sauce
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
1 teaspoon Asian chile pepper sauce (optional)
1 bunch green onions, chopped
2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil

Directions:
Rinse whole lettuce leaves and pat dry, being careful not tear them. Set aside.
In a medium skillet over high heat, cook the ground chicken in 1 tablespoon of oil, stirring often and reducing the heat to medium, if necessary. Drain, and set aside to cool. Cook the onion and red pepper in the same pan, stirring frequently. Add the garlic, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, ginger, vinegar, and chile pepper sauce to the onion mixture, and stir. Stir in green onions, and sesame oil, and continue cooking until the onions just begin to wilt, about 2 minutes.
Arrange lettuce leaves around the outer edge of a large serving platter, and pile meat mixture in the center. To serve, allow each person to spoon a portion of the meat into a lettuce leaf. Wrap the lettuce around the meat like a burrito, and enjoy!

Description: 
Ground chicken seasoned with soy and hoisin sauces, garlic, ginger, and green onions is gently folded into fresh lettuce leaves to be eaten burrito style.  I used fresh ginger instead of pickled, and subbed 1/4 cup chopped red pepper for the water chestnuts.Modified from: Asian Lettuce Wraps
