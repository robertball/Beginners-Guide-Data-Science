Directions:
Scald milk in microwave x 3 minutes on high or in a saucepan on stove.
Add sugar, salt and butter.
Cool to lukewarm.
Dissolve yeast in warm water.

Stir in egg and flour, just enough to have a soft dough.
Let rise 2 1/2 hours.
Divide into 3 parts.
Roll on lightly floured surface into a circle.
Spread with soft butter, a thin layer of brown sugar and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
Cut into 8 wedges/circle, using a pizza cutter.

Let rise for 45 minutes.
Bake at 350 x 15 - 20 minutes.
Cool.
Frost when cool if you'd like, mixing frosting ingredients together until smooth.

Description: 
This delicious bun recipe was shared by a lovely American lady who brought these to a potluck. They can be frosted to increase the yum factor! They can also be made without the sugar & cinnamon for a dinner bun.
