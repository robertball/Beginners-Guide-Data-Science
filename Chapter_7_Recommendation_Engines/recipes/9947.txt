Ingredients:
6 eggs
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup margarine, melted and cooled
2 tablespoons anise extract
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder

Directions:
Beat eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until fluffy. Stir in the melted margarine and anise extract. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir in gradually. Dough will be sticky.
Preheat your pizzelle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions. Drop batter by rounded spoonfuls onto the iron. Close and cook for about 90 seconds, or until steam stops coming out of the iron. Carefully remove and cool. Store in an airtight tin at room temperature.
