Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package bulk hot pork sausage (such as Jimmy Dean®)
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)
1 cup chopped fresh chives
1/4 cup chopped onion

Directions:
Stir the sausage and onions together in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, about 8 minutes. Drain the grease off of the sausage in a mesh strainer, then return to the skillet. Stir in the cream cheese and diced tomatoes until the cheese has melted and the mixture begins to bubble. Stir in chives before serving.
