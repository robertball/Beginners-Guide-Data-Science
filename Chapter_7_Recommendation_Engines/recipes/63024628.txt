Ingredients:
4 pounds whole corned beef brisket
5 bay leaves
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon prepared mustard
¼ cup brown sugar
Whole cloves
1 can spiced peaches

Directions:
Cover corned beef brisket with water in a large pot. Add the bay leaves and onion. Cook over medium heat about 3 hours, until the meat is very tender.
While the meat is cooking, mix the brown sugar and mustard. Preheat oven to 325.
Take meat from water and remove all visible fat. Insert cloves, as if it were a ham. Cover meat with the mustard/sugar mixture and bake one hour, basting frequently with peach syrup.
Surround meat with spiced peaches and serve.
