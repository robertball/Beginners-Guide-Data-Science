Ingredients:
4 bone-in chicken breast halves, with skin
1/3 cup red pepper jelly
1/3 cup Dijon mustard
1/3 cup honey

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees F).
Arrange chicken breasts in a baking dish so they are not crowded. In a cup or small bowl, mix together the pepper jelly, mustard and honey; pour over chicken to coat.
Bake uncovered for about 1 hour, basting occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink, and the juices run clear.
