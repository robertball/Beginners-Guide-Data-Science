Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle caffeinated citrus-flavored soda (such as Mountain DewÂ®)
4 small Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored, and quartered
2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent roll dough

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Heat the butter, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla in a saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; set aside. Divide the crescent roll dough into 16 triangles. Roll 1 slice of apple with the dough and arrange on the prepared pan. Pour the butter mixture over the wrapped apples, then pour the citrus-flavored soda on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.
