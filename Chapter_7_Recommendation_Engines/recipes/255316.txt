Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
2 teaspoons Thai green curry paste
2 teaspoons lime juice
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 dash hot sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or more to taste
1 pinch ground cumin
1 1/2 cups cubed cooked chicken
1 (10 ounce) can mushroom stems and pieces, undrained
1 green onion, chopped, divided

Directions:
Warm coconut milk in a saucepan over medium heat, about 5 minutes. Whisk in green curry paste, lime juice, salt, pepper, hot sauce, and cumin. Stir in chicken, mushrooms, and white part of the green onion. Simmer soup until flavors combine, 5 to 10 minutes.
Ladle soup into bowls and garnish with remaining green onion.

Description: 
Creamy soup with mild spice and a zip of citrus. It is inspired by Tom Kha Gai from Laotian and Thai cuisines, but it comes together quickly from ingredients that are easily and routinely available--real Tom Kha needs fresh lemon grass, kaffir lime leaves, and galangal root, which are not always available in my locale.
