Ingredients:
Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla
1 cup flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 ½ cups coconut
1 cup chocolate chips (mini or regular)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
In a bowl combine melted butter, brown sugar, and white sugar. Using a wooden spoon stir well to combine. Do not use a mixer for this recipe. It turns out better stirred by hand.
Add remaining ingredients, except chocolate chips and still until ingredients are well combined.
Stir in chocolate chips.
Spread batter into a greased 9×13 pan.
Bake for 25-30 minutes.
Cool and cut into bars.
