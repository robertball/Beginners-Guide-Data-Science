3 lb ricotta cheese, drained
6 to 8 eggs, beaten
salt
pepper
parsley

1 stick pepperoni, finely diced (optional)
2 pie crusts

Directions:
Make two pie crusts using any recipe or boxed crust to line the bottom of two large pie pans. Set aside.
Optional step is to cook pepperoni and ham to remove some of the salt and fat. Let cool.
Drain off any excess liquid from the ricotta cheese.
In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, romano cheese, eggs, salt, pepper and parsley to taste.
Add the meat.
Pour into pie pans.
Bake at 350 F for 35-40 minutes.
