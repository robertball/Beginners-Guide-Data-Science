Ingredients:
44 HERSHEY速'S HUGS速 Chocolates
1/2 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
1 tablespoon cold water
2 tablespoons boiling water
1 cup heavy cream, chilled

Directions:
Remove wrappers from chocolate pieces; place 36 pieces in medium microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave at high (100%) 1 minute; stir.  If necessary, microwave at high an additional 15 seconds at a time, stirring after each heating, just until melted and smooth when stirred.  Cool.
Sprinkle gelatin over cold water in small bowl; let stand 1 minute to soften.  Add boiling water; stir until gelatin is completely dissolved and mixture is clear.  Cool slightly.
Gradually beat whipping cream into melted chocolate on low speed of mixer until well blended.  Beat on medium speed, scraping bottom of bowl occasionally, until doubled in volume and thickened.  Gradually pour in gelatin; beating until well blended.  Spoon into serving dishes.  Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.  Garnish with remaining chocolate pieces.
