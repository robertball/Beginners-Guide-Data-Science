Description: 
With simple stuff... comes moist, down home and wholesome meal, snack, or a fun side dish. I serve this up next to pulled pork sandwiches or as the main event longside mac and cheese. Can't think of anything more Americana then beans and weinees... unless it's a chili corndog! Top with shredded Cheddar cheese, it'll make you want to slap your mama.
