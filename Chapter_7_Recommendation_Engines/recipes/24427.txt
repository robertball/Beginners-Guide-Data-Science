In the microwave oven or over a double boiler, melt chocolate chips, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and stir in the bourbon and corn syrup.
In a medium bowl, toss together the crushed vanilla wafers and ground walnuts. Pour the chocolate mixture over the crumbs in the bowl and blend well using your hands. Shape into 1 inch balls and press a cherry half into the center of each one. Roll each cookie in confectioners' sugar to coat.
