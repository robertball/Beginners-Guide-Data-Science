Ingredients:
2 (4 ounce) patties ground beef
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper
For the Gravy:
1 1/2 cups beef stock
4 teaspoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 drops sesame oil, or to taste
2 teaspoons ketchup
2 teaspoons white sugar (optional)
4 teaspoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons unsalted butter, divided
2 tablespoons minced green onions, white and light green parts only
2 eggs
2 cups hot cooked white rice

Directions:
Season patties with salt, pepper, and cayenne.
Whisk beef stock, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, sesame oil, ketchup, sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patty in the hot skillet until a browned crust forms on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip; toss in green onions and cook the other side until both beef and onions are browned, 4 to 5 minutes more. Remove patty and most of the green onions to a plate.
Pour beef stock mixture into the skillet. Stir, scraping up browned bits from the bottom, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and reserve gravy until needed.
Melt remaining butter in another skillet over medium heat. Add eggs to the skillet and fry side-by-side until whites are set and yolks are still runny.
Divide rice between 2 serving bowls. Place patties over the rice, spoon gravy on top, and add the fried eggs.

Description: 
This amazing Hawaiian comfort food classic is made by topping rice with a fried burger, which is then smothered with a rich, brown gravy and finished with a fried egg. Seriously, how did it take until 1949 for someone to think of this combination? We all get hangry sometimes, so whether you're a broke student or an older professional who just wishes you were, this cheap, filling bowl of goodness is the perfect solution. Garnish with green onions.
