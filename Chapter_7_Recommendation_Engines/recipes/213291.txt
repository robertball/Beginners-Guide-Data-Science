Ingredients:
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's® Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup (Regular or 98% Fat Free)

1 tablespoon butter
1 medium onion, chopped
1 teaspoon chili powder
2 cups chopped cooked chicken or turkey
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chiles
8 (8 inch) flour tortillas, warmed
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese or Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Stir the soup and sour cream in a small bowl.
Heat the butter in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and chili powder and cook until the onion is tender. Stir in the chicken, chiles and 2 tablespoons soup mixture.
Spread 1/2 cup soup mixture in a 2-quart shallow baking dish. Spoon about 1/4 cup chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Roll up and place seam-side down into the baking dish. Spoon the remaining soup mixture over the tortillas. Sprinkle with the cheese.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until the enchiladas are hot and bubbling.
