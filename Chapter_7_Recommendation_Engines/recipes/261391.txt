Ingredients:
Crunch:
1 tablespoon canola oil, or as needed
5 tablespoons sesame seeds, or to taste
2 (6 ounce) packages dried chow mein noodles
1/4 cup chopped almonds, or to taste (optional)
1 1/2 tablespoons honey, or to taste (optional)
Sauce:
1 cup olive oil
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
Salad:
1 large head bok choy, cut into 1-inch pieces

Directions:
Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sesame seeds. Heat for 30 seconds; start stirring with a spatula and add chow mein noodles and almonds. Cook, stirring constantly, until seeds are dark brown, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Add honey; stir until crunch mixture sticks together. Pour into a bowl; cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until cool, about 10 minutes.
Mix olive oil, sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce together in another bowl. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate dressing until cool.
Place bok choy into a salad bowl.
Place crunch mixture on a flat work surface. Break into smaller pieces using a meat tenderizer. Add to the bok choy; mix into the salad. Serve dressing on the side.
Mix dressing well; serve alongside the salad.

Description: 
This is a quick bok choy salad recipe I got from my mother. I made a few modifications to the dressing to fit my own taste, but it's been a hit with my husband, and our child and frequently asked for when they see bok choy in the store. This can be served as either an appetizer or a salad for any meal. Add green onions, if desired.
