Crunchy Chicken strips and Basil Dipping Sauce Recipe

Ingredients:
Chicken Strips:
* Eggs - 2
* Salt and Pepper
* Cornflakes - 3 1/2 ounces (100 g) - crushed to resemble chunky breadcrumbs, OR...just use breadcrumbs, OR...a mixture of breadcrumbs and Cornflakes
* Parmesan, freshly grated  1 Tablespoon
* Boneless Chicken Breasts - 4 - cut into strips
* Oil for frying
--------
Basil dipping sauce:
* Egg - 1 hardboiled and cooled
* Fresh Basil - 1 to 1 1/2 ounces (30 to 40 g)
* Grain Mustard already prepared from a jar - 1 Tablespoon
* Parmesan, freshly grated  1 Tablespoon
* Salt and pepper
* Extra Virgin Olive Oil - at least 5 Tablespoons, maybe up to 8

Directions:
Chicken Strips:
In a bowl, lightly beat the eggs with some salt and pepper.
In another bowl, mix the crushed cornflakes and the grated Parmesan.
Dip the chicken strips into the egg and then roll them in the Cornflake-Parmesan mix, covering well.
Heat the oil in a skillet and cook the chicken strips on both sides.
Basil dipping sauce:
In a blender combine the hardboiled egg, basil, mustard and Parmesan, and 2 tablespoons of the oil.
With the blender running, slowly add the rest of the oil until you have a beautifully green and creamy sauce. The amount of oil you add here will depend on the quality and quantities of the other ingredients, as eggs, for example, are not necessarily all the same size, and some Basil is drier than others. This can be served as a dipping sauce, or can be spooned over the chicken on the plate.
Season with salt and pepper.

So easy, my record for this is ten minutes from opening the fridge to on the table.
Good for parties, sports games, starters, even a main when served with a salad or vegetables too.
