1 cup rolled oats
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)

2/3 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup honey

2 eggs
2 tablespoons brown sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Whisk flour, oats, baking soda, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Mix sweet potatoes, oil, honey, carrots, eggs, and brown sugar together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until batter is just combined. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
Not super sweet, but just sweet enough, and you can barely discern the oats. Excellent as a side dish. Enjoy!
