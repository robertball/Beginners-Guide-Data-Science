Ingredients:
2 - 9 inch pie shells
1 cup dark brown sugar
16 oz Dark Agave Nectar
2 TBS Black Strap Molasses
1 stick salted butter
9 eggs beaten
1 cup Jack Daniels or other Bourbon
1 TBS vanilla
Semisweet chocolate chips - cover bottom of pie crust
Chopped Pecans - to cover chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 325 degrees
In saucepan combine Agave Nectar, Molasses, brown sugar and butter.  On low allow to melt all ingredients together.  Allow to cool.
In a large bowl, combine eggs, Bourbon, vanilla.  Mix well.
Slowly temper the egg mix with the warm sugar mix.  Stirring constantly until it is completely combined.
In the bottom of the pie shell put in the chips and pecans to you have covered the bottom of the shell.  Then add a few more pecans and chips, this is really individual, I like chocolate so I probably overdue it.  Pour liquid mixture into pie shell and cover the chocolate and pecans.
Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 55 minutes, or until set and golden. May be served warm or chilled.  I think it is best a day later.  Makes 2 pies

Description: 
Agave nectar is the juice of the Agave plant.  It is more Fructose than glucose and so it is lower on the glycemic index.  It also is sweet without having any odd flavor to it.  I decided to make my pecan pie with it to see how it worked... it worked great.
