Ingredients:
22 Keebler’s Sandies Simply Shortbread cookies
1 large egg
1 cup unsweetened frozen raspberries filling
Filling
1 can (8 oz) or 1 roll (7 oz) almond paste
1/3 cup sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup heavy (whipping) cream
2 large eggs
Garnish: confectioners’ sugar

Directions:
Serve with: sweetened whipped cream, flavored with raspberry extract, if desired
Directions
Heat oven to 350°F. Generously coat a 9-in. fluted tart pan with removable sides with nonstick spray.
Process cookies in food processor until fine crumbs form. Add egg; pulse until blended. Press evenly over bottom and up sides of tart pan. Spread frozen raspberries in crust. Freeze 10 minutes, or until crust is firm.
Meanwhile, make Filling: Break almond paste in pieces into food processor. Add sugar and flour; process until blended and no lumps remain. Add cream and eggs; process until smooth. Pour over raspberries to cover.
Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until Filling puffs around the edges and is firm to the touch. Cool in pan on a wire rack, then refrigerate at least 2 hours, or cover and refrigerate up to 3 days.
Up to 1 hour before serving: Put tart pan on a small, sturdy bowl and let sides fall down. Gently slide tart off pan bottom onto a serving plate. Dust with confectioners’ sugar; serve with whipped cream.
Planning Tip: Can be prepared through Step 4 up to 3 days ahead.
