Description: 
I have discovered a few years back how Texas Roadhouse does their butter-This is THEE closest thing to the real deal!! Easy, simple and very yummie.  By far our most favorite restaurant that we wanted to bring home and here it is!!  Great on sweet dinner rolls, pancakes, waffles-just about anything-even corn on the cob!!
