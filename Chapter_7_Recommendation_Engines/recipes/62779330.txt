Ingredients:
1 package ready to bake biscuits
2 cups broccoli florets (blanched + chopped)
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray. Using one biscuit at a time, place a biscuit into the muffin cup and then press down to “dig a hole” in the middle. Plant your broccoli by dividing it evenly among all the biscuit cups. Sprinkle cheddar atop each biscuit and  bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the biscuits are turning golden brown. Serve warm.
