Ingredients:
1 cup water
2 tablespoons chocolate syrup
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 tablespoon canola oil
1/3 cup oat flour
2 2/3 cups bread flour
3 tablespoons dry milk powder
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1/4 cup dried apricots

Directions:
Place all  ingredients (except apricots) in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start.
At the end of dough cycle,  turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, cover and let rest 10 minutes. Roll dough out into a rectangle, sprinkle apricots on top, and roll up into a loaf shape. Place into a  greased 9x5 inch loaf pan, cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Slash the risen loaf down the center with a sharp knife.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from pan and place loaf on a wire rack to completely cool.
