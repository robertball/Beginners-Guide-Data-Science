Ingredients:
25 medium fresh jalapeno peppers
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3 cups finely shredded Cheddar cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
4 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled

Directions:
Cut jalapenos in half lengthwise; remove seeds and membranes. In a large saucepan, boil peppers in water for 5-10 minutes (the longer you boil the peppers, the milder they become). Drain and rinse in cold water; set aside.
In a small mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, cheddar cheese and Worcestershire sauce. Spoon 2 teaspoonfuls into each jalapeno half; sprinkle with bacon. Place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 5-10 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve warm.

Description: 
A few years ago, I saw a man in the grocery store buying a big bag full of jalapeno peppers. I asked him what he intended to do with them, and he shared this recipe with me right there in the store!
