Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
3 cups pomegranate juice
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 1/4 pounds leg of lamb
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
Mix pomegranate juice, mustard, and garlic together in a large bowl. Submerge lamb in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 2 days.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove lamb from the marinade and place in a roasting pan.
Bake lamb in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C), about 1 hour 15 minutes.
In the meantime, transfer the marinade to a saucepan and bring to a boil. Whisk in cornstarch to thicken. Let simmer to desired thickness over the lowest heat setting while lamb bakes.
Let lamb rest briefly before slicing. Serve with sauce on the side.

Description: 
The pomegranate and Dijon marinade in this dish serves double duty. Not only does it flavor the leg of lamb inside out, but it's then cooked down into a thick, rich sauce for drizzling over the sliced roasted lamb.
