Ingredients:
1 roll (16.5 oz) of Pillsbury Brownie batter
1 (8-ounce) tub of Pineapple Cream Cheese
1 tablespoon white sugar
6 Maraschino cherries (remove stems from 5 cherries and chop, save 1 cherry with stem for garnish)
1 Tablespoons of Maraschino Cherry juice
2 bananas, sliced and tossed in lemon juice to prevent browning
1 cup fresh strawberries, sliced
Hot Fudge sauce for drizzling (recommended: Smuckers)
Chopped nuts (optional)

Directions:
Grease the bottom of a 9 or 10-inch spring form pan.
Spread brownie batter in bottom of pan.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until done.
Remove from the oven and cool 10 minutes, then remove from spring form pan and cool completely.
Beat the cream cheese, chopped cherries, sugar, and cherry juice together in a bowl. More juice may be used, if needed, to soften the mixture to a good spreading consistency.
Spread the mixture over the cooled brownie crust.
Arrange the banana and strawberry slices over the cream cheese mixture, leaving a space in the middle for the reserved cherry.
Drizzle with Hot Fudge sauce and nuts (optional). Refrigerate until ready to serve.
