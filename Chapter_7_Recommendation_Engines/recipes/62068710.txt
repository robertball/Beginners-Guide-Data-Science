Ingredients:
1 premade pre-cooked pizza crust
1 boneless skinless chicken breast
6 strips of bacon
2 specialty sausages (try turkey w/ artichoke or pesto)
1 cup fresh sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup good caesar salad dressing
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
olive oil
salt and pepper

Directions:
Heat oven to 450 F.
Cut chicken breast into 1" chunks.  Saute in olive oil over medium heat until cooked through and season with salt and pepper.  Meanwhile, cook bacon until crisp and set aside to drain.  Cut sausages in 1" slices and saute them until browned (they are already precooked).
Spread caesar dressing over the pizza crust.  Top with chicken, sausage, crumbled bacon, mushrooms, and cheese.
Bake for 10 minutes.
Cut into wedges, serve, and enjoy! Add parmesan and red pepper flakes if desired. Great with a side salad.

Description: 
This pizza is so easy but very impressive and a nice change from everyday pizza. Chicken, bacon, sausage, and mushrooms go perfectly with caesar dressing instead of pizza sauce.  You can use pre-cooked chicken and bacon to save even more time.  My family and friends love it and I know you will too!
