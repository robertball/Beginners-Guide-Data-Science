Ingredients:
SALAD
1 (approximately 6 ounce) bag spinach salad
2 red onions, thinly sliced
4 blood oranges
1 (8 ounce) jar Kalamata olives, drained, liquid discarded
1 hallock grape or cherry tomatoes
4 ounces bleu cheese crumble
46 ounces salted macadamia nuts
DRESSING
1/2 cup olive oil or oil of choice
juice of one large navel orange (about 2/3 cup)
1/4 cup white granulated sugar
67 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (to taste)
2 teaspoons Dijon or other prepared mustard
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4--1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (to taste)

Directions:
To make the onions a bit milder, fill a medium (2 qt) covered bowl half full of ice, add the onion slices and top with more ice and add cold water until you’re just able to get the lid on.  Refrigerate for three hours.
Put the dressing ingredients in the empty Kalamata jar or another container with a tight lid; shake well and refrigerate until ready to serve.
Be careful with the fruit and juice as it will stain like beet juice.  Cut a slice off the top and bottom of each of the oranges, and slice downward to remove all the skin and white pith.
Cut oranges into about 1/4” horizontal slices; remove seeds; retain any juice and add to the juice of the navel orange.  Put slices in a covered bowl or plastic bag with the olives and refrigerate for three hours along with the onions.
When ready to serve, let dressing come barely to room temperature.  (Refrigerating it makes it a little bit thicker.)
Assemble salad ingredients except for nuts and cheese; toss with dressing and add nuts and cheese.

Description: 
Blood oranges are only in season for a few brief times a year, but they are so delicious and unusual that I wanted to create a recipe worthy of them.  This colorful salad always gets rave reviews, and I always get asked for the recipe.  My husband says it is the best salad he's ever had!
