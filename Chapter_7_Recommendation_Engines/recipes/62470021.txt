Ingredients:
14 ounce can sweetened condensed milk
3.4 ounce package dry pudding mix (pistachio)
1 1/2 cups milk

Directions:
Whisk the ingredients together in medium sized bowl.  Transfer to ice cream freezer and process as directed.

Submitter: 
Sweet Apron
Description: 
This is a simple way to make ice cream with three ingredients.  Pistachio is my favorite flavor, but any pudding flavor will do.  I used skim milk with great results but am certain that fuller fat milk would result in an even creamier product.
