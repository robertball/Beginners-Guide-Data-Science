Ingredients:
1.3 lb ground beef (85% lean / 15% fat)
1 large yellow onion, diced
1 cup of crushed Cheez-Its (1-1/2 cups whole Cheez-Its)
2 tablespoons butter
1 egg
1 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon of garlic
1/4 teaspoon of Kosher salt
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons mustard powder
1/3 cup ketchup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Place whole Cheeze-Its in a plastic zip-lock bag. Crush with a rolling pin until they are a fine consistency. Set aside 1 cup of crushed Cheez-Its and discard the rest.
Melt butter in a saute pan over medium-low heat.
Saute onions in butter for 10 minutes or until soft.
In a large bowl mix ground beef, crushed Cheez-Its, egg, milk, garlic, and salt. Place mixture into a lightly greased 5x9 inch loaf pan.
In a separate bowl, combine brown sugar, mustard powder, and ketchup. Pour over top meatloaf and spread evenly.
Bake for 1 hour.
Without removing the meatloaf, carefully drain grease from loaf pan. Allow meatloaf to stand for 5 minutes before serving.
