Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
3/4 cup sugar
4 eggs
5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 (.25 ounce) packages quick-rise yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cardamom
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup diced dried fruit
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup golden raisins
FROSTING:
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
2 tablespoons shortening
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add 4 cups flour, yeast, cardamom, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Heat milk to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F; add to creamed mixture and beat until moistened. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a firm dough. Turn onto a heavily floured surface. Sprinkle with fruit and raisins; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 40 minutes.
Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divided into eight portions. Shape into loaves. Place in eight greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
For frosting, in a small mixing bowl, cream butter and shortening. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar, vanilla and enough milk to achieve spreading consistency. Frost loaves.
