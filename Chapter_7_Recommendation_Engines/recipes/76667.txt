2 cups iceberg lettuce, chopped fine
1 cup watercress, coarse stems discarded, chopped fine
3 ripe avocados (preferably California)
3 cups cooked chicken breasts, diced fine (a rotisserie chicken from the grocery is a real time saver)

1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
Salt and pepper to taste

Dressing Directions: Whisk together vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper to taste.
