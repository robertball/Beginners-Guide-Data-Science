Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups sourdough starter
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Mix starter, flour, olive oil, and salt together in a bowl until mixture forms a ball. Let dough rest for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
Roll out dough on parchment paper or a lightly floured work surface, rotating frequently, until it is the same size as the baking pan. Transfer to the pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until pale golden, about 7 minutes.
