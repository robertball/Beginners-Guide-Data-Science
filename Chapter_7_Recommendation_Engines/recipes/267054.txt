Ingredients:
1 medium butternut squash
2 tablespoons butter, or more as needed
1 tablespoon coconut oil
1/2 onion, chopped
2 roasted red peppers, drained and sliced
2 tablespoons red curry paste
1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk (such as Thai KitchenÂ®)
1/2 cup skim milk

Directions:
Peel butternut squash. Cut in half lengthwise and scoop out seeds. Cut flesh into cubes.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter and coconut oil in a soup pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add squash, red peppers, red curry paste, ginger, and garlic. Mix thoroughly and cook for 5 to 7 minutes. Add extra butter if the pot dries out, to avoid burning onion or squash.
Pour coconut milk and skim milk into the pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer soup, stirring often, until squash is soft, about 25 minutes.
Pour 1/3 of the soup into a blender. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Pour into a large bowl. Repeat twice more.

Description: 
This curried squash soup has such an amazing balance of flavors and has officially become my favorite soup. Perfect for a chilly fall day! The fall weather always serves as inspiration for soup, especially butternut squash soups. I really wanted to put a spin on the typical squash soup this time, though. Optional garnishes include sliced scallions, toasted squash seeds, or shrimp. I highly suggest the toasted squash seeds as a garnish. They really add a lot!
