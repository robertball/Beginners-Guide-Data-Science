Ingredients:
Reynolds Wrap® Release® Non-Stick Aluminum Foil
1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti, cooked
2 tablespoons butter OR margarine
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1 (24 ounce) carton ricotta cheese OR cottage cheese
1 pound ground beef or spicy italian sausage

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Line a 13x9x2-inch baking pan with Reynolds Wrap&#174; Release&#174; Non-Stick Aluminum Foil with non-stick side toward food.
Combine hot cooked spaghetti with butter; stir until butter melts and coats spaghetti.  Add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese; stir to coat.  Arrange spaghetti in an even layer in foil-lined pan.  Spread ricotta cheese over spaghetti.  Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  Brown ground beef, drain; add pasta sauce and heat until bubbly.  Spoon over cheeses.  Top with mozzarella cheese and remaining Parmesan cheese.
Cover with non-stick foil.  Bake 30 minutes.  Remove foil cover and continue baking 15 minutes or until cheese is lightly browned.  Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
