Ingredients:
8 tomatoes, peeled and coarsely chopped
1/2 onion, chopped
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chilies
1/4 cup white vinegar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
salt to taste
hot pepper sauce to taste

Directions:
Combine the tomatoes, onion, green chiles, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, coriander, salt, and hot sauce in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-low heat. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the salsa reaches your preferred consistency, about 3 hours. Store in refrigerator until using.

Description: 
When fresh tomatoes from my garden start ripening faster than I can eat them fresh, I make this salsa. I modified the recipe to match my taste for sweet salsa with just a bit of zip. I freeze peeled tomatoes so that I can have the garden-fresh taste in winter, too.
