Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pound pork, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 tablespoon dried marjoram, or to taste
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch dried basil
1 pinch dill seed
1 pinch mustard powder
2 1/2 cups water, divided
1 cup sauerkraut
3/4 cup sour cream

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in melted butter until the onion is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
Stir pork, marjoram, paprika, salt, basil, dill, and mustard powder into the onion mixture; cook and stir until pork is only slightly pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour about half the water over the pork mixture. Add sauerkraut and sour cream; stir. Bring the mixture to a boil and add remaining water; cook at a boil until thickened, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
Traditional, wholesome, and all-around tasty. This recipe is about 400 years old. If the thickness is not to your liking, you can sift in flour until the desired thickness is reached. Serve hot over dumplings or whatever you feel like eating with, though dumplings are recommended. Ooh! I should put my dumpling recipe on here...maybe...
