Ingredients:
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon thyme, dried
1/2 teaspoon pepper, cayenne
1/2 teaspoon peppercorns, black freshly ground
1/2 pounds chicken, breast, boneless, skinless
3/4 tablespoon oil, olive, extra-virgin divided
1/2 medium onion(s) chopped
1/2 of a 15 ounce(s) can of beans, black, drained and rinsed
1/2 medium tomato(es) chopped
1/8 cup(s) cilantro, fresh minced plus whole leaves for garnish
2 whole tortilla(s), flour, whole-wheat 8-inch

Directions:
For the rub: In a small bowl, combine garlic powder, paprika, thyme, cayenne, and black pepper.
For the chicken: Lightly pound each chicken breast to an even 1/2-inch thickness. Rub a thick layer of the spice mixture onto both sides of each chicken breast.
In a large heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over high heat until hot but not smoking. Add chicken and cook until blackened on both sides and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a cutting board.
Reduce heat to medium and add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil and onion to the skillet. Cook, stirring to scrape up any brown bits clinging to the bottom of the skillet, until onion is softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add beans and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in tomato and minced cilantro.
Warm tortillas according to package directions. Cut chicken on the diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Place tortillas on 4 plates. Divide chicken and beans among tortillas. Fold tortillas into cones and top with cilantro leaves.
