Ingredients:
5 pounds red potatoes
1 large onion, chopped
2 1/2 cups creamy salad dressing, e.g. Miracle Whip â„¢
1/4 cup prepared yellow mustard
6 hard-cooked eggs, diced
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the potatoes in a large pot and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and cook until tender enough to pierce with a fork, about 15 minutes. Drain and cool slightly. Remove the peels and cut into cubes. Set aside to cool completely.
In a large bowl, mix together the onion, salad dressing and mustard. Stir in the hard-cooked eggs and cooled potatoes. Try not to mash the potatoes very much. Season with salt and pepper.
