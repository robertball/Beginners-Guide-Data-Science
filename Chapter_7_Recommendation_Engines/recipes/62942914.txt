Ingredients:
1lb Fresh Brussels Sprouts
1/2 large onion
1T minced Garlic
1T Season Salt (give recipe later)
1T Italian seasoning
1/8t Cinnamon
1/8 t Red Crush pepper
2T extra virgin Coconut oil

Directions:
Be sure to clean your brussels sprouts prior to cooking. I have a personal veggie wash that I created to wash and clean fruits and veggies. After washing and rinsing wash off veggies set them aside.
Now slice your onion thin. Add coconut oil, onion and minced garlic to pan/pot when onions become translucent add all spices.
Cook and allow to brown as soon as the spices become fragrant add Brussels sprouts.
Mix well and turn heat to medium low and let sit for 20 minutes. Then it will be done.
