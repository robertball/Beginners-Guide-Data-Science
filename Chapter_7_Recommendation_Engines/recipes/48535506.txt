Ingredients:
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon honey
2 tsp dried tarragon
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1/2 cup white wine

Directions:
In a small bowl, blend Dijon mustard and honey. Mix in the tarragon, basil, thyme, salt, and pepper.
Brush mixture on both sides of chicken breasts. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place chicken in the skillet and pour 1/4 cup wine around the chicken. Reduce heat to medium low, cover, and cook about 15 minutes, until liquid is reduced.
Pour another 1/8 cup wine around the chicken, and continue to cook, covered, about 15 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. Remove from heat and remove chicken breasts from pan, reserving remaining liquid.
Mix remaining wine into the skillet. Increase heat to medium, and scrape up browned bits. Cook and stir until liquid is reduced by about 1/3. Serve as a sauce over the chicken.
