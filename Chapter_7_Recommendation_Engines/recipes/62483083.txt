Ingredients:
1/2 tablespoon paprika
1/2 tablespoon dried parsley
2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon dry mustard powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 chicken breasts
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine the paprika, parsley, sugar, mustard, salt, and pepper in a small bowl; set aside.
Place the chicken pieces in a 8x8 inch baking dish, and coat with the vegetable oil; arrange skin-side up. Sprinkle evenly with the spice mixture.
Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.
