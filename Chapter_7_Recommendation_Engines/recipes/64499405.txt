Ingredients:
2 (15-ounce) cans garbanzo beans
3 Tbsp olive oil
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1 tablespoon roughly chopped fresh oregano
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, plus extra for garnish
1/4 cup white wine
1-1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/3 cup coarsely chopped parsley

Directions:
Drain the garbanzo beans, reserving the liquid, and set aside.
In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and cook the onion until soft. Add the oregano, crushed red pepper flakes, white wine and 1/2 cup of the reserved liquid. Stir to combine. Add the garbanzo beans.
Lower the heat to medium-low and let mixture simmer until almost all of the liquid has evaporated.
Transfer to a serving bowl. Pour the lemon juice over the top and sprinkled with parsley and crushed red pepper flakes, if desired.

Description: 
Watching your weight but don't want to give up great taste?  This salad is quick, easy and healthy! What more could you ask for in a side dish? Garbanzo beans make the perfect base for this Greek-flavored salad. I often make a double batch so my wife can take it to work for lunch the next few days (if there was any left).
