Ingredients:
3 pounds new red potatoes
1 cup mayonnaise
3/4 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons dried dill weed
4 green onions, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste (optional)

Directions:
Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then turn heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool in an ice water bath until cold, about 5 minutes. Leaving skins on, cut into bite-size pieces, and place in a large mixing bowl.
Combine mayonnaise, sour cream, dill weed, and green onions in a bowl and stir until blended. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour mayo mixture over potatoes and toss to coat evenly. Adjust seasoning if necessary. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours, or overnight.

Description: 
This is a great alternative to the familiar yellow potato salad. The dried dill weed is much more potent than fresh and alleviates some of the blandness of similar recipes.
