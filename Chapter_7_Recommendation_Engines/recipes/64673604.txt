Description: 
This is my adaptation of a recipe that I found years ago on another website. I couldn't find the paper where I had it printed. I panicked and discovered that it was nowhere online. (The original)... So, when I finally found it, I figured I should put it on here and I would never have this problem again! There is no other like this online, I promise this one is good! I serve it for Thanksgiving as a side, but is also great for dessert. Serve warm, or cold.
