Ingredients:
5 lbs. YUKON gold potatoes
8 oz. sour cream
3 oz. softened cream cheese
1/2 pound bacon, diced
1 small onion, diced
3 cups, shredded cheddar(sharp or mild)
1/4 C. butter, melted
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp. black pepper
1/2 tsp. paprika

Directions:
Cook the diced bacon until crisp and remove to a paper towel to drain.
Add the onion to the drippings and cook until soft.  REMOVE the onions with a slotted spoon to a bowl to cool.
Peel and dice the potatoes and boil until soft. Drain and ALLOW the potatoes to dry in the colander a 5 full minutes (do not skip this step).
Mash the potatoes.
Reserve 1 cup of cheese and about a 1/4 cup of the crumbled bacon.
Stir the sour cream, cream cheese, 2 C. cheddar cheese, butter, cooked onion and bacon into the mashed potatoes.
SPRAY a 9 x 13" baking dish or a small lasagna pan with PAM nonstick spray.
Spread the potatoes evenly in the pan.
Cover with foil.
Bake @ 350 for about 45 minutes until heated through.
REMOVE foil and sprinkle the remaining cheese and bacon over the casserole.
Bake, uncovered, an additional 15 minutes until the cheese is melted.
