Ingredients:
1 cup quick cooking oats
water to cover
750 ml water
2 small dates, pitted

Directions:
Soak the quick oats in enough cool water to cover them. Cover and set aside for thirty minutes.
Using a mesh colander, drain the oats. Put the oats and the two dates with the 750 ml fresh water. Allow to sit undisturbed for 10 to 15 minutes or until the skin of the date has softened.
Blend the oats, water, and dates until completely blended. Pulse the mixture a few times and them leave on medium-high speed for about a minute.
When the mixture is is smooth, drain through a nut bag or cheesecloth to remove all solids.
Serve the nut milk cold or warm. Cover and store in the refrigerator for up to one week. Shake before use.
Footnotes - This can be used for cooking or baking. However, omit the dates if preparing a savory dish.
Footnotes - If using rolled oats, the initial soaking time in step one should be overnight. Discard the water and follow the instructions as follows from step two onwards.
