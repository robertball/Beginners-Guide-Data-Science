Ingredients:
1/2 pound uncooked pasta
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup chopped onion
3 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped
2 (8 ounce) cans chopped clams, drained with juices reserved
1/4 cup fresh parsley, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
water
freshly grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in onion and garlic, and cook 5 minutes, or until onion is translucent. Add clams, stirring frequently for 3 minutes, or until clams are lightly browned. Stir in parsley, olive oil, and reserved clam juice mixed with enough water to equal 2 cups liquid.
Increase heat and bring to a low boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve over pasta with freshly grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.
