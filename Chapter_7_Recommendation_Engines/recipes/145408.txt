Description: 
Jimmy Buffett's sister, Lulu, owns a very popular restaurant in Gulf Shores, Alabama. Lulu's serves the ABSOLUTE best Pina Colada in the world there! Here is the next best thing to one of hers! If you can't find the frozen mixer, 1/2 can coconut cream and enough pineapple juice to create a simulated 'can's worth' will work.
