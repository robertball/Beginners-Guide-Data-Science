Ingredients:
3/4 c. Butter
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon beef bouillon granules
2 teaspoons onion salt
2 teaspoons pepper, divided
1/2 teaspoon white pepper, optional
2-1/4 cups milk
1 can (14-1/2 ounces) chicken broth
1 pound smoked kielbasa or Polish sausage, chopped
2 eggs
1-1/2 cups (12 ounces) small-curd cottage cheese
9 lasagna noodles, cooked and drained
1 jar (16 ounces) sauerkraut, rinsed and squeezed dry
2 cups (8 ounces) shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided

Directions:
In a saucepan, melt butter. Stir in flour, bouillon, onion salt, 1 teaspoon pepper and white pepper if desired until smooth. Gradually stir in milk and broth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Add sausage; heat through. Combine eggs, cottage cheese and remaining pepper.
Spread 1 cup sausage mixture in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Layer with three noodles, a third of the sausage mixture, half of the cottage cheese mixture and sauerkraut and 3/4 cup Monterey Jack. Repeat layers. Top with the remaining noodles and sausage mixture (dish will be full).
Cover and bake at 350Â° for 50-60 minutes or until bubbly. Sprinkle with remaining Monterey Jack. Bake 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Let stand 15 minutes before cutting.
