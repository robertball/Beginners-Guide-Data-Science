2 large onions, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced

Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Drain the tomatoes, reserving the juice. Place the tomatoes, onions and garlic into a 17x11-inch roasting pan. Pour the oil over the vegetables and toss to coat. Bake for 25 minutes.
Place the roasted vegetables into a 3-quart saucepan. Stir in the reserved tomato juice, broth, celery and barley and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 35 minutes or until the barley is tender. Stir in the parsley.
