Ingredients:
2 pounds red potatoes, cut into quarters and rubbed dry
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (250 degrees C).
If you like your potatoes crispy, after chopping them, dry them thoroughly on paper towel before adding the oil. Put the potatoes in a gallon ziploc bag, then add about 1.5 T of extra virgin olive oil. Generally speaking, the less oil you can use, the better the result. after tossing the potatoes in the bag with the oil to coat, add the herbs. Toss to coat again. Use a dark cookie sheet lined with Aluminum foil. When opening the bag, dump the potatoes on the foil lined sheet, but DON'T dump the excess oil in the bag onto the sheet. The dark sheet absorbs heat and transfers it to the aluminum foil, and the aluminum foil itself provides easy cleanup. Bake for 20 minutes initially on 450° on the middle rack Then take the pan out of the oven, and gently turn the potatoes. This will keep them from sticking to the foil later. Reduce the heat to 400° and cook for another 15 minutes. A convection oven will yield a bit crispier results, but with only a small reduction in cooking time. Don't open the oven except to turn the potatoes.
