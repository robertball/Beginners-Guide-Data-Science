Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup, divided
1 cup uncooked instant rice
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 egg
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, thoroughly mix together the ground beef, half of one can of tomato soup, instant rice, onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, egg, and green bell pepper; season with salt and black pepper. Reserve remaining tomato soup. Form the meat mixture into a loaf, and place into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bake the loaf in the preheated oven until browned and an instant-read meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, and cover the loaf with the remaining 1 1/2 cans of tomato soup. Return to oven, and bake until the soup is hot and beginning to form a glaze on the meat, about 10 minutes.
