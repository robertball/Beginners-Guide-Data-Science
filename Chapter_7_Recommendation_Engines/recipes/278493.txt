Description: 
Marjoram is oregano's oft-forgotten little sister. Not having to share the spotlight with oregano, marjoram has developed a lighter, sweeter personality than its sibling. It doesn't take everything so seriously, and in turn makes for a lighter, cleaner flavor while still imparting a wonderful herbal aroma. Mixed with a little citrus, marjoram can make your grilled fish taste great without much effort.
