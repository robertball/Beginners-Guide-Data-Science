Ingredients:
1 (3 1/2 lb) roasting chickens;
1 lemon;
olive oil;
4 medium roasting potatoes, peeled and each cut into 8 pieces;
1 large onion, cut into 6 pieces;
3 -4 garlic cloves, unpeeled;
salt and pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Wash chicken and pat dry. Remove and reserve any extra fat from inside the chicken. If there is no fat, use butter.
Very gently run your fingers between the breast and skin, loosening the skin from the breast on both sides. Don't puncture the skin.
Place the excess fat underneath the skin, chop it up to spread evenly, if necessary. This way the chicken will baste itself.
Puncture the lemon all over with a fork, and place inside the chicken.
In a bowl, toss the potatoes, onion and garlic with olive oil so each piece is coated.
Pour a little olive oil over the chicken, and season the chicken with salt and pepper.
Put the oil-coated veggies in a roasting pan and spread out. Season with salt and pepper.
If you have a rack, put the chicken on it and jiggle things to fit over the potatoes and onion. Otherwise, just put the chicken right into the pan with the veggies.
Roast for about 1 hour.
Remove the pan from the oven and let rest for about 10 minutes.
squeeze the baked lemon over the top of the chicken and veggies.
Carve chicken into serving pieces, surround with the potatoes, onion and garlic.

This is a family favourite recipes, it is so quick and easy! The pan juices are fabulous so no gravy needed. My children are always asking me to make it.
