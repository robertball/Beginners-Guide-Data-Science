Ingredients:
Lemon Loaf:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons butter, softened
3 eggs, at room temperature
1/3 cup lemon juice
2 teaspoons lemon zest
1 teaspoon lemon extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup vegetable oil
Icing:
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon powdered sugar
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Whisk flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl. Cream sugar and butter in a separate bowl with an electric mixer. Add eggs, lemon juice, lemon zest, lemon extract, and vanilla; beat until incorporated.
Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture; whisk until smooth. Add oil and mix well. Pour into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
While the cake is cooling, mix powdered sugar, milk, lemon zest, and lemon extract in a bowl until smooth. Pour over the cooled loaf. Slice up the loaf when the icing sets.
