Description: 
Every now and then when you find yourself with a few over ripe bananas, you can make this lightened and higher fiber Banana Cake. I used half Splenda and half sugar but you could use all sugar instead. I also cut the amount of frosting in half and switched to lighter ingredients and added a couple pinches of cinnamon. If you are going to mash the bananas and wait more than a few minutes to add it into the batter, you will want to stir in 2 teaspoons of lemon juice to prevent browning.
