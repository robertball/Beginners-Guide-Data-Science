Ingredients:
2 teaspoons canola or olive oil
3 cups sliced portobello mushrooms (about 2 large portobellos, stems and black gills removed)
2 tablespoons chopped shallots
3 cups 1 1/2-inch asparagus pieces, from about 1 pound (see note)
1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce
3 (1/2-ounce) slices nitrite-free turkey (or pork) bacon, cooked until crisp, drained well, and crumbled
1 tablespoon grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
In a nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook for about 3 minutes, or until they just start to soften and release their liquid. Add the shallots and cook for another minute.
Add the asparagus and cook for 3 minutes longer, or until the asparagus is just crisp-tender.
Drizzle the soy sauce over the veggies and sprinkle with the bacon crumbles and cheese. Toss well and serve hot.
