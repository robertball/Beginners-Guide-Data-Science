Ingredients:
9 cups 1/4-inch thick cucumber slices
6 (1 pint) canning jars with lids and rings
1 tablespoon pickling spice
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
3 cups distilled white vinegar
3 cups water
1 1/2 cups sugar
4 teaspoons sea salt

Directions:
Divide cucumber slices among canning jars. Add 1/2 teaspoon pickling spice and 1/2 teaspoon turmeric to each jar.
Stir vinegar, water, sugar, and sea salt together in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook and stir until the sugar and salt dissolve; cook at a boil for 2 minutes.
Carefully fill jars with brine to within 1/2 inch of the rim, covering the cucumbers completely. Discard any leftover brine.
Place the lids on the jars. Refrigerate at least 24 hours before serving. Store in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.
