Ingredients:
1/4 cup vinegar
1/2 cup ketchup
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, undrained
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated (optional)
3 pounds pork spareribs, cut into serving size pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a saucepan over medium heat, stir together the vinegar, ketchup, soy sauce, and pineapple. Stir in brown sugar, cornstarch, salt, and ginger. Cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
Arrange a layer of spareribs in a roasting pan. Pour half of the sauce over the top. Arrange another layer of spareribs, and top with remaining sauce. Cover pan tightly with foil.
Bake in a preheated oven until done, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Description: 
This recipe does wonders for pork ribs. My mother made it when I was a child, and now I make it for my family. This recipe is very rich but very filling. It goes great with mashed potatoes!
