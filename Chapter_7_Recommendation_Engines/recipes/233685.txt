Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup long grain rice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small sweet onion, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 small green bell pepper, chopped
1 small red bell pepper, chopped
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tiny pinch salt
1 splash dry white wine
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion in the hot oil until tender, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook and stir until onion is translucent, 2 to 3 minutes more. Stir green bell pepper and red bell pepper into onion mixture; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Season with basil, oregano, black pepper, and salt.
Pour wine into vegetable mixture and reduce heat to medium low. Simmer until liquid is reduced, about 5 minutes. Stir rice into vegetables. Top with Parmesan cheese before serving.

Description: 
Normally a pepper and rice dish has a Mexican or Spanish kind of flair to it. I wanted something a little more Italian, and this is what I came up with.
