Ingredients:
2 cups Dry pinto beans (rinsed not soaked)
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/2 tablespoon Cumin
1 jalapeño pepper diced
2 serrano peppers diced
1 poblano pepper roasted and diced
1 chipotle pepper diced
1 bell pepper chopped
4 cups beef broth
1 can diced tomato
7oz can tomato sauce
1 medium onion chopped
2 clove garlic minced
1 lb ground beef

Directions:
Start by broiling poblano pepper to blister the skin and peel skin off. Strip seeds and veins from serrano and jalapeño peppers.  You can leave if you want but it will add HEAT.
Use sauté setting on instant pot to brown ground beef with onion and all peppers and garlic.  Drain if necessary.
Add remainder of ingredients and set instant pot to beans/chili for 30 min. After this cycle use manual release and taste for seasoning.  (Add salt at this time if needed).
Set for another 30 min bean/chili cycle.  Manual release after this cycle and eat!
Corn bread/muffins go great with this chili.  And a tall glass of water!
