Ingredients:
3 potatoes, cut into fries
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
1/2 cup beef gravy, or as needed
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or to taste
2 tablespoons mayonnaise, or to taste
1 tablespoon ketchup, or to taste
1/2 cup shredded lettuce
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry potatoes in batches in the hot oil until tender and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove to drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
Heat gravy in a small saucepan over medium heat until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Spread a layer of fries into two bowls, sprinkle with cheese and add a small amount of gravy; repeat these layers once. Squirt each serving with 1 tablespoon mayonnaise and 1 1/2 teaspoons ketchup. Sprinkle each bowl with half the lettuce; season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Courtesy of us old-time students from Fenelon Falls - this is how I ate poutine almost every day in my high school days (oh, the memories!). People say real poutine must have mozzarella cheese curds - I emphatically disagree! In every restaurant I've been to in Ontario, they use shredded cheese. If you're like me and prefer the English-Canadian version (non-cheese curds) and want to try something different, try this!
