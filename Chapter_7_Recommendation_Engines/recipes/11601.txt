Ingredients:
1 cup margarine
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 cup unsulfured molasses
4 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon mustard powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon instant coffee granules
3/4 cup milk
4 tablespoons raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a couple of cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and lard. Gradually mix in the egg, and  molasses. Sift together the flour, baking soda, ginger, dry mustard, instant coffee, and cloves; stir this into the creamed mixture alternately with the milk.
Drop cookie dough by heaping teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Press a raisin or maraschino cherry into the center of each one.  Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
