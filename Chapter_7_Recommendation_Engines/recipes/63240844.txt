1 cup dark brown sugar
1 cup apple cider vinegar
1 cup yellow onion, chopped coarsely
3/4 cup golden raisins
1/2 cup lime, seeded, chopped
1/2 cup ginger root grated
1/2 cup peeled, seeded and chopped orange
1/2 cup molasses
1/4 cup peeled, seeded and chopped lemon
3 cloves garlic minced
1 T. mustard seed
1 T. dried red pepper flakes
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground cloves

Directions:
Combine mangoes, sugar, vinegar, onions, raisins, lime, ginger root, orange, molasses, lemon, garlic, mustard seed, red pepper flakes and cook for about 30 minutes, stirring often. Add cinnamon, cloves, allspice and cilantro and cook for about 10 minutes more, until chutney starts to thicken.
Ladle chutney into a hot jar to within 1/2" of top rim (head space). Remove air bubbles by sliding a rubber spatula between glass and food; readjust head space to 1/2". Wipe jar rim removing any stickiness. Top with a lid and band, tighten to finger tight. Process 10 minutes at altitudes up to 1,000 ft.
