Ingredients:
1 large egg
2 T Mayonaise (Paleo, see my other recipes)
1 tsp Dijon mustard
1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1/4 tsp Tabasco
1/4 tsp lemon juice
1 1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning
~black pepper to taste
1 pound fresh jumbo lump crab meat
1 T red pepper, finely diced
2 tsp sliced green onion
1 T fresh chopped parsley
1/4 cup almond flour + 1/3 cup for dredging.

Directions:
In a small bowl, whisk together egg, mayo, mustard, Worcestershire, Tabasco, lemon juice, Old Bay and pepper
Place crab meat in a separate bowl, trying not to break up too many of the big chunks of crab
Pour the liquid mixture over the crab and, using your hands, gently mix all together. Add in peppers, green onions, and parsley, as well as 1/4 cup almond flour, and combine all. Set additional 1/3 cup almond flour aside in a separate bowl.
Form mixture into crab cakes of desired size. Dip top and bottom of cakes in the almond flour, and set on greased sheet pan. Refrigerate for at least one hour.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place crab cakes in over for 15-20 minutes, until golden brown.
