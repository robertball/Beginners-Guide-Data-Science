Description: 
Home-made meatloaf with a yummy sweet twist. I didn't have any breadcrumbs for the traditional meatloaf, so I searched my cabinets and came up with this meatloaf. It was a HUGE hit with the kids. Its sweet but still a meatloaf. The cornmeal and brown sugar just made it out of this world! Also, once cooked, they are very easy to store and pack up for left overs.
