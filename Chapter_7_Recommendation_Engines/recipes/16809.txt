Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
3/4 cup uncooked white rice
6 (3/4 inch thick) boneless pork chops
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/4 cups water, divided
1 (10.75 ounce) can tomato soup
2 tablespoons taco sauce

Directions:
In a saucepan bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil. Stir in rice.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
Season pork chops with the garlic powder, ground black pepper and seasoned salt to taste. In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil for 5 minutes. Add the chops, browning well on both sides.
Add 3/4 cup water, reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Move chops to one side and add the tomato soup and remaining 1/2 cup water. Simmer for 5 to 7 more minutes, then add the cooked rice, stirring well. Allow to heat through, about 5 more minutes.
