Ingredients:
500 ml (2 Cups) Water
150 g Palm Sugar, roughly chopped
3 tsp Agar-Agar Powder
1 Pandan Leaf, tied into a knot
300 ml (1 Â¼ Cups) Coconut Milk
Pinch of salt

Directions:
1. Place water, sugar, agar-agar powder and pandan leaf in a roomy pan and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer until agar-agar powder completely dissolves, about 8 minutes
2. Remove pandan leaf. Stir in the salt into the coconut milk and pour this into the jelly mixture. Return the mixture to the heat and bring it up to a boil and turn off the heat immediately.
3. Pour the jelly into a glass dish or jelly mould and leave undisturbed until set. When cool, chill the jelly in the refrigerator. The jelly should separate nicely into 2 layers-a clear palm sugar layers and a coconut layer. Remove from mould, cut and serve cold.
