Ingredients:
2 lbs fajita meat (or thinly sliced skirt steak)
4 chipotle chiles- stems removed
4 cloves of garlic
1 chile de arbol Â– stems removed
1/3 cup olive oil
Juice of 3 small limes
1 teaspoon of Mexican oregano
1 pinch of cumin
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Add all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. It will take a minute or two to completely break up the chipotle chiles and to get a smooth consistency. If you find that the marinade is too thick drizzle olive oil into the blender while it is running until you get the desired consistency. Allow it to sit for about 30 minutes to let the flavors come together.
Thoroughly coat the meat on all sides and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to permeate the meat. You can let the meat marinade for up to 4 hours.
Heat grill.  Once hot grill meat for 5-7 minutes on each side.  Remove and serve with your favorite fajita peppers and vegetables.
