Ingredients:
⅓ cup all-purpose flour
1  egg, beaten
1 pound chicken breast tenderloins
1 (8 ounce) jar chili bean sauce (such as Toban Djan(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
¼ cup vegetable oil
4 cups vegetable oil
2 tablespoons ground Sichuan peppercorns

Directions:
Place flour in a large bowl. Beat egg in a shallow dish. Coat a piece of chicken in flour, dip in egg, coat again in flour, and place on a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken. Let coated chicken rest for 10 minutes.
Heat chili bean sauce and 1/4 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat, whisking occasionally, for 8 minutes.
Heat 4 cups oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a large skillet. Fry chicken in batches: cook for 4 minutes, flip, and cook other side until golden brown, about 4 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
Dip chicken tenders in the chili bean sauce mixture, using tongs. Transfer to a serving plate and sprinkle with ground Sichuan peppercorns. Serve immediately.

A popular dish at a fast-food chain restaurant is trending all over the US right now. If you are the one that goes in and asks for extra spicy, well this is the recipe for you. It's spicy and will make you sweat, however the numbing affect of the sichuan peppercorn tames the heat and has you coming back for more.
