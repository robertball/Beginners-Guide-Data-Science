Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup butter
2 eggs
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon rum flavored extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Mix together flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder, and butter until the mixture resembles cornmeal.
Combine eggs, sugar, rum extract, almond extract, and nutmeg until well mixed. Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture. Stir until well blended. Divide the dough into two equal halves. Refrigerate the dough for 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place dough on a lightly floured surface.  Roll the dough out until it is 1/8 inch thick. Using a cookie cutter cut the dough into cookies (whatever shapes you please). Place the cookies on an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 7 to 9 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
