Turn out into a colander and let cool.  Chill the potatoes a bit in the fridge too.  Meanwhile in a small bowl blend the mayo, yogurt, celery seed, and dijon.  Once the potatoes are chilled add in the 4 minced scallions, and the dressing mixture.  Toss gently and sprinkle with salt & pepper.  Chill until ready to eat.
