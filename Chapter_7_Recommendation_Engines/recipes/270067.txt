Description: 
A very tasty drink made with orange juice and a variety of spices that my doctor suggested to reduce inflammation. 
My doctor has suggested that I ingest the anti-inflammatory spices several times a day. Well I don't know about the rest of you, but I just cannot eat that many times a day, so I have come up with this drink to have between meals. I mainly have it between breakfast and lunch. You can change the amounts to your taste. Get well, everybody!
