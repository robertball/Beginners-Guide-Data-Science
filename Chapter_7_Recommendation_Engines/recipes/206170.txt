Description: 
I received this recipe from my mother in law who resides in Garrochales, PR. It isn't nearly as complicated as other recipes I have seen and is just as delicious. I recommend freezing these in ice trays, then storing in freezer bags and frozen to have on hand. You can double, triple or quadruple, etc as needed. This recipe lasts me about 2 months.
