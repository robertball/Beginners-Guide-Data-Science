Ingredients:
1 (19.8 ounce) package brownie mix
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1/2 cup coffee-flavored liqueur (such as Kahlua®), or to taste
1 (3.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding and pie filling mix
2 cups cold milk
1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Mix the brownie mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs together in a mixing bowl until smooth, and pour the batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the brownies shows moist crumbs, 25 to 30 minutes. Set the brownies aside, and cool completely. Use a chopstick or the end of a wooden spoon to poke holes all over the brownies, about 1/2-inch apart; drizzle the coffee liqueur all over the brownies. Let the brownies stand 5 minutes to soak up the liqueur.
In a bowl, whisk the chocolate pudding mix with cold milk until thickened, about 2 minutes; allow to stand 5 more minutes to set.
To assemble dessert, cut the brownies up into small cubes. Layer 1/3 of the brownies into the bottom of a glass trifle bowl, and top with a layer of pudding, then a layer of whipped topping. Repeat twice more, ending with whipped topping. Chill at least 4 hours before serving.
