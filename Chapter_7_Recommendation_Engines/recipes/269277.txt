Combine cranberries, jalapenos, green onions, and cilantro in the bowl of a food processor; blend until everything is finely chopped. Transfer mixture to a bowl. Stir in sugar and lime juice. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Mix cream cheese and Cheddar cheese together in a bowl until evenly combined. Spread mixture evenly on top of tortillas to cover. Spread 1/4 cup of cranberry mixture on one half of each tortilla. Layer 8 slices of turkey lunch meat over cranberry mixture.
Tightly roll up each tortilla, starting on the end with the meat and cranberry mixture. Use a serrated knife to cut into 1-inch pieces. Serve immediately or refrigerate until use.
