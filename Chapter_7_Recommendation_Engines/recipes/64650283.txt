Ingredients:
1 quart chicken stock
2 large heads fresh broccoli, chopped
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1 large carrot, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
½ teaspoon each salt and ground white pepper
6 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons All-Purpose flour
3 cups milk
8 oz. cream cheese, softened
2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
1. Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a large saucepan and add the broccoli. Bring back to a boil and simmer for about 8 minutes or until tender. Begin the next step while it’s cooking.
2. Meanwhile, heat the butter and olive oil in a large pot over medium high heat, then add the onion, carrot, celery and seasonings and sautée until well softened, about 8-10 minutes.
3.  Add the minced garlic, wait about a minute (you’ll smell the garlic cooking), then whisk in the flour and allow to cook for 2 minutes. Whisk in the milk, stirring until it begins to thicken, then add the cream cheese in pieces and stir until melted. Add the cheddar cheese and stir into the base until melted, incorporated and smooth. Taste for seasoning.
4. Remove about a cup or so of the cooked broccoli with a slotted spoon. Give it a chop if you like. Pour the remainder of the stock and broccoli into the cheese and vegetable base, stir until well combined, then puree with an immersion blender. Stir in the reserved chopped broccoli.
