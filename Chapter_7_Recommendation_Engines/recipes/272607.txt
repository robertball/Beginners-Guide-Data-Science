Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (16 ounce) package boneless chicken breast tenders
salt and ground black pepper to taste
⅔ cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium onion, peeled and cut in half
½ cup parsley, rinsed
¼ cup cilantro, rinsed
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 clove garlic, peeled
½ teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat butter and olive oil in a deep skillet or cast iron pan over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until golden brown, about 1 minute. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Add to the skillet and cook until browned on each side, no longer pink in the center, and juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Combine olive oil, onion, parsley, cilantro, lemon juice, garlic, and salt together in a food processor; pulse until finely chopped.
Spoon chimichurri sauce over chicken tenders; serve.

Description: 
Not only is this a quick and easy entree, but it is so tasty. The chimichurri sauce is amazing! I'm not a big fan of pesto and have now found a wonderful, garlicky substitute that my whole family loved! Serve with white or brown rice. Save any leftover chimichurri sauce in a sealed container in the refrigerator for future use.
