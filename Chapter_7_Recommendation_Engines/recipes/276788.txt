Ingredients:
1 pound chorizo sausage
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 small yellow onion, chopped
1 small fresh red chile pepper, finely chopped (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 (8 ounce) can chopped green chiles
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained, divided
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend, divided
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
3/4 cup baking mix (such as Bisquick Â®)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat a 10-inch cast iron or oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo, garlic, onion, and red chile in the hot skillet until chorizo is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir in chili powder, followed by green chiles and 1/2 of the black beans. Stir in 1 cup Mexican cheese blend.
Mix eggs, milk, and baking mix together in a medium bowl. Pour into the skillet. Top with remaining beans and  Mexican cheese. Sprinkle cilantro on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool, at least 5 minutes.
