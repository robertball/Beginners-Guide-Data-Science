Ingredients:
1 cup Butter Flavored Shortening
1/2 cup Brown Sugar
1 cup White Pure Cane Sugar
2 Large Eggs
2 teaspoons Vanilla or 1 tsp Almond Extract
1 teaspoon Baking Soda
1-1/2 teaspoon Salt (or to taste)
2-1/4 cups Flour
1-1/2 cups White Chocolate Chips

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 350 degrees.
In a large bowl, whisk Shortening and both sugars together until combined.  Add egg one at a time whisking until fully incorporated.  Add almond extract and whisk until combined.
In a separate bowl combine baking soda, salt, and flour.  Slowly incorporate using a whisk mixing about 1/4 of the flour mixture at a time.  Switch to a rubber spatula when after the mixture becomes too thick, usually around the 3rd of 4th flour incorporation.
After flour mixture and shortening mixture have been mixed together, add white chocolate chips.  Combine with rubber spatula.
Roll into 1 inch balls and place onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper (or your preferred method for baking cookies) around 2 inches apart.  Bake for 11-13 minutes, or until lightly golden brown at the edges.  Remove and allow to cool until you can no longer wait to eat.
