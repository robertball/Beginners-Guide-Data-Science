Ingredients:
3/4 cup grated farmer's cheese
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 1/2 cups cooked crumbled Italian sausage
3/4 cup chopped hard salami
1/2 cup chopped pepperoni
1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese
11 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place farmer's cheese in 1 bowl and mozzarella cheese in a separate bowl.
Combine sausage, salami, and pepperoni in a non-stick frying pan over medium heat; cook and stir until warmed, about 5 minutes. Stir ricotta cheese into meat mixture until melted and stringy, about 5 minutes. Stir farmer's cheese and mozzarella cheese into meat mixture until warmed, about 5 minutes.
Blend eggs together in a blender until frothy; pour into meat-cheese mixture and stir until some of the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Pour egg mixture into a 9-inch pie pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until top has risen and is starting to brown, about 20 minutes. Cool frittata on a wire rack until set, at least 5 minutes.

Description: 
This Easter breakfast frittata has been a family tradition going back many generations from Italy. You probably want to make several at a time because they are time-consuming, but well worth it! Slice as you would a pie and enjoy right away, or cover with aluminum foil and freeze in a freezer bag until needed (that's why I make 4 at a time). Serve with fruit or tomatoes.
