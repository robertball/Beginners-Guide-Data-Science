Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
2 (6.5 ounce) jars marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
3 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the farfalle pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and set aside.
Mix artichoke hearts, walnuts, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, lemon juice, basil, and oregano in a large bowl. Season with salt and black pepper. Add farfalle and stir to coat.

Description: 
Lacking a food processor I had to find another way to do this idea which called for an artichoke pesto. My version came out as good or better. This is a great meatless dish hot or cold.
