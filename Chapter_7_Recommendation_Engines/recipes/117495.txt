Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin
1 small onion, chopped
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
2 garlic cloves, minced
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/8 teaspoon pepper
CUCUMBER SAUCE:
1 small tomato, seeded and chopped
2/3 cup reduced-fat plain yogurt
1/2 cup chopped seeded cucumber
1 tablespoon finely chopped onion
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Cut pork into eight slices; flatten to 1/2-in. thickness. In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the onion, lemon juice, parsley, garlic, thyme and pepper; add pork. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. In a small bowl, combine the cucumber sauce ingredients. Cover and refrigerate until serving.
Drain pork and discard marinade. Place on a broiler pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Broil 4 in. from the heat for 6-8 minutes on each side or until juices run clear. Serve with cucumber sauce.
