Ingredients:
2 cups Captain Crunch cereal
1 1/2 cup corn flakes
1 egg
1 cup milk
1 cup all purpose flour
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup of stone ground mustard
2 pounds of pork chops
oil for frying

Directions:
Coarsely grind or crush the two cereals and set aside.
Beat the egg with milk and set aside.
Stir together the flour, onion and garlic powders and black pepper. Set this aside also.
Wash and dry the pork chops. Spread the stone ground mustard on both sides.
Dip the pork pieces into the seasoned flour. Move around to coat well, then shake off the excess flour. Dip into the egg wash, coating well, then dip into the cereal mixture, coating well.
Heat oil in a large heavy skillet to 325 degrees F.
Drop the coated pork chops carefully into the hot oil and cook until golden brown and fully cooked, 3 to 5 minutes per side depending on size.
You can substitute boneless chicken breasts cut into "fingers" or "nuggets".
