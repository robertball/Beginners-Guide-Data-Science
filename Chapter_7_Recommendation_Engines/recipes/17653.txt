Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
4 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
2 cups grated carrots
1 cup crushed pineapple with juice
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1/2 cup butter
1 pound confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup flaked coconut
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9 inch round cake pans.
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and cocoa, set aside. In another bowl, stir together the eggs, vanilla and oil. Stir in the dry ingredients until they are completely absorbed. Fold in the carrots and pineapple. Pour the batter evenly between the three prepared pans.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. To make the frosting, combine the cream cheese, butter and confectioners sugar in a medium bowl. Beat until smooth, then stir in the coconut and nuts. Frost cake when cool.
