Ingredients:
4 (8 ounce) skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs
1 teaspoon paprika
salt and pepper to taste
4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1/3 cup low-sodium chicken broth
4 ounces sliced mushrooms
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
2 green onions, white and green parts separated and sliced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Season chicken thighs on all sides with paprika, salt, and pepper.
Cook bacon in a cast iron skillet or oven-safe pan over medium-high heat until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Drain and discard excess grease from skillet.
Return skillet to medium heat and cook chicken thighs, skin-side down, for 3 to 4 minutes. Flip chicken over and place skillet in the preheated oven.
Bake until chicken thighs are no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Remove all but 2 tablespoons drippings from skillet.
Return skillet to the stove over medium-high heat. Pour in chicken broth while whisking up brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Add mushrooms and cook until soft, about 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in heavy whipping cream and whisk together until lightly simmering, then reduce heat to medium-low. Season with salt and pepper, if necessary.
Return chicken and any juices back into skillet; top with bacon and green onions. Serve immediately, spooning sauce over the chicken.
