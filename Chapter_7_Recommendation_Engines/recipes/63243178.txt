Ingredients:
4 large portobello mushrooms
1 tsp olive oil
1 zucchini, chopped
1/2 Spanish onion, chopped
1 Tbsp minced garlic
1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 medium tomato, chopped
2 roasted red peppers, chopped
handful fresh basil leaves, chopped
1/2 cup whole-wheat bread crumbs
1/2 cup Parmesan or Romano cheese
sea salt and black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375
Remove stems from mushrooms and set aside. Clean mushroom tops and scrape out gills with a spoon. Set aside
To prepare stuffing; heat oil in medium sillet. Chop mushroom stems and add to skillet with zucchini, onion, garlic and vinegar. Saute for about 5 minutes, until zucchinin and mushroom soften. Add tomato and roasted red peppers and heat through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl.
Stir in basil, bread crumbs and cheese, I reserve a bit of cheese to sprinkle on top of mushrooms. (if you prefer a drier mixture, simply add more bread crumbs.) Season with salt and pepper.
Fill mushroom tops with vegetable mixture and bake for 15 minutes or until mushrooms look tender and cheese is slightly melted.
