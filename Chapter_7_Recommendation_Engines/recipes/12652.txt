Ingredients:
3 cups chopped watermelon rind
1 1/3 cups dried cranberries
3/4 cup chopped walnuts
1/3 cup distilled white vinegar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons orange zest
1 teaspoon orange juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place watermelon rind in a saucepan and cover with water and bring this to a boil. Reduce the heat; simmer uncovered for about 10 minutes or until the rind becomes tender and translucent. Remove from heat and drain.
Place cooked watermelon rind in a large bowl and add the cranberries, walnuts and vinegar. Combine the sugar, pumpkin pie spice, flour, and the salt. Add this to the rind mixture and stir well.
Line a 9 inch pie plate with bottom pastry, trim the pastry even with the edge. Add the filling. Roll out the remaining pastry and make a lattice crust. Seal and flute edges.
Cover pie with aluminum foil and bake at 425 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20-25 minutes. Remove the foil, and bake for another 20-25 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.
In a small bowl, combine confectioners sugar, orange rind and orange juice. Stir to combine, and spoon over hot pie. Cool on a wire rack.
