Ingredients:
1/2 pound pork tenderloin, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon butter
1/3 cup dry vermouth
1/3 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard
1 tablespoon honey mustard
1 teaspoon ground allspice

Directions:
Dredge the pork tenderloin slices in the flour, and shake off the excess. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the tenderloin in the hot butter until golden brown on both sides and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Remove to a platter and keep warm.
Pour the vermouth into the skillet, and bring to a simmer; cook for 1 minute. Add the chicken broth and lime juice. Cook and stir until reduced by about half. Stir in the cream, yellow mustard, honey mustard, and allspice. Pour the sauce over the pork to serve.
