Ingredients:
1 cup milk
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 slices white bread
1 teaspoon butter

Directions:
Whisk milk, cinnamon, and vanilla extract together in a shallow bowl.
Press each slice of bread lightly into the milk mixture to coat both sides, removing it before it gets soaked.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook coated slices in batches until golden brown and somewhat firm, 5 to 8 minutes per side.

Description: 
All the goodness of French Toast made without eggs. My husband came up with the recipe for our son, who is allergic to eggs and other foods. Serve with syrup and confectioners' sugar.
