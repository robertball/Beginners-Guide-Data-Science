Ingredients:
1/2 cup (4 oz) salted butter, at room temperature
3 cloves of garlic, minced
1/4 cup minced fresh flat leaf (Italian) parsley
1/2 tsp. fresh ground pepper
2 dozen canned snails, drained and rinsed
2 dozen snail shells

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450F.
In a bowl, combine the butter, garlic, parsley and pepper and mix well with a wooden spoon.
Slip a snail into each shell, pushing it toward the back with a small spoon. Then tuck in a plug of the seasoned butter, about 2 tsp. pushing it deep into the shell and smoothing at the opening.
Arrange the snails, the butter facing up, on snail plates with individual indentations, and place the plates on a baking sheet. Alternatively, pack them snugly together in a shallow baking dish.
Bake until the snails are hot and the butter is beginning to melt, 10-12 minutes. If using snail plates, put them on individual serving plates. If the snails have been cooked in a baking dish, transfer them to small plates or shallow bowls, being careful not to lose any of the garlicky butter. Serve at once. Use baguette slices to soak up the yummy garlic butter.
