Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup basmati rice
1 tsp olive oil (or up to 3 T)
2 cloves garlic, minced (1 tsp)
1 tsp grated lemon zest
juice from half a lime (1 T)
salt to taste
2 cups finely chopped fresh cilantro
2 cups finely chopped baby spinach
3 scallions, finely chopped
salt to taste

Directions:
In a large saucepan, bring the water to a boil.  Add the rice, olive oil, garlic, lemon zest, lime juice, and salt and reduce to medium heat.  Stir gently, cover and simmer slowly for about 25 minutes, or until the rice is tender.  Leave the rice covered so the steam stays in, making the rice fluffy.
Transfer rice to a large mixing bowl. Add the cilantro, spinach, scallions and salt. Combine thoroughly.

Description: 
Simple, beautiful, healthful rice dish. When the warm rice combines with raw spinach and cilantro, the delicate flavors are released. The lemony rice takes on a pale green color, adding great plate appeal. Try this as a side dish with Borracho Beans. Recipe from The Whole Foods Cookbook.
