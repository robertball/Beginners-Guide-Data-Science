Ingredients:
1 cup lightly salted butter, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 12-ounce package M&M;'S (if you do mini baking bits, they will keep their color)
3/4 cup chopped nuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. In large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy; beat in eggs and vanilla. In medium bowl combine flour and baking soda; blend into the creamed mixture. Stir in M&MS. Drop by heaping tablespoonfuls about 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake 10 to 13 minutes, or until edges are lightly browned and centers are still soft. Do not overbake. Cool for 1 minute on cookie sheets, then cool completely on wire racks. Store in a tightly covered container. Enjoy!
