Ingredients:
4 pounds whole chicken cut up
1  whole dried red chili pepper, seeded and diced
2  carrots, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
2  onions, chopped
1  bay leaves
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
1 cup heavy cream
¼ cup cornstarch
½ cup water
2 cups self-rising flour
1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
For the stock: In a large pot over high heat, place the chicken parts, chile pepper, carrots, celery, onions, bay leaf, garlic and chicken broth. Mix well and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 1 to 2 hours, or until  chicken comes off bone easily. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
The next day, skim the fat off the top of the soup and remove the chicken parts. De-bone the chicken and chop the meat into bite size pieces. Discard bones and set meat aside. Using a slotted spoon, remove and discard the vegetables. Return the pot to the stove over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low for 10 to 15 minutes, add the heavy cream and stir well.
In a separate small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the water and add to the pot. Stir until thickened, and make the dumplings while the stock reduces.
For the dumplings: In a large bowl, combine the flour and the heavy cream, mixing well. Roll into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Drop balls carefully into the simmering soup and cook for 7 minutes. Then cover soup and cook for 7 more minutes. Add the chicken, stir well and allow to heat through.
