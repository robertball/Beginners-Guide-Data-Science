Ingredients:
16 spears asparagus, medium thickness (about 1 pound)
16 slices prosciutto sliced medium thin (about 1/2 pound)
1 Tbsp olive oil

Directions:
Cut 1 inch off the bottom of the asparagus spears.  Wrap a slice of prosciutto around each spear from bottom to top.  Line a jelly roll pan with foil and cover lightly with the olive oil.  Place the asparagus on the pan and bake in a 450 degree oven for 5 minutes.  Shake the pan vigorously to turn the spears and roast another 5 minutes then shake again.  Roast until the aspargus is tender and the prosciutto is crisp.  Serve immediately.
