Ingredients:
2 cups buttermilk biscuit mix
7 tablespoons water
8 eggs
8 slices processed American cheese
8 bacon strips, halved and cooked

Directions:
In a bowl, combine biscuit mix and water just until blended. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead 5 times. Roll out to 1/2-in. thickness; cut with a 3-in. biscuit cutter. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 425 degrees F for 9-10 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, scramble the eggs. Split the biscuits; fill each with a slice of cheese, scrambled egg and two bacon pieces.
