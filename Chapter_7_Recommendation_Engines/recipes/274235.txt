Description: 
After experimenting, this is my adaptation of coconut-chicken curry. Others ended up either too tangy, too tomato-like, or too lemony. This is what I feel better represents the sweet and savory flavor you get in a restaurant. I use generous amounts of sugar, cinnamon, and some butter, so if you plan on making this often you might want to try some of the others since mine is packed with the best stuff on earth that is worst for you! But it tastes so good!
