Ingredients:
5-8 pounds pork spareribs or baby back ribs, rinsed, patted dry, and any membrane and excess fat removed
1 cup plain prepared yellow mustard
1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons Liquid Smoke seasoning
2 tablespoons paprika
3 tablespoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon celery salt
2 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon red chili powder
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup water
16 ounces of your favorite BBQ sauce, bottled or homemade

Directions:
After rinsing, patting dry, and removing any membrane or excess fat, place ribs in a shallow roasting pan.
Mix the mustard, worcestershire sauce, and liquid smoke with a fork or whisk.
Rub the mustard mixture into the ribs. Make sure to coat all over and evenly.
In a small bowl combine the paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt, brown sugar, cinnamon, cumin, chili powder, oregano, salt, and pepper.
Place the dry seasonings in an empty shaker.
Liberally coat all sides of the ribs with the seasoning mixture heavily, pressing it into the mustard.
Cover and let marinade in the refrigerator overnight or up to 2 days.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.
Add the water to the shallow roasting pan, add the roaster grill insert, or lay upon wadded balls of foil (do not lay them directly in the water!). Cover and seal tightly with aluminum foil.
Slowly bake ribs for 2 1/2 hours.
Uncover and add BBQ sauce, and bake for 30 minutes, or until starting to brown/blacken slightly.
