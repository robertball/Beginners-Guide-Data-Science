Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
6 chicken breast tenders
1 (.18 ounce) packet sazon seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 cup instant rice
1 cup water
1 (14 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (.18 ounce) packet sazon seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic salt
8 extra-large flour tortillas
1 (16 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend
1 tablespoon softened butter, or as needed

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir chicken, 1 packet sazon seasoning, and 1 teaspoon garlic salt, shredding chicken as it cooks until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes.
Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir black beans, 1 packet sazon seasoning, and teaspoon garlic salt together in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook in microwave until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add black bean mixture to rice.
Place each tortilla on a work surface; layer half of each tortilla with bean-rice mixture, Mexican cheese, shredded chicken, and more Mexican cheese. Fold each tortilla in half. Spread a thin layer of softened butter atop each quesadilla.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook each quesadilla, butter-side down, until cheese is melted and outside is crisp and brown, about 5 minutes per side. Cut into wedges.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe on a whim. I love quesadillas, but am picky about what goes in them. This was super easy to make and tasted really good. Serve as is or with salsa and sour cream.
