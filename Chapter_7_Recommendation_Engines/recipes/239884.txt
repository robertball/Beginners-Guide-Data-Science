Ingredients:
1 cup wild rice
water to cover
2 teaspoons Celtic sea salt, divided
3 quarts chicken broth, divided
2 tablespoons coconut oil
3 cups cubed wild turkey breast, or more to taste
1 large onion, chopped
2 large carrots, quartered lengthwise and sliced
4 stalks celery, chopped
1 pound bag frozen okra
1 teaspoon white pepper
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons chopped jarred jalapeno peppers
1 teaspoon hot sauce (such as Texas PeteÂ®)

Directions:
Place wild rice in a bowl and pour in enough water to cover; soak 4 hours to overnight. Drain rice.
Mix wild rice and 1 teaspoon salt together in a stockpot and add about 3 cups chicken broth. Bring broth to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover stockpot, and simmer until rice is tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.
Heat coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir turkey, onion, carrots, and celery in the hot oil until turkey is cooked through and vegetables are slightly tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Add okra to turkey mixture and cook until okra is thawed, 5 to 7 minutes; season with 1 teaspoon salt, white pepper, and black pepper.
Combine wild rice, turkey mixture, jalapeno peppers, hot sauce, and remaining chicken stock in a slow cooker.
Cook on High for 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a great recipe for a hearty soup. You can substitute tame turkey for wild turkey and still call it wild turkey gumbo because of the wild rice. You can add more kick by increasing the spices or less kick by decreasing them.
