Ingredients:
1 pound jumbo prawns
2 tablespoons cooking oil
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons thinly sliced lemon grass
5 fresh Thai chile peppers, sliced thin
1 shallot, sliced thin
2 kaffir lime leaves
1 tablespoon fish sauce, or to taste
1 lime, juiced
1 tablespoon Thai roasted chilli paste (nam prik pao)
1 tablespoon torn fresh mint leaves

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat; lightly oil the grate.
Cook the shrimp on the hot grill until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Arrange the prawns on a serving platter.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry the garlic in the hot oil until brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir the lemon grass, chile peppers, shallot, lime leaves, fish sauce, lime juice, and chilli paste into the garlic; toss to combine. Spoon the sauce over the prawns. Garnish with the mint to serve.
