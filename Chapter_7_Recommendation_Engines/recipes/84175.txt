Ingredients:
1/4 cup oil for frying
1 (2 pound) rabbit, cleaned and cut into pieces
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 green bell pepper, seeded and sliced into strips
1 red bell pepper, seeded and sliced into strips
1 bird's eye chile, seeded and minced
1 large tomatoes - peeled, seeded and chopped
1 3/4 cups chicken stock
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2/3 cup cream of coconut

Directions:
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the rabbit pieces until browned on the outside. Transfer to a soup pot or large saucepan. Add the onion, garlic, green pepper, red pepper and chile pepper to the skillet; cook and stir until onion is transparent. Transfer to the saucepan.
Add the tomatoes, chicken stock, salt and pepper to the saucepan, and bring to a boil. Simmer over medium-low heat for about 2 hours. Remove the rabbit pieces with a slotted spoon, and keep warm. Turn the heat up to high under the saucepan, and boil the liquid until it has reduced by half.
Return the rabbit pieces to the pan, and stir in the coconut milk. Cook, stirring gently, until heated through. Serve.

Description: 
This is an old recipe that comes from Colombia. My family loves when I cook this. Rabbit meat is very low in fat and can be dry-tasting, so it marries well with coconut cream. It is best to cook the rabbit gently till it is falling off the bone. Serve with rice.
