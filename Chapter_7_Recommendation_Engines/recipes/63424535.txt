Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup flour, all-purpose
1 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed
1 cup canned pumpkin
1 egg
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3/4 cup flour, whole-grain wheat
3/4 cup chopped pecans
3/4 cup raisins, seedless (I prefer GOLDEN)
FOR BROWNED BUTTER GLAZE:
1/4 cup butter
2 cups powdered sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, beat margarine with electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds or until softened.
Add flour, brown sugar, pumpkin, egg, cinnamon, vanilla, baking powder, soda and nutmeg. Beat until thoroughly combined, scraping sides of bowl occasionally.
Stir in whole-wheat flour until mixed. Stir in nuts and raisins.
Drop in rounded teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart on a greased cookie sheet. Bake in 375-degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until edges are firm.
Remove and cool on a wire rack. Drizzle with Browned Butter Glaze.
FOR BROWNED BUTTER GLAZE: Melt butter over medium heat in small saucepan until delicate brown. Mix in powdered sugar. Beat in vanilla and milk until smooth. Pour over cookies in a thin stream.
