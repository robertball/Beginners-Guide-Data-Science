Ingredients:
3 (12 ounce) packages refrigerated cheese tortellini
1/2 (10 ounce) package frozen peas
3 tomatoes, chopped
1 cup coarsely grated Parmesan cheese
1 bunch fresh chives, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
Dressing:
6 tablespoons olive oil
2 lemons, juiced
1 tablespoon white sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook tortellini in boiling water until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.
Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook peas for 2 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.
Combine cooled tortellini, cooled peas, tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, chives, and parsley in a bowl.
Combine olive oil, lemon juice, sugar, salt, and pepper in a little bowl; the dressing is supposed to taste sour. Pour over tortellini salad and mix well. Refrigerate at least 2 hours. Taste before serving and season with salt and pepper, if necessary.

Description: 
This is one of my standard pasta salads for potlucks or parties. It's vegetarian and so good! Don't skimp with the dressing because the tortellini soak up a lot of dressing. I estimated the dressing amounts, so you just need to taste for yourself.
