Kansas Potatoes Recipe

https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
6 C. cooked, grated potatoes
1 t. salt
2 C. cottage cheese
1 t. garlic salt
1 C. sour cream
1/2 t. dried chives or 2 t. fresh chives, minced
3 T. melted butter
1/2-1 C. grated cheddar cheese

Directions:
Peel potatoes and cook in boiling water until slightly underdone. Let cool, then grate. They will be easier to grate if they are not fully cooked. Place the 6 C. potatoes in a large bowl and mix with the rest of the ingredients. Bake in a 13x9 pan at 350 degrees until cheese is melted.
I have used low-fat cottage cheese, lite sour cream, and reduced-fat cheddar with good results.
