Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated crescent rolls
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 pinch brown sugar, or more to taste
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or more to taste
Icing:
1 tablespoon skim milk
1 teaspoon maple syrup
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 16 mini muffin cups.
Unroll crescent dough onto a work surface; separate into 2 sections along the perforated lines. Brush each half with melted butter; sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon. Roll into logs and slice each log into 8 sections. Place into prepared muffin cups.
Bake rolls in preheated oven until golden brown, about 8 minutes.
Whisk milk and maple syrup together in a bowl. Mix in confectioners' sugar, a few spoonfuls at a time, to form desired icing consistency. Drizzle over warm rolls.
