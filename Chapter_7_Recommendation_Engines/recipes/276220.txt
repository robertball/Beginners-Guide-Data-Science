Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 large red onion, chopped
3 red potatoes, cubed
5 slices bacon
3 cups cubed cooked chicken
1/2 (16 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (10.5 ounce) can turkey gravy
1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Heat butter in a pan over medium heat. Cook onion until soft, about 5 minutes, and set aside.
Place potatoes into a pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble into a large bowl.
Add onions, potatoes, chicken, mixed vegetables, cream of mushroom soup, and gravy to the bowl with the bacon and mix well.
Line a 2-quart casserole dish with 1/2 the phyllo dough to make a bottom crust. Pour in turkey mixture. Cover with remaining phyllo dough to make a top crust.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until golden brown, about 20 minutes more.
