1 pound potatoes
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon dried oregano

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Cut potatoes into wedges. Rinse and pat dry. Pour olive oil into a large bowl. Add wedges to the oil; mix until coated.
Mix black pepper, oregano, garlic powder, and seasoned salt together in another bowl or a large zip-top bag. Add potato wedges and mix around until evenly coated. Spread wedges on the prepared baking sheet.

Description: 
Made these potato wedges on a whim, just threw some spices together! Great alternative to French fries! You may need to adjust the cooking time, depending on how thick your wedges are.
