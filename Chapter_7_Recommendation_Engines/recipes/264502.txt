Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons ras el hanout (optional)
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
salt to taste
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
3 pounds lamb shoulder, trimmed and cut into cubes
1/2 cup butter
2 medium onions, finely chopped
1 shallot, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 cinnamon sticks
3 cups chicken stock, or more as needed
2 cups whole blanched almonds
1 cup diced carrots
1 cup chopped dried apricots
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup pitted, chopped prunes (optional)
1/3 cup honey
1 tablespoon lemon juice, or more to taste

Directions:
Mix water, paprika, ras el hanout, black pepper, cinnamon, coriander, cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, cayenne pepper, turmeric, and salt in a small bowl. Add red pepper flakes to the spice paste if you want more of a kick to your dish.
Place lamb cubes in a large bowl and rub in the spice paste. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Melt butter in a Dutch oven. Add onions, shallot, garlic, and cinnamon sticks; saute for 6 to 8 minutes. Add lamb with the spice paste. Cover with chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more stock if lamb looks dry.
Add almonds, carrots, apricots, raisins, prunes, and honey to the Dutch oven. Simmer until lamb is completely tender, carrots are cooked, and almonds are slightly softened, 15 to 30 minutes more. Add lemon juice. Season with salt.

Description: 
A delicious, sweet, and fragrant tagine usually made for Eid al-Adha, but also perfect for winter days. This dish is best made a day in advance, as it tastes twice as good the next day! Serve with couscous, rice, or bread.
