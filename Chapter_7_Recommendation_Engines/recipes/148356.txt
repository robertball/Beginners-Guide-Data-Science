Ingredients:
1/4 cup quinoa
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 teaspoon lemon zest
4 (2 ounce) sole fillets
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
4 lemon slices
ground black pepper
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Stir together the quinoa, 1/2 cup water, parsley, basil, and lemon zest in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes. Pour into a mixing bowl, fold in the Parmesan cheese, and allow the mixture to cool.
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack at about 6 inches from the heat source. Lightly grease a small baking dish.
Spoon a quarter of the quinoa mixture onto one end of each sole fillet. Fold the other side of the sole overtop, sprinkle with black pepper, and place a lemon slice on top. Place the sole into the prepared baking dish, and add the vinegar and remaining water.
Broil in the preheated oven until the sole flakes easily with a fork, and the flesh is opaque, 3 to 4 minutes.
