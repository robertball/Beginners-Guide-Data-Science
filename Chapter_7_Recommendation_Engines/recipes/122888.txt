5 eggs
2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, melted

In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, chocolate and vanilla; mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk, beating well after each addition. Stir in nuts if desired. Pour into four greased 5-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks to cool completely.

You can't go wrong with my grandmother's chocolaty bread recipe. It tastes as yummy as it looks...it's my most-requested special-occasion bread...and it never lasts long at bake sales.
