Ingredients:
2 (14 ounce) cans full-fat coconut milk, chilled overnight
1 cup sliced strawberries, divided
1/4 cup tahini
5 pitted dates, soaked in hot water for 30 minutes and drained
1 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1/4 cup sliced fresh strawberries (optional)
1 tablespoon sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
Freeze the base of your ice cream maker for at least 12 hours.
Combine coconut milk, 1/2 cup strawberries, tahini, dates, and almond extract in a high-speed blender. Blend until strawberries are broken down and mixture is combined, about 1 minute. Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer's directions, 5 to 10 minutes.
As mixture starts to thicken, add remaining 1/2 strawberries and sliced almonds. Continue mixing until thickened, 10 to 20 minutes more.
Serve immediately as soft-serve ice cream garnished with additional strawberries and sesame seeds. Alternatively, place ice cream in the freezer for 1 to 2 hours to firm up.
