Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups milk
1 tablespoon butter, melted and cooled
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs

Directions:
In a small mixing bowl, beat the milk, butter, flour and salt until blended. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Fill buttered popover pans or large custard cups three-fourths full.
Bake at 450 degrees F for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F; bake 20 minutes longer or until very firm. Remove from the oven and prick each popover with a sharp knife to allow steam to escape. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Popovers have been a Christmas morning tradition in my family for 30 years. I get up early to make the popovers, then wake the family to begin opening gifts. When the popovers are ready, I serve them with lots of butter and assorted jams. My father-in-law began the tradition.   --Sue A. Jurack
