Ingredients:
1 cup plus 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp baking powder
2 tsp cornstarch
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup (4oz) light cream cheese
1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp brown sugar
1/4 cup coconut sugar
2 tbsp white sugar
1 large egg
1/2 tsp vanilla
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
In a small mixing bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cornstarch, and salt.
(Optional): In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and vanilla.
In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the cream cheese and sugars until fully combined, about 1 minute. Slowly add the egg and vanilla mixture (or whole egg and vanilla) until fully incorporated. Reduce mixer speed to low and slowly add in the flour mixture. Once the dough is fully mixed, add in the chocolate chips.
Chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
After chilling, remove the dough from the fridge and preheat the oven to 350F. Scoop dough into balls about a tablespoon in size onto a cookie sheet, then bake for 8 minutes. After 8 minutes, turn off the oven, but leave the cookies inside for two minutes.
Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This chocolate chip cookie recipe is adapted from the original Toll House recipe, but with a few healthier swaps. You can serve this with the traditional glass of milk, but you can also mix it up by serving with a dip of Greek yogurt and honey!
