Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds hamburger
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (6 ounce) can diced green chiles
3/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup milk, or as needed
2 eggs
15 crushed crackers
1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan.
Mix hamburger, tomatoes, green chiles, onion, milk, eggs, crackers, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Transfer to the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a serving dish.

Description: 
Growing up in New Mexico, we had access to the Hatch green chile (the best!). I add green chile to a lot of my recipes and it rather sets this meatloaf off. It's very good cold, made into sandwiches the second day.
