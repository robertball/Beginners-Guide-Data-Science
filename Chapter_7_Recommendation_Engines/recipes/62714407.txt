Description: 
This is a very unique, pretty way to serve this delicious cauliflower cooked in the microwave, it doesn't over cook the cauliflower.  People who say they have never liked cooked cauliflower, like it.  
I got this recipe from an old friend, Cora.  Well she's not old, by now we're both old.  I serve it in a large salad serving bowl with a large spoon so everyone can cut their own piece of of this pretty dish.
