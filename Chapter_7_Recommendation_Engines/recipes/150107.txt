Description: 
Beat the flavor of the 'included sauce' (usually not too hard) with this quick and easy dipping sauce that only requires a few Asian ingredients! If you want to make this into a teriyaki, just add a bit of brown sugar (2 tbsp) and then cook it over low heat, adding a tablespoon of cornstarch for a thicker, glossier glaze-type sauce.
