6 tablespoons panko bread crumbs
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon lemon pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Combine panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, lemon pepper, thyme, parsley, granulated garlic, and lemon zest in a bowl. Arrange salmon on the prepared baking sheet and brush with melted butter. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture evenly over salmon fillets.
Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes.
