Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked jasmine rice
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 green onions, chopped
3 sprigs fresh thyme leaves
1 (28 ounce) can kidney beans, drained
2 cups chicken stock
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 Scotch bonnet pepper, stemmed
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Rinse rice in a fine strainer.
Heat oil in a large 5-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic, green onions, and thyme; cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Add the rice, kidney beans, stock, coconut milk, Scotch bonnet pepper, salt, sugar, black pepper, red pepper flakes, allspice, and cayenne pepper.
Bring to a boil, uncovered. Reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer until rice is tender and liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes.
