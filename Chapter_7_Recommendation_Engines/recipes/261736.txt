Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add breadcrumbs; toast until they just start to gain color, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and salt. Stir in more breadcrumbs if the mixture is too wet; add a little more oil if too dry. Toast until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes more.

Description: 
This vegan Parmesan cheese version doesn't taste the same as real Parmesan cheese, but it adds a similar texture and extra flavor. With this, I don't even miss the Parmesan!
