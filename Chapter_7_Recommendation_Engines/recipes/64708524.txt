Ingredients:
1/2 cup aged balsamic vinegar
2 large Roma tomatoes, sliced into 1/4 inch thick rounds
1 large cucumber, peeled and sliced into 1/4 inch thick rounds
1 8-oz. package fresh sliced mozzarella cheese
1 cup fresh basil leaves
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
1. In a small saucepan, add balsamic vinegar and cook over medium heat until boiling. Boil until the balsamic has reduced to 1/4 cup (about 8 minutes). Remove from heat, and allow to cool to room temperature.
2. On a small serving platter, arrange the sliced Roma tomatoes, cucumber slices, sliced mozzarella cheese, and basil leaves in an alternating pattern, until the serving platter is covered. Drizzle all the ingredients with 1 tbsp of olive oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
3. Take 1-2 tablespoons of the cooled balsamic vinegar and drizzle over the top of the tomatoes, cucumbers, mozzarella, and basil. Serve immediately.
