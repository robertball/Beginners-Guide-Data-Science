Ingredients:
½ cup lemon juice
¼ cup lime juice
¼ cup vegetable oil
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces
Italian seasoning to taste
seasoned salt to taste

Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, lime juice, and oil. Place chicken pieces in the mixture, and marinate at least 1 hour in the refrigerator (preferably 2 hours).
Preheat the oven broiler. Fit a roasting pan with a lightly greased wire rack. Fill pan with water to just below the level of the rack.
Remove chicken from marinade, arrange on the wire rack, and season with Italian seasoning and seasoned salt. Transfer remaining marinade to a saucepan, and bring to a boil.
Broil chicken 10 minutes in the preheated oven, basting frequently with the boiled marinade. Turn chicken, season again with Italian seasoning and seasoned salt, and continue broiling and basting 10 minutes, or until well browned and juices run clear.
