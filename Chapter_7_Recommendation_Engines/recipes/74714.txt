Ingredients:
1 quart oil for frying
4 summer squash, cut into chunks
1 medium onion, grated
2 eggs, beaten
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup dry corn muffin mix
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat the oil in a deep, heavy skillet or deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
Place the squash in a pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook 10 minutes, or until tender. Drain, and mash.
In a bowl, mix 2 cups squash*, onion, and eggs. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, corn muffin mix, baking powder, and salt. Thoroughly blend the squash mixture into the flour mixture.
Drop the squash and flour mixture by rounded tablespoons into the hot oil, and fry until evenly brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels.
