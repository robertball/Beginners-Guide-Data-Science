Description: 
This recipe is one of my mother's refrigerator cookies that she made when I was little. The old fashioned sugar cookies that you have on your home page is exactly what mom used to make. They are wonderfully soft and a touch of nutmeg in them. You could not believe how many memories it brings back to me. This is another memory to enclose to you. This is a sandwich type cookie spread with jam in the center.
