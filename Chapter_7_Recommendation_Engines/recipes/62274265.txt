Ingredients:
1 Large Shallot
1 Clove Garlic
6 - 8 Peppercorns
6 - 8 Sage leaves (optional)
Some butter
1/2 glass of White Wine or Champagne
Cream (You decide the quantity depending on how strong you want the taste, and how thick is your cream. I use about a wine glass full of single cream, but less will taste stronger of the rest of the ingredients).

Directions:
Peel the shallot and slice finely lengthwise.
Peel and chop the garlic finely.
In a small saucepan, melt about 2 teaspoons of butter, then add the onions and garlic.
Cover the pan and sweat on a low heat for 5 minutes.
Add the peppercorns and, optionally, the sage leaves.
Sweat for another 5 or 10 minutes until everything is soft (except, of course, the peppercorns!)
Add the white wine/champagne and mix throroughly.
Increase the heat and reduce the liquid without burning the rest.
When the liquid has all but disappeared, add the cream, stir well and warm it through.
Serve as an additional sauce rather than as a sauce that "floods" the rest of the plate.
