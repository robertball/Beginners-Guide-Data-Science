Ingredients:
2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
4 colves garlic, minced
1 rib celery, minced
1/2 shallots, minced
Knorr Garlic Herb Sauce Mix
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup white wine
1/4 cup lemon juice concentrated
1 tablespoon basil pesto
10 ounces calamari rings
1 tablespoon capers (optional)
1/2 cup frozen peas
6 taglierini pasta nests
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, vegetables, and cook until lightly brown. Blend in water, white wine, lemon juice, basil pesto, and garlic sauce mix. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir calamari, frozen peas, and capers into the sauce. Continue to simmer approximately 15 minutes, until squid is opaque. Check frequently to avoid overcooking squid. Serve squid and sauce over cooked pasta.

Description: 
I love light sauces over pasta and came up with this one with squid to go over Taglierini. I usually have on hand either fish or clam base and would substitute a broth for water. This goes good with a loaf of Italian bread for dipping into sauce.
