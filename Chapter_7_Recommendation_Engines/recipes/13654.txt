Ingredients:
12 fresh mushrooms
1/2 pound ground beef
1 tablespoon minced onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup bread crumbs
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon chili powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Remove and chop mushroom stems.
In a saucepan over medium heat, combine ground beef, onion, and garlic. Cook until beef is no longer pink; drain. Mix in chopped mushroom stems, 1 tablespoon butter, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in cream.
Dip mushroom caps in 1/4 cup melted butter, and stuff generously with meat mixture.  Arrange stuffed mushrooms in a baking dish. Sprinkle with chili powder.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven.

Description: 
An 18th Century recipe that I have altered slightly. Better make a double batch because these go fast. Sausage can be substituted for ground beef if you'd like.
