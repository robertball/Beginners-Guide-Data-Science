Ingredients:
12 ounces Frozen limeade concentrate, undiluted
3/4 cup Tequila (Jose Cuervo)
1/4 cup Triple Sec
6oz can Dole pineapple juice
Ice cubes
Lime slices

Directions:
Rub rim of cocktail glass with wedge of lime. Place salt (I like to mix salt and sugar) in saucer; spin rim of each glass in salt (Optional). Set prepared glasses aside. Combine limeade concentrate, tequila, and Triple Sec and pineapple juice in container of an electric blender. Add enough ice cubes to fill blender; blend well. Pour beverage into prepared glasses; garnish with a slice of lime, if desired.
Serve right away or perfect to make ahead and freeze for a frozen margarita.

Description: 
This is my favorite recipe for margaritas. The pineapple juice cuts the sour of the lime and sweetens the drink perfectly. If there is any extra just freeze it, it doesn't freeze solid because of the liquor and it's ready for you whenever you want a margarita. Even better make up a few batches ahead of time and freeze.  Perfect on a hot summer day!
