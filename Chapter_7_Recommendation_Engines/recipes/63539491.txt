Ingredients:
1 lb flank steak
1 egg beaten
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup water
vegetable oil
2/3 cup grated carrots
4 Tbps chopped ginger
4 cloves of garlic
2 Tbsp white vinegar
3 Tbsp soy sauce
2 Tbsp red wine vinegar
1 Tbsp sesame oil
1/2cup sugar
1/8 tsp Cayenne pepper

Directions:
Slice steak into narrow strips. Beat eggs. Dissolve cornstarch in water. Mix the beef with both the eggs and cornstarch mixture.
Pour oil into wok and heat. Add beef, a small amount at a time, separate and stir until crispy. Drain and set aside.
Combine soy sauce, red wine vinegar, white vinegar, sesame oil, sugar and cayenne together to form sauce. Set aside. (I will usually double and sometimes triple the sauce depending on how big of batch I make).
Put 1 Tbsp of oil into the wok. Add grated carrots, ginger, and garlic; stir fry over high heat. Add the sauce and bring to a boil. Add the beef and mix well. Serve over rice.
