Ingredients:
1 cup mashed banana;
1 cup sugar;
1/4 cup oil;
1/2 cup applesauce;
2 whole eggs;
2 cups flour;
1 teaspoon baking soda;
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon;
1/2 teaspoon salt;
1 cup grated carrot;
1/2 cup chopped walnuts;

Directions:
Combine banana, sugar, oil, applesauce and eggs.
Sift dry ingredients and fold into banana mixture, then add carrots and nuts.
Pour into a greased 9 x 5&quot; loaf pan and bake at 350ยบ for 55 minutes or until done.
Cool in pan on rack for 10 minutes, then remove from pan.
Cool thoroughly before slicing.
NOTES : Also good with coconut or raisins stirred in. I have also used almonds instead of walnuts. Makes 1 loaf.
A double batch fills 9 baby loaf pans - bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Makes great Christmas gifts.
