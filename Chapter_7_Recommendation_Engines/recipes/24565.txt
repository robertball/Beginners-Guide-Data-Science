Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup evaporated milk
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/4 cups pecan halves
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Generously grease a large slab or baking sheet.
In a saucepan over medium heat, combine brown sugar, white sugar and milk.  Bring to a boil.  Stir in butter, pecans and vanilla.  Heat, without stirring, to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.  Remove from heat and let cool 5 minutes.
Beat until thickened, then pour immediately onto prepared surface and let rest until firm and completely cool before cutting.
