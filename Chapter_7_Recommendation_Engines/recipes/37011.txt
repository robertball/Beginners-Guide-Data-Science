1 small onion, chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 (15.5 ounce) cans black-eyed peas

1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon hot sauce
1 (8 ounce) package hush puppy mix with onion

Directions:
SAUTEE onion in 1 tablespoon hot oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until tender.
PROCESS onion, 1 can of peas, and next 4 ingredients in a blender or food processor until mixture is smooth, stopping to scrape down sides. Stir in hush puppy mix, and gently fold in remaining can of peas.
SHAPE mixture by 2 tablespoonfuls into 3-inch patties, and place on a wax paper-lined baking sheet. Cover and chill 1 hour.
