Ingredients:
3 lbs. smoked ham, boiled and ground
1 lb. Velveeta Cheese (cubed)
1 8 oz. can tomato sauce
1 tsp. vinegar
2 Tbls. Minute Tapioca
2 Tbls. catsup
1 Tbls. Prepared mustard
1 tsp. Worcestershire Sauce

Directions:
After boiling the ham for 15 minutes or so, drain and grind the meat.  (I use a food chopper or blender.) Set aside.
Cook together: tomato sauce, vinegar, tapioca, catsup, prepared mustard and Worcestershire sauce until slightly thickened.  Add the Velveeta cheese to the cooked mixture and let melt.  Do not cook.
After cheese has melted, add the ground ham, mix thoroughly and chill.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite recipes.  My Mom, Lucy Wahnsiedler, used to make this when I was a kid.  I love the flavor of the spread and it is marvelous for making sandwiches or for spreading on crackers.  It is simply delicious!
