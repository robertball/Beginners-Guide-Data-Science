Ingredients:
2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1 pound cream cheese, softened
1 pound mascarpone cheese
4 eggs
Zest of 2 lemons
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 cup Sugar In The Raw®
1/2 cup Stevia In The Raw®
1 tablespoon vanilla
Edible flowers, for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil two 12-cup muffin tins. Cut parchment paper into twenty-four 5x1-inch strips and place one strip in each cup so it runs down the center.
In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs and butter and divide evenly between the muffin tins. Press the crust firmly into the bottom of the muffin cups.
In a large bowl, beat together cream cheese, mascarpone, eggs, lemon zest, lemon juice, Sugar In The Raw(R), Stevia In The Raw(R), and vanilla until completely smooth. Divide cheese mixture between muffin cups.
Bake cheesecakes until set, about 25 minutes, rotating the pans in the oven halfway through baking. Let cool completely in the pans, then use the parchment strips to lift the cheesecakes out. Refrigerate to chill completely.
