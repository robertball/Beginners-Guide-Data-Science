Ingredients:
1 cup corn
1 large tomato, sliced
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and halved
6 cloves garlic, halved
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can fire-roasted tomatoes
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 lime, juiced

Directions:
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Place corn, sliced tomato, jalapeno pepper, garlic, and olive oil in a large bowl and toss to lightly coat. Spread oiled ingredients on a baking sheet.
Broil in the preheated oven until vegetables begin to char, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
Transfer charred ingredients to a food processor and add black beans, fire-roasted tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, salt, and lime juice; blend to desired consistency.

Description: 
This charred corn salsa came about when I wanted to make use of some leftover ingredients after making a Mexican dish the night before. Broiling a few of the ingredients up front and using fire-roasted tomatoes gives it a nice smoky flavor. The recipe as-is will yield a salsa on the spicier side of mild. Alter the spice level by increasing or decreasing chili powder to taste. Serve with chips or use in any recipe that calls for salsa.
