Ingredients:
6 pounds pork spareribs
1 1/2 cups ketchup
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup vinegar
1/2 cup honey
1/3 cup soy sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground mustard
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Cut ribs into serving-size pieces; place with the meaty side up on racks in two greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pans. Cover tightly with foil. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/4 hours or until meat is tender.
Drain; remove racks and return ribs to pans. Combine remaining ingredients; pour over ribs. Return to the oven, uncovered, for 35 minutes or until sauce coats ribs, basting occasionally. Ribs can also be grilled over medium-hot heat for the last 35 minutes instead of baking.
