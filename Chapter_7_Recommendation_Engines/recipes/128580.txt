Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped pecans (optional)
1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough, thawed
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 (3.5 ounce) package cook and serve butterscotch pudding mix
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Grease a 9-inch Bundt pan, and sprinkle the pecans into the bottom of the pan.
Cut the thawed bread dough in half, and cut each half into 8 pieces. Roll the 16 dough pieces into balls, and place them into the pan on top of the nuts.
Mix the melted butter and brown sugar together in a bowl, and set aside. Sprinkle the butterscotch pudding mix over the rolls, then sprinkle on the cinnamon. Pour the butter mixture over the rolls, cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap, refrigerate, and let the rolls rise for 6 to 8 hours, or overnight.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Remove the plastic wrap from the pan, and bake the rolls for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown.
