Ingredients:
10 cans refrigerated pizza dough
1/4 pounds provolone cheese (sliced)
1 jar Ragu Sauce (1 lb. 8 oz)
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (about 4 oz)
1/4 cups grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400Â°. Roll pizza dough into 15 x 11-inch rectangle. Layer provolone cheese over dough, leaving a 1-inch border around edges. Evenly spread 1 cup Pasta Sauce over cheese, then evenly sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.
2. Roll, starting at the longest end, jelly-roll style. Fold in ends and pinch to seal. Arrange stromboli seam-side down on the ungreased baking sheet.
3. Bake 20 minutes or until bread is golden. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with remaining Pasta Sauce, heated.
