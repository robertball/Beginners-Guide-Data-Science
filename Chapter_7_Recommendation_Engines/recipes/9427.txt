Ingredients:
1 pound butter
2 cups white sugar
12 egg yolks
1 teaspoon salt
4 cups warm milk
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
20 cups all-purpose flour
16 ounces honey
3 1/4 cups hot milk
3 1/2 cups white sugar
12 egg whites
5 pounds ground walnuts

Directions:
Beat butter, 2 cups sugar, and egg yolks. Dissolve yeast in 4 cups of warm milk. Add salt. Combine with flour and knead until dough is no longer sticky. Cut into 14 equal pieces. Place on floured wax paper and cover with tea towels, let rise while making nut filling.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine honey, 3 1/4 cups hot milk, 3 1/2 cups white sugar, egg whites and ground walnuts.
Roll out one piece of dough into a large rectangle about 3/4 inch thick and spread with about 1 1/4 cups filling. Roll up jellyroll fashion and place on cookie sheet, seam side down. Brush with an egg wash (1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water). Repeat with remaining dough. You may bake 2 rolls on a sheet. Bake 35 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe is time consuming to make, but worth the effort. The rolls freeze well when wrapped securely with foil. You will have enough to feed an Army, but it will disappear quickly!
