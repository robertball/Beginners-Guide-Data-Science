Ingredients:
• 2 cups rice (any kind white or brown)
• 2 pieces (4 ounces each) fresh tuna
• 1/4 cup olive oil plus extra to drizzle
• 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice or white wine vinegar
• 2 green onions, sliced
• 1-2 tablespoons capers, drained
• 1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
• 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil, plus whole leaves for garnish
• Sea salt and pepper

Directions:
Follow the instructions to the rice you will be using in this dish. Remove from the heat keeping covered and let stand until completely cool, at least 1 hour. Separate grains with a fork.
Take each piece of tuna and drizzle olive oil and season with salt and pepper on each side.
Take a Le Creuset Iron handle skillet and heat to a high temperature. Once hot add about 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Place tuna on hot pan and sear for 2 minutes, flip then grill for another 2-3 minutes (depending on the thickness). Remove from heat and set on a clean surface for cutting. Cut into small pieces
In a large serving bowl add rice, tuna, lemon juice or white wine vinegar, capers, green scallions, parsley, basil then combine using 2 large spoons. Taste for additional salt or pepper.
Drizzle with your best olive oil, garnish with fresh herbs and let your guests serve themselves.

Description: 
This is such a yummy salad! You can use white, brown or your favorite style rice! You can also substitute with spaghetti squash or zucchini noodles to make this fit your diet or lifestyle if on the Paleo Diet. I make this for lunch when I have my girlfriends over and we all enjoy this dish so much! (So much better than a sandwich).
Give my Rice Salad with Tuna, Capers and Herbs. You can also add cherry tomatoes to this salad  just cut them in 1/2!
