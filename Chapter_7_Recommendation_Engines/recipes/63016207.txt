Whet the beets are cooked, drain the water, let them cool down and then peel and shred the beets.
Mix the beet with prunes and add the pressed garlic (optional). Season the salad and add the olive oil. Mix everything very well.

***Tip from Helen*** If you want the salad to be more creamy and you aren’t vegan or vegetarian – then you can add some mayo instead of olive oil!

Description: 
eets are like Cinderella, we think that they are not as delish as they are, we  rarely cook them and generally, we think that this it is not essential for us. But in reality, there’s much more to it than we think.
Beets provide antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and detoxification support.In recent lab studies on human tumor cells, betanin pigments from beets have been shown to lessen tumor cell growth Beets also possess fiber-related benefit, so next time when you pass the beets in a vegetable aisle, grab couple for the salad or soup.
