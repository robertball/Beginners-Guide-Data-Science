Ingredients:
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
2 eggs
1/3 cup buttermilk
1/3 cup butter, melted
1 tablespoon molasses
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup white sugar
1 cup canned pumpkin
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin-pan cups, 2 1/4 inches in diameter.
Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger onto wax paper.
Beat together the eggs, buttermilk, melted butter, molasses, vanilla, sugar and pumpkin in a large bowl. Stir in the dry ingredients, all at once, just until moistened. Fold in the nuts. Spoon into the prepared muffin-pan cups, filling almost to the top.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in the centers comes out clean. Remove the muffins from the cups and cool on wire racks. Serve warm.
