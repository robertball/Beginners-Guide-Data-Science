Ingredients:
3/4 cup unsalted butter
4 large lemons
3 cups sugar
6 large eggs, lightly beaten

Directions:
Grate rind of lemons, then juice lemons and strain out seeds.
Meanwhile, melt butter in the top of a double boiler.
Stir in lemon juice and grated peel, sugar, and eggs.
Continue to stir constantly over simmering water until curd thickens.  (Don't worry if it seems thinner than the storebought kind, it will thicken more in the jars).  Ladle into hot 1/2 pint jars and process 10 minutes in a boiling water bath (or the length of time recommended by your local extension center).

Description: 
We think this lemon curd is even tastier than the storebought kind.  The jars are a beautiful sunny color and make lovely gifts.  It is great with scones, on toast, or on top of orange or lemon pound cake.
