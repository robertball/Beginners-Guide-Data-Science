Ingredients:
5 cups all-purpose flour
1 envelope onion soup mix
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
3 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons salt
2 cups warm water (120 to 130 degrees F)
2 tablespoons shortening
1 egg white
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups flour, soup mix, yeast, sugar and salt; add warm water and shortening. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; knead 4-5 times. Divide in half. Roll each portion into a 14-in.x 6-in. rectangle. Roll up, jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch edges and ends to seal. Place seam side down on a greased baking sheet. Beat egg white and water; brush over loaves. Cover with plastic wrap that has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray; let rise until doubled, about 30-40 minutes. With a sharp knife, make four shallow diagonal cuts across the top. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
Holiday meals are even more memorable when I complement them with this chewy onion bread. Day-old slices taste great with soup and sandwich fillings, too.
