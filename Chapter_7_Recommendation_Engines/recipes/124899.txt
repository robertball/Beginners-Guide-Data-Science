Ingredients:
3 (15 ounce) cans sliced beets
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup vinegar
12 teaspoons salt
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 tablespoons ketchup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
25 whole cloves, tied in a cheesecloth bag

Directions:
Drain the beets, reserving 1-1/2 cups of juice in a large saucepan. Add cornstarch to juice and mix well. Add beets and remaining ingredients; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until the sauce is slightly thickened, stirring often. Remove the spice bag. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Description: 
I really didn't like beets until my mother made these. When I've served them to guests or taken them to a gathering, many people have told me how much they like them. The combination of ingredients may sound a bit unusual, but they really taste good together.
