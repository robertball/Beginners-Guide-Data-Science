Ingredients:
4 5-ounce fresh or frozen skinless salmon filets
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 T fresh lime juice
1 T grated fresh ginger
1/2 t. toasted sesame oil
2 T sesame seeds, toasted
lime wedges (optional)

Directions:
Thaw fish, if frozen.  Rinse fish; pat dry with paper towels.  Measure thickness of fish.  Place fish in a shallow dish.  For marinade, in a small bowl, combine soy sauce, lime juice, ginger., and sesame oil.  Pour marinade over fish; turn to coat.  Cover and marinade in the refrigerator for 2 hours, turning fish occasionally.  Drain fish, discarding marinade.
Preheat grill, reduce heat to medium.  Place fish on greased grill rack.  Sprinkle fish with sesame seeds.  Cover and grill for 7 to 9 minutes per 1/2-inch thickness of fish or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.  If desired, serve with lime wedges.
TIP: To toast sesame seeds, place them in a small heavy skillet over low heat and cook them for about 7 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently, until they're golden brown and fragant.
