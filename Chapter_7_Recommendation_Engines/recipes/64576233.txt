Ingredients:
1 whole garlic head
12 ounces baby red beets
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon water
2 teaspoons fresh orange juice
1 teaspoon red wine vinegar
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
4 cups baby spinach
4 cups torn Lacinato kale
1 thick applewood-smoked bacon slice, chopped
1 cup fresh orange segments

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Remove white papery skin from garlic head (do not peel/separate cloves). Wrap head in foil. Arrange beets on large sheet of foil; wrap tightly.
Bake garlic and beets at 350 degrees for 1 hour or until beets are tender; cool 10 minutes. Separate garlic cloves; squeeze to extract pulp. Discard skins.
Combine garlic pulp, oil, and next 5 ingredients (through pepper) in a small bowl, stirring with a whisk.
Place spinach and kale in a large bowl.
Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Add bacon; cook 5 minutes or until crisp. Increase heat to high. Stir in garlic mixture; remove from heat. Pour hot bacon mixture over kale mixture, stirring to coat.
Peel beets and discard skins. Cut beets in half. Arrange beets and oranges over kale mixture.
