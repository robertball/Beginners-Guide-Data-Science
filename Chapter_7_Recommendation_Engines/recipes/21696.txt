1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan.
In a large bowl, stir together cake mix and pudding mix. Make a well in the center and pour in oil, eggs, sour cream and juice.  Beat on low speed until blended. Scrape bowl, and beat 2 minutes on medium speed. Stir in the poppy seeds.
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool 15 minutes in the pan.  Remove from pan, then sprinkle with confectioners' sugar before serving.
