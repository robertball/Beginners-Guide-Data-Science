Ingredients:
2 Tbls. butter
2 onions, chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
49 oz. can chicken broth
48 oz. jar Randal's Great Northern Beans, with juice
28 oz. can Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies
2 (11 oz.) cans white shoepeg corn, with liquid
1 can Cream of Chicken Soup, undiluted
2 Tbls. Cumin
1 Tbls. Oregano
2 Tbls. Cilantro, dried or fresh
2 - 4 teaspoons chili powder, to taste
4 large chicken breasts
2 cups shredded Monterey Jack Cheese

Directions:
In a skillet or small saucepan, melt the butter with the onions and garlic. Saute just until the onions and garlic are soft, but not browned. Place that in your large crockpot. Add the next nine ingredients and stir to combine. Add your chicken breasts, pushing down into the soup mixture. Cook in the crockpot for 8 hours on Low (or 4 hours on High). Remove chicken breasts and shred. Return chicken to soup. Serve in bowls with Monterey Jack Cheese shredded on top.
**Instead of using a crockpot, you can precook and shred the chicken then just dump everything into a large stockpot. Heat for 10 minutes and serve.

Description: 
This is a delicious soup that we love on a cold fall or winter day. I came up with this version after trying several other recipes and finally combining our favorites parts of each. We think it's a winner! I serve it with hot crusty bread.
