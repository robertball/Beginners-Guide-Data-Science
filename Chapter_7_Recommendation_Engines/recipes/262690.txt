Ingredients:
2 cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour (such as Bob's Red MillÂ®)
1 cup coconut sugar
2/3 cup cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
3/4 cup buttermilk
1 (6 ounce) container plain fat-free Greek yogurt
3/4 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 tablespoon sliced almonds, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
Combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt together in a bowl. Fold in chocolate chips.
Combine buttermilk, yogurt, oil, eggs, vinegar, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Add the flour mixture and mix well. Batter should be thick; scoop into the prepared muffin cups using a tablespoon until about 3/4-full. Sprinkle sliced almonds on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed and centers are still moist and gooey, 17 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
Easy and fast. Rich but not too rich, using Greek yogurt. Sweet, but not too sweet. Using coconut sugar is a lower-glycemic alternative to sugar. Or so I've read. Deep-dark and satisfying for the choc-o-holics in all of us. A recipe I have worked over and over to perfect. This being the best thus far. Best when cooled down and chips have firmed again. Depends on your likes.
