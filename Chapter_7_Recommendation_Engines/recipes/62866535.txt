Ingredients:
3 whole slicing tomatoes, chopped
1 can (99% fat free) chicken broth
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon butter
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1/8 teaspoon rosemary
1/4 cup fat free milk (or 1/8 cup cream)
1 teaspoon lite sour cream (garnish)
1/2 avocado (garnish)

Directions:
If you dislike tomato skin, blanche the tomatoes to remove the skin first. Slice the tomatoes into big chunks. Combine the tomato slices, chicken broth, sugar, butter, basil, and rosemary in a pot and cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes (until the tomatoes have mostly boiled down).
When tomatoes have boiled down, add milk.
Garnish with a dollop of lite sour cream and diced avocado

Description: 
A neighbor gives me the biggest, most delicious tomatoes from his garden every summer. Being the tomato soup connoisseur that I am, I wanted to create a soup that allowed me to use all those tomatoes, was healthy, and tasted great, too. :) Voila, Rikki's Creamy Tomato Basil Soup was born!
