Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup milk
1 1/2 cups warm water
2 cups shortening for frying

Directions:
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Pour in milk; mix thoroughly. Pour in warm water gradually, kneading dough until soft but not sticky. Cover with plastic wrap and let dough rest, about 15 minutes.
Pinch off egg-shaped balls of dough and place on a flat work surface. Roll out into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Make a small hole in the center of each round.
Melt shortening in a deep fryer or large saucepan. Working in batches, fry dough rounds in hot shortening until bubbly and golden, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.

Description: 
Best fry bread ever! Can be used as the base for Navajo Tacos, which are layered like tacos: fry bread, cheese, taco meat, cheese, onion, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. My kids also like it with honey or cinnamon and sugar.
