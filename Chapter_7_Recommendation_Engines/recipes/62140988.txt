and membrane, then either pipe or spoon some of the cheese mixture into each jalapeno
In a separate bowl, mix together the milk and eggs
Holding the peppers by the stem, dredge the peppers in the egg mixture, then in the flour.

Description: 
These poppers are always requested when my boyfriend and I have our football parties.  They have the perfect combination of flavors on the inside, and a wonderfully crispiness on the outside, and so easy to make!  I hope you enjoy them as much as we do!!
