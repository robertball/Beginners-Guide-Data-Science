Ingredients:
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into cubes
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 cup broccoli florets
1  red bell pepper, sliced
½ cup sliced mushrooms
1 tablespoon cornstarch
½ cup water
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
½ cup cubed jicama

Directions:
Mix chicken with ground ginger, black pepper, garlic salt, and sesame oil in a bowl; cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook broccoli, bell pepper, and mushrooms in the boiling water until broccoli is just tender, about 3 minutes; drain.
Whisk cornstarch and 1/2 cup water together in bowl.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chicken until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
