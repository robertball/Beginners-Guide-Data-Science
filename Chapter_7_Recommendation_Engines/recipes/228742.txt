Description: 
I use bacon instead of ham and frozen hash brown potatoes in this pea soup. It's a good winter comfort food and  smells wonderful while cooking. It freezes well, so when my husband and I  are busy all day, its a quick dinner for us.  I add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit. You can also cook whole bacon strips in the microwave until lightly browned. Transfer to paper towels and let cool; crush or tear into small pieces.
