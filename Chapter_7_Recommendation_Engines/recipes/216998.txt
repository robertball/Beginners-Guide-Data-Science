Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked quinoa, rinsed
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
8 spears fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 cup raisins
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 tablespoon lemon juice
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring the quinoa and chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender about 15 minutes. Turn off the heat, and let the remaining liquid absorb into the quinoa.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, onion, and red bell pepper; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the asparagus, mushrooms, raisins, and ginger; continue cooking until the asparagus is tender. Stir in the shrimp, and cook until the shrimp have turned pink and are no longer translucent in the center.
Stir the lemon juice into the quinoa, then toss the quinoa with the shrimp and vegetable mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
