Ingredients:
2 ripe bananas peeled and frozen in ziplock bags.
1/8 cup peanut butter
1/8 cup soy milk (can be replaced with rice milk or almond milk)

Directions:
Cut frozen bananas into 8 pieces. Run them in food processor using the chopping blade until they are in very small pieces (about 30 seconds).  Add peanut butter and run for about 10 seconds.  Slowly pour in milk while processor is running until you have a thick creamy mixture.  Do not add too much milk.  The shake should be thick enough to eat with a spoon.

Description: 
This is a delicious dairy free frozen treat.  The peanut butter can be replaced with either frozen or fresh fruit (strawberries, peaches, mangoes...)  If fresh fruit is used in the recipe you should reduce the amount of milk.
