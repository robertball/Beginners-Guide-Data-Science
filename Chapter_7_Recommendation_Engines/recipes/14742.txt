Ingredients:
4 pounds pork spareribs
1 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup fresh sliced mushrooms
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons honey
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon prepared mustard
2 teaspoons salt
ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup soy sauce
2/3 cup water
1/3 cup chili sauce

Directions:
Cut ribs into serving size pieces and place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a medium saucepan saute onion, garlic and mushrooms in oil until tender. Add vinegar, honey, lime juice, mustard, salt, pepper, soy sauce, water and chili sauce and mix together well. Warm mixture throughout.
Pour this sauce over the ribs and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour or until ribs are tender and internal temperature has reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Baste often with sauce.

Description: 
A honey mustard lime sauce coats these baked ribs. Scrumptious! When determining the number of servings, take into account the fact that most people actually like to have a rack of ribs to themselves. Accordingly, 4 pounds of spareribs might serve 4 or 6 people, depending on the serving size!
