Ingredients:
1 1/2 to 2 Roma tomatoes, diced
1/4 of an onion, diced (1/4 to 1/3 depending on size)
2 t jalapeno, minced
2 1/2 to 3 T cilantro, chopped
1/2 t salt
1/8 t pepper
1/8 t garlic powder
1 t olive oil
1 t white vinegar
lime juice to taste

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together in large container until well blended.
Can use right away if desired, but allowing it to sit for at least 6 hours or overnight is even better.

Description: 
This is a cloned recipe - probably from El Torito or Chevys, but can't remember which.  My absolute favorite. Increase or decrease tomatoes depending on amount of meat - can use white or red onion (I like white), and again, adjust to taste and visual appeal.
