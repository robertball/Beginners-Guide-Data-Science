Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) boneless ham
1/3 cup bourbon whiskey
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple in juice
1/2 cup honey
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 cups water
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple rings

Directions:
Score the surface of the ham, making diamond shapes about 1/2-inch deep. Place the ham in a large, resealable bag. Add the bourbon, brown sugar, crushed pineapple, honey, and garlic to the bag; refrigerate at least 8 hours, turning the bag over several times while marinating.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Transfer the ham and marinade to a large baking dish; pour the water into the dish. Attach the pineapple rings around the surface of the ham with toothpicks.
Bake in preheated oven until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (95 degrees C), basting occasionally with the sauce in the pan, 90 to 105 minutes.

This is a delicious combo of about five recipes I found while researching for my first Thanksgiving ham. The empty baking pan afterwards was my best compliment!
