Ingredients:
10  chicken thighs
2 cups distilled white vinegar
1 cup all-purpose flour for coating
½ teaspoon salt and pepper to taste
¼ cup oil for frying
1 (12 ounce) jar sliced jalapeno peppers, with liquid

Directions:
Place chicken thighs in a shallow baking dish. Pour vinegar over, cover and let marinate overnight.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserving 1/4 cup of the vinegar. Coat the chicken with flour, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
Fry chicken in the hot oil until the outside is lightly crisp. Remove from heat, and place chicken into a 9x13 inch baking dish lined with aluminum foil. Add 1/4 cup of vinegar to the pan, and pour the entire jar of jalapenos over the chicken. Cover the pan with foil.
Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until chicken is no longer pink, and the juices run clear.
