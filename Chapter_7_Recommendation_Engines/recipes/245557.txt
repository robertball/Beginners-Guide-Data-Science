Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
2 cups rolled oats
1 cup chopped dried mixed fruit
2/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
1/2 cup sunflower seeds
1/3 cup flaxseed meal
1/4 cup chia seeds
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 tablespoons hot water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix whole wheat flour, oats, dried fruit, brown sugar, coconut, sunflower seeds, flaxseed meal, chia seeds, vanilla extract, and salt together in a large bowl.
Melt butter and honey together in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 2 minutes.
Dissolve baking soda in hot water in a small bowl; add to the butter mixture and mix well.
Pour butter mixture over flour mixture; mix well to combine. Spoon tablespoons of mixture into ungreased mini muffin pans and flatten tops slightly.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 10 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
My take on Aussie Bites™ with a little more added to them. Use a mix of chopped dried fruits such as raisins, dates, figs, cranberries, etc.
