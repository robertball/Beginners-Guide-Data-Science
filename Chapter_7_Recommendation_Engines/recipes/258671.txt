Ingredients:
3 tomatoes, seeded and cubed
1 bunch fresh basil leaves, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups cubed mozzarella cheese
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
cooking spray
12 empanada pastry discs
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon sesame seeds

Directions:
Combine tomatoes and basil in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Mix in mozzarella cheese and olive oil. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top. Let marinate at room temperature, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets with cooking spray.
Arrange pastry discs on a flat work surface. Dab a little water around the rims. Place a large tablespoonful of the tomato mixture in the center; fold pastry over and press with a fork to seal.
Transfer empanadas to the prepared baking trays. Brush mustard over tops; sprinkle sesame seeds over mustard.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
