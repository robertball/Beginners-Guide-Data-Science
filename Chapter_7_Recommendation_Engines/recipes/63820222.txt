Description: 
Among the fond memories of visiting apple orchards in the Fall are of course all the great apple products that can be made after the trip. From sauces, to pies, to desserts, to salads, apples are incredibly versatile as a key ingredient. Today's recipe is a great treat I've come to love after those trips to the orchard: apple butter.
