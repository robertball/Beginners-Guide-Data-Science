Ingredients:
2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 3 big breasts)
1 1/2 cups water
kosher salt
black pepper
3/4 cup mayonnaise (more or less to taste)
1 tablespoon Dijon (more or less to taste)
3 stalks of celery, diced

Directions:
In a deep saute pan, place the chicken breasts in the water.  Sprinkle kosher salt and black pepper on top of the chicken, and add some salt to the water (1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon).  Turn the heat to high, bring to a boil, then immediately cover and turn to medium-low.  Let it simmer for 6 - 8 minutes, then flip the chicken over and season the other side.  Bring to a boil once more, then cover and turn to medium low.  Simmer for 6 - 8 more minutes.  Check for doneness by cutting into one of the breasts.  If still raw inside, flip and cook a little longer until done.
Remove the pan from the heat and allow the chicken to cool for about 30 minutes.
In a large bowl, shred the cooked chicken with two forks.  Add the mayonnaise, Dijon, celery, and adjust the seasonings to taste.  Refrigerate until chilled.

Description: 
A classic style chicken salad.  Good on its own or to use as a base for different mix-ins.  Try fruit, nuts, or different spices!  Poaching the chicken keeps it moist and gives it just the right texture.
