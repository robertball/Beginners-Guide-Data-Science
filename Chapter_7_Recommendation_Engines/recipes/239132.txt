Ingredients:
1 pound fresh green beans
1 small onion, sliced
2 slices bacon, cut into quarters, or more to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 pinch salt-free seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash), or to taste
1 portobello mushroom, sliced

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Combine green beans, onion, and bacon in a bowl. Drizzle olive oil over green beans mixture and season with seasoning blend; stir to coat. Transfer green beans mixture to a grilling basket or wok.
Place green beans mixture on the preheated grill and cook, stirring every 10 minutes, until tender, about 30 minutes. Add mushroom to green beans mixture and cook until tender, about 10 minutes more.
