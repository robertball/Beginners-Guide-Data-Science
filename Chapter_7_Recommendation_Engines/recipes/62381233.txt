Ingredients:
5 chicken breasts on the bone with skin, trimmed of excess fat (each should weigh about 1 ½ pounds)
5 lemon slices
5 large dill sprigs
2 teaspoons minced garlic, divided
¼ teaspoon salt, divided
¼ teaspoon freshly ground pepper, divided
1 large red bell pepper
1 large orange bell pepper
1 large yellow bell pepper
1 large green bell pepper
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Preheat the broiler.
Divide lemon slices, dill, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper and place under the skin of each breast.
Set chicken skin side up on a nonstick broiler pan and place on a rack 4 inches from heat. Broil until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Turn chicken over and continue to cook 5 to 7 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of chicken registers 170°F. Remove it to a plate.
While chicken is cooking, cut all of the peppers into ½-inch-wide strips. In a medium bowl, toss red, orange, yellow, and green peppers with oil, remaining 1 teaspoon minced garlic, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.
After you remove chicken, scatter peppers in single layer on the (uncleaned) broiler pan and broil 3 minutes. Stir peppers, re-spread, and continue cooking 2 to 3 minutes until tender.
Place 1 chicken breast and ½ cup of cooked peppers in a covered container and refrigerate until ready to prepare lunch.
Divide remaining peppers and chicken breasts among four dinner plates. Remove skin before eating to keep the fat content low.
