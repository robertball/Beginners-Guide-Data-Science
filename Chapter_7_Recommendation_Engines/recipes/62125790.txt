Ingredients:
INGREDIENTS - SERVES 18
CAKE:-
* 2-1/2 cups white sugar
* 1-1/2 cups butter - room temperature
* 7 eggs
* 1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1-1/2 cups coconut milk
* 3-1/4 cups all-purpose flour (sifted)
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 1-1/2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1-1/2 teaspoons salt
* (optional) 1-1/2 cup dessicated/flaked coconut (I omitted this, but if you wish to add coconut inside cake, omit 1/4 cup of flour, and add coconut)
GLAZE:-
* 1/2 cup coconut cream
* 1/2 cup sweetened coconut cream
LIME CREAM ICING:-
* 2 1/4 cup whipping cream
* 9 TBS icing sugar - sifted
* 3 tsp grated lime zest
* 6 tsp lime juice
* 3 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
DIRECTIONS:- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 x 10inch (25cm) spring form pans. This is essential, as cakes will stick. Line the bottoms                                 with a circle of baking paper.
Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt together and set aside.
Cut Butter into cubes and place in a large bowl. Add sugar, and cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, best done with hand mixer. Add eggs one at a time; beat well so it is incorporate completely before adding next egg. Mix in vanilla extract.
With a spatula, fold in small amount of flour mixture alternately with coconut milk, taking care not to over-beat, but ensuring it is well incorporated.                                                         (Over-beating causes cake to have "tunnels")
If you wish to add dessicated/flaked coconut, fold it in at this stage.
Split mixture in half and pour batter into prepared spring-form pans.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 mins, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.
GLAZE:- Mix equal parts of coconut cream and sweetened condensed milk.
After taking the hot cakes out of the pans, use a chopstick to poke holes evenly over the top in rows, taking care not to poke all the way through to the bottom.
Using a pastry brush, paint the coconut cream/condensed milk glaze over the tops of each hot layer.
Cake can be eaten that day, however, once the cake comes to room temperature, it can be covered with cling film, and placed in the fridge for serving the next day or the day after. This gives the glaze time to flavour and moisten the cake.
LIME CREAM:- Whip cream to soft peaks and gradually add sifted icing sugar while beating. Keep whipping until cream holds a peak when beaters are lifted. Fold in lime juice, vanilla extract and lime zest.
TO ASSEMBLE:- Dollop a third of the cream onto the cooled cake and spread evenly. Place second cake layer on top and evenly spread the other two thirds of the lime cream over the top and sides. Sprinkle or sift the flaked or toasted coconut over the top and sides. Cake looks gorgeous when decorated with thinly sliced lime crescents and twists of lime.

Description: 
This is a two layered coconut cake that is slathered with unctuous lime cream and sprinkled with coconut. I made this gorgeous cake for my mother's 50th birthday. It was a great hit at the party! Every guest begged for the recipe, and the groans of delight were worth the calories! The the glaze creates a moist and perfect texture, not too coconutty, and the lime cream is the perfect accompaniment. This cake is best made a day or two before serving for the glaze to sink in, and then frosted/decorated on the day of eating with the lime cream.
