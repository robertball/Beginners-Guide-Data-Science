Ingredients:
16 large shrimp, peeled, deveined and butterflied with tail on
1/2 cup cornstarch
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1 cup flaked unsweetened coconut
2 packets sucralose
3 egg whites
1 teaspoon coconut extract
salt and pepper to taste
cooking spray
Sauce
8oz canned crushed pineapple with juice
1/2 teaspoon chili garlic sauce
1 packet sucralose
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In one bowl add cornstarch.
In another bowl add egg whites and coconut extract; beat until almost forming peaks but not quite.
In another bowl combine panko bread crumbs, coconut flakes and sucralose.
One at a time dredge shrimp in cornstarch, then egg white mixture and finally in panko and coconut mixture.  Set aside on a plate.  Repeat until all shrimp are breaded.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper if desired.
Spray shrimp completely on both sides with cooking spray.
Bake in preheated oven for about 10 minutes flipping shrimp halfway during cooking time.
Meanwhile while shrimp is baking combine pineapple, garlic chili sauce and sucralose in food processor or blender.  Blend until completely smooth.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
Serve shrimp with dipping sauce immediately after baking.

Description: 
I love the big succulent coconut shrimp found at a popular restaurant.  Unfortunately due to health reasons I can't indulge in that shrimp anymore.  I created a recipe that satisfies my craving and tastes just as indulgent but without the guilt!
