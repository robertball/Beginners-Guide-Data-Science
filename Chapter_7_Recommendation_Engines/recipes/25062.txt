Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting
1 cup chocolate flavored confectioners coating

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the vanilla and then the flour to form a soft dough. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls. Place the cookies 2 inches apart onto the cookie sheet. Flatten each cookie to 1/4 inch thick using the bottom of a glass dipped in confectioners' sugar.
Bake for 8 to 10  minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges are just beginning to brown. Do not over cook. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
Melt the coating chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave, stirring frequently until smooth. Spread chocolate onto the bottom of each cookie. Place cookies chocolate side down onto waxed paper until set.
