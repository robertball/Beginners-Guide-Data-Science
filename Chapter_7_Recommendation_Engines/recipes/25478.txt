Preheat grill for high heat.
In a large bowl, combine the new potatoes, sweet potato, Vidalia onions, green beans, rosemary, and thyme. Stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, and pepper to coat.
Using 2 to 3 layers of foil, create desired number of foil packets. Brush inside surfaces of packets liberally with remaining olive oil. Distribute vegetable mixture evenly among the packets. Seal tightly.
Place packets on the preheated grill. Cook 30 minutes, turning once, or until potatoes are tender.
