Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate
1/3 cup cocoa powder
1 cup butter, at room temperature
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
frosting

Directions:
Heat the oven to 350°F Grease and flour two 9-inch round pans and set them aside.
In a microwave-safe, liquid measuring cup, measure 1 1/2 cups water.
Add the unsweetened chocolate squares to the water.
Microwave for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring after 1 1/2 minutes or until the chocolate has melted.
Stir in the cocoa and set the mixture aside.
In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter for 1 minute, add the granulated and brown sugars, and cream for another 2 minutes or until light and fluffy.
Add the eggs individually, beating well after each one.
Beat in the vanilla extract.
In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
Beginning with about a third of the flour mixture, add the flour mixture and the chocolate mixture alternately to the butter, stirring well after each addition.
Divide the cake batter evenly between the two pans, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula.
Place the pans on the middle oven rack and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cakes comes out clean.
