Slow Cooker Taco Soup Recipe

Ingredients:
2 chicken legs
2 chicken thighs, bone-in
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can hominy, drained
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
3 cups water
2 (14.5 ounce) cans of Rotel
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix

Directions:
Place all the ingredients in a large crockpot and cook for 8 hours on low.
At the end of eight hours, remove the chicken and shred the chicken off the bone (this should be pretty easy since the meat is practically falling off the bone after cooking so long). Return the shredded chicken into the crockpot.
Serve and enjoy! I like to garnish with some sour cream and a lemon wedge.
