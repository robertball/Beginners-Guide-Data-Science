Description: 
Beginning with my Fast Chicken Soup Base it is easy to knock hours off of the cooking time usually needed for homemade chicken soup and still end up with soup that tastes even better than the 'from scratch' method. With a little creativity you can easily make two varieties of these soul-satisfying meals.
