1/2 cup natural creamy peanut butter
1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup rice milk

Description: 
These are not going to be as amazing as the No Bake Cookies made with sugar, but they still satisfy a sweet tooth.  A lot of recipes add vanilla, so it might be worth adding 1/2 - 1 tsp.
