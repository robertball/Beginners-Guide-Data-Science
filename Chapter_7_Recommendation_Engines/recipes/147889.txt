Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 pounds lean ground turkey
2 onions, chopped
2 zucchinis, diced
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
3 (28 ounce) cans diced unsalted tomatoes, with liquid
3 (15 ounce) cans BUSH'S® Black Beans, drained and rinsed
2 ounces bittersweet chocolate
For Garnish:
1 cup sour cream
1 cup grated Cheddar cheese
Diced jalapenos
Baked tortilla chips

Directions:
In a large, heavy pot or a large enameled cast-iron casserole dish, set over medium-high heat, heat the oil.
Add the ground turkey and cook, breaking the turkey with a wooden spoon and  stirring, until browned, about 5 minutes.   With a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl and set aside.
Add the onions and zucchini to the pot and cook over medium heat, stirring  occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about 6-8 minutes.
Add the garlic, chili, cumin, oregano, salt, and black pepper and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
Add the turkey, tomatoes with the liquid, beans and chocolate, stir until chocolate melts. Simmer the chili over low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Serve the garnishes in individual bowls as a toppings bar, or serve individually, topping each bowl with a dollop of sour cream, sprinkle of cheese and scallions. Kids can crumble tortilla chips on top.
