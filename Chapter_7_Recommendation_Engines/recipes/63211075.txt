Ingredients:
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons light corn syrup or maple syrup
1/2 to 1 cup chopped pecans, optional
12 slices any thick-sliced bread, divided use - cubed six and six
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
(1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, optional)
6 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk or fat-free evaporated milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Spray a 13" x 9" by 2" pan with non-stick spray. Set aside. In a small saucepan, bring the brown sugar, butter and syrup to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and pour into the prepared pan. (If using pecans, sprinkle them over the caramel.) Top with six slices of bread, cubed. Combine sugar, (optional nutmeg,) and cinnamon; sprinkle half over the bread. Place remaining bread cubes on top. Sprinkle with remaining spiced-sugar; set aside.
In a large bowl, beat the eggs, milk, salt and vanilla. Pour over bread. Cover and refrigerate for  8 hours or overnight.
Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes, then stir caramel sauce up from bottom through the bread mixture to distribute. Bake 5 - 10 minutes longer or as needed to set. (If mixture appears to be browning too quickly, recover with foil and finish baking.)
