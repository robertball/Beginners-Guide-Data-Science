Directions:
1. Oven should be at 450 degrees.
2. Sift the flour and salt into a bowl.
3. Make a well in the center and add the milk and water gradually, beating with a wooden spoon.
4. In a separate bowl, beat eggs until fluffy. Add to flour mixture. Beat until bubbles rise to the surface.
5. Refrigerate batter for 1/2 hour.
6. After your Roaast is cooked, add about 2 tbsp of meat juices to the bottom of a large muffin pan.
7. Rebeat batter and pour quickly into pan.
8. Bake in oven for 10 minutes at 450, then reduce to 350 degrees and cook and additional 15 minutes until it is well risen and turned golden brown. (Do NOT open the oven door while it is cooking).
9. Serve immediately. And, of course, pour gravy over them!

Description: 
I use this recipe but it is taken from a British cookbook. They're very good, but you MUST make a roast with it. You need the meat juices to make the Pudding.
