Ingredients:
Juice of 1/2 lemon
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon hot sauce, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups panko crumbs
1 1/2 lb. chicken pieces (breast pieces cut in half)
1/2 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Place chicken pieces into zip top food grade plastic bag.
Mix together lemon juice, milk, hot sauce, oregano, cumin, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Pour into bag with chicken. Press out most of the air, seal bag, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, turning bag at least once while chicken marinates.
Preheat oven to $450 degrees F.
Remove chicken pieces from marinade; discard marinade. Pat chicken dry.
Place panko crumbs in a large shallow bowl. Press chicken pieces into panko, covering them with a thick coating of crumbs. Place chicken in a cast iron skillet or shallow baking dish. Leave a bit of space between pieces so they get crisp. Drizzle with melted butter.
Bake until browned and cooked through, 30 to 40 minutes (internal temp of ???).
Remove baking dish from oven and let chicken rest for 5 minutes before serving so they continue to crisp up.

Description: 
Chicken in a spicy panko coating bakes up amazingly crisp in a hot oven. So much easier and less messy than deep fried!
