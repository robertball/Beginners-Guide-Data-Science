1 small onion, diced
¼ cup all-purpose flour
¾ cup half-and-half cream

1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium-high heat; cook the celery and onion in the melted butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the flour and allow to cook until absorbed, about 2 minutes more. Slowly stir the half-and-half and water into the mixture. Dissolve the bouillon in the liquid. Stir in the chicken, buffalo wing sauce, and Cheddar cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low. Stirring occasionally, allow the soup to simmer until the the cheese has melted completely, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
I've found a lot of recipes for Buffalo Chicken Soup but none of them seemed just right. After tailoring elements from all the recipes I found into the perfect one, I came up with this. This soup is creamy and smooth with a hint of spice from the buffalo sauce. Serve it up with a dollop of sour cream and some mozzarella sprinkled on top.
