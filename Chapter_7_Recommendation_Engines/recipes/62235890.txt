1/2 cup dark molasses
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons oil
2 cups rye flour
2.5 - 3 cups bread flour

In bowl combine yeast combo with the rest of the warm water, molasses, salt, oil and rye flour. Mix until smooth.
Work in bread flour until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky - it will be very pliable and elastic.
Knead dough a few minutes then let rise until doubled.
Punch down and form loaves.
Place loaves on a greased and cornmeal dushed baking sheet and sprinkle with cornmeal. Let rise until doubled.
