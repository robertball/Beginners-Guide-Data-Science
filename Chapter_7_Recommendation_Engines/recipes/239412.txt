Ingredients:
1/4 cup Diamond CrystalÂ® Coarse Sea Salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup chopped pecans
2 teaspoons butter (no substitutions)
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup finely shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup canned solid-pack pumpkin (not pie filling)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 dashes Worcestershire sauce, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
20 mini fillo tart shells, thawed to room temperature

Directions:
Combine the Diamond Crystal(R) Coarse Sea Salt and cinnamon in a small bowl; stir until well mixed.
Heat a small skillet over medium heat. Melt butter and saute pecans until golden brown, about 1 minute, stirring constantly to prevent burning. Remove from heat.
Beat together cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, pumpkin puree, garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne with an electric mixer on medium speed until completely combined.
Place cheese mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a small open star tip (such as Ateco #21). Pipe mixture evenly into fillo shells.
Top each tart with some of the pecans and a small amount of the cinnamon sea salt, to taste.
Serve immediately, or refrigerate up to 2 hours until ready to serve.
