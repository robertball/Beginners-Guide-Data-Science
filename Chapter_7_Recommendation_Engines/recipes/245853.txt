Image:
NA
Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) whole red snapper, cleaned and scaled
5  lemons, juiced, divided
¼ cup sweet soy sauce
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon finely minced fresh ginger
3  tomatoes, chopped
1 bunch chives, chopped
½  red chile pepper, sliced
1 pinch white sugar, or to taste (optional)
salt to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place snapper on a large plate; squeeze juice of 1 lemon onto each side and inside cavity. Set snapper aside to marinate, about 10 minutes. Combine soy sauce, butter, and ginger in a small bowl. Mix remaining lemon juice, tomatoes, chives, chile pepper, sugar, and salt together in a separate bowl.
Heat a large skillet to smoking hot over medium-high heat. Cook snapper until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute per side.
Place snapper on preheated grill; brush with soy mixture on each side. Grill, basting occasionally with soy mixture, until snapper flakes easily with a fork, 4 to 6 minutes per side.
Transfer snapper to serving platter. Pour tomato mixture over snapper to serve.

Description: 
This dish has always been my favorite, easy to make and easy to get the ingredients. It can be served with pita bread, salad, or steamed rice, but I prefer it with steamed rice. Passed down from mum to me as a family delicacy.
