Ingredients:
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon celery seed
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 bay leaf
1/2 cup elbow macaroni
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup butter
1 large carrot, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
1 large onion, diced
1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 small zucchini, diced
1 (28 ounce) can diced San Marzano tomatoes with juice
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (15.5 ounce) can three bean salad, drained and rinsed
1 1/2 (10 ounce) packages frozen French-cut green beans
6 cups chicken stock

Directions:
Combine Italian seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, celery seed, parsley, thyme, basil, oregano, salt, black pepper, and bay leaf in a small bowl.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.
Heat olive oil and butter together in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir carrot, celery, and onion until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, zucchini, and Italian seasoning mixture; stir to combine.
Stir tomatoes and their juice, tomato sauce, three bean salad, green beans, and chicken stock into seasoned vegetable mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors are blended, about 30 minutes. Stir in elbow macaroni before serving.
