Description: 
This is a delicious summer salad. Great as a dinner salad with some grilled chicken or fish. Or as a side. This is my first experience with kale and i'm hooked! Add nuts (walnuts, cashews, slivered almonds) or sunflower seed or dried fruit such as cranberries or cherries for some added texture and deliciousness! The citrus vinaigrette is light and refreshing. A great summertime salad :)
