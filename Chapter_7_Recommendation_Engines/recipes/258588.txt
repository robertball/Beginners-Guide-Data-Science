Ingredients:
2 zucchini
cooking spray
1 onion, halved and sliced
1/2 bunch radishes, trimmed and quartered
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or to taste
1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon lemon zest, or to taste
3 cloves garlic, sliced and roughly chopped
1/4 teaspoon dill weed
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 lemon, juiced

Directions:
Cut zucchini into noodles using a spiralizer. Place noodles in a colander set in the sink. Season lightly with salt. Let stand for 20 to 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Spread onion slices on one side of the baking sheet. Spread radishes on the other side of the baking sheet. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil on top.
Combine kosher salt and lemon zest in a small bowl; rub together with your fingers until fragrant. Sprinkle over onion and radishes.
Bake in the preheated oven until onion and radishes are tender and slightly browned, about 25 minutes.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat; grease with cooking spray. Cook and stir garlic until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add onion and radishes; cook and stir until browned, about 3 minutes. Stir in dill weed.
Mix zucchini noodles into the skillet; cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat; pour lemon juice on top.
