Ingredients:
2 (9 inch) pie shells
¾ cup white sugar
2 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca
2 tablespoons cornstarch
¼ teaspoon salt
1 (16 ounce) can pitted sour cherries, drained with liquid reserved
1 (10 ounce) package frozen strawberries in syrup, thawed, drained with liquid reserved
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a medium saucepan combine 3/4 cup sugar, tapioca, cornstarch, and salt. Mix well, then stir in reserved cherry and strawberry liquids. Stirring constantly, cook mixture over medium heat 5 to 10 minutes or until it begins to thicken. Remove from heat; stir in cherries, strawberries, and lemon juice.
Spoon fruit filling into pastry-lined pan. Top with second pastry. Seal and flute edges, then make steam vents in top crust. Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons sugar. Cover edges of pastry with aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove foil during last 15 minutes of baking to allow pastry edges to brown.
