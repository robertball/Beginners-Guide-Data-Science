Ingredients:
1 bunch of swiss chard (large stalks work best)
2 cups flour
salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and paprika to taste
4-5 eggs
oil for frying (canola or corn)

Directions:
Remove the green leafy part from the stalks for later use if desired. Wash and trim the stalks to workable length. Place stalks in large pot of water and boil for approximately 5 minutes until tender. Drain and cool stalks. Place flour and seasonings in ziplok or paper bag. In separate bowl beat eggs with fork. Shake several stalks in flour to coat then dip in egg until fully coated and fry in medium hot oil in small batches.  Turn once to brown both sides and drain on paper-towel lined plate. May wish to sprinkle on a little salt before serving. Serve warm or room temperature.

Description: 
Substitution for cardone (say gar-doon)-an old fashioned Italian favorite.  Cardone (a leafy green)is very difficult to locate.  My family has fond memories of the battered and fried stalks. Once you try it you'll see why!
