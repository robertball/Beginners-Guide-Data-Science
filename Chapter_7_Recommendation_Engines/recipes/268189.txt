Ingredients:
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 cups chicken broth
2 cups water, or as needed

2 cups heavy whipping cream, divided

Directions:
Place chicken in a slow cooker on High power. Add broth and water to cover. Season with salt and pepper.
Cover and cook until chicken is no longer pink inside, about 3 hours.
Remove chicken from slow cooker, shred using a fork, and return meat to the pot. Add 1 cup cream and entire jar of pesto.
Cook on High 1 more hour.
Add remaining cream, egg noodles, and 3/4 of the grated Parmesan-Romano-Asiago cheese to the slow cooker. Add milk.
