Description: 
This is a wonderful, quick soup that works as a main dish with a compliment of cornbread, or as a great accent dish with your Mexican favorites!  Even my kids gobble this one down! Garnish with shredded Monterey Jack cheese and freshly chopped cilantro. This soup holds well in a slow cooker set on Low!
