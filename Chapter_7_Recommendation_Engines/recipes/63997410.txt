Ingredients:
For the Salad:
1 cup uncooked wheatberries (makes 2 & 1/4 cup cooked)
1 cup uncooked quinoa (makes 2.5 cups cooked)
1 cup edamame
1 cup diced carrots (about 2)
1.5 cups diced red pepper (1 large)
1.5 cups diced green pepper (1 large)
1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley
Herbamare or kosher salt, to taste
For the dressing (makes four 1/4 cup servings):
2/3 cup 100% pure orange juice (or use freshly squeezed)
1/3 cup 100% pure apple juice
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
1 tbsp fresh minced ginger
1 tbsp fresh lime juice
kosher salt, to taste (I used 1/4 tsp)

Directions:
In a medium-sized pot, add quinoa and 1.5 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer, until fluffy, about 15-20 minutes, watching closely so it doesnâ€™t burn. Do the same for the wheatberries, in another pot, but add 2 cups of water and cook until tender and chewy, likely cooking for about 5 mins longer than the quinoa.
Meanwhile, chop the vegetables. In a bowl or jar, whisk together the dressing ingredients and set aside.
When the grains have cooked, grab your 500-ml mason jars (if layering), and add into each: 1/2 cup wheatberries, 1/4 cup green pepper, 1/4 cup red pepper, 1/2 cup quinoa, 1/4 cup carrots, 2 tbsp parsley, and 1/4 cup edamame per mason jar. You may have to push it down a bit. Repeat as necessary. Makes enough for 4 mason jars, with a bit leftover. Alternatively, you can just mix the salad together into a big bowl along with the dressing. Will keep in the fridge for 5-6 days.
