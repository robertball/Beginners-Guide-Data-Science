Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet.
In a medium bowl, mix together Italian sausage, baking mix, green bell pepper, yellow onion, mozzarella cheese and pizza sauce. Gradually stir in water until the mixture is a workable consistency. Roll into 1 inch balls.

Description: 
Sausage pizza balls make a great appetizer or snack. They're like whole pizzas that can be popped into your mouth in a single bite! Omit the green bell peppers and onions, if desired.
