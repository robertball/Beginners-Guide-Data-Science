Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups boiling water
3/4 cup old-fashioned oats
1/2 cup butter at room temperature
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
1 cup mashed overripe bananas
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
Topping:
1 (14 ounce) can caramel-flavored sweetened condensed milk
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut (optional)
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
Combine boiling water and oats in a small bowl; let stand for 20 minutes.
Combine 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add bananas, eggs, and vanilla extract; stir well to combine. Mix in oatmeal.
Sift flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Fold into the oatmeal mixture. Divide batter evenly among the muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let cool in the tin, about 5 minutes.
Poke 3 deep holes into each muffin using the round handle of a small wooden spoon. Drizzle 1 tablespoon caramel-flavored condensed milk over each muffin. Let cool completely, about 15 minutes.
Mix 1 cup brown sugar, walnuts, coconut, 1/2 cup melted butter, and heavy cream together in a bowl to make topping. Sprinkle topping over muffins.
