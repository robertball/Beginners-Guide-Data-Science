Ingredients:
10 small fresh apricots, pitted and quartered
1/3 cup white sugar
1 cup almond meal
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 egg
1 (9 inch) refrigerated pie crust (such as PillsburyÂ®)
1/3 cup apricot jam, melted

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll out pie crust onto a baking sheet.
Toss the quartered apricots with the white sugar in a bowl. Mix almond meal, confectioners' sugar, and egg together in another bowl to create a paste.  Spread almond paste on the center of the pie crust, leaving 1/2 inch of bare crust all around the edge. Arrange the sugared apricots over the almond paste. Fold the 1/2-inch bare edge of the crust inward over the almond paste and apricots, leaving the center of the tart uncovered. Crimp the edge down with a fork as you go around the tart.
Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown, about 40 minutes. Brush the melted apricot jam over the hot galette. Slice and serve.
