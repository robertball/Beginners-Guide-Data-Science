1 medium onion, diced
1 tablespoon minced garlic

1/4 cup barbeque sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Place the beef and sausage in a skillet over medium heat, and cook until evenly brown; drain grease. Mix in onion and garlic, and cook until tender. Stir in baked beans, butter beans, ketchup, barbeque sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper. Cover, reduce heat to low, and continue cooking 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Description: 
This is a down-home country, stick-to-your-ribs kind of meal, passed down from an old man my dad once knew. He used a lot more onions that what I use, but that's a personal preference. I have also made it with onion powder or dried minced onion, and it's always good. It's great on a blustery fall or winter day with corn-bread.
