1 cup Amish Friendship Bread Starter
3 eggs
1/3 cup oil
1/2 cup milk
1 cup brown sugar

1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups flour
1 (4 ounce) small box pumpkin spice instant pudding
1 cup canned pumpkin

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325° F (165° C).
In a large mixing bowl, add ingredients as listed.
Grease two large loaf pans.
Dust the greased pans with half of the sugar-cinnamon mixture of 1/2 cup sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.
Pour the batter evenly into loaf or cake pans and sprinkle the remaining sugar-cinnamon mixture on the top.
Bake for one hour or until the bread loosens evenly from the sides and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.
ENJOY!
