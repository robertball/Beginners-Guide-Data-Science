Ingredients:
1 pound beef top sirloin center filets, cut 1 inch thick, tied
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon pepper
2 cups packed fresh baby spinach
1/4 pound fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
1 1/2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
4 naan breads (Indian flatbread) or pita breads

Directions:
Press lemon pepper evenly onto steaks. Place steaks on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill, covered, 12 to 17 minutes (over medium heat on preheated gas grill, 12 to 16 minutes) for medium rare (145 degrees F) to medium (160 degrees F) doneness, turning occasionally.
Meanwhile, combine spinach, cheese and basil in large bowl. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar; toss to coat and set aside.
Remove steak from grill and let stand 5 minutes. Place naan on grill; grill, covered, 1 to 3 minutes or until lightly browned, turning once.
Carve steaks into slices. Top naan evenly with spinach mixture and steak slices.
