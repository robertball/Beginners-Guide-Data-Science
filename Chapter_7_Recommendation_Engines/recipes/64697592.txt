Ingredients:
24 ounces plain yogurt
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon curry powder
2 teaspoons cumin powder
1 teaspoon cinnamon
2 teaspoons freshly ground pepper
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon salt
2 pounds chicken tenders
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 cloves of garlic, minced
2 teaspoons cumin powder
2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 (8 ounce) tomato sauce
1 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup cilantro

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine yogurt, lemon juice, 2 teaspoons cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, curry powder, black pepper, ginger, and salt. Stir in chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 24 hour.
Preheat a grill for high heat.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Thread chicken onto skewers, and discard marinade. Grill until juices run clear, about 5 minutes on each side.
Melt butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat.  Season with 2 teaspoons cumin, paprika, and salt. Stir in tomato sauce and cream. Simmer on low heat until sauce thickens, about 20 minutes. Add grilled chicken, and simmer for 10 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter, and garnish with cilantro.
