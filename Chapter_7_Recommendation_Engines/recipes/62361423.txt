Ingredients:
10 ounces goat cheese, softened
1 lemon, zested
1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley leaves
Vegetable oil, for frying
2 eggs 2 cups panko crumbs Salt

Directions:
In a medium bowl combine goat cheese, zest and parsley. Roll into 16 (1-inch) sized balls and put on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Freeze until firm, about 20 minutes.
In a large heavy-bottomed pot, add enough oil to reach 1/3 of the way up the sides. Heat oil to 360 degrees F. Whisk eggs in a small bowl and place panko crumbs on a plate. Dip cheese balls in the egg wash, then roll in the panko crumbs. In batches, carefully transfer balls into the hot oil and fry until golden, about 1 minute. Transfer to a paper-towel lined plate and season with salt immediately.
