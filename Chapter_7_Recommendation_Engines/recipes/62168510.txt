Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts, chopped
1 teaspoon minced ginger
1/4 cup spicy curry sauce
1/4 cup raisins

Directions:
Spray oil on frying pan. To make sure it's hot wet your hands and flick them over the pan, if it sizzles it's hot.
Add pieces of chicken to pan. After chicken is slightly browned, add the spicy curry sauce. After thirty or forty seconds, add ginger and raisins. Let chicken cook for a minute, and occasionally toss the chicken around with a spatula. Enjoy!

It's really spicy but I took some of the sauce away and things were just a little spicy.
