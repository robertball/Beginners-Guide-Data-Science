Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 pounds chicken wings
½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste
⅓ cup all-purpose flour
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
½ cup hot sauce
½ tablespoon red wine vinegar
½ tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
½ tablespoon honey
½ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 stalks celery, sliced, or to taste
2  carrots, sliced, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat with nonstick cooking spray.
Pat chicken wings dry using paper towels. Season with salt. Place flour in a shallow dish and dredge chicken to lightly coat. Place wings on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and no longer pink in the centers, 40 to 45 minutes.
While wings are baking, melt butter over medium heat in a medium saucepan. Add hot sauce, red wine vinegar, Worcestershire, honey, garlic powder, and cayenne. Let sauce simmer on low heat until wings are done baking, about 40 minutes.
Remove wings from the oven and place in a large mixing bowl. Pour sauce over wings; toss until evenly coated. Serve with celery and carrots.
