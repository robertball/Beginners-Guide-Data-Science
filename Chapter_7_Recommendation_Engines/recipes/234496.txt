Ingredients:
4 cups pancake mix (such as KrusteazÂ®)
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1/2 cup cold water, or as needed
1/2 cup white chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped pecans
2 teaspoons cinnamon

Directions:
Heat a lightly oiled griddle to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir pancake mix, pumpkin puree, water, white chocolate chips, pecans, and cinnamon together in a large bowl until just incorporated, adding more water as needed.
Drop batter by 1/2 cup scoops onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 4 minutes; repeat with remaining batter.
