Ingredients:
8 cups water
2 cups steel-cut oats
1 dash salt
1 cup whole milk
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Stir oats into boiling water and cook at a boil until the mixture begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Season oats mixture with salt; stir.
Reduce heat to low and simmer oats until beginning to soften, about 20 minutes.
Stir milk, brown sugar, melted butter, and cinnamon together in a bowl with a whisk until smooth; stir into the oats mixture. Continue cooking the oats until tender, 10 to 15 minutes more.
Stir cranberries into the oatmeal to distribute throughout the mixture; cook just until the berries are warmed, 2 to 3 minutes.

Description: 
I love instant oatmeal 'raisins and spice' flavor, but I wanted better oats, so this is my own twist. 

This recipe is not 'quick,' but if you make this large amount, you can refrigerate in small storage containers for a quick and easy snack or meal. This oatmeal taste great hot but even tastes good cold when you are on the go.
