Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
3 cups white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
6 large eggs, at room temperature
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoons red velvet emulsion (such as LorannÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan.
Beat butter and cream cheese together in a bowl using an electric mixer until well combined. Add sugar and beat until fluffy. Mix vanilla extract, salt, and baking powder into the creamed mixture. Beat in 2 eggs. Add 1 cup flour and mix well. Add 2 eggs and mix well. Add 1 cup flour and mix well. Add last 2 eggs and mix well. Add remaining 1 cup flour and mix until batter is smooth.
Remove 2 cups batter and place in a separate bowl. Stir in cocoa powder and red velvet emulsion. Pour 1/2 the plain batter into the prepared pan. Add 1/2 the red velvet batter and swirl with a knife. Repeat with remaining plain batter and red velvet batter, swirling gently.
Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 90 minutes.
