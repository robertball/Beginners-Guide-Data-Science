Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled
1 1/2 teaspoons gluten-free baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon fine salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature, or more as needed
3 large eggs
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups pure pumpkin puree
3/4 cup buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter an 8 1/2x4 1/2-inch loaf pan.
Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg in a bowl.
Beat sugar and butter using an electric mixer in a large bowl on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 7 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in vanilla extract. Add flour mixture gradually while beating on low speed; beat until just combined. Add pumpkin and buttermilk and beat until just combined.
Transfer batter to the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean with a few moist crumbs attached, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Turn loaf out onto the rack and let cool completely, 15 to 30 minutes more.

This gluten-free version of a well-loved Thanksgiving pumpkin dish allows all of your guests to stay true to tradition. Gluten-free all-purpose flour is a blend of alternative flours like rice, tapioca, and bean. We like King Arthur FlourÂ®'s gluten-free multipurpose flour for this bread. To store, wrap in plastic wrap and keep at room temperature, up to 3 days.
