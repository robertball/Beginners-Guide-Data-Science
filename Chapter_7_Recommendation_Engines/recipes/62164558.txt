Description: 
My husband created this one after a long day at the beach and a long stare into the pantry.  He whipped it up with staples we always have on hand. We thought it was super tasty.  When I asked him what the dish was called he said, MARCO POLLO.  You gotta love that...Cooks dinner and is a comedian!
