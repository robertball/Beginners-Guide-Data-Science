Description: 
My mother got this recipe out of the local holiday editions of the newspaper when I was just a child. It became an instant family favorite.  It's super easy to make.  Eeven the kids can do it.  We used to joke that it was called millionaire salad because it was expensive to make, but I don't think that all now.  Enjoy.
