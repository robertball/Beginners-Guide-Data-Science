Ingredients:
1 can pizza crust (I used generic)
1/3 c Baking Soda
Pink Himalayan Sea Salt (or any salt)
Dipping Sauce:
Chocolate:
4 oz Neufch√¢tel Cream Cheese
3/4 c Nutella
2-4 Tbsp. Milk
Honey Mustard:
1/3 c Yellow Mustard
3-4 tsp. Honey

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 F.
Spread pizza dough out and cut into 2" by 2" squares. Roll each square into a ball and set aside on a cookie sheet. (Can sit for at least an hour until ready to use.)
Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil and add baking soda. Mix until baking soda is dissolved.
Add the rolled pizza balls to the baking soda boiling water. Allow them to cook for 1-2 minutes or until they puff up and float. Remove the pizza balls with a slotted spoon to a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. (May have to work in batches)
Sprinkle the pizza/pretzel bites with sea salt. Bake in preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.
Meanwhile, mix together the cream cheese, nutella and milk. In a separate bowl mix together the mustard and honey. Serve with warm pizza/pretzel bites.
Note: For a thinner dipping spread add more milk. Dip also great with cut up apples and strawberries.

Description: 
This came together kind of by accident when the kids wanted a snack after school. We have made homemade pretzels before and I have to admit it was a little time consuming. The trick is the baking soda water bath. Very quick and easy pretzel bites with two dipping sauces. I love Nutella. Enjoy!
