Ingredients:
2 lb fresh green beans
Canola oil
brown mustard
pepper
Old Bay seasoning
salt
water

Directions:
Cut the green beans diagonally into thirds, minus the ends.
Place the green beans in a pot and pour water in until they are covered.
Parboil the green beans.  They are done when they have turned light green.  This should take about 20-30 minutes.
Coat the bottom of a pan with oil.
Place the green beans in the pan.  Saute on high heat.
Add enough mustard to coat the green beans but not enough to make much excess sauce or to overpower them.
Add salt, pepper, and old bay seasoning to taste.
The green beans are done after about 15 minutes of sauteing.

Description: 
This recipe gives green beans a wonderful grilled-veggie flavor, but does not actually need to be grilled.  In the summertime, consider adding an equal amount of sliced or chopped zucchini to this dish.  If you add zucchini, only use one pound of green beans.
