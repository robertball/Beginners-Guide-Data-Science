Ingredients:
4 bone-in pork chops (can lightly brown, but not necessary)
seasoned salt to taste
1-2 onions, sliced
1/4-1/3 cup water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Season the pork chops with seasoned salt and place in a glass baking dish. Arrange onion slices on top of pork chops, then pour the water into the pan. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, then reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about another 20 minutes.
