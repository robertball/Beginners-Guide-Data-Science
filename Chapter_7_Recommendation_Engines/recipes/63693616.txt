Ingredients:
1 -2 1/4 lb chicken
4 ounces blue mountain curry powder
onion powder, to taste
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 ounce garlic powder
2 ounces cooking oil
1/2 ounce vinegar
4 ounces water
1 potato, cut in eight pieces (optional)
1/2 ounce black pepper (optional)
1 sprig thyme (optional)

Directions:
1
Cut chicken into 8 pieces, or more if you so desire, wash with vinegar and water in a pot or kitchen sink.
2
Combine chicken with all ingredients and rub together until curry powder is wet and sticks to the chicken.
3
Turn your heat on high, heat the cooking oil in a large iron skillet with 2 tablespoon of curry powder until the oil is hot and curry powder changes color.
4
Add chicken to the hot oil, then turn down the heat to medium, add the water immediately.
5
Add diced potato then cover the pot and simmer. Stir the ingredients in the pot then taste the gravy, after fifteen minutes.
6
If you need to add anything more like salt to bring it to taste, now is the time.
7
Add the 1 sprig of thyme and black pepper to the ingredients in the pot. Allow to simmer until chicken is moist and tender.
8
Option 1: You can thicken the curry chicken gravy with bread crumbs or cornstarch. I prefer to thicken the gravy by using evaporation.
9
Option 2: Remove the chicken from the skillet and place in a bowl.
10
Turn up the fire to high and allow gravy to boil. Using a spoon, stir the gravy slowly and pay close attention to the consistency of the stew, Turn off the stove when it becomes thick enough.
11
Then add curry chicken back to the stew.

Your food is ready!
