Ingredients:
Zest of 12 lemons
750 ml. bottle of Everclear
1-1/2 liters of whole milk
1-1/2 kg of sugar
1 packet of vanillina
3 decorative bottles with tight fitting lids

Directions:
Wash and scrub the lemons to remove any wax or residue.
Remove the peel of the lemons with a vegetable peeler or very sharp knife, being careful to only remove the yellow part, and none of the white pith.
Place the lemon zest in a large glass jar that has a tight fitting lid.
Pour Everclear over the lemon zest and tighten lid.
Let sit for a minimum of 2 weeks at room temperature, in a dark place.
Pour the milk and sugar in a large pan or dutch oven, and heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until hot, but not boiling.  Make sure sugar is completely dissolved.
Add vanilla to milk mixture and stir until incorporated.
Remove from heat and cool completely.
Using a fine sieve or cheese cloth, strain lemon mixture into milk mixture, removing all of the lemon zest.
Mix well.
Pour into a container that has a pour spout.
Decant into the bottles, and store in the freezer.
