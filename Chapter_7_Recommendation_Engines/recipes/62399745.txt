Ingredients:
1 cup pecans
1 (18.25 ounce) Devil Food cake mix
1/2 cup dark rum
4 eggs
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup of pitted and halved fresh cherries
129 grams (3 pieces) of Ghirardelli 86% cacao intense dark chocolate chopped
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup dark rum
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup of chopped fresh strawberries
1/4 cup butter
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 cup cocoa
4 cups powdered sugar
1/3 cup milk

Directions:
The Cake: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease and flour one Bundt pan. Sprinkle 1/2 cup pecans over the bottom of the pan.
Mix together cake mix, 1/2 cup dark rum, eggs, 1/2 cup cold water, cooking oil.
Fold in cherries, 1/2 cup pecans and dark chocolate.
Pour batter over nuts.
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 1 hour. Cool, invert on a serving plate.
To make the frosting: In a sautee pan, melt 1/4 cup butter, add the strawberries and 1/4 sugar.
Cook and over medium-high heat adding the 1/4 cup rum and the tsp of vanilla extract as it starts to bubble.
Reduce the mixture to a syrup state.
Add 1/4 cup butter and melt it in.
Remove from heat and mix in 1 cup cocoa.
On medium speed, mix in 1/3 cup milk and 4 cups powdered sugar.
Apply to the cake.  You may want the frosting to cool a bit before applying.  Also, you will have excess frosting.  Keep it and use it as a garnish by heating it up (recommend double boiler method to be safe).  Cut a piece of cake (you can heat it or serve room temp) and place the cake slice in a puddle of the heated frosting, and drizzle some over the cake as well.  Enjoy!
