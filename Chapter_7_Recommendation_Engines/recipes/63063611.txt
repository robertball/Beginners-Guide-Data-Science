Description: 
A delicious chili recipe my mother handed down to me. The recipe calls for 2 tablespoons chili powder, but this just isn't spicy enough for me, so I usually double the amount.  Obviously, add as much as you'd like! Also, I usually double the recipe - because it's just that good and I like to eat on it for a few days. :)
