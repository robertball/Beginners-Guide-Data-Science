Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 (15 ounce) can mixed vegetables, drained
2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce, divided
1/2 cup cooked rice
1 small onion, chopped
3 green onions, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 egg
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 large green bell peppers, tops removed, seeded

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix the ground beef, mixed vegetables, 1 can of tomato sauce, rice, onion, green onions, garlic, egg, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Spoon the beef mixture into the bell peppers. Arrange peppers in a baking dish, and spoon the remaining 1 can of tomato sauce on top. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until the beef is no longer pink, about 1 1/2 hours.

Description: 
I watched my mom make these when I was a kid. I loved them then and I love them now, and you will too. Goes great with mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, and a salad. I like to cook them on a medium-high heat, about 350 degrees, so that the peppers cook soft. You can adjust your temperature to lower the cook time. Enjoy.
