Ingredients:
Nonstick vegetable oil spray (like Pam)
3 large eggs
1 1/4 cups low-fat (1% or 2%) cottage cheese
1 cup buttermilk baking mix (like Bisquick)
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, melted
3 tablespoons sour cream
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasoning
2 teaspoons fresh rosemary, finely chopped, finely chopped
1 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese (about 6 ounces)
Pine Nuts or Walnut halves (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees (slightly lower if using in convection/bake mode).  Spray forty-eight of 1¾” diameter muffin cups (2 pans) with nonstick spray.  Whisk eggs in a large bowl and then add next 8 ingredients and whisk to blend well.  Stir in Gorgonzola cheese.
Fill each cup to just below the top (less than a full tablespoon) with batter.  Top batter in each cup with pine nuts or walnut halves, if desired.
Bake tarts until golden and puffed.  This will be 15-20 minutes typically, but may vary based on oven calibration.  Keep a close eye on them so as not to burn them.  Remove from pans onto cooling rack after 2-3 minutes of in pan cooling.
