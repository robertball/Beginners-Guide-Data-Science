Description: 
An economical version of an old-favorite sandwich. It is made of rump roast simmered for 7 hours with beef broth, onion soup and beer. The reduced cooking liquid makes plenty of sauce for dipping. Best flavor if made a day ahead and let sliced meat soak in the juice overnight.  YUM!!!Modified from: Easy Slow Cooker French Dip
