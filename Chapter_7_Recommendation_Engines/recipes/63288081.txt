Ingredients:
1 cup        margarine (softened)
2 cups      caster sugar
4              eggs
3/4 cup    cocoa powder
1 cup        self-raising flour
1 cup        choc. chunks (white or dark)
1cup         fresh raspberries

Directions:
Grease and powder with cocoa pwdr. a 12x9 pan, set oven to 350f
Measure all the ingred. EXCEPT raspberries into a large bowl and blend with mixer until evenly mixed.
Fold in raspberries being careful not to crush them too much.
Spoon the mixture into pan making sure it gets into the corners (i usually slide the pan back and forth to do this)
Bake at 350f for 40-45 min. (sometimes it take longer - i think it has to do with the raspberries. just watch for a crust on the top, but a clean toothpick when skewered in the center.)
Let cool, cut and TRY not to eat the whole pan at once!!!

Description: 
The best brownies are soft in the center and have a crust on the top, oh and they also have chocolate chunks and fresh raspberries in them too!!! This recipe couldn't be simpler - just measure everything into 1 bowl, mix, add raspberries and bake! No doubt these will be one of the best desserts you have EVER made!!!!
