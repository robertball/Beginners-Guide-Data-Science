Ingredients:
6 (5 ounce) salmon fillets
3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
3 tablespoons orange blossom honey
1 pinch brown sugar
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
lime slices for garnish

Directions:
Place salmon fillets in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a small bowl, stir together the lime juice, honey, brown sugar, and olive oil. Pour over the salmon. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to marinate.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). Season the salmon with salt and pepper.
Bake for 15 minutes in the center of the preheated oven, or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Garnish with lime slices, and serve immediately.

Description: 
A nice, light, healthy summertime dinner. Salmon is marinated in a lime and honey mixture.  And anytime I add lime to a dish, I want a margarita the size of my head to go with it!
