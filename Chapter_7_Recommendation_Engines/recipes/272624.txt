Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash
1/2 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 sweet yellow onion, chopped
1/2 yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
nonstick cooking spray
1 (14 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
3/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend, divided
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 Roma tomatoes, chopped
1 avocado, diced, or more to taste
1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking pan with aluminum foil.
Cut squash in 1/2 lengthwise. Remove and discard seeds. Add a few drops of oil to each 1/2 and spread using a pastry brush. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Place cut-side down in the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion, bell pepper, and garlic in the hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat.
Remove cooked squash from the oven and reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 2-quart casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.
Remove strands from squash using a fork or spoon and place them into a large bowl. Add black beans, sauteed veggies, 1/2 cup Mexican cheese, cilantro, cumin, salt, and pepper; mix well. Spoon mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Mexican cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with tomatoes, avocado, and olives. Serve immediately.
