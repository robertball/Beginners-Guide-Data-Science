Ingredients:
2 Tbsp canola oil
1/2 onion, diced
2 tsp salt, divided
1 tsp freshly ground pepper
2 lbs stew meat, cut into 1” pieces
3 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 tsp dried thyme
3 C chopped mushrooms
2 Tbsp soy sauce
2 Tbsp flour
3 C chicken broth
16 oz wide egg noodles
¾ cup sour cream, or to taste

Directions:
1. Turn Instant Pot on Sauté and add 2 Tbsp olive oil to the bottom of the pot. Give the oil a minute to heat up, then add the diced onions, and 1/2 tsp salt to the pot. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, until the onion begins to soften.
2. Season the beef with 1 tsp salt and the freshly ground pepper. Add the meat to the onion and stir to combine. Brown the meat for about 2 minutes, stirring a couple of times to sear it evenly on all sides. Add the minced garlic and the thyme to the pot, cook for 30 seconds or until the garlic is fragrant.  Add the soy sauce.
3. Add the chopped mushrooms to the pot, and then the flour. Stir the flour into the mixture to coat the ingredients. Immediately pour chicken broth and 1/2 tsp of salt. Cover the Instant Pot, close the pressure valve, and cook on high pressure for 10 minutes.
4. After 10 minutes on high pressure, quick release the pressure and add the egg noodles  Cook for 5 more minutes on high pressure.  Let pressure release naturally for a few minutes, then switch to quick release.  Add sour cream and stir to combine.
