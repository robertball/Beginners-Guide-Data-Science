Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 eggplant, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 clove garlic, minced
4 crusty sandwich rolls, split and toasted
1 bunch fresh basil leaves
1 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Pour the oil into a large skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Place the eggplant slices in the heated pan and cook without moving until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Flip the eggplant and continue to cook until golden brown on the other side. Remove from heat.
Mix together the mayonnaise and garlic in a small bowl.
Lay the toasted rolls out, cut side up. Place the cooked eggplant on the bottom half of each roll. Layer the eggplant with fresh basil leaves and crumbled feta. Spread the garlic mayo very lightly over the cut side of the top each toasted roll. Place the tops on the prepared sandwich.
