Ingredients:
3 Fresh Bananas, washed and peeled
3 Kiwi Fruits, washed and peeled
3 very ripe Pears, washed, peeled and cored
1 Tangerine or Clementine, washed, peeled and seeds removed
Lemon Juice *optional
1/4 cup Infant Cereal *amount may vary
8 new zip seal bags, sanwich size
Food Processor

Directions:
Be sure that your work surface is clean and sanitized.  Wash hands thoroughly with soap.  Place prepared fruit in food processor and puree until fruit is very smooth with no chunks.  If desired, add 1 tsp of lemon juice.  Please note that lemon juice is not necessary and it is said that it may cause allergic reactions in very young babies just starting out on solid food, so please use lemon juice at your discretion.
Depending on the juiciness of your fruit, infant cereal may need to be added to thicken baby food.  Add by tablespoonful at a time until desired consistency is achieved.
Using a 1/3 or 1/2 Cup measuring cup (depending on your child's appetite), scoop one scoop of baby food into each zip seal bags.  Be sure to get out excess air before sealing bags.  Place sticky label on each bag stating contents and date.  Flatten food in bags and store in freezer until ready to use.  Thaw by running under water, placing in fridge for a day, or in microwave and enjoy knowing that you are feeding your baby the best!
