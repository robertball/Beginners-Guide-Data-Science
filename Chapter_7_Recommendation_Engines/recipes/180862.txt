Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cut into bite-size pieces
3 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 cup white wine
3/4 cup chicken stock
3 (16 ounce) cans great Northern beans, drained
1 (14 ounce) bag baby spinach
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts in water, drained and quartered
1 (8 ounce) can whole black olives, drained
1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon
1 sprig fresh rosemary
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the chicken breast, and cook 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic, and continue cooking until the chicken has turned golden brown on all sides. Pour in the white wine, and simmer for 1 minute, then stir in the chicken stock, great Northern beans, spinach, artichokes, olive, tarragon, and the whole rosemary sprig. Season with ground black pepper.
Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the rosemary sprig before serving.
