Ingredients:
1 cup grated Gruyere cheese
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup butter
2 zucchini, sliced
1 yellow squash, sliced
2 shallots, diced
1 clove garlic, minced (optional)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3/4 cup light cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix Gruyere cheese and panko bread crumbs together in a bowl.
Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat until melted. Add zucchini, yellow squash, shallots, and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 10 minutes. Stir in basil, rosemary, salt, and black pepper; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Mix flour into the skillet. Pour in cream in a steady stream and stir until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix in half the cheese mixture. Remove from heat.
Pour zucchini mixture into a baking dish. Top with remaining cheese mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden brown, about 20 minutes.
