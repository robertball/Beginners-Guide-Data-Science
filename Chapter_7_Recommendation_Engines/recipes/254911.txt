Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup Greek yogurt
1 egg
2 tablespoons almond extract
1/4 cup shredded coconut
1 (15 ounce) can Libby'sÂ® Sliced Peaches, juice reserved, chopped
3 tablespoons heavy cream, for brushing
1/4 cup powdered sugar, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.
In medium bowl mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and spices. Add cold butter and mix until well combined.
In large bowl whisk together 1/4 cup of heavy cream, yogurt, egg and extract. Slowly add to dry ingredients and mix until well combined. Add coconut and stir in diced peaches and combine.
Transfer dough to well-floured surface and pat into small disk (about 1/2-inch thick). Cut into 6 to 8 pieces and transfer to baking sheet. Brush scones with additional heavy cream. Bake for 16 to 18 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool.
In small bowl add powdered sugar and reserved peach juice. Stir until it forms a liquid and drizzle over scones.
