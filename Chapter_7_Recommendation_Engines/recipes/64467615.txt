Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour, 4 tablespoons lard, 1 1/2 cups warm water, 2 quarts oil for frying,1 teaspoon salt,2 teaspoons baking powder, honey, chocolate syrup, powdered sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, salt and lard. Gradually stir in water; mix until dough is smooth and consistent. loosely drape a towell over the bowl and let stand for 20 minutes.
Roll the dough out on floured board with a floured rolling pin until 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. If you don't have a rolling pin, a wine bottle works. Cut into triangles. Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees. Fry until golden brown on both sides.
Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and drizzle with either honey or chocolate syrup (both if you're super rad). Serve warm.
Achieve nirvana.
