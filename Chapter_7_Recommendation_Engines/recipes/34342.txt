Ingredients:
12 eggs
1 quart whole milk
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste

Directions:
Crack eggs into a large saucepan and beat with a whisk. Whisk in milk, sugar, salt and cinnamon. Cook over medium-low to low heat, stirring constantly until the mixture fully forms curds and the whey separates. This will take 20 to 30 minutes. Using higher heat or failing to stir will result in a big pan of sweet scrambled eggs.
Drain the mixture into a colander lined with several layers of cheese cloth. Use the cloth to shape into a ball and twist the top to remove excess moisture. Secure with a twist tie. Hang for several hours or overnight. I do it on the spigot of the kitchen sink (which would probably wig out the germ police, but I haven't gotten botulism in 34 years). Of course, you could let it drain initially there and then finish it overnight in the fridge suspended over a deep bowl.

Description: 
Hrudka pronounced (hur-UT-ka)is a simple custard cheese that's essential for many Eastern European Easter tables. It's sliced and eaten by itself or, more often, as part of a ham or kolbassi sandwich made on Paska bread that's slathered with beet horseradish. The recipe is as easy as it is healthy. Ha!
