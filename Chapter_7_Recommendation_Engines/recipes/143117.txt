Ingredients:
1 pound bulk chorizo sausage
1/2 onion, chopped
5 eggs, beaten
4 tomatoes, chopped
2 jalapeno peppers, sliced
1 (8 ounce) package tortilla chips
1 (8 ounce) package finely shredded Mexican blend cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook the chorizo in a skillet over medium heat until crumbled and evenly browned, about 5 minutes; drain and set aside. Cook the onion in the same skillet until soft; stir in the eggs and scramble with the onion. Mix in the tomatoes and continue to cook and stir until eggs are nearly set; remove from heat.
Spread a layer of tortilla chips into a 9x13 baking dish. Scatter the chorizo and the scrambled egg mixture over the chips. Top with jalapeno slices and cover with the cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted, 7 to 10 minutes.
