Ingredients:
skewers
Marinade:
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup lime juice
6 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
4 teaspoons ketchup
4 teaspoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
Kabobs:
1 pound cubed beef stew meat
1 (8 ounce) package whole mushrooms
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 yellow squash, chopped
1 zucchini, chopped

Directions:
Whisk maple syrup, lime juice, garlic, ketchup, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl until marinade is smooth.
Place beef in a bowl; pour in marinade and stir to coat. Marinate beef in the refrigerator, at least 3 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Soak skewers in water for at least 10 minutes.
Thread beef, mushrooms, onion, green bell pepper, squash, and zucchini onto skewers.
Cook kabobs on the preheated grill until vegetables are tender and beef is cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes per side.

Description: 
I make this for the 4th of July and have used it on pork, beef, and chicken. I love to marinate my mushrooms too. The marinade is sweet with a mild kick.
