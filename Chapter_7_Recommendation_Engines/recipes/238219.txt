Ingredients:
30 tomatoes, peeled and chopped
10 cups chopped onions
2 (12 ounce) cans tomato paste
2 green bell peppers, chopped
2 red bell peppers, chopped
2 cups vinegar
4 banana peppers, chopped, or more to taste
1/2 cup white sugar, or more to taste
10 cloves garlic, chopped
8 teaspoons pickling salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
17 1-pint canning jars with lids and rings

Directions:
Combine tomatoes, onions, tomato paste, green bell peppers, red bell peppers, vinegar, banana peppers, sugar, garlic, pickling salt, and ground black pepper together in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until slightly reduced in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.
Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack salsa into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 35 minutes.
Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.
