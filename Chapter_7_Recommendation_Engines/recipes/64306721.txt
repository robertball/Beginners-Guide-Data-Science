Ingredients:
6 whole Deli Rolls Or Crusty Italian Rolls
Jarred Marinara Sauce Or Pizza Sauce
Jarred Or Refrigerated Pesto
2 pounds Mozzarella Cheese, Grated
Grated Parmesan Cheese To Taste
2 Tablespoons Butter
1 whole Onion, Sliced
1/2 pound Sausage (regular Breakfast Sausage Or Italian Sausage)
Pepperoni Slices
Canadian Bacon Slices
Pineapple Chunks, Fresh Or Canned
Roma Tomatoes, Sliced
Sliced Black Olives
Optional Ingredients: Sliced Bell Peppers, Various Cheeses, Pepperoncinis, Jalapeno Slices, Diced Red Onion, Any Other Pizza Topping You'd Like!

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
Slice rolls in half and lay them, cut side up, on a large baking sheet.
Top each half with a generous portion of either marinara or pesto. Next, top with a generous amount of grated mozzarella and Parmesan, if you'd like.
Add whatever toppings you'd like on top of the cheese!
Once all assembled, put the pan in the oven on the lowest rack for 8 to 10 minutes. Crank up the heat to 425 and put it on the highest rack until the cheese starts to bubble a bit and turn golden.
Remove and serve immediately! You can cut the pizzas in half right across the middle so there are mini-French Bread Pizzas for everyone.
