Spray a large skillet with cooking spray; warm over medium-high heat. Whisk eggs together in a bowl. Pour into the skillet. Add spinach, green onions, garlic salt, and Cajun seasoning. Cook and stir until eggs are nearly set, about 5 minutes.
Pour black beans into a small pot over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 5 minutes.
