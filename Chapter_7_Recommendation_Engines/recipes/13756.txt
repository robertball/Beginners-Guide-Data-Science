Ingredients:
6 sweet potatoes
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup melted butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup dark brown sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup melted butter
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In a large stockpot, cover sweet potatoes with 1 inch of water; boil for 20 minutes, or until fork tender.  Drain, allow to cool and remove skins.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or butter one 2 quart casserole dish.
Place potatoes in a mixing bowl and with an electric mixer, beat on low speed until potatoes begin to break up. Increase speed to medium high and blend until smooth.
Reduce speed to low and add sugar, milk, butter, vanilla, eggs and salt. Mix well.
Allow any potato 'fibers' to remain on the beater and remove. Pour sweet potato mixture into the casserole dish.
Prepare the topping in a small bowl by whisking together the brown sugar, flour, butter and pecans. Sprinkle mixture over potato mixture and bake for 40 minutes.
