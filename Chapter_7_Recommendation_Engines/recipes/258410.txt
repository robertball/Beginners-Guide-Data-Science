Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound haddock, cut into cubes
1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 shallot, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (13.5 ounce) can full-fat coconut milk
2 teaspoons red curry paste
2 teaspoons curry powder
3/4 teaspoon ground coriander
3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
2 cups baby spinach
1 cup shelled edamame
2 green onions, sliced

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot until very hot. Add haddock; cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Add red bell pepper, shallot, and garlic; cook and stir until shallot softens, about 3 minutes.
Pour coconut milk into the pot. Whisk in curry paste, curry powder, coriander, and turmeric. Reduce heat; simmer until coconut milk is reduced by 1/4, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in spinach and edamame. Cook until spinach is wilted and edamame is heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle green onions over curry.

Description: 
Don't you love one-pot recipes? I love making them. As much as I love to cook, not having a big mess makes me very happy. The curry blend smelled so good and the haddock took on the flavors perfectly! Thanks again, City Fish! 

This is also a 30-minute meal and a paleo dish! Keep it healthy...
