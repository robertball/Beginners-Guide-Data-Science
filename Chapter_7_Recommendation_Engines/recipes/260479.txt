Ingredients:
1/2 cup warm water
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon yeast
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 cup hot water
2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, or as needed
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 cup finely chopped scallions

Directions:
Combine warm water, sugar, and yeast in a bowl. Add 1 cup flour; stir dough with a spatula.
Mix the remaining 1 cup flour, hot water, 2 tablespoons oil, and salt together in a separate bowl until dough-like in texture. Add the dough from step 1; knead together into a round ball, dusting with flour as needed. Place dough ball on a lightly floured work surface; cover with a warm, damp towel for 30 to 40 minutes.
Pinch dough ball into 2 pieces. Roll each out and sprinkle half the scallions on top. Roll up each piece into a tube; pinch each in half. Roll and flatten into large pancakes, dusting with flour, if needed.
Heat the remaining oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook pancakes until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
