Ingredients:
1 cup coconut butter
1 cup chopped macadamia nuts
5 eggs, room temperature
1 tablespoon stevia sugar substitute (such as TruviaÂ®)
2 teaspoons baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a loaf pan with parchment paper.
Place coconut butter and macadamia nuts in a food processor and process on high to achieve a part butter, part chunky, nut meal. Reduce speed to medium-low and add one egg. Run processor to combine, about 10 seconds. Add remaining eggs, one at a time, blending until mixture is creamy.
Turn off the food processor and add stevia, baking soda, and salt; process to combine, 10 to 15 seconds. Clean edges of the bowl and process until mixture is evenly blended. Pour in lemon juice and reduce speed to low; blend well. Clean the sides of the bowl again and mix once more to thoroughly combine.
Pour mixture into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let cool before transferring to a wire rack.
