Ingredients:
2 cups chicken stock
3/4 cup uncooked long grain rice
2 cups sour cream
2 (4 ounce) cans diced green chiles
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1/2 teaspoon salt
black pepper to taste
4 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 1 1/2 quart casserole dish.
Bring chicken stock to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add rice, reduce heat to low, and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.  In a medium bowl, mix together the sour cream, green chilies, green onion, salt and pepper. Set aside.
Spread half of the rice into the bottom of the prepared pan. Spread with half of the sour cream mixture, and then half of the cheese. Repeat layers ending with cheese on top.
Bake uncovered for 45 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
