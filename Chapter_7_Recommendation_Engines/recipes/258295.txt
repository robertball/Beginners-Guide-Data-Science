Ingredients:
3 extra large eggs
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon oyster sauce
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
6 slices fresh ginger
1 large clove garlic, smashed
1 cup fresh bean sprouts
1/2 cup chopped roast pork loin
1/2 cup chopped cooked chicken breast
1/4 cup chopped mushrooms
1/4 cup chopped green onions

Directions:
Whisk eggs, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil together in a glass measuring cup. Add enough water to make 1 cup; whisk until blended.
Heat vegetable oil in an 11-inch nonstick omelet pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ginger and garlic until browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Discard ginger and garlic.
Cook and stir bean sprouts, pork loin, chicken breast, mushrooms, and green onions in the same skillet until heated through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
Reheat skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in 1/2 cup egg mixture, tilting skillet to coat the bottom. Cook for 30 seconds. Spread half of the bean sprout mixture over one side of the egg layer. Reduce heat to low; cook until eggs are set, 3 to 5 minutes. Fold over omelet and slide onto a plate.
Repeat with remaining 1/2 cup egg mixture and bean sprout mixture to make second omelet.

Description: 
Delicious authentically flavored egg foo yung. I used Rachael Ray's foo yung sauce, but any gravy flavored with a bit of oyster sauce and soy sauce will do. My husband says this is the best he's had anywhere.
