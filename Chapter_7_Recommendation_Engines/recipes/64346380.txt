Ingredients:
1 large russet potato, washed
1 small onion, peeled
1/2 bunch kale, sliced thin
1 small "head" of broccoli
3 cups soy milk
1 tablespoon potato starch (opt)
2 teaspoons vegetable broth & seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
white pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut stem part off the head of broccoli, peel it if you feel it is necessary and add just the stem with the potato, onion, and kale in a steamer about 40 min. When almost done, add the flower end of the broccoli and continue steaming so it can soften but not be overdone (still bright green). Heat the milk in the microwave until steaming. Put the cooked veggies in a Vitamix or other mixer, add the milk, and seasoning and blend at high speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 or 2 min. Serve
