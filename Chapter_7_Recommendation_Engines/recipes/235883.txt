Ingredients:
1/2 cup tapioca flour
1/2 cup ground flax seed
1 large egg
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon water, or as needed
1 teaspoon coconut oil, or as needed

Directions:
Whisk tapioca flour and flax seed together in a bowl. Quickly stir egg and olive oil into tapioca flour mixture; add enough water to make dough stick together. Turn dough onto a work surface and roll to about 1/8-inch thickness. Cut dough into preferred size.
Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry dough, working in batches if needed, in the hot oil until crackers are lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Description: 
I came out with this recipe out of the blue and people seemed to love it. I used mine with guacamole, and they were a hit! Someone was even willing to buy some crackers from me. They are perfect to be used with dips! Season to taste.
