Description: 
Family favorite around bird hunting season. Chicken fried pheasant is so simple and good, and unless you tell them, they don't have a clue it's wild game. Uses few ingredients, prep and cooking time are minimal. The first problem is getting the bird in the first place, if you're a hunter! The second problem is there are NEVER any leftovers, no matter how much you cook. Makes wonderful cold sandwiches IF there is anything leftover!
