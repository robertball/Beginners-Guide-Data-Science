Ingredients:
1 cup butter beans
3 cups water
2 cups white sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/4 cup butter, melted and cooled
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon half-and-half cream
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch single crust pie

Directions:
Soak the beans in the water overnight. The next morning, take the hull off beans. Place beans in a saucepan and add water to cover. Do not add seasoning. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and cook until beans are very tender, about 1 hour. Drain; when they have cooled slightly, mash beans.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine sugar, flour, butter, vanilla, eggs, and salt. Mix well. Stir in mashed beans; add cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cream.
Pour into a pie shell. Bake until a knife inserted near the center of the pie comes out clean, 30 to 45 minutes. Allow to cool completely before serving. Store pie in refrigerator.
