Ingredients:
3/4 cups/180 milliliters extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing
3 cups/375 grams flour, plus more for dusting
4 eggs
1 cup/200 grams sugar
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1/3 cup/80 milliliters whole milk
1/3 cup/80 milliliters heavy/double cream
2 tablespoons baking powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F/160 degrees C/gas 3. Lightly oil a 10- to 12- inch/ 25- to 30-centimeter bundt pan or angel-food cake pan, then dust with flour, shaking off the excess by turning the pan upside down and gently banging it several times on a countertop.
Combine the eggs and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed until pale yellow, about 1 minute. Add the flour, orange and lemon zest, oil, milk, and cream and mix on low speed until well combined. Add the baking powder and mix in thoroughly.
Spoon the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with the back of a wooden spoon. Bake the cake until the top is golden brown and a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the cake cool completely in the pan on a rack before unmolding and serving.
