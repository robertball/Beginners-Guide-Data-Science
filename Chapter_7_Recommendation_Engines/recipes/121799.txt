Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup cold butter
3/4 cup apricot preserves

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, oats, sugar, salt and baking soda. Cut in butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Press half of the mixture into a greased 8-in. square baking pan. Spread with preserves. Sprinkle with remaining oat mixture; gently press down.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 38-42 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into squares.

Description: 
Easy to prepare and designed to make a small amount, these squares are a marvelous blend of flavors. It's a dessert that can be stirred up in no time to satisfy a sweet tooth...warm from the oven or as a treat later. -Veronica Roza, Bayport, New York
