Ingredients:
1 9" ready-made graham cracker crust
1 14-oz can fat-free sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup low-fat sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Juice from 1/2 a lemon
1/2 cup blueberry preserves
1/8 cup white table wine
1 cup fresh blueberries
1 cup fresh mulberries
Confectioner's sugar (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Combine the sweetened condensed milk, sour cream, vanilla extract, and 1/2 of the lemon juice (reserving 1/2 of the juice) in a medium saucepan.  Simmer and stir over medium heat until the texture begins to slightly curdle.  Remove from heat and let cool for 5 mins.  Pour into graham cracker crust.
In another medium saucepan, combine the remaining lemon juice, the preserves, and the wine.  Simmer over medium heat until the preserves have liquified.  Add the berries and stir gently until all of the berries are coated.  Continue to cook over medium heat for 5 mins.  Remove from heat and let cool for 5 mins.  Pour over the custard.
Bake in preheated 425 degree oven for 10 mins.  Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack for 15 mins.  Finish cooling in the refrigerator until the custard sets.  Sift confectioner's sugar over the tart before serving if desired.

Description: 
Blueberries and mulberries are everywhere in Eastern PA during the early to mid-Summer, so I created this quick and simple vanilla custard tart to accentuate the natural sweetness of the hand-picked berries.  Enjoy!
