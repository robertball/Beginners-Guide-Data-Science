Ingredients:
2 lbs red bliss potatoes
1 lb carrots
1 head cauliflower
1 onion
canola oil
salt
marjoram
thyme
water

Directions:
Chop the cauliflower into 1" to 2" pieces.  Place in a pot and pour water in until covered.
Parboil until cooked, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Cut the potatoes into 1" to 2" pieces.  Peel the carrots and slice them into 1/2" disks.  Peel the onion and chop it into small slices.
Place the potatoes, carrots, onion, and parboiled cauliflower in a pan.  Pour in just enough oil to coat the vegetables and the bottom of the pan.  Add spices to taste.
Place the pan in the oven for about 40-50 minutes, or until all vegetables are done.  Check on it every 15-20 minutes, stirring and adding spices as desired and oil as needed.
