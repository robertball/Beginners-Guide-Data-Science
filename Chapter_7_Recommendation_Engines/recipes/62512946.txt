Ingredients:
4       bone in skin on leg/thigh portions
1       reusable plastic bag
2       tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2	cups favorite white wine
1	cup water
¼ 	scant cup light brown sugar
½	cup extra-virgin olive oil
1	tablespoon kosher salt or sea salt
1  	tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1	tablespoon dehydrated garlic

Directions:
1.	preheat oven to 375
2.	Combine all the ingredients in a non-reactive bowl (glass or stainless-steel) and whisk until the salt and sugar are dissolved.  Alternatively, dissolve in warm water and then add the rest of the ingredients; make sure the marinade is cool before using.  The marinade will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.  I marinated the chicken for 6 hours, pan sere on both sides, until skin is browned well.  Place on baking sheet and bake for about an hour, or until juices run clear.
