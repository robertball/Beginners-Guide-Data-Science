Ingredients:
16 oz. cream cheese (softened)
2 cups sour cream
5 oz pkg of chipped beef lunch meat chopped I use Budding brand(in lunch meat area of grocery store)
2 cups grated cheddar cheese
8 minced green onions
4 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1 whole loaf Sheepherders bread

Directions:
Hollow out loaf of Sheepherders bread.
Combine all other ingredients in large bowl and mix until well blended.
Put mixture into hollowed out loaf.  Replace top of loaf.  Place on baking sheet and cover with foil.
Bake in 350 degree oven for 1-1/2 hours.
You can serve with pieces of hollowed out bread.  I also serve with crackers (I think it tastes the best with Pepperidge Farms Golden Butter Crackers - they are shaped like a butterfly).

Description: 
This recipe is from my mom and has been a family favorite for years.  It is the most delicious dip I have ever had, and I have had many dips in my life!  The flavors blend so perfectly.  Every time I have made this dip it is devoured! It is also super easy to make.  Not low in calories, but very much worth the splurge during the holidays!
