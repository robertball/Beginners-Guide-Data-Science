Ingredients:
6 ounces white whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch chunks
1/4 cup ice cold water
1 tablespoon ice cold orange vodka (optional)
1 cup cherry pie filling
2 teaspoons milk
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Whisk together flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Cut in cold butter with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the flour mixture and pour in water and vodka, if using. Toss with a fork until flour mixture is moistened, then use your hands to bring dough together into a ball. Flatten into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
Roll dough into a large disk about 13 inches wide and 1/8-inch thick. Transfer dough to the prepared baking sheet.
Pour cherry filling into the middle of the dough, leaving a 3-inch border. Fold the outside edge of the dough over the fruit, making occasional pleats.
Brush milk over dough; generously sprinkle with sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden and the fruit is bubbling, 35 minutes.

Description: 
Why am I calling this a cherry folditup, and not a cherry galette, its correct culinary name? Because one sounds like something that's easy to make, and one doesn't.
