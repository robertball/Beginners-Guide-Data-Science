Ingredients:
Marchino Cherries with stem *one for each mouse*
Hershey Kiss *one for each mouse*
Slivered Almonds *two for each mouse*
2 small red candies (optional) *two/three for each mouse*
Brick of almond bark
Optional Oreos *any but works great with the white iced covered oreos*

Directions:
Melt the almond bark in the microwave 30 seconds first then 10-15 second intervals until it is melted
Take a Marchino Cherry with the stem on, hold the stem and dunk it into the almond bark you melted. Do not get the stem in the chocolate
Next before the chocolate dries put a Hershey kiss on the side of the cherry with no stem. Have the smooth bottom on the side it makes the mouse head. Next you take the two slivered almonds about the same size and you put them inbetween the cherry and the kiss making the ears. Optional you can put the red candies on for eyes and if it is near Christmas time can put one as the nose and make it Rudolf the Mouse. Sit them out to dry. The oreos if you get the white iced covered ones you can sit the mouse on those to dry and then you have Mice on Ice.
