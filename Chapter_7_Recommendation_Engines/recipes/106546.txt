Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
5 tablespoons Kentucky bourbon
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans
1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda and salt with a fork. Set aside.
Cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the bourbon. Stir in the flour mixture just until blended. Fold in pecans and chocolate chips.  Drop by large spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Cool on the cookie sheet for a minute, then remove to wire racks to cool completely.
