Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can chicken broth
1 1/2 cups rice
1 (10 ounce) can cream of chicken soup
1 cup water
4 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
1 pound boneless pork chops
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 3-quart casserole dish.
Stir chicken broth, rice, cream of chicken soup, and water together with a whisk in the prepared casserole dish until smooth; add Cheddar cheese, season with salt and pepper, and stir.
Lie pork chops into the rice mixture in a single layer; season with more black pepper.
Bake in preheated oven until rice in the middle of the dish is tender and pork chops are golden brown, about 80 minutes.
