Ingredients:
Crust:
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup butter
4 tablespoons white sugar
12 miniature chocolate-covered peanut butter cups (such as Reese'sÂ®), unwrapped
Filling:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
Mix graham cracker crumbs, butter, and sugar in a bowl until crumbs are moistened. Press into the bottom of each paper liner to form a crust. Place a peanut butter cup in the center of each crust.
Beat cream cheese with a handheld electric mixer until fluffy. Add sugar, flour, and vanilla extract; beat well. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Spoon cream cheese mixture over the peanut butter cups and graham cracker crusts.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set, about 20 minutes. Allow cheesecake cups to cool completely.
