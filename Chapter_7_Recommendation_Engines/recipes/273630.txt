Ingredients:
1 egg
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 pinch ground black pepper
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup crushed jalapeno potato chips (such as Miss Vickie'sÂ®)
1 1/2 teaspoons grated lime zest
2 bone-in pork chops
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 teaspoon margarine

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Whisk egg in a shallow bowl. Combine flour and pepper in another shallow bowl. Mix Cheddar cheese, jalapeno chips, and lime zest in a third bowl.
Toss pork chops in the flour to coat. Shake off excess, then dunk in egg. Coat chops in the chip and cheese mixture.
Heat oil and margarine in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Fry each pork chop until browned on the outside, 2 minutes per side. Transfer chops to a baking dish or foil-lined baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until pork is no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
