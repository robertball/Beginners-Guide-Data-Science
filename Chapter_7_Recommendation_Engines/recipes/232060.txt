Ingredients:
1 teaspoon salt
2 heads escarole, cut into 2-inch pieces
1/4 cup olive oil
3 cloves garlic, pressed
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Pour enough water into a large pot to be about 2 inches deep; bring to a boil. Stir 1 teaspoon salt into the boiling water; add escarole. Cook the escarole at a boil, pushing the escarole further into the water as it wilts, until it is fork-tender, 3 to 5 minutes; drain.
Pour olive oil into the pot and place over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes in hot oil until the garlic is soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir drained escarole and cannellini beans into the garlic mixture; cook and stir until the beans are hot, 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the mixture just before serving.
