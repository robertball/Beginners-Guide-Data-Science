Ingredients:
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup quinoa
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup coarsely chopped mint leaves
1/2 cup dry-roasted almonds, unsalted
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1 cup coarsely chopped kale
1/2 cup sliced carrots
1/2 cup sliced celery
1 scallion, thinly sliced
18 grape tomatoes, halved
1 lemon, juiced
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring the chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Add quinoa, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, about 13 minutes. Stir in olive oil; fluff quinoa  with a fork. Set aside to cool slightly.
Stir mint, almonds, dried cranberries, kale, carrots, celery, scallion, grape tomatoes, lemon juice, and lemon zest.  Season to taste with salt and ground black pepper.
