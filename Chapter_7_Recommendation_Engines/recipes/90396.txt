Description: 
A tried and true ceviche recipe to be enjoyed for a Sunday brunch in our cafe. It is believed by most Latinos that the best time to eat ceviche is on a sunny day. Rainy days cause stomach cramps and nightmares. Of course most Latinos (especially my wife) can make a good ceviche blindfolded on any day rain or shine, in my opinion. Excellent for an appetizer in smaller portions or as a meal itself. Personally I enjoy this with an ice cold beer on the side.
