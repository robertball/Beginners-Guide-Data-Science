Ingredients:
4 egg yolks
4 egg whites
1/3 cup sugar
1 tbs sugar
1 pint whole milk
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tsp freshly grated nutmeg (if not freshly grated then use 1 1/2 tsp)
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp vanilla
3 oz bourbon or Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum (don't add for non-alcoholic)

Directions:
In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the egg yolks until they lighten in color. Gradually add the 1/3 cup sugar and continue to beat until it is completely dissolved. Add the milk, cream, bourbon and nutmeg and stir to combine.
Place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat to soft peaks. With the mixer still running gradually add the 1 tablespoon of sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.
Whisk the egg whites into the mixture. Chill and serve.
