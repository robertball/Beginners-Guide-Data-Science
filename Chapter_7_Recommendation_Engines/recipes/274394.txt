Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
1 shallot, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
2 cups pipe rigate pasta
1 cup milk
1/4 cup whipping cream
nonstick cooking spray
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1 1/2 cups cooked medium shrimp
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/3 cup shredded Fontina cheese
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
1 teaspoon Creole seasoning
Crumb Topping:
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
1/2 teaspoon Creole seasoning
1 tablespoon butter, melted

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Melt butter in the pot. Add shallot and garlic; saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Hit Cancel button and allow the cooker to cool.
Pour in pasta and stir to coat with shallot-butter sauce. Add milk and whipping cream. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, for 10 minutes. Use the quick-release method to release remaining pressure. Unlock and remove the lid.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat an 8x8-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
Add evaporated milk, cooked shrimp, cheeses, seafood seasoning, and Creole seasoning to the pasta mixture; mix to thoroughly combine. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish.
Mix panko, seafood seasoning, and Creole seasoning together for the crumb topping. Mix in melted butter. Spread over casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 5 minutes. Switch on the broiler and broil until top of casserole is golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes.

Description: 
This macaroni and cheese gets elevated by the addition of shrimp. It partially cooks in the Instant Pot® and is finished in the oven. Please shred cheese yourself; if you use pre-shredded cheese, it will not be creamy.
