Ingredients:
1 lb. flaky white fish
4 Tbsp. fresh lime juice
2 Tbsp. vegetable oil
2 Tbsp. soy sauce
10 to 12 corn tortillas
3 cups shredded cabbage
For Lime Sauce:
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1/2 cup low-fat yogurt (or sour cream)
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 chipotle chile in adobo sauce, finely chopped )
2tablespoon finely chopped green onions
1 garlic clove, finely chopped or pressed Salt
For Mango Salsa:
1 bell pepper (red or yellow) finely chopped
1/2 small red onion, finely chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, deseeded and diced
2 just-ripe mangoes, peeled and chopped into 1/2-inch square chunks (we used papaya)
1 handful cilantro, washed, dried, destemmed, and chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
Juice of 1 lime
Salt to taste

Directions:
Fish Marinade: Combine lime juice with vegetable oil and soy sauce in a rectangular glass or ceramic dish. Add fish, turn to coat, and leave to marinate while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. Chipotle-Lime Sauce: Combine mayonnaise, yogurt, lime juice, chipotle chile, and chopped garlic in a bowl. Season to taste with salt.
Mango Salsa: Mix all ingredients together in a medium-large bowl and season to taste with salt. Remove fish from the marinade and grill or saute until cooked through. Warm the tortillas, either in the oven, microwave, or saute in oil. Set out individual bowls of the sauce, salsa, and shredded cabbage. For each individual taco, place some of the fish (breaking off chunks of the cooked fillets) on a tortilla, drizzle with the chipotle-lime sauce, and top with cabbage and mango salsa.
