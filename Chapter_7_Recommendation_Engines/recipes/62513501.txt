Ingredients:
2 cups all purpose flour
1 tsp. bacon drippings
1/4 tsp of baking soda
2 tbs. of frozen butter
2 tbs. frozen lard or shortening if you must.
3/4 tsp salt
1 cup of buttermilk

Directions:
Mix the all the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl.
Take a cheese grater and grate the frozen lard and butter and give it a little stir to blend.
Make a little well in the middle of the flour and add your cup of buttermilk and bacon drippings to the center and take the tips of your fingers and stir until the dough just starts to come together. Being careful to work quickly before the butter and lard melts. TIP: Do not overwork the dough it will make the biscuits tough and chewy. The dough will be sticky.
Turn the dough out on a floured surfaced and dust the top with flour and fold it over about 4 or 5 times no more than 6 times, again, do not overwork the dough.
Take a rolling pin and gently roll out the dough until its about 1" thick. Take a glass and cut out your biscuits by pushing straight down and through the dough and place on a very lightly greased pan (using lard) with sides just barely touching. Makes about 8 2,5" biscuits.
Bake for 15-20 minutes in a 450' oven until golden brown.
