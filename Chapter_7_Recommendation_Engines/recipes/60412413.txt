Ingredients:
3/4 cup lukewarm milk
5 tablespoons lukewarm water
3 tablespoons butter, softened
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 cup dried minced onion
1/2 cup oatmeal+
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 pkg active dry yeast
1 egg white
1 tablespoon water
1/4 cup dried minced onion
1/4 cup grated sharp chedder

Directions:
Mix the milk, water, butter, salt, sugar, onion powder, dried onion, oatmeal, 2 cups of flour and yeast into a medium bowl.  Remove the dough from the bowl, and knead in the rest of the flour.. Knead for the standard 8 or so minutes and let rise, covered, in a warm place for an hour or more.
Cut into 8 equal pieces, and form into balls. Gently flatten the balls until they are 4 inches in diameter. If they keep shrinking back, just let them relax for a minute before flattening. Place on a greased baking sheet, and cover loosely with a towel. Set in a draft-free place to rise until doubled in size, about 40 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk together the egg white and water in a cup. Brush over the tops of the risen rolls, and sprinkle with remaining minced onion and grated cheddar.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Cool completely, then slice in half horizontally before using.

Description: 
This is it!  I've been through many recipes to come up with this one.  Great for BBQ beef sandwiches.  If you prefer plain rolls, omit onion ingredients.Modified from: Soft Onion Sandwich Rolls
