Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
4 shallots, minced
3/4 cup fresh or frozen peas
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
6 slices ciabatta bread
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed
1 clove garlic, peeled

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet and cook shallots and peas until soft, but not browned, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until coarsely pureed. Mix in mint.
Cut ciabatta slices in half and drizzle with olive oil. Cut garlic in half and rub onto each slice.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place ciabatta slices on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.
Remove from oven and spread with pea mixture. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a fun take on bruschetta with peas, shallots, and mint that I invented one year when my neighbor brought me a bunch of fresh peas. I have also made it with frozen peas.
