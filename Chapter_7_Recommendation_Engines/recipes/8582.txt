Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
Â½ pound Monterey Jack cheese
8  jalapeno peppers
8 slices bacon
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch garlic powder

Directions:
Soak skewers in water for 1 hour.
Pound breasts between 2 pieces of plastic wrap.   It should be about 1/4 inch thick.  Cut in half lengthwise.  Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and garlic powder on both sides.
Cut cheese in to strips to fit lengthwise on pounded breast.  Put a slice of jalapeno beside the piece of cheese.  Roll the breast from the bottom, and set it down with the overlap down.  Wrap with a whole piece of bacon around the ends to keep the cheese in as it cooks.  Put on soaked wooden skewer.
Grill over medium heat until done.
