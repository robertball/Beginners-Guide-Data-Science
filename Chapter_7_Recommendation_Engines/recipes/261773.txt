Ingredients:
1 (18 ounce) package Hawaiian sweet rolls
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes with garlic and onion
1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
12 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
Glaze:
1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Place rolls, without separating them, on a flat work surface. Cut in half horizontally. Arrange bottom half in the prepared pan. Sprinkle 1 cup Cheddar cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.
Cook and stir beef and onion in a skillet until beef is browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain grease. Stir in tomatoes, 1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, 1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Cook until fully combined, 1 to 2 minutes.
Spoon beef mixture over rolls. Sprinkle remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese and bacon on top. Cover with top half of rolls.
Combine butter, brown sugar, 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, and 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover and microwave on high until butter is melted, about 1 minute. Stir until blended and pour over rolls. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top.
Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
