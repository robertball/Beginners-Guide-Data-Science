10 tablespoons butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
4 eggs
2/3 cup sour cream

2 tablespoons grated orange zest
2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
In a bowl, cream the butter with the sugar.  Beat in the eggs, then the sour cream, vanilla and orange rind.
In another bowl, stir together the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.  Beat into the creamed mixture just until incorporated and then stir in the almonds.
Turn the batter into a greased and floured tube pan.  Bake in a 350 degrees F (175 degree C) oven for 1 hour, or until it tests done with a toothpick.  Let cool on a rack.  Makes 16 servings.
