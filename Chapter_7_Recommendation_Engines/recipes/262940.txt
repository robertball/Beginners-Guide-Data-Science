Ingredients:
1 pound lamb shoulder, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
10 skewers
2 tablespoons ground cumin
2 tablespoons red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon salt

Directions:
Thread a portion of the lamb pieces onto a flat kebab skewer. Repeat with remaining lamb and skewers.
Preheat a grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place skewers on the grill. Cook, turning often and sprinkling with cumin, red pepper flakes, and salt, until nicely browned and meat is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes.
