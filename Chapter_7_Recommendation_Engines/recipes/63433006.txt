Ingredients:
1 cup chopped onion
5 teaspoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil (preferably extra-virgin)
1 1-pound eggplant, trimmed, peeled, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2 cups 1/2-inch pieces zucchini
1 cup 1/2-inch pieces red bell pepper
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
Pinch of cayenne pepper
four 4-to-5 inch-diameter portobello mushrooms, stems removed
1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley
1 10-ounce package ready-to-use spinach leaves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Mix onion, 3 teaspoons garlic and 1 tablespoon oil in large ovenproof pot. Cover; cook over medium-low heat until onion is very tender, stirring often, about 15 minutes. Stir in eggplant; cover and cook 10 minutes, stirring often. Stir in next 6 ingredients. Season with salt and pepper. Cover; bake until vegetables are very tender, about 30 minutes.
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, rounded side down. Cook until bottoms are golden, about 10 minutes. Turn mushrooms over; cook until just tender, about 6 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and 2 teaspoons garlic; cook until mushrooms are very tender, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat 1 teaspoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add spinach; stir until wilted, about 2 minutes. Divide spinach among 4 plates. Top each with 1 mushroom, rounded side down. Fill mushrooms with ratatouille.
