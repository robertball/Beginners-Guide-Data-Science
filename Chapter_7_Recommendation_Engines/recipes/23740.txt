Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
2 eggs, beaten

Directions:
To Make Pudding Batter: In a large bowl combine the flour, salt, milk and eggs. Mix all together with a hand beater just until smooth.
Prepare Yorkshire pudding 30 minutes before roast is done. Remove roast from oven and spoon drippings into a 9x9 inch pan, to measure 1/2 cup. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Return roast to oven. Pour pudding batter into pan with drippings and bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes.
Remove roast from oven; continue baking pudding for another 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool, cut into squares and serve with roast.
