Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound hickory-smoked bacon
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1 egg
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray.
Cut each slice of bacon in half, crosswise.
Mix together turkey, bread crumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, and salt in a large bowl. Form mixture into 1-inch meatballs and wrap each meatball with bacon. Place on the prepared baking sheet making sure the bacon ends are tucked under the bottom of the meatballs.
Cook in the preheated oven until meatballs are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Switch the oven to broil, and broil on high until bacon is browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
