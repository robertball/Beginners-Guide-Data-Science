Ingredients:
5 cups broccoli
1 lb bacon, cooked and crumbled
1 cup of cherry craisins
1/2 cup sunflower seeds
(more or less for your taste, and I like to toast mine before adding them in)
3/4 cup shredded cheese, I use sharp cheddar
Sauce
1 cup mayonnaise
2 tbs apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine first ingredients well, then mix the sauce in a smaller bowl and pour over the salad... chill at least a couple of hours or over night but if you make it the day before, make sure to cover it before chilling...!
