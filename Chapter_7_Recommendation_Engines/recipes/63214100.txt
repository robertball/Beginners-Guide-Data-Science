Asian Lettuce Wraps Recipe

Ingredients:
Rice sticks, dried and string-like
1 to 1 1/2 cups canola oil
.................................................
4-5 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, chopped in very small pieces (about 1/4 inch)
1 Tablespoon canola oil
1/4 cup teriyaki sauce (I like Great Value brand)
1/2 tsp. minced garlic
1/2 tsp. ground ginger
Head iceberg or boston lettuce
.................................................
Dipping Sauce:
3 Tablespoons hoisin sauce
2 Tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
1 tsp. vinegar
2 tsp. Sriracha
1/4 tsp. salt

Directions:
Heat 1 to 1 1/2 cups oil small pot.  Fry rice sticks a small amount at a time for 30 seconds or less.  They should puff up almost immediately. If not, then the oil is not hot enough.  Drain on paper towels and set aside.
Heat 1 TBSP oil in nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.   Add garlic, ginger, and chicken until chicken begins to turn white.  Drain liquid if necessary and add teriyaki sauce.  Cook and stir uncovered for 5-10 minutes or until chicken is done. Add a little water or more teriyaki sauce if it gets too dry.  It should have just a little extra sauce.
While chicken is cooking, make dipping sauce. Combine hoisin sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, Sriracha and salt.  Mix well.  I keep mine in a squeeze bottle which can be found in the cake decorating section of stores.  This makes it easy to just squeeze onto your wrap and other foods and it can be stored in the refrigerator for several weeks.
Serve chicken on lettuce leaves with hoisin sauce mixture or teriyaki sauce and fried rice sticks.
