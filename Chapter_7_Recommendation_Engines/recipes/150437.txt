Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (14 ounce) can EAGLE BRAND® Sweetened Condensed Milk (NOT evaporated milk)
3/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups finely chopped walnuts

Directions:
Combine flour, baking powder and salt. In large mixer bowl, beat EAGLE BRAND(R), butter, eggs and vanilla until well blended. Add dry ingredients and walnuts; mix well. Chill 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. On well-floured surface, knead dough to form a smooth ball. Divide into thirds. On well-floured surface, roll out each portion to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut with floured cookie cutter. Reroll as necessary to use all dough.
Place 1 inch apart on greased baking sheets. Bake 7 to 9 minutes or until lightly browned around edges (do not overbake). Cool. Frost and decorate as desired. Store leftovers loosely covered at room temperature.
