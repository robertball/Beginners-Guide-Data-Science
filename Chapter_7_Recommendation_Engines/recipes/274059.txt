Ingredients:
18 ounces chicken breast tenders, cut into bite-sized pieces
Chicken Marinade:
4 tablespoons light soy sauce
2 tablespoons Chinese cooking wine
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1 tablespoon tapioca starch
2 tablespoons cooking oil
2 medium onions, chopped
1/2 cup dry white wine (optional)
2 medium potatoes, cubed
1/2 carrot, cubed
7 cups water
1/2 (8 ounce) package mild curry sauce cubes (such as House Foods Vermont Curry)
1/2 (8 ounce) package hot curry sauce cubes (such as House Foods Vermont Curry)

Directions:
Combine chicken with soy sauce, cooking wine, and sugar in a medium bowl. Sprinkle tapioca starch over chicken and massage until well coated. Marinate for 20 minutes.
Heat oil over medium-high heat in a wok. Saute onions until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken, discarding excess marinade, and stir-fry until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in white wine. Add potatoes and carrot; saute for 3 minutes. Pour in water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium. Cook, covered, until chicken is tender, about 10 minutes.
Remove wok from heat. Break both types of curry sauce cubes into pieces and mix into the wok until cubes dissolve completely. Return wok to low heat and let curry simmer until desired consistency is reached, about 10 minutes.
