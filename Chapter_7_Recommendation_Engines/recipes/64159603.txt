1 large onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
4 hot italian sausages
4 cups chicken broth
1 28 0z can plum tomatoes
19 oz can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
4 cups chopped kale

1 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp oregano leaves

Directions:
Prepare onion and garlic.  Slice sausages into bite-size pieces. Coat a large, wide saucepan with oil and set over medium heat.  Add onion, garlic and sausages.  Stir often until sausages start to lose their pink colour, 5 min.
Add broth and tomatoes including juices.  Increase heat to high and bring to boil.  Meanwhile, using a fork, break up tomatoes.  Rinse and drain chicipeas, then stir in along with kale and seasonings. (If using spinach, stir in just before serving.).  When it comes to a boil, reduce heat to low.  Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until kale is tender, about 10 min.  If soup is thicker than you like, stir in more water or chicken broth.  Discard bay leaves and ladle soup into bowls, Sprinkle with parmesan.
