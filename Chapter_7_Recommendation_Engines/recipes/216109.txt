Ingredients:
3 turkey drumsticks
3 quarts water
2 large onions, chopped
4 carrots, chopped
3 stalks celery, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground dried sage
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
2 cups uncooked egg noodles

Directions:
Combine the turkey drumsticks and water in a large soup pot and bring to a boil. Stir in onions, carrots, celery, garlic, salt, black pepper, sage, thyme, rosemary, and celery salt; reduce heat to a simmer. Cook until the turkey meat is very tender, about 2 hours. Remove the turkey drumsticks and allow to cool. When cool enough to handle, strip the meat from the bones and tendons, chop the meat, and return to the soup.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook the egg noodles a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain. Scoop noodles into soup bowls and fill the bowls with turkey soup.
