Description: 
Eric and I took Megan's Granola recipe and changed it to our own liking. It turned out wonderful! We will give out samples and get some feedback on it. I kept in mind gluten free and that is why I didn't add the spelt flakes like we originally intended or wheat germ.Modified from: Megan's Granola
