Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups coconut
1 1/2 cups Sultana (light) raisins
1 1/2 lbs large gum drops each cut into 4 or 5 smaller pieces
2/3 cup flour
1/2 cup softened butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla
1 tsp lemon extract
1 19oz can crushed pineapple-undrained
2 cups flour
2 tsp baking powder

Directions:
In a a large bowl stir the 2/3 cup of flour into the cut up gum drops to keep them separated. Shake out any excess flour then stir in the coconut and raisins.
In a another bowl, cream the butter and sugar together.
Beat in the eggs.
Add the vanilla and lemon extracts and the undrained pineaple.
Stir in the flour salt and baking powder until well blended.
Mix the gum drop mixture into the batter.
Pour into 16 small loaf pans that have been greased and lined with parchment paper.
Bake @ 275 for 1 hr 20 min. I put a pan of water into the oven at the same time to keep cakes moist.
Remove from oven and cool completely. Peel parchment paper off and wrap in plastic wrap and foil to keep fresh.
Freezes well like this.

Description: 
My family doesn't like the peel in traditional Christmas cakes. An elderly lady that I met gave me this recipe-she makes 90 of them every year and gives them away as gifts! This is a very nice moist cake-not as dark as most Christmas cake and no bitter peel!
