Ingredients:
Crust:
3 1/2 cups refridgerated hash browns, or thawed frozen ones
1 beaten egg or 1/4 cup egg beaters
1/2 cup finely minced onion
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1/2 tsp garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
Filling:
1 tablespoon butter or oil
2 medium zucchini or yellow summer squash, thinly sliced.
8 oz sliced crimini mushrooms.
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste
Topping:
3 beaten eggs or 3/4 cup egg beaters
1 cup shredded cheddar or swiss cheese, or a combination of both
1/2 cup milk
1/2 tsp dried oregano, crushed
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl combine crust ingredients and mix well.  Spray a 9-inch pie plate with pan spray and transfer potato mixture to the pie plate.  Pat the mixture in the bottom and up the sides of the dish.
Bake, uncovered in a 400 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes until golden.  Cool slightly on a wire rack
Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees
While the crust is baking, cook the zucchini, mushrooms and garlic in the butter until the zucchini is tender crisp.  Do not over cook.  Season with salt and pepper as desired. Cool slightly.  Arrange the zucchini mixture atop the crust.
In a small mixing bowl, combine the topping ingredients.  Mix well.  Pour over the zucchini mixture in the crust.
Bake in the 350 oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until the filling appears set when gently shaken.  Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe to use up some zucchini, and because I'm pie-crust impaired I made a crust out of hash brown potatoes.  This makes four main dish servings or eight sides.
