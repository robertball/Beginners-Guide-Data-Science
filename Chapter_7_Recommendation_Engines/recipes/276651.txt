Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1/2 cup peanut butter
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 packets stevia sweetener (such as Truvia®)
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Line the air fryer basket with parchment paper and spray with cooking spray.
Combine pumpkin puree, peanut butter, eggs, vanilla, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, sweetener, and salt in a bowl. Stir until well combined.
Working in batches if necessary, place about 3 tablespoons batter for each pancake on the parchment paper in the air fryer basket, leaving about 1/2 inch space in between.
Place basket in the air fryer oven and cook at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C), without flipping, until the bottom side is fully cooked, 4 to 6 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
