Description: 
Make this classic lasagna recipe zestier by using hot Italian sausage or a little milder with regular Italian sausage.  Don't be scared off by the long cooking time.  The wait is well worth it. It's a great dish to make for a crowd and easy to adjust for varying tastes.  The leftovers are even better when reheated the next day.
