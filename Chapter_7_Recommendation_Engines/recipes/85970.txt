Ingredients:
2 cups basmati rice
1 (10 ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
2 3/4 cups water
2 large limes, juiced
2 tablespoons peanut butter
1/4 cup sesame oil
1 teaspoon fish sauce
1 teaspoon curry paste
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/4 cup flaked coconut, toasted
1/2 cup raisins
1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the rice, coconut milk and water. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the rice has absorbed all of the liquid. Set aside to cool down.
In a small bowl, stir together the lime juice, peanut butter, sesame oil, fish sauce, curry paste and garlic. Taste, and adjust the flavor of the dressing to your liking.
When the rice has cooled, stir in the dressing along with the coconut, raisins and almonds. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, and up to one day.
