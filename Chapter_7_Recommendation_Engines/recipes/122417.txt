Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons water
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 (1 pound) flank steak

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag or shallow glass container, combine the first seven ingredients; mix well. Add steak and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight, turning occasionally. Drain and discard marinade. Grill, covered, over medium-hot heat for 6-8 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).

Description: 
'This mildly marinated flank steak is my son's favorite,' reports Gayle Bucknam of Greenbank, Washington. 'I usually slice it thinly and serve it with twice-baked potatoes and a green salad to round out the meal. Leftovers are great for French dip sandwiches.'
