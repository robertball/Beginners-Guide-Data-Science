Ingredients:
¾ cup white sugar
½ cup unsalted butter, softened
1 large egg
1 ¼ teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking powder
½ teaspoon baking soda
¼ teaspoon salt
1 cup all-purpose flour
½ cup milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a cupcake pan with 12 paper liners.
Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla extract. Mix in baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Alternate adding flour and milk, stirring until just combined. Fill prepared pan with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned on top, about 18 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
These moist, tasty vanilla cupcakes are amazing! The vanilla flavor isn't too strong and the cupcakes aren't too sweet. They can be made really quickly, too, and in just one bowl.
