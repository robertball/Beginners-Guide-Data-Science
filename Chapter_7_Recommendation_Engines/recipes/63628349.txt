Ingredients:
2 cups cooked rice
3/4 cup egg substitute or 3 eggs
1/2 cup steamed bun flour*
1 ripe banana
pinch of salt
pinch of ginger powder
1/2 cup canned grated coconut in heavy syrup
Canola oil for frying.
Powdered sugar

Directions:
Set up oil in a frying pan on high heat. Lower heat when it reaches 325 to maintain temp. Set up some paper towels to drain the fritters.
In a work bowl, mash the banana.
Add the coconut and the egg.
Add the cooked rice. Combine all ingredients.
Add the pinch of salt, then slowly sprinkle in the steamed bun flour, turning to make sure it's incorporated, but not overly stirring it.
Drop larger rounded spoonfuls into the oil. Let cook for a minute or until brown. Turn the fritter over and cook until brown. Test the fritter by gently pushing on it. If it compresses, it may need a moment or two.
Remove from oil and drain on paper towels.
Serve with a sprinkle of powdered sugar over them.
