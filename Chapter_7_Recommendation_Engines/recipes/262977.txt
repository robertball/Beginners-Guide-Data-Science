Ingredients:
1 pound asparagus spears, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3/4 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
2 (4 ounce) balls fresh mozzarella cheese, cubed
1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add asparagus and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Drain well.
Whisk mustard, balsamic vinegar, and white wine vinegar together in a small bowl. Add olive oil and whisk until well combined. Season with salt and pepper. Add a little bit of lukewarm water if dressing is too thick.
Combine asparagus, tomatoes, and mozzarella in a bowl and drizzle with dressing. Mix well and sprinkle with basil.
