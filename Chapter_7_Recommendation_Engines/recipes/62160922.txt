Ingredients:
2 lbs ground beef
6 eggs
1/2 c Parmesan cheese
Pinch of salt and pepper
1/4 c seasoned bread crumbs
Oil to fry the meatballs
Love

Directions:
Heat enough oil over medium high heat in large pan to come up to half the meatballs (about an inch).
Mix the ground beef, eggs, cheese, and spices by hand until well blended.  Mixture will be very loose.
Form a small handful into a ball slightly larger than a golfball, and watch.  Meat will lose it's shape.  Put it back into the mix, and slowly add bread crumbs a Tbsp-ish at a time and mix.  Keep testing until balls barely hold their shape.
Oil is ready when a speck of meat mixture bubbles and fries.  As you make each ball, add them to the oil.
Cook 5 minutes, turn over, cook 5 more minutes.  Balls will be cooked "medium".  Drain on paper towel.  Add them to your sauce to finish cooking (see my Easy Tomato Sauce recipe).  Cook 3 or 4 a few minutes more and keep on the side to munch on while the rest cook in the sauce.

Description: 
My dad showed me how to make these.  Keep a few on the side out of the sauce to eat while they cook.  We're 100% Italian from Brooklyn, so these are the real deal!
