Ingredients:
3/4 cup imitation crabmeat
1 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 teaspoon sriracha sauce, or to taste
4 rice paper wrappers
1/3 English cucumber, cut into matchsticks
1 carrot, cut into matchsticks
1/2 ripe avocado, sliced lengthwise into 8 pieces
1 green onion, cut into matchsticks

Directions:
Shred crabmeat using 2 forks or in a food processor.
Mix crabmeat, mayonnaise, and sriracha sauce together in a small bowl.
Fill a shallow bowl with hot water to a depth of 2 inches. Dip 1 rice paper wrapper in the water for a few seconds to soften; set on a wooden cutting board or a clean, moist dish towel. Layer 1/4 of the cucumber, carrot, avocado, crabmeat mixture, and green onion in the bottom third of the rice paper.
Pull bottom of the rice paper over the filling, using your fingers to prevent it from spilling out the sides. Fold opposing edges of the rice paper to overlap the filling; roll up tightly towards the top. Place roll seam-side down on a plate. Repeat with remaining rice papers and cucumber, carrot, avocado, crabmeat mixture, and green onion.

Description: 
This is a cross between a spicy sushi crab roll and a spring roll. Quick and easy to make with fresh ingredients. Also good with shrimp instead of crab. Serve with ponzu or sweet chile sauce for dipping.
