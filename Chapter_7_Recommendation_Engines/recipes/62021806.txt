Ingredients:
3 c. unbleached all-purpose flour
1 scant tbsp. active dry yeast
1 tbsp. salt
2 tbsp. white sugar
1 1/4 c. warm potato water (or plain water if not available)
2 tbsp. olive oil
1 tsp. sage
1 tsp. rosemary
1/8 tsp. garlic powder

Directions:
Proof yeast in 1/2 cup potato water with 1 tbsp. sugar.  Let stand until creamy.  Mix 1 tbsp. sugar, sage, rosemary, garlic powder, and oil in separate bowl, then add yeast mixture and the rest of the water.  Add flour small amounts at a time, stirring thoroughly between each addition.  When Â½ cup flour is remaining, turn dough out onto surface covered with remaining flour and knead until smooth and elastic.  Form into ball, place in greased bowl, turning to coat, cover, and let rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled.  Punch down and form into loaf.  Place in greased loaf pan and let rise again for 1 1/2 hours, or until loaf is well-risen and fills the pan.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  When ready, turn down to 400 degrees and bake for 25 minutes, or until browned and done.
