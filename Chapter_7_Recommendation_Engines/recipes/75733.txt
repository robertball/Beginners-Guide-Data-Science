Description: 
This has the taste of yesterday updated to meet today's palates. I love this dressing and it was one of two signature dressings I used as the executive chef at a Washington, D.C. seafood restaurant. Great stuff. Don't be put off by the use of anchovy paste; it is not noticeable and the dressing is very memorable. Works especially well as a Caesar substitute!
