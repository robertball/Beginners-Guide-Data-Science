Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
20 cherry tomatoes, halved
7 ounces bocconcini (small balls of fresh mozzarella cheese)

2 tablespoons olive oil
6 fresh basil leaves
1 1/2 teaspoons fresh oregano leaves

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and cool to room temperature.
Combine tomatoes, bocconcini, olives, olive oil, basil, and oregano in a large bowl; toss to evenly coat. Add pasta to tomato mixture and toss.
