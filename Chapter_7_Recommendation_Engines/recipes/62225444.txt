Ingredients:
6 yellow-fleshed sweet potatoes
3/4 cup butter
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut sweet potatoes in half & place in pot. Cover with water & boil about 15 minutes or until potatoes are almost fork tender. Drain and cool.
Peel, and cut sweet potatoes into large chunks.  Place in a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt.  When the sauce is bubbly and sugar is dissolved, pour over potatoes.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, occasionally basting the sweet potatoes with the brown sugar sauce.
