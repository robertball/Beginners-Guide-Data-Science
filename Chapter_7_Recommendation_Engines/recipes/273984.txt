Ingredients:
2 Anaheim chile peppers
1 poblano pepper
8 dried chipotle chiles - stemmed, seeded, and halved
water to cover
6 cloves garlic
1/4 white onion
2 cups beef broth
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer (such as BudweiserÂ®)
1 tablespoon sea salt
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice, or to taste
1 lime
1 (3 pound) chuck tender roast

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; place Anaheim and poblano peppers on top.
Roast peppers in the preheated oven until skins are charred and bubbly, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat a dry skillet over medium-low heat. Add chipotle peppers and cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in enough water to cover the peppers; increase heat to medium-high. Weigh down the peppers with something heavy, like another pot, to keep them submerged. Simmer until tender, 10 to 12 minutes.
Remove Anaheim and poblano peppers from the oven. Let cool until easily handled. Peel and discard seeds. Mince peppers and place in a blender with the chipotle pepper mixture, garlic, and onion. Blend until smooth.
Pour beef broth and beer into a slow cooker. Stir in the blended pepper mixture, salt, cumin, pepper, marjoram, and allspice. Cut lime in half; squeeze juice into the slow cooker and toss in the lime halves. Add roast.
Cook on Low for 5 hours. Remove roast and shred the meat with 2 forks. Return to the slow cooker and simmer for 2 hours more. Use tongs to serve straight from the slow cooker.

Description: 
Juicy, intensely flavorful pulled beef barbacoa. For my money it's the best taco filling there is.
