Ingredients:
1 pound fresh green beans
1 1/2 ounces slivered almonds
2 tablespoons butter
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place beans into a microwave-safe casserole dish with enough water to cover the bottom. Microwave on high power until almost tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain in a colander and refresh under cold running water to keep the nice green color.
Heat a frying pan over medium heat. Add almonds and cook until just starting to turn golden, about 5 minutes, watching closely so as to not burn. Take pan off of heat and add butter to melt. Return to heat and add garlic. Mix in green beans, season with salt and pepper, and continue to stir until heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.
