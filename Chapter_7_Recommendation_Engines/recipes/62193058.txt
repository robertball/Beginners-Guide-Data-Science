Title:
7 Layer Salad Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 pound bacon, Fletchers thick cut original
1 large head iceberg lettuce - rinsed, dried, and chopped
1 red onion, chopped
1 (16 oz) package frozen tiny green peas
1 (16 oz) package shredded Cheddar cheese
1 QT (real) mayonnaise (see directions)
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (see directions)
Note: This is one of the few things I prefer making with the green can of Parmesan cheese rather than fresh grated.

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Crumble and set aside.
In a large bowl (See footnote), place the chopped lettuce and top with a layer of onion, peas, shredded cheese and bacon. Note: the order is important to the flavor of the finished salad.
Smooth mayo over the top until it is 1 1/2"-1 3/4" deep. Generally this is less than 1QT, but it depends on the size/shape of your bowl.
Cover with a thin layer of Parmesan cheese - depending on the size/shape of the bowl you may need more or less than 1C.
Seal bowl tightly (plastic wrap, lid, etc) and refrigerate at least 3 hours, overnight is best - to allow flavors to blend.

Description: 
I usually make this bacon, lettuce, onion, pea, cheese layered salad in a large flat bowl. There's never too much because everybody loves it!  You can vary the salad by substituting green onions for red, jack cheese for the Cheddar, etc.Modified from: Seven Layer Salad (custom)
