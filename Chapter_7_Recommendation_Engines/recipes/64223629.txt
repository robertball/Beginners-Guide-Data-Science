Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 cup veggie broth
1 cup dry quinoa
2 cucumbers chopped 1/2" cubes
3 cups washed diced lacinato (dino) kale
3 scallions thinly sliced (1/4" - 1/8")
4 med firm and ripe avocados cubed
1/8 cup minced cilantro
2 packages of cherry tomatoes quartered
1 jalapeno, de-seeded, minced
Juice of 1 lemon or Juice of 2 limes
1 1/2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
For the quinoa, make sure to rinse it thoroughly (I personally rinse 4 times with agitation), this will get rid of the bitterness that you can get if it is not rinsed well enough.
Bring the quinoa, water and veggie broth to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 20 minutes (no stirring or removing of the lid). Remove from heat, uncover and let sit for 5 minutes.
Spread out the quinoa on an aluminum baking sheet and place in fridge to chill. (Minimum 30 minutes)
Chop and dice remaining ingredients as called for. The time it takes for this is generally enough time for the quinoa to chill.
For the ideal flavor and texture of the kale, it is best to avoid veins, and to gently massage after dicing.
Once the  quinoa has chilled, combine all ingredients in a large bowl and mix well.
Makes enough for 3-4 adults as a main/stand-alone dish, 6-8 as a side dish.
I have added some creole spice mixture ( (~ 1-2 tablespoons) as well with success to spice it up a little more. The jalapeno adds a little heat, but since the seeds are excluded, it is suitable for those with sensitive palettes.
