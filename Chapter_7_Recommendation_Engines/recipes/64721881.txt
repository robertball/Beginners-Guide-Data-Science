Ingredients:
2 tbsps olive oil
8 oz cremini mushrooms, sliced
1 onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1 1/2 cups orzo
1/2 cup dry white wine
3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 cup frozen peas
1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano, or to taste
1/4 cup heavy cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
1. In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onion, cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 10-15 minutes.
2. Add in garlic, oregano, and thyme, cook 1 minute, stirring often. Add in orzo, and cook until lightly toasted, about 1-2 minutes, stirring often. Pour in wine and cook until it has mostly evaporated, an additional 1-2 minutes.
3. Gradually pour in chicken broth. Bring mixture to a simmer, cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until orzo is softened, about 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Remove cover and stir in frozen peas. Cook an additional 1 minute or until peas are warmed through. Remove from heat, add in Pecorino Romano and heavy cream, and stir to combine. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Top with additional Pecorino Romano before serving, if desired.
