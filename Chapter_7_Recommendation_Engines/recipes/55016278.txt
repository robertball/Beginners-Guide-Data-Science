Ingredients:
1 pd. Ground Beef
2 eggs
1.5 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon black pepper
3/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup buttermilk (or whole milk with squirt of lemon juice)
2 tablespoon hot pepper sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups lard or oil

Directions:
Combine beef and 1 egg, form into balls and smash to three large thick patties.  In large shallow bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, pepper, and salt.  In the separate bowl stir in the milk, egg, Hot Sauce, and garlic. Dredge each patty first in the flour mixture, then in the wet mix, and again in the flour. Let dry on prep plate for 5 minutes, pat the breading onto the surface of each patty so they are completely coated with dry flour.
Fry the patties in oil until evenly golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Place fried steaks on a plate with paper towels to drain.
Gravy - Pour out excess oil so that only about 2 tbs is left in pan.  Brown 4 tbs of flour mix in oil/lard in pan. Slowly add beef broth (or milk for white gravy) until the thick. Add more flour mix if needed to thicken. Season with garlic powder, salt and pepper.

Description: 
Use the same recipe for Chicken Fried Steak with cube steak - ground beef works just as well.  You can seasoning the ground beef as well as breading, or not. I make a large batch of the flour mix and use the same for fried chicken.Modified from: The Best Chicken Fried Steak
