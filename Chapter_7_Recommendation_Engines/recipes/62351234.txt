Ingredients:
Oil Pie Crust:
1 1/2 cup flour
2 Tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons cold milk
Pie Filling:
1 3/4 cups carrots
1 1/2 cups evaporated milk
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ginger
1/4 teaspoon cloves
2 eggs (add last)

Directions:
Crust:
Place all ingredients in the pie pan and mix well.  Press up on sides of pan to make the crust.  If a top crust is desired, double the recipe but mix in a bowl.  If making a two crust pie, divide dough in half, press 1/2 in pie plate and  roll out the other half between sheets of waxed paper.
Filling:
In a glass measure place 1 Â¼ cups water.  Add carrots until the water mark reaches 3 cups.   This gives you 1 3/4 cups carrots. Microwave the carrots until tender (about 10 minutes) then drain.  Place carrots in the blender or food processor with milk, sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger and cloves and process until smooth.  Add eggs and blend again.  Pour into prepared 9 inch pie shell and bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes or until a knife comes out clean from the center.  Serve when cooled with whipped cream.

Description: 
This is what I make instead of pumpkin pie every year.  Carrots are something I always have on hand, and are a little sweeter than pumpkin.  The pie crust recipe was given to me by an neighbor and makes this so easy to prepare.
