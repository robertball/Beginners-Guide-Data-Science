Ingredients:
1 Russet Potato, scrubbed and cleaned
1.5 teaspoons Seasoning Salt
Cooking spray

Directions:
1.  If desired, peel potato (I don't).  Slice potato in half, length-wise.  Slice each half lengthwise into 5-6 large fry-sized strips.  Optional:  Cut each strip in half.
2.  Put foil on a broiler pan.  Spray with cooking spray.
3.  Spread out the potatoes evenly on the foil.  Sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons seasoning salt, or to taste.
4.  Bake in oven at 450 degrees for 25-28 minutes (varies by oven - keep an eye out the first time) until crispy.
