Ingredients:
Crust:
12 oz.bag of frozen cauliflower
1 egg
2 TB shredded mozzarella cheese
1 TB shredded Parmesan cheese
1 tsp dried basil
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 TB health seed blend (flax/chia/hemp mix such as Trilogy)
1/4 tsp salt
Sauce suggestion:
2 TB olive oil
2 tsp. minced garlic
1 tsp. dried basil
1/4 tsp. salt
Topping suggestion:
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 TB prepared (sold in jar) bruschetta
1 1/2 TB feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400ºF and cover a pizza pan with parchment paper.
Defrost one 12-oz bag of frozen cauliflower in microwave just until thawed (not hot).
Place cauliflower into center of thin cloth napkin, then twist repeatedly and squeeze ball firmly with hands to wring out as much moisture as possible.
Use blender or food processor to crumble cauliflower (or chop very finely with knife). Place again in the cloth napkin and wring out as much water as possible. You should now have a lump of cauliflower pulp.
Place cauliflower pulp in a medium-size mixing bowl. Stir together with the egg, mozzarella, Parmesan, basil, seeds, garlic powder and salt.
Turn mixture out onto center of parchment covering pizza pan. Form into ball, then use palms of hands to gradually press flat into 8” circle. Use fingertip to compress edges to create slightly thicker, smooth outer edge.
Bake for 16-17 minutes on center rack, until top begins to turn golden brown. Remove from oven and use spatula to loosen from paper. Flip over and return to oven 5-6 minutes until golden brown on that side.
Use immediately as a pizza crust or cool for flatbread.
For pizza, add sauce and toppings then return to 400ºF oven until cheese is bubbly.

Description: 
A convenient, quick, low-cost way to whip up a yummy cauliflower pizza (or flatbread) for one. Buy inexpensive frozen cauliflower when on sale and thaw as needed to make a single crust. Uses just a few ingredients I always have on hand. The seeds are carried in the health section of grocery stores, even in my small town. You could leave them out, but I recommend them for added nutritionespecially  iron, fiber and protein.
