1 tablespoon olive oil
2 pounds small chicken thighs
12 ounces Merguez or spicy Italian sausage
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 onions, minced
2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch rounds
1/2 stalk celery, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1 rutabaga, parsnip, or turnip - peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
1/2 green bell pepper, cut into 1/4 inch strips
1/2 red bell pepper, cut into 1/4 inch strips
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (15.5 ounce) can garbanzo beans
2 cups chicken stock
2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon harissa, or to taste
1 bay leaf
2 zucchini, halved lengthwise and sliced into 1-inch pieces
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 cups couscous
2 cups chicken stock
1/2 cup plain yogurt

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken thighs, skin-side down, and sear until golden brown on both sides; set aside. Reduce heat to medium, add sausage, and cook sausage until no longer pink; set aside.
Stir garlic and onions into skillet; cook until onions have softened and turned translucent. Stir in the carrots, celery, rutabaga, green pepper, red pepper, diced tomatoes, garbanzos, and 2 cups chicken stock. Season with thyme, turmeric, cayenne, harissa, and bay leaf. Cut sausage into 1--inch pieces, and add to skillet along with chicken. Cover, and simmer for 30 minutes until chicken is no longer pink. When the chicken is done, stir in the zucchini, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.
While the chicken is cooking, mix 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) into couscous in a heatproof bowl. Bring 2 cups of chicken stock to a boil and stir into the couscous, cover, and keep hot.
Serve chicken stew over the couscous with a dollop of yogurt.
