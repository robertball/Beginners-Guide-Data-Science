Description: 
The last Thai restaurant I went to served almost all their meat dishes drenched in sauce with a scoop of white rice on the side to go with. All the sauces were amazing, and were either a curry or a peanut sauce. There are several peanut sauce recipes on this cite, but hardly any curry sauce recipes, so I tried to recreate the flavor.
