Ingredients:
1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/4 cup sweet paprika
3 tablespoons blakc pepper
3 tablespoons coarse salt
1 table hickory smoked salt
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
2 teaspoons celery seeds
1 teaspoons cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons ground cumin

Directions:
This rub goes well on any meat that goes on the grill. The rub should be applied a day in advance for large cuts and a few hours in advance for smaller cuts. Store the rub in a airtight jar away from heat or light. It will keep for six months. This is especially good using some smoking chips on top of the charcoal. Just soak the chips in water and then put them in foil on top of the coals.
