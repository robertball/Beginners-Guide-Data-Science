Ingredients:
1 cup warm water (110 - 115 degrees F)
4 1/2 teaspoons (2 packets) active dry yeast
1 cup warm milk (110-115 degrees F)
2 eggs
1/2 cup + 2 Tbs honey
2-1/4 teaspoons salt
5 1/4 to 5 1/2 cups whole wheat bread flour, divided
1/4 cup vegetable shortening or softened butter
Optional:  1 Tbs melted butter to brush tops of loaves

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. To dissolved yeast, add the warm milk, honey, eggs, and 3 cups of flour. Using an electric mixer, beat 3 minutes on medium speed. Cover and allow sponge to rest for 30 minutes.
Stir in the salt and enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. To avoid adding extra flour in the kneading process, gradually knead in the shortening or butter by hand. If using dough hooks, add shortening or butter and knead with the hooks for 12 to 13 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.
Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl; turn the dough to coat the top. Cover and place in an 80-degree F environment until the dough has risen and doubled in size. Deflate the dough. Re-cover and let rise again until doubled.
Deflate the dough, remove from the bowl, and divide the dough in half. Cover and let rise for 10 minutes.
Roll each half into a 14 x 7 inch rectangle. Starting at the shorter side, roll up tightly, pressing dough into roll. Pinch edges and ends to seal. Place in a greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pan. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise again until doubled in size.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bake for 10 minutes at 400 degrees F, then lower oven temperature to 375 degrees F and continue to bake for 25-30 minutes more.
If softer crusts are desired, immediately after removing bread from oven, brush tops with melted butter. Remove from pans and cool completely on a rack.

Description: 
This healthy bread will surprise you with its softness.  Letting the sponge rest for 30 minutes, then allowing the dough to rise an extra time gives it the light, fluffy texture you don't usually expect from 100% whole wheat bread.  For a nutty flavor and added health benefits, try substituting 1/2 cup of ground flax meal or wheat bran for part of the flour.
