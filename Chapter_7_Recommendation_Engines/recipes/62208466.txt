Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1/4 tsp. salt
1 cup unsalted butter, room temp
2 cups firmly packed light brown sugar
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa, sifted if lumpy
2 tsp. finely grated orange zest
1 tsp. vanilla extract
3 eggs
8 oz. bittersweet chocolate, melted and cooled to barely warm
3/4 cup (4 oz) chopped white, bittersweet or semi-sweet chocolate
About 1/3 cup granulated sugar (for rolling)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 - line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Whisk flour, baking soda and salt together.
In a separate bowl or stand mixer beat butter, brown sugar, cocoa, orange zest and vanilla on medium speed until well-blended (about 4 min). Add eggs, one at a time, beating briefly after each addition. Blend in melted chocolate, then blend in flour on low speed until just barely blended. Add chopped chocolate and blend 15 seconds.
Shape dough into 1 1/4" balls*. Dip tops in sugar and place sugar-side up on baking sheets about 1 1/2" apart.
Bake until cookies are puffed and cracked.  Cool on sheets 5 minutes before transferring to cooling racks to cool completely.
