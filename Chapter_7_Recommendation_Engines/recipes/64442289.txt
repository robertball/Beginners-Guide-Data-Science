Ingredients:
1/2 cup diced yellow onion
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 green bell pepper, diced

1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt & pepper, to taste
1 lb. chicken thighs
1 can cream of mushroom soup
3/4-1 lb. cooked spaghetti
3 cups grated cheddar cheese
a few splashes chicken stock {optional}

Directions:
Place onion, bell peppers, green chiles, cumin, garlic powder, salt, pepper, chicken, mushroom soup and 1 cup of grated cheese together in a crock-pot. Stir to mix ingredients. Cook on high for 3-4 hours or until chicken is fully cooked. Remove chicken, shred and return to crock-pot. Pour in cooked spaghetti and remaining cheese. Toss to coat pasta in sauce and melt cheese, adding in a few splashes of chicken stock where necessary to get sauce consistency you want. Cook another 20-30 minutes on low and serve.
