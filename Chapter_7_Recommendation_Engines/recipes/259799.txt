Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
3/4 cup dry quinoa
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/4 cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped zucchini
1/4 cup chopped yellow bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
3 tablespoons whole wheat flour, or more if needed
1 egg
salt and ground black pepper to taste
cayenne pepper (optional)
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly, about 15 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and celery; saute for 1 minute. Add zucchini, yellow bell pepper, and red bell pepper; saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes more. Set aside to cool, about 10 minutes.
Mix quinoa, zucchini-pepper mixture, and garlic together in a bowl. Stir in flour; stir in egg. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Mix in mozzarella cheese. Form into about 6 equal-size patties; place on a plate.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry patties until heated through and browned, 5 minutes per side.

Description: 
I made these with leftover quinoa and some vegetables I had in the fridge. Super easy! Great on a multigrain bun with some tomatoes, spinach, and your favorite spread! 

My 2 1/2-year-old said, I love it Mommy! If necessary, while frying, flatten the burgers with the back of your spatula (but don't make them too thin).
