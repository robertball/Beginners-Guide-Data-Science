1/2 cup ice cubes
4 1/2 ounces chocolate liqueur (such as GodivaÂ®)
1 1/4 fluid ounces peppermint schnapps
Green Whipped Cream:
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
3 drops green food coloring, or as desired
Chocolate shavings (optional)

Directions:
Fill a cocktail shaker with ice cubes. Add chocolate liqueur and peppermint schnapps. Shake vigorously for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour into glasses.
Beat heavy cream and vanilla extract in a chilled glass or metal bowl using an electric mixer until frothy. Add confectioners' sugar gradually, continuing to beat until soft peaks form. Beat in enough food coloring to reach desired shade of green.
Place a dollop of green whipped cream on top of each shot and garnish with shaved chocolate.
