Ingredients:
10 hot dogs
2 slices Pepper Jack cheese
10 slices bacon
4 cups oil for deep frying
10 hot dog buns
20 toothpicks

Directions:
Slice each hot dog 3/4 of the way through lengthwise. Cut each slice of cheese into 5 strips, and insert 1 strip of cheese into each hot dog. Wrap bacon snugly around each hot dog, securing each end with a toothpick.
Preheat oil in a saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Carefully drop the hot dogs in the hot oil, and fry for 1 to 2 minutes, or until bacon is brown and crispy. Remove from oil, and drain on paper towels. Remove and discard toothpicks. Serve on buns with your favorite condiments.
