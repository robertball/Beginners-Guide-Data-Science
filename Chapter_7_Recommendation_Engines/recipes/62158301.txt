Rhubarb Spinach Salad Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
2 Large stalks of rhubarb
1/4 c sugar
2 tbsp. sweet vinegar (I used a cranberry sugar vinegar that I made, but you could try red wine vinegar, too.)
1/2 lb of spinach--or enough to make two large salads.
6 tbsp. olive oil.

Directions:
Cut the rhubarb diagonally, into thin pieces.  Put it into a skillet.  Add the sugar, and just enough water to cover by one inch.  Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally.  Boil the mixture for two minutes, then strain out the rhubarb, saving the liquid.  Return the liquid to the pan, and place the rhubarb onto your bed of spinach.  Add the vinegar to the liquid in the skillet, and bring back to a boil.  Boil until reduced to about 3/4 c.  When it is reduced, remove from heat, and wisk in the olive oil.  Pour over the salad.  This will ever-so-slightly wilt the spinach, and give it a delicious dressing.
