Ingredients:
1 cup butter, melted
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
4 eggs
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup buttermilk, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Stir butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl; add vanilla extract and mix well. Stir eggs, 1 at a time, into butter mixture until smooth.
Sift flour, cocoa powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture, alternating with buttermilk, into butter mixture until batter is smooth, adding more buttermilk if needed to thin out batter. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe was created after I miscalculated a recipe for brownies. The brownies were horrible but the result was a perfect chocolaty sponge cake. I make it ever since and it's perfect for a layer cake, frosting or on it's own.
