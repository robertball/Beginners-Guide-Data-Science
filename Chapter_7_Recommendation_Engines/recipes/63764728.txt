Ingredients:
2 (2 pound) slabs baby back pork ribs
coarsely ground black pepper
1 tablespoon ground red chile pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
Barbecue sauce of your choice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degree F (150 degrees C).
Cut each full rack of ribs in half, so that you have 4 half racks.  Sprinkle salt and pepper (more pepper than salt), garlic powder, paprika and 1 tablespoon chile pepper over meat.
Wrap each half rack in aluminum foil.
Bake for 2 1/2 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.
Remove the ribs from the oven, and let stand 10 minutes.
Remove the racks from the foil, and place on the grill.
Over direct heat, grill the ribs for 3 to 4 minutes on each side.
Transfer to rib rack
Brush sauce on the ribs while they're grilling,  letting the sauce bake into the ribs --approximately 5 more minutes.    (Do just before you serve them adding it too early will burn it).

Description: 
Slowly baking these baby back pork ribs before grilling is the secret.  I like Sweet Baby Rays sauce and Buddy likes Mango Chipotle Barbecue Sauce.Modified from: Scott Hibb's Amazing Whisky Grilled Baby Back Ribs
