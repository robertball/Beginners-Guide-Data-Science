Description: 
My mom has been making this basic sloppy joe recipe for so long that when I asked her how she made them, she had to make a batch to be sure of the measurements. These are no fancy joes - nothing but lots of sloppy, zesty mess! Beef may be used instead of turkey. Perfect for potluck or game day. Serve on your favorite buns.
