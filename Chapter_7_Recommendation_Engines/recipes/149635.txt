Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons shortening, chilled
2 apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1 tablespoon milk
1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
1 tablespoon milk
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar
1/4 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Stir the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Use two forks or a pastry blender to cut in the shortening with the flour mixture until the mixture resembles coarse corn meal. Stir in the chopped apples.
Whisk 1 egg, yogurt, milk, and almond extract together in a small bowl until smooth. Stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture just until blended. Gather the dough, and place the dough on a lightly floured surface; knead 4 to 5 times. Pat dough into a 7 inch diameter circle about 1 1/2 inch thick. Cut dough into 8 wedges, and place on prepared baking sheet.
To make the scone topping, whisk the milk and 1 egg together in a small bowl. Brush tops of scones with the egg mixture. Sprinkle each scone with cinnamon sugar and almonds.
Bake in preheated oven until tops are golden brown, and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Description: 
I especially enjoy these scrumptious scones--bursting with apples, cinnamon and almonds--on a rainy afternoon with a cup of tea. Because they're made with yogurt and no butter, they're a good fit for everyone's palates. Hope you enjoy them, too!
