Ingredients:
1 pie shell
4 medium tomatoes, peeled
4 scallions
cut-up fresh basil
1/4 t. salt
Dressing:
1 C. Maoyonnaise
1 C. shredded cheddar cheese
1 C. Mozzerella cheese
1/8 t. black pepper

Directions:
Peel and slice 4 tomatoes. Put into a collander and add salt. Let the liquid drain off the tomatoes for approximately an hour. You can blot them as well to ensure the liquid is gone. Layer the slices into a pie shell. Cut up 4 scallions using most of the tops of the scallions and sprinkle them on top of the tomatoes. Sprinkle the basil on top of the layers. Mis the ingredients for the dressing. Then "frost" it onto the top of the pie. Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.
