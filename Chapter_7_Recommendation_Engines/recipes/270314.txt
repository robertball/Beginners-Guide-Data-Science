Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups milk
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup unsalted butter
1 pinch salt to taste
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Cook milk and flour together in a saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until thickened to the consistency of pudding. Bring to a boil; pour into a heat-proof container. Lay a piece of parchment paper directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.
Cream sugar, butter, and salt together in a stand mixer or using a hand mixer until sugar granules disappear.
Remove boiled milk mixture from the refrigerator and stir with a spatula to ensure there are no lumps. Slowly pour into the creamed butter, mixing on low speed until completely incorporated. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl. Increase speed to medium and beat until frosting is light and fluffy, 5 to 10 minutes. Beat in vanilla extract.

Description: 
Originally known as ermine icing or butter roux icing, you can change up the flavor with any extract you want to try. I love adding peppermint extract for a pop of holiday flavor.
