Ingredients:
1 lb. radishes, trimmed (about 20)
1 TB butter
1 medium shallot, minced
1/2 cup chicken or vegetable stock
1 TB honey
1 TB minced fresh parsley leaves (optional)

Directions:
Trim and halve radishes (lengthwise).  Saute shallot in butter until softened (about two minutes).  Add the radishes and stir - cook until well coated with butter (about one minute).
Add the stock and honey, cover.  Cook about 10 minutes.  Remove the cover, season with salt to taste, and simmer until liquid is reduced to a glaze (about one minute).
Garnish with parsley, if desired, and serve immediately.

Description: 
Braising the radish makes the white flesh turn pink and reduces the sharpness of flavor.  You'll be amazed by how good these are!
