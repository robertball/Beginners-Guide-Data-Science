Ingredients:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
6 cups shredded cabbage
3 cups olive oil
4 potatoes, sliced 1/4 inch thick
1/4 pound thinly sliced capicola
4 (1 ounce) slices mozzarella cheese
4 (1 ounce) slices provolone cheese
4 (1 ounce) slices Swiss cheese
8 thick slices Italian bread
4 thin slices onion (optional)
4 thin slices tomato (optional)

Directions:
Whisk together the mayonnaise, milk, white vinegar, and white sugar in a large bowl; add the cabbage and toss to coat. Chill in refrigerator at least 1 hour.
Heat oil in deep-fryer or large deep pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C); add the potato slices; cook until crispy and golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
Place a large skillet over medium heat. Arrange the capicola in four separate stacks in the skillet and top each stack with 1 slice mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, and Swiss cheese; heat until the cheese begins to melt.
Arrange 4 slices of Italian bread on 4 separate plates. Top each slice with a stack of capicola and melted cheese; about 1 1/2 cups of the cabbage mixture, 1 slice onion, 1 slice tomato, and about 1/4 of the fried potatoes. Top with the remaining bread slices. Cut each sandwich in half to serve.
