Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 cup unsalted butter
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1/2 tablespoon ground nutmeg
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat pumpkin, butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together using an electric mixer in a mixing bowl until creamy. Beat in eggs.
Sift flour, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cloves together in a separate bowl. Stir into pumpkin batter. Refrigerate dough for 1 hour.
Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place on ungreased baking sheets. Flatten each ball using a fork, making a crisscross pattern.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are golden and edges are set, about 10 minutes, making sure not to overbake.
