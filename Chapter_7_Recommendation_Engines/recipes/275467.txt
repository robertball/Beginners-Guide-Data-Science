Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
8  fresh tomatillos, husked and chopped, or more to taste
3  serrano peppers, chopped
1 cup white vinegar
1 cup water
½  white onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 pinch salt to taste
½ cup fresh cilantro, stems removed
1  lime, juiced
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend, divided
¾ cup sour cream
1 tablespoon dried minced onion
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
6  flour tortillas

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Season chicken with cayenne, salt, and black pepper.
Place chicken on the preheated grill and cook until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer to a plate and shred using 2 forks.
Combine tomatillos, serrano peppers, vinegar, water, onion, garlic, and salt in a large pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tomatillos are tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and chill in an ice bath until cool, 20 to 30 minutes. Add cilantro and lime juice. Blend salsa thoroughly using an immersion blender.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix shredded chicken, cream cheese, 4 ounces Mexican cheese, sour cream, 1/2 cup salsa, onion, and cayenne pepper together in a medium bowl.
Pour just enough salsa into a 9x13-inch baking pan to thinly cover the bottom. Place a heaping spoonful of filling into each tortilla, roll, and place into the pan. Try to keep them from touching. Top with remaining salsa and Mexican cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes.

Delicious variation of traditional chicken enchiladas. I like to make the tomatillo salsa and tortillas from scratch! We cook up the chicken on the grill for less mess. My hubby's favorite dish!
