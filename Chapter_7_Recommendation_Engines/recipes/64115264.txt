Ingredients:
6–8 pork chops, about 200g each
Olive oil, to brush
Marinade
2 tbsp Dijon mustard
4 tbsp wholegrain mustard
6 tbsp runny honey
4 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
4 tbsp light soy sauce

Directions:
Mix the marinade ingredients together in shallow bowl.
Add the pork chops and turn to coat well. Cover with cling film and marinate in the fridge for a
few hours or overnight.
Heat a griddle pan or barbecue (or grill) until hot.
Scrape the excess marinade off the pork chops and save it.
Brush the chops with a little olive oil. Cook on the barbecue or griddle (or grill) for 4–5 minutes on each side or until cooked through, basting with the marinade occasionally.
Rest the chops in a warm spot for 5–10 minutes
