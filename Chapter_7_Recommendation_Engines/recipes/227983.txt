Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup milk
2 teaspoons baking powder
4 cups fresh blackberries
1/2 cup seedless blackberry jam

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place butter into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish and place in the oven until butter is melted, about 5 minutes. Whisk flour, sugar, milk, and baking powder into a smooth batter in a bowl. Pour batter over melted butter without stirring.
Mix blackberries with blackberry jam in a separate bowl and spoon blackberries and any accumulated juice evenly over the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until blackberries are bubbling and cobbler is set, about 1 hour.
