Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 (14.5 ounce) cans beef broth
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO*TELÂ®)
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 teaspoons salt, or to taste

Directions:
Combine ground beef with onion and garlic in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add cumin and chili powder; cook 2 minutes more.
Drop cream cheese into the pot by bits and mash it into the beef with a big spoon until no white spots remain, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in broth, diced tomatoes, heavy cream, and salt. Cook until heated through, about 10 minutes more.
