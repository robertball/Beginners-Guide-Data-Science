Description: 
My family loves this slightly spicy marinade, we've even cooked it down and added tomato sauce and made it into a type of basting/barbeque sauce. Place steaks in a resealable plastic bag and pour marinade over the top. Allow to rest for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight for best flavor and tenderness.
