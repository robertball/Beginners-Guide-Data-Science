Ingredients:
1 CAULIPOWER® Three Cheese Pizza
cooking spray
1/2 pound ground beef
1/2 cup black beans, rinsed and drained
1/3 cup water
1/4 cup salsa
2 tablespoons taco seasoning
1/4 cup shredded pepper Jack cheese
1/4 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon Mexican-style hot sauce
1 cup shredded lettuce
1 Roma tomato, diced
1 jalapeno pepper, sliced (optional)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
1/4 cup tortilla strips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Spray a skillet with cooking spray. Cook ground beef on medium-high heat until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain off grease. Add black beans, water, salsa, and taco seasoning and cook for about 2 minutes more.
Unwrap pizza and place on a baking sheet. Spread meat and bean mixture evenly over the crust. Add pepper Jack cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes.
While pizza is baking, combine sour cream and hot sauce in a small bowl. Transfer to a small zip-top bag and place in the refrigerator.
Allow pizza to cool for about 5 minutes, then top with lettuce, tomato, jalapeno, cilantro, and tortilla strips.
Snip off a corner of the zip-top bag and drizzle the sour cream and hot sauce mixture over the pizza.
