Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
2/3 cup whole milk
2 eggs, beaten, divided
1 dash vanilla extract
1 cup frozen blueberries
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix flour, 1/2 cup white sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
Cut in butter using a pastry blender or fork until the flour mixture looks like cornmeal.
Pour in milk, 1 egg, and vanilla extract. Fold in frozen blueberries and mix sparingly.
Scoop dough onto the prepared baking sheet into 10 equal-sized amounts of dough. Do not flatten. Brush tops with reserved beaten egg. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar evenly over the tops.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
My daughter loves blueberries, so I make these scones for her. A lot of times, I will freeze the leftovers and heat them in the toaster oven for a warm breakfast treat which she really enjoys.
