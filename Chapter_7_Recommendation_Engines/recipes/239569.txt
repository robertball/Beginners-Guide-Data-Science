Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TELÂ®), drained
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
3 (15 ounce) cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained
1 1/4 cups brewed black tea
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala
1 teaspoon ground coriander
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in hot oil until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir tomatoes with green chile peppers into the onion mixture; cook until the tomatoes darken in color, about 8 minutes; add ginger and cook until ginger is fragrant, about 2 minutes more.
Stir chickpeas, black tea, lemon juice, salt, cumin, garam masala, and coriander into the tomato mixture; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, loosely cover the skillet, and cook at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the tea has nearly evaporated completely, 15 to 20 minutes. Garnish with parsley.
