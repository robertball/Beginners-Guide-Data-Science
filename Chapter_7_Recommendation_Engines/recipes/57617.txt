Ingredients:
2/3 cup milk
1/2 cup hot water
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon dried dill weed
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 cups bread flour
2 teaspoons bread machine yeast
1/2 cup grated Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup grated Asiago or Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select the white bread light crust setting; press Start.  If your machine has a Fruit setting, add the Cheddar and Asiago cheeses at the signal, or about 5 minutes before the kneading cycle has finished.

Description: 
This bread machine recipe turns out a perfectly textured flavorful bread every time. I prefer to let the bread machine cycle thru 2nd rise, then shape the loaf and bake in the oven at 400 degrees for 35-40 minutes. The dill cheese combination is great toasted and makes wonderful salad croutons.
