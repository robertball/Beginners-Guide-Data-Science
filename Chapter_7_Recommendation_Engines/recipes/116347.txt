In a saucepan, combine the brown sugar, cornstarch, celery salt and ginger. Combine the pineapple, water onion, vinegar, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, orange peel and hot pepper sauce. Gradually stir into brown sugar mixture. Bring to a boil; cook for 2 minutes or until thickened. Brush ribs with sauce.

Description: 
A friend shared this recipe more than 30 years ago, and I've been using it ever since. I make the ribs a day ahead and let the flavors meld, then I reheat and serve them the next day.
