Ingredients:
4 tbsp salted butter (add pinch of salt if using unsalted)
5 apples, best results with fugi and golden delicious
1/2 cup golden raisins
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon

Directions:
Wash, peel, core, and chop, the apples, into fine dice(or as small as you can get them without mincing).
Melt butter in large pot, when melted add the chopped apples, and turn to coat. Cook the apples down until a golden color, between 15 to 20 minutes, stirring frequently.
Once apples have cooked down, slowly stir in the rasins, water, syrup, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Turn heat down, bringing mixture to a simmer, and cook for 15 more minutes, until a thick syrup forms.
Turn heat off and let set for several minutes to thicken. Serve hot, or refrigerate and serve cold!
