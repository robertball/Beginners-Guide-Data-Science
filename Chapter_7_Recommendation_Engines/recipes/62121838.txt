https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 (8.5-ounce) corn muffin mix
1 (15-ounce) can cream style corn**
1 (15-ounce) can whole kernel corn**
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 tbs margarine, melted (optional)
1-2 tbs honey
pinch of black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  Lightly coat the inside of 2.5 quart casserole dish with non-stick cooking spray.
In a large bowl, stir together all ingredients until well blended. Pour into the prepared casserole dish.
Bake 45 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
Variation: Fiesta Corn Pudding.  Add 1/3 cup diced red, green and/or yellow pepper to the mix for a fun splash of color!
**Note: "No Salt Added" canned corn can also used to create a lower sodium option.  But if it's all you have on hand and you don't mind the sodium, for the best flavor, I suggest adding just a pinch or two of salt to taste.

Description: 
Many corn puddings and casseroles call for STICKS of butter, and lots of added salt or sugar which is absolutely not necessary!  This recipe misses none of the flavor but gets all the delicious goodness of a homemade corn pudding.
