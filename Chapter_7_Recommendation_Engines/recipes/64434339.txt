Ingredients:
12 Anaheim chile peppers, charred and peeled
1 pound Cheddar cheese, cut into strips
1 cup milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon canola oil
1/2 cup all-purpose flour for coating

Directions:
Remove seeds and membranes from peppers.  Stuff each pepper with a strip of cheese. Separate the yolk from the white.  Beat the whites until stiff and then fold the white into the yolk.
In a small bowl combine milk, the 1 cup flour, egg, baking powder, baking soda, salt and canola oil; mix well to make a batter.
Pour enough oil in heavy frying pan to reach 1 inch in depth and heat over medium-high heat.  Roll each pepper in the remaining flour and dip in the batter.  Fry until lightly browned on both sides.
