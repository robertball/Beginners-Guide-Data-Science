Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs. of steak
5 potatoes
1 onion chopped
4 cloves of garlic
2 cans of beef broth
1 can of cream of mushroom soup
1 cup of chopped mushrooms
1/2 cup of barley
1/2 bag of mixed veggies (or what ever you have laying around)
Season to taste with black pepper, salt, oregano, or what ever you like :)

Directions:
In a large pot bring 4 cups of water to a medium boil. Cut potatoes into quarters and place them in (make sure the water covers the potatoes). While the potatoes are boiling, cut steak into 1 inch cubes. Heat 1 tbls. of olive oil in a medium size pan and brown meat on all sides. In the mean time cut up garlic and onion and set aside. Add 2 cans of beef broth and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup to slow cooker and set to low then add 1/2 cup of barley. By now the steak should be close to done (if not, no worries) Let the potatoes boil until they're almost falling apart, then drain and add them to the slow cooker (the potatoes are the base). When the steak is done add the entire mixture (oil and juices included) to the slow cooker then last the veggies. If you're using frozen veggies I suggest waiting an hour or so to add them because they will cook a lot faster than fresh ones. Also add any seasonings you prefer. I personally like a lot of pepper and oregano, but that's the beauty of cooking! Hope you enjoy this hap hazard recipe!
