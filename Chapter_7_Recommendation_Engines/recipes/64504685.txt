Ingredients:
6 cups hot water
2/3 cup oil
1 cup sugar
2 tbsp salt
4 eggs
4 tbsp yeast (quick rising)
16-17 cups flour

Directions:
Dump the first 5 ingredients into a bowl and mix them together slightly.
Then add in the yeast and cover the bowl for about 10 min until the yeast has activated and looks puffy/foamy.
Add your flour in gradually. You want it to have just a bit of stickiness to it once it's all added in. Knead bread for a few minutes. Then spray a BIG bowl with Pam and place then dough in it. Let it rise in a warm place till it has doubled in size.
Punch down, roll out, and top with tomato paste (with pizza seasoning), pepperoni, and cheese. Roll up like a cinnamon roll and cut into 2 inch rounds. If making garlic bread rolls, roll dough out flat and cover with butter mixed in with Johnny's garlic bread seasoning and cheddar cheese. Top garlic bread rolls and pizza buns with grated cheese. Let rise again for an hour.
Bake at 350 for 22-27 minutes on parchment paper.
