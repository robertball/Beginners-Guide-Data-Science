Ingredients:
15 oz. ready-to-roll pie crusts
1 1/2 pounds Granny Smith apples; peeled, cored & sliced
1 pound pears; peeled, cored & sliced
1/2 cup dried cherries
2/3 cup + 1 tablespoon sugar (divided)
1/3 cup sliced almonds
1/4 cup flour
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees
Put 1 pie crust into pie plate and refrigerate until ready to fill.
In large bowl, gently mix together apples, pears, cherries, 2/3 cup sugar, almonds, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.
Pour apple mix into prepared pie crust.
Roll out second pie crust, cut out 6 evenly spaced circles or other desired shape with a 1 inch cookie cutter, reserving cutouts.
Place crust over filling and pinch top and bottom edges together.
Brush lightly with egg wash (1 egg lightly beaten with 1 tablespoon water) and place cut-outs randomly over crust.  Brush cutouts with egg wash also.  Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon sugar over pie.
Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then cover edges with foil and reduce heat to 350 degrees.  Bake for an additional 35 minutes or until nicely browned and bubbly.
Cool pie completely.
Serve with whipped cream.

Description: 
I found this recipe in a Woman's Day magazine and have made it for many special gatherings (especially Thanksgiving) and I get rave reviews every time.  I made it for a Thanksgiving gathering at Ronda & Scott's and their little boy Tommy (age 3 at the time) even wanted seconds.  ~ Gina
