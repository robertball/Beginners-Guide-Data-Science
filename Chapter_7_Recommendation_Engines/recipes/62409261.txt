Ingredients:
1 1/4 lb. firm to ripe peaches (I used 4-8)
1 TBSP fresh lemon juice
1 2/3 cup sugar
1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, melted
1 cup flour
1 TBSP baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup whole milk
Cinnamon or nutmeg for sprinkling (optional)

Directions:
1. Preheat to 375 with rack in middle position.
2. Score peaches by cutting an X on the bottom of each. Blanch in boiling water 10 seconds, then transfer with slotted spoon to bowl filled with ice and cold water. Once cool enough to handle, peel off skin, starting from X and discard. (If the peaches are fairly ripe, the skins will just slip right off. If they're closer to firm, you'll have to get out your paring knife.) Halve peaches, pit and then cut into real thin slices.
3. Transfer peaches to heavy saucepan and add lemon juice and 2/3 cup sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly, then boil, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes. Remove from heat.
4. Pour melted butter into 13x9 glass baking dish. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt and remaining cup sugar in a bowl, then whisk in milk until combined. Pour batter over butter -- DO NOT STIR! -- and then pour peaches over batter -- DO NOT STIR AGAIN! Sprinkle lightly with cinnamon or nutmeg and bake till cobbler is bubbling and top is golden brown, about 40-45 minutes. Cool in pan unil warm.
