Ingredients:
1/3 cup uncooked wild rice
1/3 cup uncooked brown rice
1/3 cup uncooked barley
1 clove garlic, minced
1 Tbsp butter
1/4 to 1/2 cup sweet onion, chopped
8 ounces fresh mushrooms (I almost never add this - never this much)
3 cups vegetable broth or water
2 tsp dried thyme (That's a lot -- I add less)
3/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
2 Tbsp minced fresh parsley (or 2 tsp dried)

Directions:
Saute garlic in butter. Add grains and saute for 2-3 minutes. Add onion, mushrooms, broth and seasonings. Bring to a boil.
Transfer to 2 qt. baking dish coated with nonstick spray. Cover and bake at 250 for 70 minutes or until rice and barley are tender. Uncover; bake 5 to 10 minutes longer or until liquid is absorbed.

Description: 
Gretchen's favorite. You can use any combination of grains to make 1 cup. I usually use the exotic rice blend from Motts's along with brown rice and some barley if I have it.
