Ingredients:
1/4 c. butter
1 onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/3 c. flour (more if needed)
1 c. half and half
2 c. milk
1 c. chicken stock
1 lb. broccoli, chopped small
1 carrot, finely diced (optional)
1 lb. velveeta cheese (approximate. You can adjust to your taste)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Saute the onion and garlic in butter until a nice golden brown. Add in the flour, and mix until a ball forms and holds.
Add liquids and whisk hard, making sure there are no lumps remaining. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low and add broccoli and optional carrot. Bring to a slow simmer and cook until broccoli is soft.
Stir in the cheese and add salt and pepper to taste. Let simmer about 10 minutes more before serving.
