Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 medium to large onion, sliced
1 lb smoked (kielbasa is good) sausage, sliced
2 tablespoon garlic powder (or to taste)
1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
1 teaspoon pepper (or to taste)
4 bags (16 ounce each) frozen black-eyed peas
1/3 lb sliced and chopped (raw or cooked and crumbled - your choice) bacon
8 cups water
2 cups cooked rice
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Dump all ingredients (except rice and cheese) into large stock pot.  Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Simmer over low heat for 1 - 1 1/2 hours. (If you don't have cooked rice on hand, then cook some rice while everything else is boiling and a'simmering!  And don't forget to grate some good cheddar which you can keep in the fridge until you're ready to serve.)  When ready to serve the peas, place in bowls with some cooked rice and top with cheese and serve.  OR eat alone - it's yummy!
