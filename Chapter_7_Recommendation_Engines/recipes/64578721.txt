Ingredients:
1 Tbs. Key lime juice, or fresh lime juice
2 tsp. canola oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tsp. chili powder
¾ tsp. ground cumin
¼ tsp. salt
¼ tsp. freshly ground black pepper
? tsp. ground cayenne pepper
1 pound firm white fish fillets
8 (6-inch) corn tortillas
½ cup Sour cream (or plain yogurt)
1-2 Tbs. key lime juice or fresh lime juice
2 Tbs. chopped cilantro
1 ½ tsp. canned chilis
1 c. thinly sliced Napa Cabbage
1 c. chopped tomatoes
½ c. sliced green onions
1 avocado, peeled and sliced
Salsa of your choice, optional

Directions:
Combine first 8 ingredients. Add fish. Toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate 15 minutes.
Mix together Sour cream or yogurt, lime juice, cilantro and chills. Set aside.
Wrap tortillas in foil. Place fish on a foil lined pan, sprayed with cooking spray, if baking, or directly on grill rack coated with cooking spray. Place tortillas and fish on medium-high heat grill or in 400 degree oven. Grill 3 minutes per side or bake approx. 6 minutes per side, or until fish flakes easily with a fork, taking care not to overcook.
Divide fish among tortillas. Top with Lime-Cilantro Sour Cream, chopped cabbage, avocado slices, chopped tomatoes, chopped green onions and salsa of your choice.
