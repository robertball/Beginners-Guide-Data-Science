Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add frozen corn; cook and stir until golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Stir in diced onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
Stir edamame, black beans, garbanzo beans, roasted red pepper, sea salt and cumin into corn mixture; cook and stir until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add cilantro and lime juice; toss to combine.

Description: 
A quick and simple plant-based, vegan salad that is great at room temperature or cold. I make this protein-packed dish for my kids' school lunch 2 to 3 times a month. I sometimes use small white beans when out of garbanzos, and add avocado and/or cooked quinoa, tomato, or cucumber to change it up or stretch it. It is great for picnics, potlucks, and kids' school lunches, and can be side or main dish, served on a bed of spinach, or in a wrap.
