Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups quinoa
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup seeded, chopped zucchini
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend

Directions:
Rinse quinoa. Transfer to a saute pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until dried, about 1 minute. Add oil; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add garlic; cook until grain begins to brown, about 1 minute more. Mix in diced tomatoes, zucchini, broth, water, sun-dried tomatoes, salt, and pepper.
Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to a simmer. Continue cooking until liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes more. Add Mexican cheese blend; fluff quinoa with a fork.

Description: 
This is a unique side dish which is low in carbohydrates, but satisfying. It went very well with a pork roast, and the next night my husband asked for the leftovers to eat with his fish.
