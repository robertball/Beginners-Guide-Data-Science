Ingredients:
3 large eggs
8 ounces plain, vanilla, or blueberry yogurt
1/4 cup frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed
1/4 cup granulated sugar if using unsweetened yogurt
1/3 cup canola oil, corn oil, or safflower oil
1 white cake mix with pudding in the mix
16 ounces frozen blueberries

Directions:
Grease and flour a 10 or 12-cup Bundt cake pan or a tube cake pan. Heat the oven to 325° for a dark-colored Bundt cake pan or nonstick pan, or 350° for a light-colored pan.
In a mixing bowl with electric mixer, beat together the eggs, yogurt, orange juice concentrate, sugar, and oil until smooth. Slowly beat in the cake mix. Continue beating on high speed for 2 minutes. Batter will be somewhat lumpy. Fold In Blueberries. Spoon into prepared cake pan.
Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, depending on pan size and color, or until browned and a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the cake comes out clean.
