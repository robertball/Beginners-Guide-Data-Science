Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package bacon
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated large flaky layer biscuits
6 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons milk
6 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels. When cooled, chop the bacon.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Separate biscuits and pull each biscuit into halves. Press 2 biscuit halves into a muffin cup, molding the dough to the inside to make a dough cup. Repeat with remaining dough to make 12 biscuit cups.
Whisk eggs and milk together in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Spoon each biscuit cup about half full of egg mixture and top with about 1 tablespoon bacon and about 1 1/2 teaspoon Cheddar cheese per biscuit.
Bake in the preheated oven until the biscuit crust is browned, the cheese is melted and bubbling, and the egg center is set, about 20 minutes.
