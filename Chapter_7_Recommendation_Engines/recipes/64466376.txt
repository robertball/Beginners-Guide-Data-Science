Dinomite's Fluffy Bites Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup corn syrup (white)
4 cups sugar
3/4 cup water (cold)
3 egg whites
1 tsp Almond extract (or regular pure, not imitation)
2 cups chopped pecans (or hazelnuts)

Directions:
First, get a heavy saucepan and place over medium heat. Add the corn syrup, water and sugar and stir together until sugar (and only the sugar) has dissolved. Stop stirring and cook until it becomes like a hard ball (around 250 degrees if you've got a candy thermometer)
While the saucepan is on, beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks, similar to merengue. Once the above syrup reaches 250 degrees, add it to the egg whites and continue beating on high. It's important to keep this going while adding the syrup as you don't want the eggs to "cook" while being added. Add the vanilla and continue beating for another five to six minutes. Add the almonds and mix. (Don't get too crazy with the mixing, as the oil of the nuts can ruin the recipe)
All that's left is to take a spoonful of the mixture and place on wax paper. I recommend using two spoons, one larger than the other. You can scoop the candy and then scrape it off with the other spoon, twirling as you go to get a cool sundae-like effect.
This recipe is similar to other recipes but with a few tweaks and tips to make it perfect! An alternate version is to use chopped almonds and vanilla extract. DINOMITE!
