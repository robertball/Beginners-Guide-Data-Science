2 medium onions, chopped
2 stalks celery, sliced
1 large green bell pepper, coarsely chopped
6 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons Creole seasoning

Place chicken broth, tomatoes, onions, celery, bell pepper, garlic, and Creole seasoning in the bottom of a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker. Cover and cook on High for 4 to 5 hours, or Low for 8 to 10 hours.
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat during the last 50 minutes of cooking time. Add andouille sausage and turkey kielbasa to the skillet and cook, turning occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir sausage and rice into the slow cooker.
