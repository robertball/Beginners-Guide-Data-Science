Ingredients:
1 cup chopped dried figs
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
3/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2/3 cup chopped kalamata olives
2 cloves garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste
1/3 cup chopped toasted walnuts
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
3 ounces of pecorino cheese

Directions:
Combine figs and water and 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, and liquid has reduced. Remove from heat, and stir in the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, rosemary, thyme, and cayenne. Add olives and garlic, and mix well. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Cover, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight to allow flavors to blend. Pulse in the food processor to marry the flavors even more and smoooth out the tapenade, if desired.
Unwrap cream cheese block, and place on a serving platter. Spoon 1/2 the tapenade over cheese, and sprinkle with walnuts. Serve with slices of French bread or crackers.Substitute marscapone for the cream cheese, if desired. You can also serve little bits of pecorino with it as figs and pecorino are delicious together!
