Ingredients:
olive oil cooking spray
1 butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch pieces
1 large sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 (10 ounce) package frozen Brussels sprouts, thawed and halved
1 onion, halved and thickly sliced
1 parsnip, peeled and sliced
3 carrots, cut into large chunks
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
1 teaspoon ground thyme
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 pinch salt
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Combine butternut squash, sweet potato, Brussels sprouts, onion, parsnip, and carrots in a large bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat. Add thyme, rosemary, salt, and black pepper; toss again. Transfer coated vegetables to the prepared baking sheet.
Roast vegetables in the preheated oven for 25 minutes; stir and continue roasting until vegetables are slightly brown and tender, about 20 more minutes.

Description: 
I wanted a vegetable medley good for the fall. I took 3 recipes and changed them up to the following recipe. This recipe is good when reheated in the microwave, or I have frozen some and used later.
