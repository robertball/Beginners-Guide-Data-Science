Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds parsnips, peeled and julienned
1/4 cup butter
2 pounds carrots, julienned
2 tablespoons dried minced onion

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute parsnips in butter for 3-4 minutes. Add carrots and onion; cook and stir until vegetables are tender, about 10-15 minutes.

Description: 
Orange carrot slivers and yellow parsnips make a pretty and different side dish. If parsnips aren't available, you could substitute rutabagas or turnips. Usually, I saute the vegetables until they are crisp-tender. But they're also good quite well-cooked, almost browned.                                                             --Lavonne Hartel                                                          Williston, North Dakota
