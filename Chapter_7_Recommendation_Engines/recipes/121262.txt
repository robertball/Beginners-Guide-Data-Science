Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
2 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoons salt
6 cups all-purpose flour
1 egg
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the sugar, salt and 2 cups flour. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add egg and shortening; mix well. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (do not knead). Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Punch dough down and divide into four portions into a 14-in. x 12-in. rectangle. Spread 2 tablespoons butter over dough. Fold in half lengthwise; cut into 12 strips. Tie each strip into a knot; tuck and pinch ends under. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough.
Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.

Description: 
My mom, Velma Perkins, loved to serve these light, golden rolls when I was growing up on our Iowa farm. They're extra nice since they require no kneading. The dough rises in the refrigerator overnight, so there's little last-minute fuss to serve fresh hot rolls with any meal.                 --Toni Hilscher                                                                  Omaha, Nebraska
