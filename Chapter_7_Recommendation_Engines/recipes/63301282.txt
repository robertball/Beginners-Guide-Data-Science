Ingredients:
For Pork
2 pounds pasture-raised pork loin (4 loins)
3 cloves of garlic, crushed and peeled
1-2 chipotle peppers in adobo, from a can
The grated zest of one lime
Herbs such as a bit of fresh or dried oregano and/or thyme (optionalI didn't have any on hand)
Sea salt, freshly ground black pepper
Olive oil
For Salsa
4 ripe peaches
1 small clove of garlic
1-2 fresh hot chile peppers, such as serranos
Sea salt, freshly ground black pepper
Extra-virgin olive oil
The lime you zested for the pork marinade
For gazpacho
6 medium, ripe tomatoes
A few thick slices of red onion
1 clove of garlic, crushed and peeled
1-2 serrano peppers
Sea salt, freshly ground black pepper
To serve
13 corn tortillas
8-10 lime slices

Directions:
Marinade—at least 2 hours in advance or night before
In blender-garlic,chipotle,lime zest,generous pinch salt, and a vigorous grind of black pepper. With the machine whirring, add a thin stream of olive oil until you have a smooth emulsion. Should be good and salty. Marinade loins until an hour before cooking.
Peach salsa-Peel the peaches, chop it coarsely. Mince the garlic and 1 serrano very fine with a pinch salt into a paste and add to peaches. Add a glug of olive oil and a good squeeze of lime, stir. add some of the other serrano if you want more of a kick. set aside.
Lay the loins hot side of the grill. Let them sear until they're good and brown, and then move them to the cool side. Now the grill the tomatoes and onion slices for the gazpacho on the hot side of the grill. Cover it. The loins will now cook slowly on the cool side and pick up some smoke-flip the tomatoes when they're good and charred. Move the tomatoes and onion slices to a blender(Don't worry about coring them.) Grill the tortillas on the hot side. Swaddle them in a kitchen towel.
To the charred tomatoes and onion, add the chile(s), the garlic, a pinch of salt, and a generous grind of pepper, a few ice cubes, and one of those grilled tortillas, torn in half. Blend until everything is smooth. Taste and adjust for seasoning.
To serve, cut the pork into thin slices, at an angle, and place on a serving plate. Divide the gazpacho into four bowls, adding an ice cube to each to chill it down a bit, and garnish each with a drizzle of olive oil. Let everyone assemble his or her own tacos, garnishing with peach salsa. Have someone else make a side dish—my friend made a lovely one of thinly sliced summer squash and zucchini, lightly baked and finished with shaved hard cheese.
