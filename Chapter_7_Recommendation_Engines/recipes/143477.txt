Description: 
A sweet and salty brine is the secret to this Asian-inspired pork tenderloin. Let the pork tenderloin soak in the brine for 2 to 8 hours to become tender, juicy, and flavorful. Grill and serve the sliced tenderloin with the Asian glaze. Complete the meal with brown rice, glazed carrots, and steamed green vegetables.
