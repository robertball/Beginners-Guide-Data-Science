1/4 cup finely shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning

1/8 teaspoon onion powder
1 (1 pound) loaf frozen white bread dough, thawed
1/4 cup butter or stick margarine, melted

Directions:
In a shallow bowl, combine the first five ingredients; set aside.  Divide dough into 16 pieces; roll each into a 6-in. rope. Dip ropes in butter, then roll in cheese mixture. Place 2 in. apart on a greased baking sheet. Let rest for 10 minutes. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.
