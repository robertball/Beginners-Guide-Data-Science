Ingredients:
2 large baking potatoes
6 slices bacon
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Place the potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender when pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes. Drain, and cool.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Drain, cool, and crumble.
Slice the potatoes into 1/4 inch rounds, and arrange them in a single layer on the baking sheet. Sprinkle a few crumbles of bacon onto each round, then top with some shredded Cheddar cheese.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is melted and lightly browned.

Description: 
Baked potato rounds are topped with bacon and cheese. Great appetizer - a lot like potato skins but easier to make!
