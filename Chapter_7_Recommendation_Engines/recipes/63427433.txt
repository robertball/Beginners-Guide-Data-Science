Ingredients:
1-1/2 cup sifted all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
2 egg
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 apples peeled and chopped
1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg; set aside.
In a large bowl, mix together melted butter, brown sugar, and cup of white sugar with a wooden spoon until smooth. Stir in the egg and vanilla. Blend in the flour mixture until just combined, then stir in the apples and walnuts. Spread the mixture evenly into the prepared pan. In a cup or small bowl, stir together the remaining cinnamon and sugar; sprinkle over the top of the bars.
Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until done in preheated oven; finished bars should spring back when lightly touched. Cool in the pan, and cut into squares.
