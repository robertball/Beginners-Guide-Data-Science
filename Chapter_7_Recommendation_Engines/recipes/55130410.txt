Ingredients:
2 cups oat flour
2 scoops protein powder (soy or whey)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
4 egg whites
2 cups sugar substitute (like splenda)
3/4 cup fat free ricotta cheese
2 teaspoons vanilla
1 teaspoon butter flavor
3/4 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and grease an 8x8 inch square baking dish.
In small bowl stir together oat flour, cocoa powder, protein powder, salt and baking soda in a bowl, sifting with a fork to remove lumps and set aside.  Whisk egg whites and sugar substitute until fluffy.  Then mix in ricotta cheese, vanilla, butter flavor and water.  Using a large spoon, add in the dry mixture and water. Alternating each until well incorporated and the mixture forms a smooth batter, 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape the batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the brownies comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
