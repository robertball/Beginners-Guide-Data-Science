Ingredients:
1/2 lb ditalini pasta
3 tsp olive oil
2 tbsp butter
1/2 cup white onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups asparagus, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
1/4 cup white cooking wine
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
2 tsp fresh ground pepper
1/2 cup pistachios, chopped
1 cup Dubliner or other aged sharp cheddar cheese, grated

Directions:
Boil water for pasta.
While water is boiling, chop/dice ingredients.
In a large skillet, melt 2 tbsp butter.
When butter is melted, add white wine, cider vinegar, and pepper; then add onion.  Cook about 5 minutes over medium heat.
While onion cooks, heat 2 tsp oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat.  Add garlic and cook 4-5 minutes.
Add pasta to boiling water with 1 tsp oil, cook about 10-12 minutes or until al dente.
Add asparagus to onion and saute about 10 minutes, or until tender but still firm.
While pasta and asparagus cook, add pistachios to garlic and stir to coat.  Cook over medium-low for 5-7 minutes, then roast on high for about 2 minutes or until toasted.
Drain pasta and remove asparagus from heat.  Add pasta to asparagus mixture and toss to coat.
Dish out pasta.  Top with 2 tbsp pistachio garlic mixture and 1/4 cup of grated cheese.

Description: 
This dish is great because it's quick and satisfying without being too heavy.  The white wine and onion provide a sweet flavor which is nicely offset by the tart cheese.  The roasted garlic and pistachios provide depth and crunch without overwhelming the other flavors.
