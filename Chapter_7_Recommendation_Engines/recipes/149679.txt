Ingredients:
2 cups mashed potatoes
6 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
1/4 cup sliced green onions
8 flour tortillas
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons softened butter
1 cup salsa
1/4 cup sour cream

Directions:
Stir together the mashed potatoes, bacon, and green onions. Spread the mashed potato mixture onto one side of half of the tortillas, spreading to within 1/2 inch of the edges. Sprinkle the shredded cheese on top of the mashed potatoes and top with the remaining tortillas. Lightly butter each side of the quesadillas.
Preheat a large skillet over medium heat. Place a quesadilla into the preheated pan, and cook until golden brown and crispy, then turn over, and continue cooking on the other side until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining quesadillas. Serve with salsa and sour cream.

Description: 
I had something like this at a restaurant last night and I had to try to duplicate it at home! It reminds me of a perogies! I think that this recipe can really be played up with just about anything you like with potatoes! This can be a super fast meal if you use the heat and serve bacon and premade mashed potatoes!
