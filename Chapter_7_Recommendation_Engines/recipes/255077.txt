Ingredients:
2 English cucumbers, peeled
1 teaspoon salt, divided, or to taste
2 tablespoons garlic-seasoned rice wine vinegar
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Cut cucumbers into long, thin noodle shapes using a spiralizer set to the thinnest setting.
Place cucumber noodles in a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and toss until combined. Let cucumber stand until moisture is drawn out, about 30 minutes.
Whisk rice vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, and sugar together in a bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add cucumber; toss gently until coated. Season with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt; sprinkle with sesame seeds.
