Description: 
This chile paste is spicy but not to an extreme. It has a sweet, smokey flavor to it that is great for recipes calling for chile paste or mixing with Ranch dressing for a spicy dip. I use this in a recipe of mine for baked beans that gives it a nice little kick without being overbearing.
