Ingredients:
Get a foil lasagna pan and a NEW pooper scooper or a slotted spatula
1 any flavor cake mix - we use yellow
1 extra egg
1 can fruit cocktail (drained)
1 can cherry pie filling
1/4 c shredded coconut
1/4 c chopped walnuts
1 can chocolate frosting
1 package Pecan Sandies
a couple dozen tootsie rolls

Directions:
Prepare cake mix as directed, but add an extra egg, the cherry pie filling, the nuts, coconut and fruit cocktail (you can use the strained juice in place of the water in the mix if you like.) and pour into the lasagna pan.
Bake the cake as directed.
Once the cake has cooled, spread the chocolate frosting over the top (don't worry if it gets on the sides of the pan it just adds to the effect)
Crumble Pecan Sandies to get enough "litter" to cover the frosting.
Use your fingers to sculpt the tootsie rolls into "deposits." You can even melt one or two in the microwave and pour it into the litter for a touch of extra gross :D
Serve with the pooper scooper.

Description: 
've made this for years. I've even gotten requests for it for Halloween and April Fool's Day from people I worked with. One of my coworkers said This is the most wonderfully disgusting thing I've ever put in my mouth.  BTW - the cake itself is delicious so you don't have to decorate it as a cat box - just slather your favorite frosting on and go for it.
