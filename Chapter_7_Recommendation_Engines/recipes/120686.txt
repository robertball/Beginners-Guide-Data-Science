Ingredients:
3/4 cup raisins
1/3 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons honey
3 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 (12 ounce) package refrigerated buttermilk biscuits
GLAZE:
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the raisins, nuts, sour cream, honey, 2 tablespoons butter, cinnamon and lemon peel; set aside.
Separate the biscuit dough into 10 pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece into a 6-in. oval. Place a rounded tablespoonful of raisin mixture on each. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a short side; seal seam. Place roll-ups seam side down on an ungreased baking sheet.
Melt remaining butter; brush over dough. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 2 minutes. Combine confectioners; sugar, vanilla and enough milk to achieve drizzling consistency; drizzle over rolls. Serve warm.
