Description: 
Here's a smooth and tasty alternative to regular Caesar dressing. This recipe has stood the test of time in my kitchen, and is requested often. It tastes best on Romaine tossed with 'Spring Mix' lettuces. The dressing will keep up to two weeks in the refrigerator in an air-tight container.
