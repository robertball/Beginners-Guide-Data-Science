Ingredients:
1/2 cup coconut oil
1 cup light corn syrup
2 cups brown sugar
1 tsp salt
11.25 oz canned Sweetened Condensed Coconut Milk
2 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Place oil, corn syrup, brown sugar, and salt in a sturdy pot and place on the stove over medium high heat (7). Using a candy thermometer, heat contents to 270 degrees F, stir occasionally. Add in the sweetened condensed milk, mix well and then bring back to 270 degrees F. Once caramel reaches 270, take off the heat and allow to cool for 1 minute before mixing in the vanilla. Pour hot caramel over popcorn, mix and serve.
For a less sticky option, preheat oven to 250. Divide the caramel popcorn between two cookie sheets lined with parchment or silpat. Bake the popcorn for 40 minutes while mixing, turning and switching racks every 10 minutes. When done, allow to cool on parchment paper.
