Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 bananas, mashed
2/3 cup brown sugar
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/3 cup melted butter or margarine
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 10 muffin cups, or line with muffin papers.
In a large bowl, mix together 1 1/2 cups flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, beat together bananas, sugar, egg and melted butter. Stir the banana mixture into the flour mixture just until moistened. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice.
Bake in preheated oven for 18 to 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean.

Description: 
Instead of making a streusel topping I like to keep it simple by spicing up a little brown sugar with pumpkin pie spice. I keep this on hand and use in many of my baking recipes in place of plain old cinnamon. The depth of flavor the added spices contribute are intense as well as a thrifty way to keep many spices stocked in one handy jar.Modified from: Banana Crumb Muffins
