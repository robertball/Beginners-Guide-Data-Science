Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 pound bacon, cut into small pieces
2 onions, chopped
1/4 cup chopped shallots
1 leek, sliced
2 stalks celery, chopped, with leaves
5 cloves garlic, sliced
2 cups dry mixed beans, soaked overnight
3 carrots, sliced
1 turnips, cubed
1/2 small head cabbage, finely shredded
4 quarts vegetable stock
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Stir in the bacon and saute just to render the fat out of the bacon; do not cook till crisp. Then add the onions, shallots, leek, celery and garlic and saute for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
Then, add the beans, carrots, turnip and cabbage along with enough vegetable stock to cover (about 4 quarts). Let simmer for 2 hours, or until vegetables are to desired tenderness. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Hearty vegetable soup for a crowd. Makes about 5 to 7 quarts of soup, enough for 15 people as a meal. Great with crusty rye bread and even better if made the day before it is served.
