Ingredients:
For Soup:
1 turkey carcass
8 cups of chicken broth
4 cups of water
2 Tbsp lemon juice
5 carrots, peeled and sliced
4 stalks of celery, sliced
1 medium yellow onion, diced
1/2 bunch fresh parsley, chopped
2 bay leaves
1 tsp minced garlic
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp thyme
1 tsp poultry seasoning
1/2 tsp dill
1/2 tsp oregano
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
For Dumplings:
1 C flour
1/4 C grated parmesan cheese
1 Tbsp baking powder
1/2 tsp dried rosemary
3 Tbsp shortening
1/2 C milk, or as needed

Directions:
Place turkey carcass in large slow cooker and cover with broth, water, and lemon juice.  Add all remaining spices and veggies for soup.
Cook on high for 8 hours.  Four hours into cook time, remove carcass from soup, separate meat from bone, and return meat to slow cooker.  Discard bones.
30 minutes before serving, boil broth or water in a saucepan on the stove.  In a bowl, combine flour, parmesan cheese, baking powder, and rosemary.  Cut in shortening.  Add enough milk to create a thick batter that pulls away from sides of bowl.
Drop rounded spoonfuls of dumpling batter into boiling liquid.  Reduce heat to low and allow to simmer, covered for 15 minutes.  Add cooked dumplings to turkey soup and serve.
