Ingredients:
Seasoning Mix
4 small bay leaves
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon white pepper
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon ground red pepper (preferably cayenne)
1 teaspoon gumbo file (file powder) (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
Jambalaya
4 tablespoons butter
6 ounces tasso (about 1 1/2 cups) or other smoked ham, diced
6 ounces smoked andouille sausages (about 1 heaping cup) or kielbasa, diced
1 1/2 cups onions, chopped
1 1/2 cups celery, chopped
1 cup bell pepper, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 cups uncooked rice (preferably converted)
4 cups beef stock or chicken stock (if not salt-free, adjust salt)

Directions:
Seasoning Mix: Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
Jambalaya: Use a large, heavy skillet, cast iron is best; over high heat melt margarine; add tasso and andouille, or ham and sausage, and cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add onions, celery, bell pepper, seasoning mix and garlic; stir and cook 10-12 minutes until well browned, scraping the bottom of the pan well.
Stir in rice and cook 5 minutes, again scraping the pan bottom often; add stock.
Bring mixture to boil; reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, about 20 minutes, until rice is tender but still a bit crunchy; stir a bit towards the end of the cooking time; remove bay leaves and serve.
