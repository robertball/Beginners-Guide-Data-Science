Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup meringue powder
7 cups confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons light corn syrup (such as Karo®)
2 tablespoons shortening (such as Crisco®)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Whip water and meringue powder on high speed in a large bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy and soft peaks form, 7 to 10 minutes. Gradually add confectioners' sugar, corn syrup, shortening, and vanilla extract while mixing on low speed. Increase speed back to high and beat until well-combined and smooth, about 3 minutes.

Description: 
This frosting will dry like traditional royal icing, but it doesn't suck all the flavor and moisture out of the cookies and it tastes absolutely delicious!
