Description: 
This tuna salad is made special with the addition of cream cheese and chopped raw carrots. Red peppers make it pretty and one or two other vegetables, fruits or nuts keep it changing and interesting. I developed this recipe after I tasted cream cheese in a salmon salad sandwich at a funeral lunch in Canada many years ago. Add baby spinach or lettuce leaves, and serve on your favorite bread or as a wrap in a tortilla.
