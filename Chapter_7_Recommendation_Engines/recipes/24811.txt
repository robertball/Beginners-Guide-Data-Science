Ingredients:
2 (10 ounce) packages baby spinach, rinsed and dried
1 red onion, thinly sliced
1 1/2 cups toasted, chopped pecans
8 ounces crumbled blue cheese
1 1/2 cups balsamic vinegar
2 teaspoons molasses
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2/3 cup olive oil

Directions:
In a large bowl, arrange spinach and red onion slices and top with toasted pecans and crumbled blue cheese.
In a small saucepan, warm the garlic in the olive oil to allow its flavor to diffuse into the oil.  Then add molasses, vinegar and pepper.  Whisking constantly, bring almost to a boil, remove from heat and cool until just warm.  Pour into a shakeable container, shake and pour over salad.  Serve immediately.
