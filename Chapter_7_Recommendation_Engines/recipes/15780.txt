Description: 
This recipe doesn't taste like you would imagine. It's a huge hit with everyone who has tried it. It has a great flavor, and it is wonderful when its warmed with butter on it. People are always asking me to make them a loaf or two. Note: For best slicing results and a tender crust, wrap bread in aluminum foil and slice the next day. If you can wait that long...we can't.
