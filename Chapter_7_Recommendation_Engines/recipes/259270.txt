Ingredients:
3 green onions, chopped
5 slices fresh ginger
3/4 cup water
1 pound ground pork
3 tablespoons Chinese rice wine, divided
2 tablespoons soy sauce
3 teaspoons salt, divided
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon ground white pepper
40 shrimps, minced
1/2 cup diced mushrooms
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken stock

Directions:
Mash green onion and ginger in a bowl with water. Mix in pork, 2 tablespoons rice wine, soy sauce, 2 teaspoons salt, sesame oil, and white pepper.
Combine shrimp, 1 tablespoon rice wine, 1 teaspoon salt, mushrooms, and celery in a bowl. Add to the pork mixture; stir until filling is well combined.
Separate and place wonton wrappers onto your work surface. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the pork-shrimp filling onto the center of each wrapper. Use your finger or a pastry brush to lightly moisten edges of wonton wrappers with water. Fold one corner of the wrapper over the filling onto the opposite corner to form a triangle. Press edges together to seal.
Bring the chicken stock to a rolling boil. Add wontons and cook until they float to the top, about 5 minutes.
