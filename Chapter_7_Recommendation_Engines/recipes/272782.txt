Ingredients:
Cake:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup cane sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon fine sea salt
4 eggs
1 cup fresh strawberries, pureed
3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted, divided
1/2 cup milk
Frosting:
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar
4 tablespoons fresh strawberries, pureed, or more as needed
1 cup fresh strawberries for garnish
8 leaves fresh mint for garnish

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans or one 9x13-inch baking pan.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
Beat eggs, 1 cup strawberry puree, 1/2 cup melted butter, and milk until combined. Add to flour mixture; whisk until combined. Pour batter into prepared cake pans or baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly, then invert onto a cooling rack to cool completely.
Pour melted butter into a large bowl and sift in confectioners' sugar. Add enough pureed strawberries to make a spreadable frosting. Frost cooled cakes and garnish with fresh strawberries and mint.
