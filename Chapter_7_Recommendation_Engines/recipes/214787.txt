Ingredients:
½  papaya - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch slices
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste
¾ cup butter at room temperature
3 (10 ounce) porterhouse steaks
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic salt

Directions:
Preheat outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Rub the papaya slices evenly with 2 teaspoons olive oil.
Cook the papaya on the preheated grill until hot and softened, about 10 minutes.
Blend the grilled papaya, garlic, and butter in a blender until smooth. Pour into a small container and cool in refrigerator 1 to 2 hours.
Again preheat outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Rub the porterhouse steaks thoroughly with the 2 tablespoons olive oil. Stir the rosemary, salt, pepper, and garlic salt together in a bowl; rub evenly onto both sides of the steaks.
Cook the steaks until they are beginning to firm, and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Top with the papaya butter to serve.
