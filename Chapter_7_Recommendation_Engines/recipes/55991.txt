Ingredients:
2 onions, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
4 1/2 cups water
3 large carrots, peeled and chopped
1 leek, bulb only, chopped
3 green onions, chopped
1 1/2 habanero peppers, seeded and chopped
1 (10 ounce) bag fresh spinach
1 bunch watercress, trimmed and chopped
1 tablespoon salt and pepper to taste
extra virgin olive oil
red wine or balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Cook onion and garlic in butter over medium high heat until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken stock, water, carrots, leeks, green onions, habanero peppers, spinach, and watercress. Bring to a low boil, and cook for 30 minutes, or until carrots are soft. Remove from heat, and allow to cool for 30 minutes.
Puree in a blender or food processor until smooth. Return to the pot, and simmer on low heat for 15 minutes before serving. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil or vinegar, or both, if desired.

Description: 
This smooth and flavorful vegetable soup is a family recipe. It can be served as an elegant first course, but we also find it makes great diet fare when eaten with a loaf of French bread.
