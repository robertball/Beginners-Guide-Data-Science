Ingredients:
1 cup of softened butter
1/2 of white cup sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups old-fashioned oats (slightly chopped up in a blender)
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 tsp of nutmeg
1 tsp of cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup raisins (soaked in warm water for 10min.)

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugars. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Combine the oats, flour, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Stir in and raisins.
Cover the bowl and let the cookie dough sit in the refridgerator overnight. This step is important because the time in the fridge gives the oats some time to soften and this gives you a chewier cookie.
Drop by tablespoonfuls 2 in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool.
