Ingredients:
2 cups pancake mix
1 cup coconut milk, or more to taste
1 cup mixed berries, or more to taste
1 banana, or more to taste
1/2 cup oats, or more to taste
1/4 cup flaxseed meal, or more to taste
1 tablespoon coconut oil, or as needed

Directions:
Combine pancake mix, coconut milk, berries, banana, oats, and flaxseed meal in a food processor or blender; puree into a smooth batter.
Melt coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Drop large spoonfuls of the batter into the skillet and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until pancake is browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
Arrange pancakes on a wire rack; let stand until completely cool, about 20 minutes. Wrap each pancake individually in plastic wrap and place in a large resealable plastic bag. Transfer to the freezer.
