Ingredients:
1/2 red pepper chopped
1/2 green pepper chopped
2 plum tomatoes diced
1 bag shredded mozzerella cheese
1/4 large red onion, diced
1/4 head red cabbage shredded
i lb Bowtie (farfazella) shaped Pasta
1 jar green stuffed green olives sliced
1/2 bottle of Ken'sâ„¢ LIGHT Greek
Dressing
1/2 Cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1/8 Cup White Vinegar
1/4 cup chopped FRESH OREGANO (please do not use dry)
1 can red kidney beans, rinsed
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Chop peppers, tomatoes, red onion and red cabbage into 1/4" sized pieces. Cook pasta according to package directions for al dente'. When the pasta is done cooking, open your can of red kidney beans and drain everything in the same colander. Run cold water over the beans and cooked pasta to stop cooking and remove the thick juices from the canned beans. DRAIN VERY VERY WELL. Add the pasta and beans to the chopped vegetables. Add the 1/2 bottle of light Ken's Greek Dressing. I find it too overpowering and strong so I added my own dressing. Mix the 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil and the 1/8 cup white vinegar with the 1/4 cup chopped fresh oregano. Whisk until the oil and vinegar have completely combined (I use a metal whisk in a glass Pyrex measuring cup).  Pour your dressing over chopped salad and toss. Allow to marinate at least one hour. Toss again before serving. My mother who will NOT eat pasta could not stop eating this. Trust me. It's a keeper. Enjoy..... mwa xoxo Chef Bevski
