Ingredients:
4 bone-in chicken thighs, or more to taste
1 pinch dried oregano, or to taste
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 bay leaves
3 tablespoons miso paste, or more to taste (optional)
4 quarts water, or as needed
1/2 bunch celery, diced
4 carrots, chopped, or more to taste
1 bunch fresh dill, minced
1/2 butternut squash, peeled and chopped
1/2 small head red cabbage, chopped
1 purple turnip, peeled and chopped
1 leek, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, seeded and diced
1 large jalapeno pepper, with seeds, diced

Directions:
Place chicken thighs in a large pot and season generously with oregano, salt, and pepper. Add bay leaves and miso paste. Fill pot with water and bring to a rolling boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook until thighs are no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Remove thighs and bay leaves from the pot. Tear meat off the bones and chop. Discard bones and bay leaves and return meat to the pot. Reduce heat to medium-low; add celery, carrots, and dill. Stir and add butternut squash, cabbage, and turnip. Cook, 5 to 10 minutes more.
Add leek, bell pepper, and jalapeno pepper to the pot. Cook until squash and turnip are soft, about 30 minutes more. Add salt to taste.
