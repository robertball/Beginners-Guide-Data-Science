Ingredients:
1 cup raisins
1 1/2 cups orange juice, divided
2 cups chopped celery
1 large onion, chopped
1 cup butter or margarine, divided
1 pound bulk Italian sausage
1 (16 ounce) package crushed herb-seasoned stuffing
4 medium tart apples, peeled and chopped
1 cup chopped pecans
2 cups chicken broth
2 teaspoons dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In a saucepan, bring raisins and 1 cup orange juice to a boil. Remove from the heat; set aside (do not drain). In a skillet, saute celery and onion in 1/2 cup butter until tender. Transfer to a large bowl. In the same skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Add sausage, stuffing, apples, pecans, remaining orange juice and remaining butter; add broth, thyme and pepper. Pour over stuffing mixture; mix well. Place in two greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dishes. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F for 1 hour. Uncover; bake 10 minutes longer or until lightly browned. Refrigerate any leftovers.

Description: 
This is the only stuffing my family will permit on our holiday table. With Italian sausage and a blend of so many great flavors, it's almost a meal in itself. No wonder it won first prize in a local recipe contest!
