Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 egg
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1/4 cup bacon bits
garlic salt to taste
4 hamburger buns, split and toasted

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.
In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, onion, egg, bread crumbs, and bacon bits. Season with garlic salt. (I like to use a lot.) Divide into four balls, and pat into patties.
Lightly oil the grate, and place patties onto the grill. Cook for about 5 minutes per side, or until firm and no longer pink in the center. Serve on toasted buns with your favorite hamburger toppings.

Description: 
One of my family's favorites. They are made with bacon bits and seasonings and taste especially good when cooked on the grill.
