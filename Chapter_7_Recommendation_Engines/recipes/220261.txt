1 (64 ounce) bottle tomato and clam juice cocktail (such as Clamato®)
1 (12 fluid ounce) can frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed
5 limes, juiced
1/3 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup hot sauce (such as Valentina® or Tabasco®)

1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper, or to taste
2 tablespoons salt
salt for rimming glasses
24 wedges lime

24 (12 fluid ounce) cans Mexican beer

Directions:
Combine tomato and clam juice cocktail, thawed frozen orange juice concentrate, and lime juice in a large pitcher; mix.
Stir the Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and 2 tablespoons salt through the cocktail mixture until the salt has dissolved.
Pour 1/4 cup salt for rimming glasses onto a small, shallow plate. Moisten the rim of a large beer glass with a wedge of lime, dip the moistened rim into the salt. Tap off excess.
Fill the rimmed glass with ice. Pour 1/3 to 1/2 cup michelada mix, or to taste, over the ice. Fill the rest of the glass with beer and stir to serve.

Description: 
A Mexican favorite, the michelada is a simple way to make a cheap Mexican beer into a delicious drink that will quickly become a party favorite. I recommend a cheap Mexican beer such as Modelo® or Tecate® for best taste and to stay true to the michelada concept.  Best served at a Mexican food barbecue alongside fajitas, Mexican rice, guacamole, salsa, and so on with family and friends!
