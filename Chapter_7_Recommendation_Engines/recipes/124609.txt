Ingredients:
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup milk
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup minced onion
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 pound ground pork
GRAVY:
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 tablespoons minced onion
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 cups beef broth
1/2 cup heavy cream
dash cayenne pepper
1 dash white pepper

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine eggs, milk, bread crumbs, onion and seasonings. Let stand until crumbs absorb milk. Add meat; stir until well blended. Shape into 1-in. meatballs. Place on a greased jelly-roll pan. Bake at 400 degrees F until browned, about 18 minutes. Set aside.
For gravy, melt butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Saute onion until tender. Stir in flour and brown lightly. Slowly add broth; cook and stir until smooth and thickened. Blend in cream, cayenne pepper and white pepper. Gently stir in meatballs; heat through but do not boil.

Description: 
These meatballs are a favorite around our area. On May 17, Norwegian Independence Day, many people serve them with a mashed rutabaga and potato dish. So this recipe is both delicious and very traditional.
