Ingredients:
28 oz potatoes
Â½ onion
1 cup gram or chickpea flour
1 cup water (+ 1 cup water)
Black Salt to taste

Directions:
Peel the potatoes and wash them. Cut them in half lengthwise. Then, slice the potatoes in pieces approximately 1/8" thick. Peel and chop the onion into small pieces.
In a non-stick frying pan, add potatoes, onion, salt to taste and 1 cup of water and bring it to boil. You may need to turn down the heat slightly, so the potatoes do not burn. Cook about 20 minutes or until potatoes are soft (or use pre-cooked). Stir occasionally. Remove the potatoes and onion from the pan with a slotted spoon.
In a bowl, place 1 cup of gram flour and 1 cup of water, add salt and beat by hand with a fork. Pour in the potato onion mixture. Mix all together.
Heat skillet on medium heat. Pour in the potato onion mixture and cook over medium heat for about five minutes. Place a plate over the tortilla and turn it around and cook the other side for about another 5 minutes. Turn the tortilla again if required until it's totally cooked.
