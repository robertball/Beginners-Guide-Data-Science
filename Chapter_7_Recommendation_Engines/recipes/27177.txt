Fill a large pot with 2 quarts of water, and stir in the olive oil and salt.  Bring to a boil.
Drain the lentils, and carefully pour into the boiling water. Add the onions, tomatoes, garlic, potatoes, carrots and plantains into boiling water.  Drop in bay leaves and season with salt and pepper.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer until lentils and plantains are tender, 45 to 60 minutes.
