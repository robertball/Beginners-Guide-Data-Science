Ingredients:
1 lb hamburger
1 lb pork sausage
2/3 cup breadcrumbs
1/2 cup water
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
2 teaspoon black pepper (more if you prefer it spicier)
1 1/2 teaspoons ground nutmeg or 1 1/2 teaspoons ground mace - (I used nutmeg)

Directions:
Put everything in big bowl together and give it a really good mix by hand (I used the K beater) Then ideally put the mix into a loaf tin or rectangular pan about 10" x 4" x 3". I used a hamburger press and made patties - separated with wax or parchment paper.
Put the sausage meat block in the freezer for a little while until it's just starting to set. Remove it from the tin and cut the sausage block into the thickness you prefer.
Put the slices, separated by cling film, into freezer bags and put them back in the freezer.
When required, defrost and grill or fry in a little fat or oil until brown and crispy on the outside, and cooked through.
