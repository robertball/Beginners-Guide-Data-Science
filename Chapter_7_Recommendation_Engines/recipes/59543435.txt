Description: 
This recipe may not have a package of instant pudding in the recipe but these cookies still bake up into a soft batch of cookies.  Use store-brand or sale-priced baking goods and margarine and vegetable shortening instead of butter to make these a winner for the wallet!Modified from: Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies
