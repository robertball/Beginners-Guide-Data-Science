Ingredients:
Spice Mixture:
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/8 teaspoon curry powder
Stew Vegetables:
1 tablespoon butter
1 sweet onion, chopped
2 cups finely shredded kale
4 (14 ounce) cans organic vegetable broth
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
3 large potatoes, peeled and diced
2 sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
4 large carrots, chopped
1 cup dried lentils, rinsed
1/2 cup chopped dried apricots
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, to taste
1 tablespoon cornstarch (optional)
1 tablespoon water (optional)

Directions:
Combine cinnamon, cumin, salt, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, turmeric, and curry powder in a large bowl.
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the onion in the butter until soft and just beginning to brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in kale and spice mixture; cook until kale begins to wilt and spices are fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Pour the vegetable broth into the pot.  Stir garbanzo beans, tomatoes, potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, lentils, apricots, and honey, into the broth; bring to boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until vegetables and lentils are cooked and tender, about 30 minutes. Season stew with black pepper.
Dissolve cornstarch in water; stir into stew and simmer thickened, about 5 minutes.
