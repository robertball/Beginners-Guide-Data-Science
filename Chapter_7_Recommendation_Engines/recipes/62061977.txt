Ingredients:
8 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or 4 if you want to half the recipe which is very easy to do).
1 c. sour cream
2 Tbsp. lemon juice
2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp. celery salt
1 tsp. paprika
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper
1 3/4 c. crushed corn flakes
1/4 c. butter, melted

Directions:
Mix together sour cream, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and seasonings (not butter).  Arrange chicken breasts in a flat baking dish.  Spread mixture over both sides of the chicken and marinate in the refrigerator (overnight for best results).  After marinating, preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Remove chicken, allowing as much of the marinade as possible to cling to all pieces and roll in crushed corn flakes.  Return to baking dish and bake uncovered until just about done.  Spoon butter over chicken and bake until juices run clear.

Description: 
Crushed cornflakes that stick to the chicken with a thick, tasteful mixture make this recipe really great.  There are many harmonizing tastes like lemon, spices, and garlic.  Very easy to make, and very easy to half to feed 3-4 people.
