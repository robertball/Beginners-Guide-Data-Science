Ingredients:
4 medium baking potatoes
2 tbsp. olive oil
2 tbsp. coarse grill seasoning

Directions:
Scrub potatoes well and prick all over with a fork.
Place on microwave-safe plate and microwave 8-10 minutes, or until just barely done, turning once during cooking.
Place each potato on a square of foil large enough to wrap completely around potato. Brush with olive oil and sprinkle generously with grill seasoning, turning to coat completely.
Grill over medium to medium-high indirect heat 15 minutes, turning halfway through.
Serve with your favorite baked potato toppings.
