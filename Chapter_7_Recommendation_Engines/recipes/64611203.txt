Ingredients:
3 c granulated sugar
7 Tbsp unsweetened dark cocoa
10 oz evaporated milk
4 large eggs - beaten
1 stick butter - melted & cooled
2 tsp vanilla
2 nine inch deep dish pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Prick pie crusts with a fork.
In an electric mixer using the whisk attachment, mix together all ingredients except pie crusts until smooth.  Note, if butter is not cool, it will cause the eggs to cook, and make a lumpy pie.
Pour mixture into pie crusts.
Bake for 40-50 minutes until top is flaky, and pie is set (does not jiggle when moving pie around).  Knife inserted in center will not come out clean.
Chill in refrigerator.
Serve cold.
