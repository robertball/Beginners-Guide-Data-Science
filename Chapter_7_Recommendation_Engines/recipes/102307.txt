Ingredients:
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup ketchup
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
3/4 cup finely crushed saltine cracker crumbs
3/4 cup milk
2 eggs, beaten
1 medium onion, cut into small dice
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position, and heat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan with vegetable cooking spray. Press brown sugar into prepared pan bottom; spread ketchup over the sugar.
In a large bowl, mix ground beef with saltines, milk, eggs, onion, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and ginger. Form meat into a loaf, and press over brown sugar-ketchup mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf registers 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
