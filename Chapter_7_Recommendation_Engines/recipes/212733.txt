Ingredients:
4 ounces PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese, softened
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 1/2 pounds ground lamb

1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 onion sandwich rolls, split, toasted
1 bunch watercress, thick stems removed, separated into equal portions

Directions:
Mix cream cheese and herbs until well blended.  Roll into 4 balls; flatten each into disk on sheet of waxed paper.  Refrigerate 15 min. or until firm.
Combine meat, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Shape into 8 thin patties.  Place cream cheese disks on 4 patties; cover with remaining patties.  Press edges together to seal.
Heat oil in large skillet on medium heat.  Add patties; cook about 5-6 min. on each side or until done (160 degrees F).  Serve in rolls topped with watercress.
