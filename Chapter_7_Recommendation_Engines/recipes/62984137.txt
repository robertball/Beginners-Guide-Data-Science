Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 cup baked sweet potato puree
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
3 tablespoons margarine, softened
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Dissolve yeast, warm water, and 1 tablespoon sugar in a mixing bowl.  Let stand 5 minutes.
Add remaining sugar, sweet potato, butter or margarine, salt, and slightly beaten eggs.  Stir to mix well.  Stir in 3 cups of flour.  Turn out on a lightly floured surface.  Knead  2 to 3 minutes, adding just enough of remaining flour to  prevent sticking.   Do not knead too heavily; when smooth, shape into a ball.  Place in an oiled bowl, and turn to coat the surface.  Cover, and let raise about 1 hour or longer.
Punch down, and allow dough to rest for 2 minutes.  Divide into 16 to 20 balls, and place on a greased cookie sheet or in a 9x13 inch pan.  Allow to rise until doubled.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 12 to 20 minutes.  Serve warm.
