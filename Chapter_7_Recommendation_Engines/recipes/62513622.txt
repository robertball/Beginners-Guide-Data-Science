Ingredients:
6 cups cooked brown (or white) rice
6 cups whole milk
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

1/4 cup rum
Optional: sweetened-whipped cream, more ground cinnamon and nutmeg, and minced candied ginger for garnishing

Directions:
In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, combine the rice, milk, white and brown sugars, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg.
Cook over medium heat until thickened and creamy-about 30 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine the heavy cream with the whole egg and egg yolks and whisk to combine.
Add the cream and egg mixture to the rice whisking rapidly and thoroughly.  Stir in the raisins.
Return to a simmer and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes until thickened.
Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, vanilla and rum.

Description: 
This is a VERY decadent treat!  I tweeked several recipes because I had some leftover brown rice and I needed to feed an army!  I'm sure this would be great with white rice too.
