Description: 
This is a pretty typical pico, except it uses a vodka soaking to meld the ingredients.  I am often requested to make this for gatherings.  You may also add other chiles: pablano, serrano, etc. to up the heat.  Sweet green peppers are also pretty good.  Don't skip the cuc though...it adds great texture
