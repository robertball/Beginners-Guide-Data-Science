Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie shell
3/4 cup pumpkin puree
2 tablespoons light brown sugar, packed
1 egg
2 tablespoons sour cream
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3/4 cup light corn syrup
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
3 eggs
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon lemon zest
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/3 cups chopped pecans

Directions:
Place rack in upper third of oven. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
To Make Pumpkin Layer: In a medium bowl combine pumpkin puree, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 egg, sour cream, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Stir until thoroughly combined. Spread mixture into pie shell.
To Make Pecan Layer: In a medium bowl, combine corn syrup, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3 eggs, butter, vanilla, lemon rind, lemon juice, and salt. Mix well, then stir in pecans. Carefully spoon mixture over pumpkin layer.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake an additional 20 to 30 minutes. The filling will puff slightly, but the center will not be completely set. Allow to set for at least an hour before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.
