Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup wheat germ
2 tablespoons soy flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups soy milk
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Combine flour, wheat germ, soy flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Add soy milk and oil and whisk until batter is smooth.
Heat a dry, nonstick pan over medium heat. Pour batter into 5-inch circles. Peek under pancakes when edges appear dry; flip when bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook other side until golden brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.
