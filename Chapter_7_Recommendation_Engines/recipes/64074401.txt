Ingredients:
4	russet potatoes (any size)
2  	to 4 tablespoons butter (depending on how large the potato is)
4	tablespoons real bacon bits
Salt and pepper to taste
Garnish with fresh chopped chives, shredded cheddar cheese, and sour cream.

Directions:
Scrub and slice the potatoes lengthwise into ¼ to ½ inch thick slices almost all the way through, but not quite. About 4 sliced per potato.
Between each slice salt and pepper, add a little butter (as much or little as you like), and sprinkle 1 teaspoon bacon bits also between the layers.
Gently squeeze the slices together using the butter or margarine to hold the potato closed.  Wrap in foil, place on a baking sheet and bake at 400 for 45 minutes to an hour.  Garnish with chopped chives, sour cream, and shredded cheddar.
