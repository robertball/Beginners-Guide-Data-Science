Ingredients:
1/3 cup shortening
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/2 cup molasses
1/2 cup water
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 tablespoons cream

Directions:
Mix shortening, white sugar, egg, molasses, and water thoroughly.  Sift together flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, baking soda, and spices  and blend in.  Chill dough until firm.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees  F (205 degrees C).
Drop dough by teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart on lightly greased baking sheet.  Bake about 8 minutes, or until almost no imprint remains when touched lightly.  While slightly warm, frost with icing.
To Make Frosting:    Blend confectioners' sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  Add cream to make icing easy to spread.  Spread on cookies with spatula or pastry brush.
