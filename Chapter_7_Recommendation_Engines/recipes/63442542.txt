Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter, room temperature
1 cup sugar
1 large egg
½ tsp vanilla
3  ups all-purpose flour
Jam (any type)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 f
In a large bowl beat butter and sugar until smooth add the egg and vanilla (Note use hand held mixer), beat until well mixed, add flour fold until well mixed (don’t over work the dough).
Roll to 1 inch balls. Place on baking sheets, at least 3 inches apart as they will double in size.
Using your thumb press gently in the center of each ball to make an small indentation (you may want to either spray your finger with cooking spray or just use water to wet thumb, this will help not sticking).
Add small amount of your favourite jam on dough being careful not to over spill.
Bake until cookies are golden brown around edges, bake around 20 minutes.
