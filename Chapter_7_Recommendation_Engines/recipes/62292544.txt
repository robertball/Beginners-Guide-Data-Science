Ingredients:
8 oz. uncooked penne pasta (about 2 1/2 cups)
3 tbsp. butter
1/4 cup onion, finely minced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
2 cups pepperjack cheese, shredded
1/3 cup small curd cottage cheese
1 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
1 1/2 cups broccoli florets (lightly steamed, if desired)
Salt & pepper
1/2 cup panko or plain bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated parmesan
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1/2 tsp, dried oregano
1 1/2 tsp olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Butter a 1 1/2 qt or 8 x 8 baking dish.
Cook pasta in boiling water as per package directions until al dente.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a small pan over medium low heat.  Add minced onion and garlic, and cook until tender but not browned, about 3 minutes.
Drain pasta and return to pan; add butter, onion and garlic mixture and stir to coat pasta.
Add cheddar and pepperjack cheeses, cottage cheese, milk, and egg and stir until cheese is melted.  Stir in broccoli and season with salt and pepper.  Pour mixture into prepared baking dish.
In a small bowl, combine panko, parmesan, thyme and oregano.  Work in olive oil with fork or fingers.  Sprinkle on top of pasta.
Bake for 20 minutes or until topping is golden brown.

Description: 
One night I melted a slice of pepperjack cheese over a dish of buttered pasta and steamed broccoli - it was delicious! That quick supper has evolved into a cheesy, spicy baked pasta and broccoli dish with a crispy panko-parmesan topping.
