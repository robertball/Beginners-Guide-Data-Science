Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
3/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 onion, chopped
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Place garbanzo beans, parsley, onion, flour, garlic, cumin, baking powder, coriander, salt, lemon juice, and black pepper in a food processor or blender. Pulse until combined and a chunky, slightly sticky mixture forms.
Roll mixture into small balls and place on a plate. Flatten into patties that are 2 inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick.
Place patties in refrigerator or freezer to help hold together, about 10 minutes.
Heat 1 1/2- to 2-inches vegetable oil in large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fry patties, working in batches to avoid crowding, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain patties on paper towel-lined plate.

Description: 
Simple, easy, and delicious falafel - no breaking apart or spattering while frying! Try serving with pita, parsley and hummus or tahini sauce! Falafel is best when it is fresh.  However, if you have leftovers, heat in a single layer in the oven to maintain crispiness.
