Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 Tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Wash the cauliflower well (dirt can collect in hard-to-reach places). Cut the cauliflower into pieces and place into a steamer basket in a pot over boiling water.
Steam cauliflower until a fork can easily glide into it—about 8 minutes.
Place the cauliflower into a bowl and crush with a potato masher until consistently mashed.
Add the Parmesan cheese, olive oil, oregano, and thyme. Stir to combine.
Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
Serve warm.
