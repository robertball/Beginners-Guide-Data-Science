Description: 
When she was a teenager, Patricia VanWyk of Newton, Iowa adapted this recipe from a cookbook. 'Since we didn't have the caraway seeds called for in the original recipe, I substituted poppy seeds,' she explains. 'We liked the savory cheese-topped muffins so well I still make them this way.'
