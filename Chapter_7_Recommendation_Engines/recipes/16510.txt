Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/4 teaspoon mustard seed
1 pinch asafoetida powder
1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 pinch ground turmeric
1 hot green pepper, split down its length (optional)
3 roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
1 potato, cubed
1 head cauliflower, broken into small florets
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat oil over a medium-high heat. Toss in the mustard seeds; when they start spluttering, add the asafoetida, followed by the cumin seeds, turmeric powder and the green pepper. Add the chopped tomatoes and ginger; stir and saute for a few minutes.
Add the potato, cauliflower florets, sugar and salt; stir well and cook until the potatoes are cooked and the cauliflower tender yet crunchy. (For a crunchier cauliflower, add it when the potatoes are just getting done but not quite finished cooking).

Asofoetida can be found in some grocery stores, but will most likely be found in an Indian grocery store, it is often called 'hing'.
