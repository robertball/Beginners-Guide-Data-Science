Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
1 cup icing sugar
1 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup oil
1 tsp. vanilla or almond extract
2 eggs
4 1/2 cups flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. cream of tartar
1 tsp. salt
Nutmeg (optional)

Directions:
Beat both sugars and margarine together till light and fluffy.
Add eggs. Mix well.
Add oil & vanilla.
Mix in dry ingredients well.
Store in refrigerator (covered with plastic wrap) x 2 hours or overnight, for easier handling. *
Shape dough into 1" balls. Place 2" apart on cookie sheets.
Flatten with bottom of glass dipped in sugar.
Bake @ 375 x 5 - 8 minutes, until set, but not brown.
*I've skipped this step and managed ok, but try it yourself :)

Description: 
A good friend shared these delicious cookies. There's quite a bit of oil in them, but they still taste light. I've found cream of tartar reasonably priced in Nutters or Bulk Barn.
