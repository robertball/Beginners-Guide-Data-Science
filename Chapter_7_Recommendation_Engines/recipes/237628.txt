Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) prepared pie crust
4 tablespoons apple pie filling
12 cake-pop sticks

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Roll pie crust out on a lightly floured work surface. Use a circular cookie cutter or glass to cut twenty four 2 1/2-inch rounds. Transfer 12 rounds to a baking sheet.
Lay 1 cake-pop stick on each round with one end of the stick almost to the center of the round. Press the stick gently into the dough. Spoon about 1 teaspoon apple pie filling into the center of each round. Place the remaining dough rounds on top of each 'pop' and press the edges with a fork to crimp the border.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden and filling is hot, 20 to 25 minutes.

Mini pies on a cake-pop stick! These also work without the cake-pop sticks, then they are just mini pie circles.
