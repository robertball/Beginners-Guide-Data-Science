Ingredients:
1 C salted butter, softened
1 C sugar
2 eggs
2 t Vanilla
2 1/4 C flour
3/4 t baking soda
3/4 t baking powder
3/4 t cream of tartar
1/4 t salt
1 C light sour cream
1/4 c Buttermilk
toppings
1/2 c sugar
1 1/2 T cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF.
Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners -- Rolling them in the cinnamon & sugar makes them to fragile to only use cooking spray.
In Lg bowl, cream the butter & sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla and stir until well combined.
In a medium bowl, add the dry ingredients. Add half of the dry ingredients to the sugar mixture and mix well. Next, add the sour cream and buttermilk, stir. Add the rest of the dry ingredients and mix until smooth.
In a small bowl, add the sugar and cinnamon for the topping.
Here comes the messy part!!
Use an ice cream scooper and plop a scoop of batter into the bowl with the sugar and cinnamon. Gently roll the batter in the sugar and cinnamon. Place the ball into the paper liner.
sprinkle the leftover cinnamon-sugar onto the tops of all of the muffins.
Bake the muffins at 350ºF for about 16-18 minutes or until they are golden on top and just baked through.
