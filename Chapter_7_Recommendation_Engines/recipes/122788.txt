Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
1/4 cup cold water
FILLING:
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups water
3 egg yolks, beaten
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1/3 cup lemon juice
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 teaspoon lemon extract
MERINGUE:
3 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
6 tablespoons sugar

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour and salt; cut in shortening until crumbly. Gradually add water, tossing with a fork until a ball forms. Roll out pastry to fit a 9-in. pie plate. Transfer pastry to plate. Trim pastry to 1/2 in. beyond edge of plate; flute edges. Prick bottom and sides of pastry with a fork. Line with a double thickness of heavy-duty foil. Bake at 450 degrees F for 8 minutes. Remove foil; bake 5-6 minutes longer or until light golden brown. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F.
For filling, combine sugar, cornstarch, flour and salt in a saucepan. Gradually stir in water. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat; cook and stir 2 minutes longer. Remove from the heat. Gradually stir 1 cup hot filling into egg yolks; return all to pan. Bring to a gentle boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in butter, lemon juice, peel and extract until butter is melted. Cover; set aside and keep hot.
For meringue, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in a mixing bowl on medium until foamy, about 1 minute. Gradually beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, on high until stiff glossy peaks form and sugar is dissolved. Pour hot filling into crust. Spread meringue evenly over filling, sealing edges to crust. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes or until meringue is golden brown. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour; refrigerate for at least 3 hours. Store in the refrigerator.
