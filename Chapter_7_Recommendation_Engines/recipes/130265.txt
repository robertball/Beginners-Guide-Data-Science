Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable broth
2 cups chicken broth
1/3 cup pineapple juice
2 1/2 cups instant brown rice
1/3 cup raisins
2 tablespoons ground turmeric
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
1 zucchini, chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh mushrooms
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 yellow bell pepper, chopped
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1 pinch ground black pepper
1/2 fresh pineapple - peeled, cored and chopped

Directions:
Pour the vegetable broth, chicken broth, and pineapple juice into a large saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the brown rice, raisins, turmeric, and cumin, bring back to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion, zucchini, mushrooms, red and yellow pepper for about 5 minutes, until the vegetables have softened.
While the vegetables are cooking, stir together honey, 1 tablespoon of oil, lemon juice, ginger, and black pepper in a bowl. Stir honey mixture, cooked vegetables, and pineapple into the cooked rice, bring the mixture back to a boil, and serve hot.
