Ingredients:
4 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
3 (12.5 fl oz) cans chunk chicken (such as Kirkland(<sup>&reg;</sup>)), drained and broken into chunks
4  baking potatoes, peeled and cubed
4  carrots, sliced
2 cups chopped broccoli
1 cup water
2 tablespoons quick-mixing flour (such as Wondra(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
salt and cracked black pepper to taste
2 ¼ cups all-purpose baking mix (such as Bisquick(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
⅔ cup milk

Directions:
Stir chicken broth, chicken, potatoes, carrots, and broccoli together in a slow cooker.
Whisk water and quick-mixing flour together in a bowl until a paste-like consistency is reached; stir into slow cooker mixture. Season with salt and pepper.
Cook on Low for 5 hours. Stir baking mix and milk together in a bowl. Drop milk mixture by the teaspoonful into the slow cooker on top of the chicken mixture. Continue cooking, turning the dumplings once, until dumplings are cooked through, about 1 hour more.

Description: 
This is a favorite recipe originally made by my mother with chicken on-the-bone and homemade broth cooked over a stove. I have found I don't have the time to start from scratch and that this version tastes just as good with less fuss! You can substitute freshly cooked chicken, if desired. You can line the slow cooker with a slow cooker liner for easy clean-up.
