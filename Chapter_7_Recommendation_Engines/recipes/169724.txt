Ingredients:
1 egg
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 cup dill pickle juice
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 slice bread, torn into small pieces
1 pound lean ground beef
1/4 cup chopped dill pickles
1/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 8x8 inch baking dish.
Beat the egg in a mixing bowl. Whisk in the onion, pickle juice, salt, and pepper. Stir in the bread until soggy, then mix in the ground beef until evenly combined. Form into a loaf and place into the prepared pan. Stir together the chopped pickles, ketchup, water, sugar, and Worcestershire sauce; pour over the meatloaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
I'm not sure where this recipe came from but it's one that my mom made all the time when I was growing up.  It's now a regular at my house and it gets excellent reviews from everyone I've served it to...and the best part is the kids love it too!
