Ingredients:
2 cups extra-fine almond flour
1/4 cup almond milk
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 pounds ground beef (75% to 80% lean)
3/4 cup reduced-sugar ketchup, divided
2 eggs
2 tablespoons prepared white horseradish
2 tablespoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar substitute (such as LakantoÂ®)

Directions:
Combine almond flour and almond milk in a bowl.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; saute until translucent, about 5 minutes.
Combine the almond flour mixture, onion, ground beef, 1/4 cup ketchup, eggs, horseradish, salt, mustard, and pepper in a bowl. Mix well and pour into a 10x5-inch loaf pan.
Mix the remaining ketchup, vinegar, and sugar substitute together in a small bowl. Spread topping on top of loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 45 minutes to 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the meatloaf should read about 155 degrees F (68 degrees C).
