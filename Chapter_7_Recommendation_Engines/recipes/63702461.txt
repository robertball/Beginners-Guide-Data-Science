? How To Make Icebox Pickles ?
6 cups sliced, unpeeled cucumbers
1 cup sliced red onion
... 1 cup sliced green bell pepper
1 Tablespoon celery seed
1 Tablespoon salt
2 cups white sugar
1 cup white vinegar

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a glass jar or crock. Cover with water and refrigerate. You can eat them immediately, but I will tell you that the pickles are much, much tastier if you let them sit in the refrigerator for a few weeks. They will keep up to 3 months in the fridge....
