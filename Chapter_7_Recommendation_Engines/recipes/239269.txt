Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 pounds bottom round beef roast, trimmed and cut into chunks
2 cups water
3 large carrots, sliced
1/2 onion, sliced and chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
1 clove garlic, pressed
2 bay leaves, or more to taste
1 pinch ground allspice
2 russet potatoes, chopped, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat; sear beef until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer beef and oil to a large pot.
Mix water, carrots, onion, celery, Worcestershire sauce, salt, sugar, pepper, paprika, garlic, bay leaves, and allspice with beef; cover pot and simmer over low heat for 1 1/2 hours. Add potatoes to stew, cover pot, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 40 minutes more.

Description: 
This is my absolute favorite beef stew. I spent the better part of two years changing and altering ingredients until it was perfect. Hope you enjoy; everyone I've fed it to does!
