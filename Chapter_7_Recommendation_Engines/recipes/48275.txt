Ingredients:
1 quart milk
1 pint heavy cream
12 egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pint whiskey
12 egg whites
1 cup white sugar
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Directions:
In a large bowl, blend the milk, cream, egg yolks, vanilla and whiskey using a hand mixer until smooth and creamy. In a separate bowl, whip egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually sprinkle in the sugar while continuing to whip until stiff. Fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture, and pour into a punch bowl or large pitcher. Serve in mugs or cups garnished with a sprinkle of nutmeg.

Description: 
This family tradition involved even the kids at New Year's Eve.  They got to help make it even if they didn't get to drink it.  The beauty of this recipe is that every ingredient is one measure, which makes it easy to remember.  Everybody from the great-grandparents to fraternity brothers have loved this one.  I prefer Bourbon, but any whiskey, rum, brandy could be substituted.  (If you use vodka, please don't tell me!)  The old folks claimed the original recipe called for a Quart of Whiskey, but a pint is perfect.
