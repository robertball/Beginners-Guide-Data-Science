1 (12 inch) pre-baked pizza crust
1 cup tzatziki sauce

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place pizza crust on a baking sheet or pizza pan. Spread tzatziki sauce over crust and top with beef, cucumber, olives, feta cheese, and mozzarella cheese, respectively. Brush egg yolk over exposed pizza crust.
