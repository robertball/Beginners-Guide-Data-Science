Ingredients:
1 Large Onion
2 Tablespoons of Butter
1/2 Cup of Sour Cream
1 Tablespoon of hot sauce
-------------------------------------------
4 teaspoons of Butter
4 Lo-Carb Tamxico's Wheat Tortillas(5 Net Carbs)or your favorite low-carb tortillas
1 Cup of cooked chicken
1 Cup of Shredded Cheddar Cheese

Directions:
Sautee onions in 2 T Butter in Small saucepan until translucent. Add Sour Cream and hot sauce to onions and melt on medium heat. Once melted, set aside.
Spread 1 teaspoon of butter on one side of tortilla and throw into large saucepan (butter side down).
Sprinkle 1/4 Cup Cheese on Tortilla almost to the edge.
Add half of Chicken mixture.
Sprinkle another 1/4 Cup Cheese on top of Chicken.
Spread 1 teaspoon Butter on plain tortilla, and lay on top of Cheese (butter side up).  Cook about 3 Minutes on each side.  Press down on quesadilla while cooking to allow it to all stick together.  (Tip:  I flipped mine with a plate.  I placed it on top of saucepan and flipped it over onto plate.  I then slid it off into pan to cook on other side.  Be sure plate is smaller than pan or it will slide around.) Garnish with sour cream or -guacamole- under low-carb diets.
