Ingredients:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup buttermilk***
2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 1/2 tablespoons white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
8 cups finely chopped cabbage (about 1 head)
1/4 cup shredded carrot (1 medium carrot)
2 tablespoons minced onion

Directions:
Be sure cabbage and carrots are chopped up into very fine pieces (about the size of rice).***
Combine the mayonnaise, sugar, milk, buttermilk, lemon juice, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and beat until smooth.
Add the cabbage, carrots, and onion, and mix well.
Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
Serves 10 to 12.
"shred" cabbage by filling my blender half way with water, then adding some chunks of cabbage. Just a couple pulses will blend it enough to get the right side pieces. Drain, and do another batch until the whole cabbage is done.
Just add the lemon juice and/or vinegar to 1/4 cup milk and let sit for 5 minutes which will turn the mixture into buttermilk.
