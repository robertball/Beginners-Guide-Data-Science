Ingredients:
4 pounds grass-fed ground beef
2 large onions, diced
1 or 2 bell peppers, seeded and diced
2 6-ounce cans tomato paste
1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes
8 cups filtered water
6 cups cooked pinto beans
2 cups cooked brown rice (I like basmati or jasmine)
5 teaspoons cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon paprika
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons dried thyme
salt and pepper, to taste
garnishes (optional): diced onions, tomatoes or avocados; sliced olives; shredded cheese; salsa; tortilla chips; hot red pepper flakes

Directions:
Brown the ground beef, onions and bell peppers over medium heat in a 12 quart stockpot. Salt and pepper liberally. Whisk together both cans of tomato paste with 4 cups of water. Add to pot. Add additional 4 cups of water, diced tomatoes, pinto beans, rice and seasonings. Adjust seasonings. Let simmer for an hour or so to let flavors merge. Adjust seasonings again. Serve with garnishes, whole-grain bread and salad.
