Ingredients:
1/3 cup cream cheese
1/3 cup chevre (goat cheese)
2 tablespoons milk (or lemon juice)
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
8 Roma tomatoes, rinsed and cored
1 sweet onion, peeled and chopped
3/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
2 tablespoons (approximately) olive oil
8 slices 3x4" Italian bread (ciabatta or even sourdough) 1/2" thick
2 cups arugula leaves, stemmed, rinsed, drained
Salt, to taste

Directions:
Mix cream cheese, chevre, milk (or lemon juice), and lemon peel; let sit a room temperature while doing the rest.
Cut tomatoes in half lengthwise, and lay halves, cut side up, in single layer in casserole a little higher than tomatoes.
Combine onion, vinegar, sugar, olive oil, and ginger; bring to boil over high heat, stirring often.
Pour mixture over tomatoes.
Roast at 400 degrees for about an hour, basting often, especially near the end (tomatoes will appear wilted and slightly browned).
Toast bread at 375 degrees until lightly browned on bottom (about 4-6 minutes); turn and brush with olive oil and bake until golden brown and crisp (6-8 minutes).
Spread lemon cheese equally on oiled sides of olive-oil toasted side.
Set bread on plates, and cover equally with arugula leaves.
Spoon tomatoes and juices equally onto toast slices.
Salt to taste.
