Ingredients:
1 teaspoon ground turmeric, or to taste
1 teaspoon paprika, or to taste
½ teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning, or to taste
1 (16 ounce) package boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into small pieces
1  green bell pepper, seeded and sliced
½  onion, halved and sliced
½ cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves, or to taste
1 ⅓ cups water
⅔ cup uncooked white rice
salt to taste

Directions:
Rub turmeric, paprika, and lemon-pepper seasoning over chicken. Place chicken in a skillet over medium heat and cover with water. Add bell pepper, onion, and cilantro. Cook until chicken juices run clear and bell peppers are soft, 20 to 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Season chicken mixture with salt and serve over rice.
