Ingredients:
Salmon fillets, thawed
Southwest blend spicy mustard
Assorted fresh herbs (I used mint, cilantro, tarragon and rosemary and it was awesome!)

Directions:
In a foil pocket, put the salmon skin side down and cover with a thin layer of the mustard. Add the herbs on top, seal and bake, 400 degrees 15-20 mins. To serve, unwrap, discard skin and herbs and turn out onto plate.
