Description: 
Make a statement for dinner with the bold flavors of these Thai-inspired pork meatballs. I love Thai ingredients and decided to combine them together with pork to make these juicy meatballs that taste like they've been simmering for hours. Serve over rice or noodles and garnish with minced scallions. Increase the red pepper flakes for an extra kick!
