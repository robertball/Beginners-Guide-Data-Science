Ingredients:
16 oz Colby jack cheese, shredded
8 oz Munster cheese, shredded
8 oz sharp cheese, shredded
1 lb block of Velveeta (small block)
1 T oil
1 lb. box elbow macaroni
8 T butter
2 cups half and half
2 eggs lightly beaten
salt n pepper (just eyeball it)
1 T butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Lightly butter 2 1/2 quart casserole (use actual butter not non-stick spray)9 x 13 baking stone pan works great!
Mix together Colby jack, Munster, and sharp into large bowl and mix well (best to use your hands.
Cube Velveeta into small cubes (smaller the better but not microscopic)
DO NOT ADD VELVEETA TO SHRED MIX-KEEP IN SEPARATE BOWL
Set all cheeses aside (in fridge if necessary)
Bring salted water to boil in large pot, add oil to prevent noodles from sticking and add elbow noodles. Cook until just tender (about 8 minutes). Drain and return to pot.
Melt butter and add to pot with noodles.  Add half 'n half and roughly 2 1/2 cups of the mixed shredded cheeses, the cubed velveeta and lightly beaten eggs, salt and pepper to taste. Stir well
Put in lightly buttered casserole and sprinkle remaining shredded cheeses on top (sprinkle just enough to cover, you may have left over cheese after sprinkling)
Cube (small) 1 tbsp butter and dot top of mac-n-cheese
DO NOT COVER (not with lid, not with foil, not with anything)
Bake for 35 minutes of until desired brownness
Then serve your molten cheesy goodness after letting sit for 5 minutes to cool.
