Ingredients:
1/2 (12 ounce) package egg noodles
1 cup 1-inch pieces fresh-cut green beans
1 cup bite-size summer squash pieces
1 cup frozen peas
1 cup sliced carrots
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/3 cup 2% milk
1 (7 ounce) can albacore tuna, drained and broken into chunks
1/2 onion, chopped
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup French-fried onions (such as French'sÂ®)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Combine green beans, squash, peas, and carrots in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl; cook until tender, 3 to 10 minutes. Rinse vegetables with cold water and drain.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute mushrooms in hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Whisk mushroom soup and milk together in a large bowl; add vegetables, mushrooms, tuna, onion, and Cheddar cheese. Mix in Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper. Pour mixture into a casserole dish and top with French fried onions.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
In an attempt to eat healthier, my husband and I have been eating more vegetables and less meats. As a result, I have become more creative coming up with dinner meals. This casserole was delicious, used fresh vegetables I had on hand, and went together very quickly. I topped the casserole with French fried onions. Another option would be more grated cheese or crushed potato chips.
