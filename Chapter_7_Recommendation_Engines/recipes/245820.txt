Description: 
My great-great-aunt Josie created this recipe and handed it down through the family. The anise seed and anisette give it an authentic Italian flavor. A bit labor intensive, but they are so worth it! Great for dunking in tea or coffee, or just munching on. I double the recipe and give them out for Christmas every year.
