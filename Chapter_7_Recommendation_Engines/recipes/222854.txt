Ingredients:
6 cups prepared tomato sauce
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup milk
1 large egg
2 teaspoons Italian herb seasoning
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground veal
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper (optional)
1/3 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Pour tomato sauce into a large stockpot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to low to keep sauce warm while preparing meatballs.
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and brush lightly with oil.
Whisk bread crumbs, milk, egg, Italian herb seasoning, olive oil, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl to form a thick slurry. Set aside.
Combine beef and veal in a large bowl. Season with salt, black pepper, and white pepper; sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Pour in slurry and mix until combined.
Use a small portion scooper to form meat mixture into about 48 meatballs. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake meatballs under the preheated broiler until browned, about 4 to 5 minutes. Turn meatballs and broil until browned on both sides and no longer pink in the center, 3 to 4 additional minutes.
Transfer meatballs to the stockpot with the simmering tomato sauce. Increase heat to medium and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or longer if desired.

Description: 
These meatballs are significantly faster than a traditional recipe because there is no chopping or pan-frying for the base mixture and they are small, so they cook fast.
