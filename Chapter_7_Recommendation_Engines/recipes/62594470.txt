Description: 
This sauce I consider a quick fix. When you have no sweet chili dipping sauce and you need one at at the moment kind of sauce. It's incredibly easy and quick. Its color is gorgeous and the honey gives it a glossy thick consistency. Great for dipping pork and beef, but also compliments small breaded chicken bits and breaded shrimp. Not to mention spring rolls.
