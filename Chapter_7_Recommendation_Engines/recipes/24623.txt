Ingredients:
2 quarts oil for deep frying
4 large potatoes, peeled and chopped
1 pinch Italian-style seasoning
1 egg yolk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg white
1 cup dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil.  Place potatoes in the water and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash.
Mix Italian-style seasoning and egg yolk into the mashed potatoes. Allow potato mixture to cool approximately 10 minutes, or until it may be safely handled.
Place flour, egg white and dry bread crumbs in three separate small bowls. Roll potato mixture into 1 inch logs or balls. Cover in flour, dip in egg white and coat with bread crumbs.
Carefully lower small batches of the coated potatoes into the deep fryer. Fry until golden brown, about 4 minutes.
