Ingredients:
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 cup lukewarm water
2 (.25 ounce) envelopes active dry yeast
3/4 cup molasses
4 teaspoons salt
6 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 cup shortening, melted
3 cups lukewarm water
2 cups raisins
12 cups sifted all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons caraway seed

Directions:
Dissolve 2 teaspoons of sugar in 1 cup of water.  Sprinkle the yeast over the water and allow to soften for 5 to 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, stir together the molasses, salt, 6 tablespoons of sugar, and shortening into the remaining 3 cups of water in a large bowl until dissolved.  Add the raisins, flour, and caraway seed.
Mix together until a dough forms, then turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 10 to 15 minutes.  Place into a well oiled bowl, and brush the top with a little melted shortening.  Cover with a cloth and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Punch down, and allow to rise again until doubled in bulk, another hour.
Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.  Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface, punch down, then form into two loaves.  Place loaves into the pans, cover with a cloth, and allow to rise again until doubled in size.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake loaves in preheated oven for 1 hour until they are nicely browned and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.

Description: 
This molasses-raisin bread is an old favorite from Newfoundland. If you do not care for caraway seed, you may substitute 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg.
