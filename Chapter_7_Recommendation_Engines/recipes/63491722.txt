Ingredients:
1 onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 teaspoon fresh ginger
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 of a medium head of cabbage, finely shredded
2 large carrots, shredded
1 (4 oz.) package of bean sprouts
3 tablespoons water
4 tablespoons soy sauce
4 tablespoons sherry
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
10 egg roll wrappers
1 egg yoke
1 egg white

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, saute onion, garlic, and ginger in the oil. Continue to saute just until onions are tender. In the same skillet, saute cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts, water, soy sauce, sherry, salt, and pepper. Continue to saute until cabbage, carrots are crisp-tender.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Fill each egg roll wrapper with approximately 1/4 cup of filling and roll up according to package directions. Seal the egg rolls with the egg yoke. Lightly oil a baking sheet. With a pastry brush, lightly spread the egg white over the egg rolls. Bake for 15-25 minutes until golden brown.
