Description: 
Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are simply coated in za'atar and olive oil, then baked to perfection. The chicken gets a simple treatment because the za'atar spice mix imparts loads of flavor! Even better, it takes just a couple of minutes to prepare. I like these baked chicken thighs alongside a Middle Eastern inspired side dish, or try them in a wrap or green salad with a tahini dressing.
