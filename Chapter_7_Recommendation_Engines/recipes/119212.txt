Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package hot roll mix
1 cup warm water (120 to 130 degrees F)
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped green pepper
2 cups chopped fully cooked ham
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup ricotta cheese
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
1 egg white
1 tablespoon cold water

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the hot roll mix and contents of yeast packet. Stir in the warm water, egg and 1 tablespoon butter. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead for 5 minutes. In a skillet, saute onion and green pepper in remaining butter until tender. Remove from the heat; stir in ham, cheeses and parsley.
On a greased baking sheet, roll dough into a 15-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Spoon ham mixture lengthwise down the center of dough. On each long side, cut 1-in.-wide strips about 2 in into the center. Starting at one end, fold alternating strips at an angle across filling. Pinch ends to seal. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 15 minutes or until almost doubled.
In a small bowl, beat egg white and cold water; brush over dough. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
