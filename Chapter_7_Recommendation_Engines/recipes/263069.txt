Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup quinoa
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1 baby cucumber, sliced
1/4 cup chopped red onion
1/4 cup halved Kalamata olives
4 small radishes, quartered
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup toasted sliced almonds (optional)

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Add quinoa and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, covered, until quinoa is just tender and liquid is absorbed, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove from heat, uncover, and let cool completely.
Stir together cooled quinoa, tomatoes, cucumber, onion, olives, radishes, oil, lemon juice, mint, parsley, pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Serve immediately or chill up to 2 hours. Sprinkle with almonds (if using) before serving.
