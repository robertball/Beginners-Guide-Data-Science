Ingredients:
Dough:
4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
3/4 cup cold butter
1 cup canned pumpkin
2 large eggs
6 tablespoons milk
Icing:
1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pinch ground cloves
1 pinch ground ginger

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine flour, 3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons white sugar, baking powder, salt, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon cloves, and 1/2 teaspoon ginger in a food processor. Add butter 1 tablespoonful at a time; mix until dough is crumbly.
Whisk pumpkin, eggs, and 6 tablespoons milk together in a bowl. Fold pumpkin mixture into dough in the food processor; blend until a dough forms.
Shape dough into a ball and pat out on a lightly floured surface. Split the dough in half repeatedly to make 12 equal portions. Shape portions into pie-shaped pieces by hand, about 3/4-inch thick each. Place scones onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, about 15 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely, about 20 minutes.
Combine confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup milk, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, 1 pinch cloves, and 1 pinch ginger in a bowl. Mix until smooth. Drizzle icing over scones in a zigzag pattern. Let dry before serving, about 1 hour.

Description: 
I decided I no longer wanted to fork out big bucks for the autumn delight of pumpkin scones from that famous coffee chain. I went on a hunt for something I could make myself and got this beauty of a recipe. They're even softer than the ones I've loved from the store with the mermaid logo and way too easy to make. Serve with chai tea!
