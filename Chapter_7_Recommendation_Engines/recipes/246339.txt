Ingredients:
1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 gallon whole milk

Directions:
Bring vinegar and salt to a boil in a saucepan. Add milk; reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring constantly, until milk separates and curds begin to form, 5 to 7 minutes.
Line a strainer with cheesecloth. Spoon curdled milk into the cheesecloth, place over a bowl, and refrigerate until fully drained, at least 2 hours. Transfer strained curds to a bowl to serve.
