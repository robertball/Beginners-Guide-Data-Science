Artichoke and Feta-Stuffed Chicken Breasts Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
½ cup marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
⅓ cup crumbled feta
¼ cup finely chopped red bell pepper
¼ cup chopped green onion
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
4  bone-in chicken breasts, with skin
olive oil, or as needed
seasoned salt, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.
Combine artichoke hearts, feta, bell pepper, green onion, oregano, and pepper in a bowl.
Carefully loosen the skin on each chicken breast by running your fingers between the skin and the meat, creating a pocket. Stuff some of the artichoke mixture into each pocket. Place stuffed breasts in the prepared baking dish. Brush lightly with oil and sprinkle with seasoned salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
