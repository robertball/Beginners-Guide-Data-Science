Ingredients:
1 banana cake mix (I prefer Duncan Hines)
1 small package instant vanilla pudding (could use banana flavor instead)
1 cup over ripe bananas, mashed (about 4 med)
1/3 cup vegetable or canola oil
1/4 cup water
4 large eggs
Streusel:
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon cocoa
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened

Directions:
Grease and flour a bundt pan. Pre-heat oven to 350. In medium bowl combine all streusel ingredients except for butter, breaking up any large compressed pieces of brown sugar. Using pastry blender, fork or hands cut and work the softened butter into the dry streusel ingredients until all is moist and crumbly; set aside. In large mixing bowl combine all the cake batter ingredients. Mix on high 2 minutes. Pour or spoon 1/2 the batter into prepared bundt pan. Spread evenly in pan,  thenusing back of spoon make indent (shallow trough) all around and in center of batter. Sprinkle evenly 1/2 the streusel over batter covering to edges. Spoon and evenly spread remaining batter over streusel, then rest of streusel evenly on top. bake at 350 for 55 to 60 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean (there may be streusel stuck to toothpick, that's ok just not undercooked batter). Cool completely and invert onto serving platter.
