Description: 
More like a relish than a true jam, this spicy delicacy will tingle your taste buds and is a great way to use a bumper crop of tomatoes and super over cream cheese with crackers!  I always get rave reviews whenever I open a jar of this jam. Use as you would a relish – great over cream cheese served with crackers!
