Ingredients:
8 large eggs
1½ ounces sharp cheddar cheese, grated (about 1/2 cup)
1 Tbsp chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 Tbsp chopped chives
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
8 slices thick cut bacon
1 Tbsp olive oil
¼ small onion, cut into ½” pieces
6 fingerling potatoes, thinly sliced
1 bunch small Swiss chard, ribs and stems removed, leaves coarsely chopped

Directions:
Heat broiler. Whisk eggs in a large bowl, then whisk in cheese and herbs; season with salt and pepper.
Cook bacon in a 10” cast iron skillet, over medium heat, stirring often, until browned and crisp, about 3 minutes. Break into large pieces and transfer to plate.
Heat oil in same skillet; add onion, season with salt, and cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften, about 1 minute. Add potatoes and cook, tossing occasionally, until just softened, about 5 minutes.
Add chard and cook, stirring often, until chard is wilted; season with salt and pepper. Mix in bacon. Pour in egg mixture, tilting skillet to evenly distribute. Cook, undisturbed, 2 minutes, then transfer to oven and broil until egg is cooked through and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Run a heatproof spatula around edges of frittata to loosen, then slide onto a plate; serve in wedges.
