Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons lemon zest
3/4 cup Almond Breeze Unsweetened Original OR any Almond Breeze Almond-Cashew Blend
1/2 cup canola or vegetable oil
2 large eggs, slightly beaten
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
Lemon Glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon almond extract
3 tablespoons sliced almonds for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 loaf pan with cooking spray and set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder. In a small bowl, combine sugar and lemon zest. Rub together with your fingers until fragrant. Whisk into the flour mixture. Set aside.
In a separate medium bowl, combine the almond milk, oil, eggs, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, vanilla, and almond extract.
Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients. Stir until combined. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.
Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean. Place the loaf on a cooling rack and cool for 15 minutes. Loosen the sides of the bread with a knife. Carefully remove loaf from pan. Let cool completely on wire rack.
While the bread is cooling, make the lemon glaze. In a small bowl, combine powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice, and almond extract. Whisk until smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the lemon almond bread. Sprinkle sliced almonds over the bread. Cut and serve.
