Description: 
Inspired by a Pillsbury Bake-Off recipe, these chocolate crackle crackle cookies are slightly flavored with orange and topped with a dark chocolate Hershey's Kiss.  One of my Dad's favorites.  Dough is easier to handle if chilled for an hour - I've added that to the prep time.Modified from: Jeanne's Chocolate Kiss Cookies
