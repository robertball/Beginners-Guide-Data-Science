Title:
Grandma's Ground Beef Casserole Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
2 small cans tomato sauce
1 tsp garlic salt
1 cup sour cream
3 ounces cream cheese
1 large white onion, diced
8 ounce package of egg noodles
Sharp cheddar cheese, grated

Directions:
Brown ground beef, drain fat. Add seasonings and tomato sauce to the beef. Simmer the mixture on low for 20 minutes, then remove from heat. Allow beef mixture to sit, covered, for about 2 hours so the flavors can meld.
Cook egg noodles according to package directions. While they cook, mix the cream cheese, sour cream and diced onion together in a bowl. Once the noodles are done, drain and let cool a few moments.
Grease a large casserole dish. Place a layer of egg noodles on the bottom of the dish. Layer some of the cream mixture on top of the noodles, then layer some of the meat mixture on top of the cream. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used up. Top casserole with the sharp cheese. Bake at 350 degrees, uncovered, for 25-30 minutes or until cheese is browned.

Description: 
As the title suggests, this was my Grandmother's recipe. I've tweaked the amount of cheese/ sour cream depending on what I've got in the fridge and it always turns out great! My mother has suggested this was made up as a way to use up ingredients in the fridge.
