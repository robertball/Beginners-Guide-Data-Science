Ingredients:
1  carrot, shredded
1  zucchini, shredded
1 (10 ounce) package silken tofu
1 small yellow onion, diced
1  celery, finely chopped
1  egg, lightly beaten
½ cup dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons red Thai curry paste
⅓ cup fresh basil leaves
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Press carrot and zucchini between paper towels to remove excess moisture.  In a medium bowl combine carrots, zucchini, tofu, onion, celery, egg, bread crumbs and curry paste.
Chop 2/3 of the basil and add it to the tofu mixture.  Mix well and form into 4 patties, about 1/2 inch thick.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Cook patties for 5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.  Serve with remaining basil leaves.
