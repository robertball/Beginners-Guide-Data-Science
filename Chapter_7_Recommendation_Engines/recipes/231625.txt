Ingredients:
6 cups rolled oats
1 cup freshly ground flax seed meal
1 cup steel-cut oats
1 cup oat bran
1/2 cup wheat germ
1 cup chopped pecans
3/4 cup agave nectar
1/2 cup canned pumpkin
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup finely chopped dates
1 cup miniature chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Mix rolled oats, flax seed meal, steel-cut oats, oat bran, wheat germ, and pecans in a large bowl. Whisk agave nectar, pumpkin, brown sugar, water, canola oil, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, and sea salt in a separate bowl, stirring until brown sugar and salt are dissolved. Pour liquid ingredients over rolled oats mixture and stir to coat. Spread mixture on prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, stirring every 20 minutes. Stir dates into granola and continue baking until granola is lightly golden brown, 20 to 30 more minutes, stirring once. Let cool completely and mix miniature chocolate chips into granola. Store in an airtight container.

Description: 
I'm a huge fan of crunchy granola breakfast cereals, but wanted to make my own so I could change it up now and again. Makes a great addition to yogurt or topping for ice cream.
