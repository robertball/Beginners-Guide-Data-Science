2 cups Greek yogurt
3 tablespoons lemon juice

Description: 
Serve this cool, refreshing salad with my Lamb Tagine and Moroccan Couscous on this site.  Make the salad early in the day and keep in the refrigerator to let the flavors blend and intensify.  Add more mint to taste, but do not substitute dried mint; the flavor is just not the same.
