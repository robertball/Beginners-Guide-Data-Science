Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) can olive-oil packed tuna, untrained
1/4 red bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
2 scallions, green parts only, diced
2 teaspoons capers, drained and coarsely chopped
1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme
1/2 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 pinch red pepper flakes
4 slices ciabatta bread
1 teaspoon olive oil, or to taste
2 slices fresh Asiago, or more to taste

Directions:
Drain about 1/2 of the olive oil from the tuna. Scrape tuna and remaining oil into a mixing bowl. Add bell pepper, scallions, capers, and thyme. Add lemon juice, mayonnaise, and red pepper flakes. Stir gently to combine.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Lay bread slices crust-sides up on an unlined baking sheet. Brush with olive oil. Broil until nicely browned, about 1 minute.
Turn bread slices over with tongs and divide the tuna filling between 2 slices. Arrange Asiago cheese over the other two slices. Return to broiler. Heat until cheese is bubbly and golden brown and filling is hot, about 2 minutes.
Remove from oven. Use tongs to turn the cheese-topped slices over on top of those spread with filling. Slice tuna melts in half and serve immediately.
