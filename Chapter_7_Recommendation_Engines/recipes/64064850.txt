2 cups gluten free shredded coconut (not ground and not coconut flour)
3/4 cup white granulated sugar
1/4 cup GF white all-purpose flour
3 egg whites
1/2 cup shredded coconut for dusting

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Preheat oven to 285°F (140°C).
Cream together egg whites and sugar in a large bowl.  Beat for at least two minutes.
Slowly add the 2 cups of coconut and GF flour to the cream mixture.
Shape into balls approximately 20 grams each.
Roll each ball in the extra coconut before placing on the baking sheet.  Leave sufficient space between each cookie as they puff out some during cooking.
Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown.
Let cool before serving.

Description: 
These traditional Italian soft cookies are a hit at any get-together.  I've made them gluten free but you can use the same amount of all purpose wheat flour in place of the GF flour.  There are many variations of this cookie in Italy.  Some people add chocolate chips, some drizzle dark chocolate over them once cooled.
