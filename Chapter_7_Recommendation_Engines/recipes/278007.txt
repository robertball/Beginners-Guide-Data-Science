Ingredients:
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons maple syrup
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1 cup finely ground almond meal
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed

Directions:
Combine eggs, olive oil, maple syrup, vanilla extract, salt, almond meal, and baking powder in a bowl. Whisk until thoroughly combined. Let batter sit for 10 minutes to marry the flavors and activate the baking powder.
Butter a nonstick pan or griddle over medium heat. Scoop in batter into any size pancake(s) you like. Cook until edges are set and bottom is golden brown, 2 or 3 minutes. Flip and cook until slightly springy to the touch, another 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
It's always nice when the best version of a recipe is also the easiest. After testing many almond flour pancake recipes that always came out unbalanced in different ways, I now give you the most texturally and *tastily* superior one of them all. Oh, and they are gluten-free, in case you're wondering. Serve with fresh fruit coated in maple syrup!
