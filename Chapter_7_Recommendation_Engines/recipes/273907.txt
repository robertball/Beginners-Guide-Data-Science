Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
6 ripe bananas, mashed
2 eggs, beaten
1 1/2 cups cake flour
3 tablespoons cake flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chocolate chips
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a loaf pan with cooking spray.
Cream sugar and butter together in a bowl. Add bananas and eggs; mix well. Sift 1 1/2 cups plus 3 tablespoons cake flour, baking soda, and salt into the butter mixture and stir to combine. Add chocolate chips and vanilla extract. Pour 1/2 the batter into the prepared pan.
Add chocolate-hazelnut spread to the pan and spread it out. Add remaining batter evenly on top. Swirl a knife through the mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes, depending on your oven.
Let banana bread cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let it cool another 10 to 15 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I have tried countless yummy banana bread recipes as my husband is literally obsessed with bananas! He'll eat them any way possible; on toast, in a shake, with ice cream, yogurt, etc! When it comes to banana bread he is my number one taste tester. This one uses a swirl of Nutella® for even more flavor.
