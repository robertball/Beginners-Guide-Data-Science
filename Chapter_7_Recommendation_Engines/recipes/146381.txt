Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
⅔ cup sliced almonds
6 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 ½ cups whipping cream
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons orange marmalade
⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the almonds, and cook until light brown and toasted, about 4 minutes.
Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap or waxed paper; flatten using a meat mallet or rolling pin. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium meat; add the chicken breasts, and cook 1 minute on each side. Combine 1/2 cup almonds, cream, Dijon mustard, marmalade, and red pepper flakes with chicken, stirring to blend. Cook until sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Serve chicken topped with sauce and remaining almonds.

Description: 
This chicken is filled with flavor and very elegant looking. It always brings raves from my husband, a man not prone to rave about food, since he is an excellent cook himself. Serve the chicken with hot rice and top with sauce.
