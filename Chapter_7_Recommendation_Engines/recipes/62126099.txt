Ingredients:
1 large head of broccoli cut up
6 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup flour
1 1/2 cups milk
teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
dash of onion powder
dash of garlic powder
6-8 oz shredded cheddar
2 slices bread or breadcrumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Steam or boil the broccoli until somewhat tender.
Melt 5 tablespoons of the butter on medium low heat.  Once melted, add flour, stirring to prevent browning.  Slowly add milk, stirring constantly. Once incorporated, take off heat and stir in cheese & seasonings.
Place broccoli in a casserole dish and pour sauce on top. Bake in preheated oven for about 20 minutes.  Before the last 5 minutes add bread crumb topping. (I crumbled up a couple slices of bread and then with the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter, just browned it a little on the stove top before sprinkling over the casserole)
Once browned slightly....serve & Enjoy!

Made this last night for the first time...I think even people who hate broccoli will LOVE this!  So simple, I recommend trying any kind of veggie or cheese combo.
