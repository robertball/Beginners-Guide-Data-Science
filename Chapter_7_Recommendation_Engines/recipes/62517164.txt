Ingredients:
1 cup butter or margarine
2 cups chopped onion
2 cups chopped celery
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 lb. bulk sage-flavored sausage, cooked

1 teaspoon poultry seasoning

1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 to 2 1/2 cups chicken broth, or as needed

Directions:
Crumble and cook sausage in a large skillet over medium heat.  Reserve sausage, leaving 2 tsp. fat in the skillet.  Add the butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook onion, celery and parsley in butter, stirring frequently.  Add reserved sausage and toss to combine.
Spoon cooked mixture over bread cubes in a very large mixing bowl. Season with poultry seasoning, sage, thyme, marjoram, and salt and pepper. Pour in enough broth to moisten, and mix in eggs. Transfer mixture to slow cooker, and cover.
Cook on High for 45 minutes, then reduce heat to Low, and cook for 4 to 8 hours.
