Ingredients:
1 pound spaghetti
1/4 pound Romano cheese, grated
1/4 pound shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 pound shredded provolone cheese
1/2 cup margarine, melted
1 pinch garlic powder

Directions:
In a large pot of lightly salted boiling water, cook the spaghetti 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium casserole dish. In a bowl, mix the Romano cheese, mozzarella cheese, and provolone cheese. In a separate bowl, blend the melted margarine and garlic powder.
Cover the bottom of the prepared dish with 1/3 of the cooked spaghetti, top with 1/3 of the cheese mixture, and drizzle with 1/3 margarine mixture. Repeat layering. Be sure to end with cheese on top. (If you really like garlic you can sprinkle between layers as desired.)
Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is bubbly and lightly brown.
