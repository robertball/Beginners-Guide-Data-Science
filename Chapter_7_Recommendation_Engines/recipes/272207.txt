Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 medium carrots, diced
1 ear fresh corn, kernels cut from cob
1 stalk celery, halved and diced
6 cups chicken stock (such as Swanson®)
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, lime, and cilantro (such as RO*TEL®)
1 ancho chile pepper, diced
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 pound fresh littleneck clams
1 pound fresh mussels
1 pound fresh cod, cut into bite-sized pieces
3/4 pound fresh shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped, or to taste
1 avocado, peeled and sliced

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a stockpot over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Add carrots, corn, and celery and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add chicken stock, tomatoes, ancho chili, chili powder, and cumin and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, place clams and mussels in a bowl of cold water to filter out sand.
Drain clams and mussels; add to the soup. Stir in cod and shrimp. Cover and boil until cod is white and flaky, mussels and clams are open, and shrimp is pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve immediately, topped with cilantro and avocado.
