Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (1 ounce) package Ranch-style dressing mix
2 carrots, finely chopped
1/2 cup chopped red bell peppers
1/2 cup chopped cauliflower
1/2 cup fresh broccoli, chopped
1/2 cup chopped black olives
16 oz. Finely grated Cheddar Cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Roll out crescent rolls onto a large non-stick baking sheet.  Stretch and flatten to form a single rectangular shape on the baking sheet. Bake 11 to 13 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Allow to cool.
Place cream cheese in a medium bowl. Mix cream cheese with 1/2 of the ranch dressing mix.  Adjust  the amount of dressing mix to taste. Spread the mixture over the cooled crust. Arrange veggies and cheese on top. Chill in the refrigerator approximately 1 hour. Cut into bite-size squares to serve.
