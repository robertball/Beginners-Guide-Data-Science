Ingredients:
4 tbs. + 1 tsp. unsalted butter
1/4 cup + 1 tsp. all purpose flour
2 tbs. unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
3 oz. unsweetened chocolate, broken into 1/2 oz. pieces
2 oz. semisweet chocolate, broken into 1/2 oz. pieces
3 eggs
1 cup granulated sugar
1 tsp. vanilla
1/4 cup sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Lightly coat a 9 by 9 by 2 inch square baking pan with 1 tsp. butter, then flour the pan with 1 tsp. flour, shaking out excess.
Sift together the remaining 1/4 cup flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt onto wax paper. Set aside.
Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium high heat. Place the unsweetened and semisweet chocolates and the butter in top half of the double boiler. Tightly cover the top with film wrap. Heat for 4 1/2 to 5 minutes, remove from the heat, and stir until smooth.
Place the eggs, sugar, and vanilla in a bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a balloon whip. Mix on high until slightly thickened, about 1 1/2 minutes.
Add the melted chocolate mixture and mix on medium for 30 seconds.
Add the sifted ingredients and stir on low for 10 seconds, and then on medium for 10 seconds.
Add the sour cream and mix on medium for 5 seconds
Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a rubber spatula to combine thoroughly.
Pour the batter into prepared cake pan, spreading evenly, including corners.
Bake in preheated oven until toothpick inserted near center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
Remove the brownies from the oven and allow to cool in the pan at room temperature for 10-15 minutes. Use a serrated knife to cut into 12 portions.
