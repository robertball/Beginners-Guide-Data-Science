Ingredients:
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite size pieces
2 cups snow peas
2 cups cremini mushrooms, stems discarded, caps thinly sliced
4 bunches green onions, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 large ripe but firm avocados - peeled, pitted, and cut into large chunks

Directions:
In a bowl, stir together the chicken broth, soy sauce, cornstarch, and garlic until the cornstarch is smooth, and set aside.
Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering, and cook and stir the chicken until cooked through and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Remove from the wok and set aside. Place the snow peas into the hot wok, and cook and stir until bright green and still crisp, about 3 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and green onions, and toss with the snow peas in the hot oil until the mushrooms are tender and have given up their juice, about 5 minutes. Pour off excess juices, if any.
Return the chicken to the wok, and stir briefly over medium heat to combine with the cooked vegetables. Stir the reserved sauce ingredients to recombine, if needed, and add to the wok. Gently stir in the avocado, and let the mixture bubble until the sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Stir gently to coat everything in sauce, and serve.

Description: 
I created this recipe after trying a similar dish at a local Chinese restaurant.  The avocado tastes SO good with snow peas and chicken.  Be sure you use unripened avocados so they don't turn to mush during the cooking process! Serve over rice.
