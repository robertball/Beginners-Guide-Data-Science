Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose or bread flour, plus more for dusting
1/3 tsp active dry yeast
1 tsp salt

Directions:
In a large bowl stir together the flour, yeast and salt.
Add 1 ½ cups plus 2 tablespoons water and mix until combined.  It will be sticky.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest for 18-24 hours at room temperature.
Flour a work surface and place dough on it.  Sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice, then roughly shape into a ball.
Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour.  Put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour. Fold it over the bread or cover with another cotton towel and let it sit for another hour or two.
Preheat the oven to 450°.
Put a 6-8 quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats.
When the dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and flip the dough over into the pot.
Cover and bake for 30 minutes, then remove the lid and bake another 10-15 minutes, until golden.
