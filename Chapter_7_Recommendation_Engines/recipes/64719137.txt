Ingredients:
1 tbsp unsalted butter (or olive oil for dairy-free)
1 large white onion, chopped
3 cups reduced-sodium vegetable broth
1 lb peeled baby carrots
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1/4 cup reduced fat sour cream (tofutti sour cream or coconut milk for dairy free) - I actually used a whole can of coconut milk instead of 1/4 cup
kosher salt and white pepper to taste
2 tbsp fresh microgreens or chopped chives for garnish

Directions:
In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat; add onions and cook, stirring often, until onions are soft, about 5-6 minutes.
Add broth, carrots, and ginger. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until carrots are soft, about 30 minutes. (OPTIONAL - cook in instant pot for 15 minutes at high pressure.  Natural release)
Add sour cream, using an immersion blender (or in batches in a regular blender), carefully blend until smooth. Bring soup back to a boil, adjust salt and pepper to your taste.
Ladle into 4 bowls and garnish with a little more sour cream and fresh chives if desired. Makes 5 cups.
