Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup minced onion (I like to puree mine with the water for smoothness)
3 tbsp minced garlic
1/2 cup Chili Garlic Sauce
3/4 cup water
1 cup tomato paste
1/2 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
1 cup whiskey
1 tbsp onion powder
1 tbsp hot paprika (optional)
1 tbsp smoked paprika
1 teaspoon onion powder
3 tablespoons dark molasses
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper (optional)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a large sauce pan. Heat to boiling stirring constantly. Reduce to a very low simmer. Stir occasionally. Cook about 2 hours until thick and the sauce has reduced by about 1 cup.
