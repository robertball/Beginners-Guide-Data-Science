Ingredients:
7 ounces feta cheese
4 sprigs fresh thyme
7 fluid ounces white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon honey

Directions:
Rinse the feta cheese, and pat dry with paper towels. Cut into half-inch cubes. In a 1 pint glass jar, place a layer of cheese cubes, followed by a layer of thyme. Repeat layers until the jar is nearly full. Whisk together the white wine vinegar and honey; pour over the cheese until the jar is full. Screw the lid on, and leave in the refrigerator to marinate for at least one day.
