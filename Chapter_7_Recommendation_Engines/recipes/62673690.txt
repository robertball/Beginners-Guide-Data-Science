Ingredients:
1) 1 pound of chorizo, cooked (may substitute ground beef/chicken/turkey/pork but season it with taco mix)
2) 16 oz Velveeta
3) 16 oz Queso Blanco (Mexican dipping cheese)
3) 2 cans Rotel, drain only 1 of the cans (any flavor, your choice)
4) 1 can black olives, drained and finely chopped
5) 1 poblano pepper, finely diced

Directions:
1) Cook the chorizo (or other meat) with the poblano pepper in a skillet. Add in the black olives towards the end of cooking.
2) While the above is cooking, dice up the Velveeta and coarsely crumble the Queso Blanco into a slow cooker or large stock pot.
3) Add the Rotel to the cheese mixture and cook on medium-low heat.
4) Once the meat mixture is complete, add it to the cheese.
5) Cook until all the cheese is melted plus 10 minutes.
6) Switch slow cooker to &quot;keep warm&quot; or turn your stovetop off and place lid.

Description: 
This dip is always a hit with the kids and of course all the adults. I put it all in my slow cooker and walk away. When I'm done making the fixings for taco night, I just spoon the dip into a bowl and put it on the table.
