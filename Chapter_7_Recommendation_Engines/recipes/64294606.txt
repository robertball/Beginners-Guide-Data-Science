Ingredients:
1 (14 oz) can sweetened condensed milk
18 oz Candy Cane flavored Wilton Candy Melts
1/8 t salt
2 cups chopped chocolate sandwich cookies

Directions:
In a saucepan over low heat, melt the sweetened condensed milk, candy melts, and salt until smooth.
Meanwhile,coarsely chop the cookies with a knife (this will prevent the fudge from turning a gray color when you stir in the cookies). Grease an 8x8 pan with shortening, then line with wax paper.
Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the cookie chunks. Spread evenly in the 8x8 pan. Refrigerate for a few hours until firm. Cut evenly before serving and wrap tightly before storing leftover pieces in the refrigerator.

Description: 
My 12 year old daughter came up with this recipe. I was initially reluctant to try it, but the delicious flavor quickly convinced me. It is now a Christmas tradition to make this fudge!
