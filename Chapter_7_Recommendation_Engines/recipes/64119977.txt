Ingredients:
1 lb. Pasta (Mini Bow Tie or Penne, or Rotini)
5 or 6 oz. summer sausage or Italian dry salami
5 or 6 oz. cheddar cheese
1 green bell pepper
1 small to medium Walla Walla Sweet onion or substitute equivalent green onion
1 14 oz. can black olives
3/4 dry pint cherry tomatoes (or equivalent firm Roma tomatoes)
1 Tbl. salt or to taste
1/2 Tbl. fresh ground pepper or to taste
2 Tbl. Italian seasoning (mix of oregano, basil, rosemary, etc.)
2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced fine
1/2 cup olive oil (basil flavored is good)
1/4 cup white balsamic or white wine vinegar

Directions:
Prepare the pasta according to directions, keep slightly firm, not soft. Drain and put pasta in pasta bowl, toss with a bit of the olive oil.
While pasta is cooking, dice meat, cheese, pepper, and onion into 1/4 inch pieces.  Cut the olives and tomatoes in half, then thirds, i.e. small pieces similar to the other.  There should be about equal volumes of each ingredient.
Toss the finely chopped ingredients in with the pasta, adding olive oil, vinegar, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.  Adjust oil and other seasonings to taste but try not to toss too much.
Serve as is at room temperature, chilled, or also good slightly warmed up.
Keeps well for several days in refrigerator.  For same or next day serving, feta cheese is a good substitute.

Description: 
July 2014 -- Our roofing crew was treated to this several times during the hottest month of July since 1934, as they stripped 5 roof layers and rebuilt all the soffits and fascia on our 1909 home.  Jesse, the 9 year old yard clean up helper, claims it as his favorite pasta in the world!
