Ingredients:
1 cup chicken broth
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon minced ginger
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (or 1 1/2 pound chicken tenders), cut in slices
2 cloves garlic, minced
8 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms
4 ounces sliced fresh carrots, parboiled for two minutes
1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained
6 ounces snow peas

Directions:
Mix together the chicken broth, soy sauce, cornstarch, ginger and sesame oil in a small bowl; set aside.
Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet on medium high heat.
Stir fry the chicken and garlic in the hot oil until the chicken is just cooked through. Remove from heat and keep warm.
Stir fry the carrots, snow peas, mushrooms and water chestnuts until the snow peas turn a bright green but are still crispy.
Return the chicken to the wok and add the reserved chicken broth mixture.
Cook until the sauce begins to thicken, about 3 to 5 minutes. Season with more sesame oil if desired.
Serve immediately over hot rice.
