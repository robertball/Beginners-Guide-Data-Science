Description: 
The original recipe didn't have enough jalapeno kick for me so I upped the amount of jalapeno in mine and left out the additional mayonnaise and subbed a little sour cream for a bit of a bite.  I also left out the Parmesan and was left with a dip that really does taste like your eating a jalapeno popper!  Serve with fresh tortilla chips.Modified from: Jalapeno Popper Spread
