Ingredients:
6 tablespoons butter or margarine, divided
1 1/2 pounds halibut steaks, bones removed and cut into 1 inch cubes
2 garlic cloves, minced
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 cup heavy whipping cream
8 ounces lasagna noodles, cooked and drained
2 cups shredded Swiss cheese
Minced fresh parsley

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add halibut, garlic and thyme. Cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes. Remove and set aside. Add the remaining butter to the skillet. Stir in flour and salt until smooth; cook and stir until golden brown. Gradually add broth and cream. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. In a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish, layer half of the noodles, halibut, white sauce and cheese. Repeat layers. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Uncover; bake 20 minutes longer or until bubbly. Let stand 15 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with parsley if desired.

Description: 
I use tender, mild halibut that we catch in Cook's Inlet near our home for this delectable white lasagna. Even 'meat and potatoes lovers' compliment its great taste. You can substitute cod or chicken for the halibut if you like. -Evelyn Gebhardt, Kasilof, Alaska
