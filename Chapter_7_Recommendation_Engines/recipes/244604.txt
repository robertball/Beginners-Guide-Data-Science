Ingredients:
2 tablespoons oil
2 cups 1-inch pieces pork
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
1/4 pound mushrooms, sliced
2 cups chicken broth
2 cups sliced celery
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 cups fresh bean sprouts
1/2 cup sliced almonds
3 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons cornstarch

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pork until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and mushrooms and cook until slightly tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add chicken broth, celery, salt, and black pepper; bring to a boil. Cover skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until pork is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Mix bean sprouts and almonds into pork mixture. Whisk soy sauce and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pork mixture until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.

Description: 
This was a favorite with the grand kids. I sometimes use chicken breast in place of the pork. Serve over rice and crunchy noodles.
