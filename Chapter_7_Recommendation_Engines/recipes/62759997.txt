Ingredients:
1 lb (thin) spaghetti
1 lb bacon, regular slices
1 Tbsp oil
4 eggs
¾ cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese
¼ cup heavy cream
1 tsp pepper
½ tsp salt
2 Tbsp butter or margarine

Directions:
Fry bacon until crisp and brown.  Let cool and crumble.
Cook spaghetti in salted water for 4-6 minutes or until cooked.  Drain.
Beat eggs in bowl with ½ cup of cheese, salt, pepper, & cream.
Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat.  Gradually beat in egg mixture when butter is dark gold.  Stir quickly.  Add bacon when mixture begins to thicken.  Stir well and quickly.  Mix in spaghetti, stirring rapidly so that mixture coats the spaghetti strands.  Cook until the egg mixture is well cooked, stirring the spaghetti periodically.
Serve at once, adding additional Parmesan cheese as desired.

Description: 
My mother brought this recipe back with her from Naples when my father was stationed there many years ago.  It has served as a staple in my mother's kitchen, as well as in my own.  This sauce-less spaghetti is heaven on a plate!
