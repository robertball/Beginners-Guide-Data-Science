Description: 
My Grandma Opal June Carlson (Gram C) made these cookies whenever my dad and I came to her cottage on Lake Okoboji for a visit. Although at the time I picked off the pecan halves that my 7 yr old self didn't yet appreciate, these simply delicious cookies were amazing and will live forever in my heart along with my Gram C! :)
