Ingredients:
4 - one ounce squares unsweetened chocolate
1 - 1/2 sticks of butter (3/4 cup)
1 -2/3 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract - do not use imitation vanilla!
3 eggs
1 cup plus 3 tablespoons flour
2 tablespoons milk
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
line a 13 x 9 inch pan with aluminum foil so the foil overlaps the two ends
Grease foil generously with crisco. This makes it easier to get them out of the pan
Cut butter into 2" chunks and place in a microwave proof bowl with chocolate squares.
Microwave butter and chocolate on high for 2 minutes
Remove from microwave and stir until chocolate is completely melted.
Add sugar and stir until well mixed.
Add eggs one at a time until well mixed.
Add vanilla
Stir in flour and cinnamon.
Stir in walnuts if desired
Since half my family likes nuts I spread the batter into the pan first and add walnuts to one half of the pan.
Bake 35 minutes until knife inserted in middle comes out clean. Do not overbake!
Set pan on cooling rack for 10 minutes.
Lift brownies out of pan using foil handles and cut into square when cool enough touch
Store in baggie or airtight container if you have any left at the end of the night!

Description: 
I've searched far and wide for a brownie recipe that was the perfect combination of chewy and cakey. After experimenting with many different ingredients this is the definitive one for our family. After I made them for the first time, both of my sons  and my husband said there were the best they've ever had.
