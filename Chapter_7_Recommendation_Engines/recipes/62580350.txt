Directions:
Melt butter and oil in large fry pan.  Cook together, chicken, hash browns, green pepper, onion and chicken broth and spices.  Cook liquid out and fry.  May need to add more olive oil as you fry.  These potatoes will not get super crispy.  Right at the end, add chopped Broccolini and cheddar cheese.  Cook a few more minutes.
