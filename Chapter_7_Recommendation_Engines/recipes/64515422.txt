Ingredients:
6 cups rolled oats
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup margarine, melted
1 cup corn syrup
1/2 - 1 cup chocolate chips
1/3  cup ground flax seed (or 1/2 cup whole flax seed. *More nutrition available from the ground seed), optional
1 cup coconut

Directions:
In large bowl, mix all ingredients together well.
Spread in a greased 11" x 17" jelly roll pan.
Bake 20 - 25 minutes @ 350 (or until edges are just starting to brown - could be less than 25 minutes). For softer, chewier bars reduce time a bit.
Remove from oven and cut into portions while it's still quite warm. This will make the final cutting much easier once they're cooled.
