Ingredients:
6  cups all-purpose flour (white or wheat)
12  tablespoons cornstarch

Directions:
Measure out the amount needed for your recipe. I always measure out 6 cups of all purpose flour.
For every 1 cup of flour remove 2 Tbsp of flour.
Now add 2 Tbsp of Cornstarch for every 1 cup of flour. (replacing the tablespoons of flour taken out).
Sift 5-6 times and it's ready-to-use cake flour.
*To sift flour without a sifter just use a strainer by filling it with flour and tapping against the palm of your hand over a bowl.
(left-over flour can go back in the bag).
Always measure the flour that is needed after its sifted.
