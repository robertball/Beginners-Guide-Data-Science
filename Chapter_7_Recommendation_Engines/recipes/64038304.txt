Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 red bell pepper, chopped
2 bunches asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
1 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
salt to taste
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper
3 tablespoons butter
1 pound grilled chicken breast strips or chicken sausage
1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup pecan halves or pine nuts, toasted

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, red pepper, and asparagus; cook and stir 5 minutes until the garlic softens and mellows. Pour in the chicken broth, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Simmer until the vegetables have softened, then add the basil, salt, peppers, butter, and chicken. Cook and stir a few minutes until the chicken is hot. Stir in the cooked pasta, then fold in the Parmesan cheese and pecan halves to serve.
