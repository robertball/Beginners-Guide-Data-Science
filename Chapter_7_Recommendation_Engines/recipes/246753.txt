1/4 cup rice wine

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add tofu; cook and stir until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in water chestnuts; cook until softened, about 2 minutes.

Description: 
I got some pea vines at our local farmers' market, and I couldn't find any recipes for them, so I made one up. I was very pleased with how it came out! The ginger/tomato combination was quite tasty, and I think it would be good with a pea vine substitute as well. Serve over rice.
