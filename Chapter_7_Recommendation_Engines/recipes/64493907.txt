Ingredients:
Three Zucchinis (green, yellow or both), rinsed and chopped
4 Tbsp Butter
Two Shallots, diced
One Clove Garlic, minced (optional)
One Cup Gruyère Cheese, grated
One Cup Panko Bread Crumbs
Salt and Pepper to Taste
1 Tbsp Rosemary, chopped
2 Tbsp Basil, chopped
1½ Tbsp Flour
¾ Cup Light Cream

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400°F.
Rinse the zucchinis and then slice them into pieces, and put the slices into a bowl.
Once the bowl is full (and all of the zucchinis are cut), melt some butter in a frying pan, and sauté the slices along with diced shallots and minced garlic, for ten minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste to the pan, as well as basil and rosemary.
In the meantime, use the mixing bowl to mix the Gruyère and bread crumbs together.
Once the sauté is done, mix in flour, and then add heavy cream in the stream (turn the burner up and down as necessary). Once the cream and flour are mixed in to create a thick mixture, add half of the bowl of cheese and bread crumbs, and mix it into the sauté.
Turn off the heat, and pour the sauté into a baking dish. Top it with the mixture of bread crumbs and cheese, and bake it for 20 minutes.
Use a large spoon to scoop out a portion of the gratin, and put it on a plate. Serve immediately!!

This was my first attempt at a gratin and I think it turned out nicely! It's a healthy, cheesy vegetable casserole.
