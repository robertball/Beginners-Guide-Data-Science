Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1 cup peanut butter
1 cup butter or margarine
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
2 eggs
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
1 1/2 cups raisins
6 cups toasted oat cereal rings (such as CheeriosÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a very large bowl, mix together the sugar, peanut butter, butter, water, vanilla and eggs until smooth. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the batter. Mix in the oats and raisins, then carefully stir in the cereal. Drop 1/2 cupfuls of dough onto ungreased cookie sheets, spacing cookies about 4 inches apart. Flatten cookies to 1 inch thick.
Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are lightly browned at the edges. Let stand on the cookie sheets for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely. Store at room temperature. I like to put each cookie into a sandwich bag which makes them easy to grab on the way out the door.

Description: 
Jumbo breakfast cookies are perfect for grabbing on the way out the door.  Feel free to substitute chocolate chips or dried cranberries for the raisins or any combination of the three for a little different twist.
