Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Mix the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, salt, egg, milk, and vegetable oil in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl.
Heat in the microwave on high, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 3 minutes, rotating the bowl halfway through cooking if the microwave does not have a rotating tray.

Description: 
It literally takes me 5 minutes to get this cornbread on the table--including absolutely all steps. I'll be honest--it tastes better baked in a regular oven.  But it's still pretty darn good in the microwave, and sometimes I only have 5 minutes!
