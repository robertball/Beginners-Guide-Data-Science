Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 onions, minced
4 cloves garlic, chopped
2 eggplants, cut into chunks
1 red chile pepper, chopped
2 teaspoons cumin seeds
2 teaspoons coriander seeds, lightly crushed
1 teaspoon saffron threads
1 teaspoon salt
4 cups drained and rinsed canned chickpeas
1/2 cup pitted large green olives
1/2 cup basmati rice
1 thin-skinned lemon, thinly sliced
2 1/2 cups vegetable broth
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions and garlic in the hot oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in eggplant, red chile pepper, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, saffron, and salt; cook until eggplant starts to soften, about 5 minutes.
Stir chickpeas, green olives, basmati rice, and lemon slices into the skillet. Pour in vegetable broth. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Fold in cilantro using a fork.
