Ingredients:
6 buttery crackers
1 tablespoon cornmeal
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 shallot, thinly sliced
2 yellow squash, sliced 1/4-inch thick
2 zucchini, sliced 1/4-inch thick
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup 2% milk
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place buttery crackers and cornmeal in a plastic resealable bag; seal and pound into fine crumbs.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shallot; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add yellow squash and zucchini. Season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cook until softened, about 10 minutes.
Stir milk and butter into the skillet. Increase heat to medium-high; cook until butter is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in crumb mixture and Mexican cheese blend. Remove from heat.
Spread yellow squash mixture evenly in an 8-inch square baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 15 minutes. Increase heat to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) and continue baking until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
