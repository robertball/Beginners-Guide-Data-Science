Ingredients:
1 ½ (8 ounce) packages rigatoni pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
½ (16 ounce) package tofu, drained and cubed
½ teaspoon dried thyme
1 ½ teaspoons soy sauce
1 small onion, thinly sliced

6 leaves fresh basil, thinly sliced

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain and cool.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tofu and thyme; cook until tofu is lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drizzle with soy sauce and remove from heat to cool.
Combine rigatoni, tofu mixture, onion, tomato, carrot, basil, and cilantro in a large bowl. Drizzle with 1/4 cup olive oil; stir to coat.
