Ingredients:
3 large or 4 medium vine ripened tomatoes
2 tsp minced garlic
10 basil leaves shredded finely and minced
1/4 tsp fresh cracked black pepper
1/4 tsp sea salt
3 Tbs extra virgin olive oil
1 Tbs fresh squeezed lemon juice

Directions:
In a pot of boiling hot water, par-boil tomatoes for 1 minute and then flash cool in cold water.  Peel skins off with hands and remove stems with either a tomato shark or a paring knife. Squeeze lightly to remove seeds, but not too much liquid.
Finely chop tomatoes and add remaining ingredients.  Allow to marinate for 30 minutes before serving if you are going to eat this immediately.
If canning, do not add the basil or lemon juice immediately.  Heat up the tomato-garlic mixture in a small stock pot until almost boiling.  Add basil & juice immediately and pour into sterile dry half pint jars until 1/4" from the rims.
Seal and place in hot water bath for no less than 15 minutes, but no more than 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is my go-to appetizer for surprise house guests, and is served over toasted french baguette rounds or store bought crostinis.  One can also use it as a pizza sauce for Marguerite pizzas or place it on focaccia and broil with mozzarella cheese for a meal.
