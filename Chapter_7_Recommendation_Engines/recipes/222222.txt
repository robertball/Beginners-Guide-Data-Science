1 teaspoon salt
2 (16 ounce) packages coleslaw mix
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen green peas, thawed
1 cup dry-roasted peanuts

Directions:
Whisk vegetable oil, sugar, vinegar, grated onion, dry mustard, and salt in a bowl, stirring until sugar has dissolved.

Submitter: 
Sunflower
Description: 
A crisp 'no-mayo' coleslaw that is great for potlucks. I have used honey-roasted peanuts and have used sunflower seeds. The honey-roasted peanuts taste great in it. For big crowds I do a double batch.
