Ingredients:
2 pkgs frozen spinach with liquor (thawed)
2 rolls Kraft jalepeno cheddar cheese (you can substitute any type(s) of cheese you wish)
3/4 c. diced white onion
1 c. milk
4 tbs. butter
4 tbs. flour
dash each of celery salt, garlic powder, ground black pepper, & cayenne

Directions:
Squeeze the liquor/juice out of thawed spinach and reserve. Use flour, butter and milk to make a "white sauce" over medium heat. As the sauce thickens, add spinach liquor to desired consistency. Add the cheese slowly, stirring constantly. If the dip gets too thick, add remaining liquor or milk. Add both packages of spinach & stir. Add spices and continue stirring until cheese is melted and dip acheives desired consistency. Pour into an oven-safe dish and sprinkle with buttered bread crumbs. Warm in 350-degree oven for about 10 minutes. Serve with bread, crackers or chips.

Description: 
This is my aunt's recipe for spinach dip--it's a huge hit! You can tone down the spiciness by using plain cheese & omitting the cayenne.
