Ingredients:
3 cups chicken broth or stock
1 can creamed corn
2 cans corn kernels, drained
3 medium potatoes, cut into 1/2 inch chunks
1/2 of a red sweet pepper, chopped
1 can diced green chilies
1 large chicken breast (approximately 1/2 pound), cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon parsley
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons flour
1/2 cup milk
1-2 cups shredded cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients except butter, flour, milk, and cheese in large slow cooker. Cook on low for 6-8 hours.
One hour before serving, melt butter in a small saucepan. Stir in flour, bringing to a boil while stirring constantly. Continue to boil and stir constantly for one minute to make sure mixture is smooth. Remove from heat and stir in milk. Add this roux to the slow cooker, stirring to combine. The roux will help the soup to thicken.
If a cheesy soup is desired, add the cheese to the slow cooker one half hour before serving. Make sure to add cheese after the roux has been added. This will help the cheese to melt properly throughout the soup.
Serve with your favorite crusty loaf of bread.

Description: 
This is a nice hearty soup that simmers in a slow cooker all day. It can be made with or without cheese, according to personal preference. Enjoy it with a nice crusty loaf of bread for dipping. It could also be served in individual bread bowls.
