Ingredients:
3 cups mashed sweet potatoes
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/3 cup dark rum
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup chopped pecans
1/3 cup self-rising flour
1/3 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a large bowl, mix the sweet potatoes and sugar. Stir in the eggs. Mix in milk, vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup melted butter. Gradually stir in the rum until well blended. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish.
In a medium bowl, mix the brown sugar, pecans, flour, and 1/3 cup melted butter. Sprinkle this mixture over the mashed sweet potato mixture.
Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow to sit at least 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This is a simple recipe for sweet potato casserole. But it is also the best I have tasted, enriched with eggs, milk, and rum, and topped with a crunchy pecan streusel. It is a standard at all holiday dinners in my family. The amount of rum can be varied according to taste (the casserole is also good without it.)
