Ingredients:
2 cups quinoa flour
1 cup sorghum flour
1 cup tapioca starch
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum
3 eggs
2 tablespoon agave syrup
1 tablespoon olive
2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 cups warm water
3/4 cup sunflower seeds

Directions:
Whisk agave syrup into warm water and add yeast. Let stand for a few minutes until yeast has bloomed.
Whisk together dry ingredients and add to the bowl of a stand mixer. In a small bowl.
Beat together eggs, oil, and water/agave mixture.
With the mixer running on low speed, add yeast mixture and let incorporate for a few minutes. Add the sunflower seeds and mix until incorporated.
Line an 8.5"x4.5" loaf pan with parchment paper and pour dough inside. Cover with plastic wrap in a warm, draft-free space in your house and let rise for 30 - 45 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. When dough has risen, bake on the center rack for 50 - 60 minutes until loaf has reached an internal temperature of 210 degrees fahrenheit and is browned and sounds hollow when you tap on it.
Remove bread from pan and let cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.

Description: 
This is the first gluten free bread I've made that I've been truly happy with.  It's very reminiscent of a whole wheat bread; nutty, dense, yet gluten free!
