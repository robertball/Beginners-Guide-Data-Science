Ingredients:
1 medium zucchini
1 red bell pepper
1 yellow bell pepper
1 tablespoon Gay Lea Spreadables, melted
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
3 cups cooked quinoa
2 green onions, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves
1 cup Nordica 2% Cottage Cheese
2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 clove garlic, minced

Preheat grill to medium-high. Slice zucchini lengthwise into strips. Core and quarter peppers. Toss zucchini and peppers with the melted Spreadables and half the balsamic vinegar. Place on the grill. Cook, turning as needed, for 7 to 10 minutes or until well-marked and tender. Cool to room temperature and chop into bite-sized pieces.
