Ingredients:
6 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 1/2 cups bread crumbs
1 tbsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp dried basil
1/2 tsp garlic powder
2 tbsp. plus 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, separated
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup water
Cooking spray (I use the canola oil variety)
2 cups prepared spaghetti sauce or seasoned tomato sauce
1 cup shredded mozzarella
Hot cooked pasta with additional sauce.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Whisk together egg and water until well mixed.
In a separate bowl combine breadcrumbs, dried herbs, garlic powder and 2 tbsp. parmesan cheese.
Spray 13" x 9" baking dish with cooking spray.
Double-dip each chicken breast in egg mixture and breadcrumb mixture (Dip in egg, the breadcrumbs, then egg again and breadcrumbs again) and place in baking dish.  If you start to run out of the egg mixture, add a little more water.
Spray breaded chicken breasts lightly with cooking spray.
Bake at 350 for 40 minutes.
Remove from oven and pour some sauce over each piece of chicken.  Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and additional 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese.
Return to oven and bake for another 15 minutes or until cheese is golden and chicken is cooked through.  (You can cover with tin foil if cheese starts to brown too much)

Description: 
In this lighter version of chicken parmesan, I skip the pan-frying in oil and bake lightly breaded chicken breasts in the oven, then top with sauce and cheese.  My family's not big on lots of sauce and cheese, so I just use a little to flavor the dish - feel free to add more if you like, but it's excellent as is.
