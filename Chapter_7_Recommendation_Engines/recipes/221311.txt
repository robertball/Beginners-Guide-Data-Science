Ingredients:
6 slices bacon, diced
1 onion, diced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 cup chicken stock
2 (16 ounce) packages Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved lengthwise

Directions:
Place the bacon, onion, and garlic in a large, deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat until the onions caramelize, 10 to 12 minutes.
Pour the chicken stock into the pan; add the Brussels sprouts. Bring the liquid to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir the mixture so the sprouts are coated in the liquid
Place a cover on the skillet and cook until the sprouts are cooked through yet firm, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
My friend Angela gave me this holiday hit recipe! Everyone loved it and was asking for the recipe. Brussels sprouts have never been a favorite of mine until now. Beef stock can be used in place of chicken stock. Great side dish with our Easter ham. ENJOY!
