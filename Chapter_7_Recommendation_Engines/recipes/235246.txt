Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
5 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into cubes
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 yellow onion, chopped
2 (16 ounce) jars salsa verde (such as Herdez®)
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)
1 (4 ounce) can diced jalapeno peppers, or to taste
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Spread flour into a shallow bowl. Dredge pork cubes in flour to coat.
Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Add pork; cook and stir until pork is browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes.
Transfer pork-and-onion mixture to a slow cooker. Stir salsa verde, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, diced jalapeno peppers, diced green chiles, garlic, oregano, and cumin into the pork mixture.
Cook on Low for 6 hours.
