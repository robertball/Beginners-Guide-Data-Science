Ingredients:
2 chopped yellow onions
1 tbsp olive oil
1 clove garlic minced
1 red bell pepper chopped
1 yellow bell pepper chopped
1 1/4 tsp chili powder
1 1/4 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp dried red pepper flakes
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
2 tsp salt
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled plum tomatoes undrained
1 (14-ounce) can tomato sauce
1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro
1 1/2 lbs ground beef
1 tsp onion powder

Directions:
Cook the onions in oil over medium-low heat for 10-15 minutes, until translucent.  While the onions are cooking, crush the tomatoes and tomato sauce by hand in a separate bowl and set aside.
Into the onions, add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.  Add the bell peppers, chili powder, cumin, red pepper flakes, cayenne, salt, and pepper.  Cook for 1 minute.
Add the tomato mixture to the pot along with the minced cilantro.  Bring to a boil then reduce the heat and simmer.
While the chili is simmering, brown the ground beef in a pan, adding the onion powder towards the end of the browning.  Add the ground beef to the chili.
Simmer for an hour on low heat.
Serve with broken corn chips, grated sharp cheddar, and sour cream.
