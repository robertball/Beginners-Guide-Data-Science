Ingredients:
2 tablespoons canola oil
3 1/2 cups Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 andouille sausage links, chopped into small pieces
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
2 tablespoons canned chopped green chiles
2 prepared pie crusts
1 cup shredded mild Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded Gouda cheese
1 egg
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Add canola oil to a 12-inch nonstick pan over medium heat. Add potatoes, salt, and pepper. Fry until potatoes are fork-tender, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.
Add sausage and onion to the same pan. Cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the bowl of potatoes using a slotted spoon. Stir in green chiles. Allow mixture to cool to room temperature.
Divide each pie crust into 3 pieces. Roll out each piece into an 8-inch circle. Add 3 tablespoons of the potato-sausage mixture to each circle. Mix Cheddar and Gouda cheeses together; sprinkle 3 tablespoons over the filling.
Beat egg and milk together to make egg wash. Fold dough over the filling in a semi-circle shape. Brush the edge of the pastry with egg wash; press to seal. Flute the border with a fork. Brush the tops with egg wash and score tops with a fork.
Space hand pies evenly on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
