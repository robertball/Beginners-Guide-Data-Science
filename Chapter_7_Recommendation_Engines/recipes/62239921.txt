Title:
Summer Cabbage Salad Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 head of cabbage shredded
2 boneless/skinless chicken breast - Preferably barbecued for extra flavor, but baked is ok too.
Dressing
2 packets of Chicken Top Ramen seasoning
1 cup of olive oil
6 Tb Balsamic Vinegar
4 Tb Sugar
6 Chopped green onions
Almond Topping:
Almond slices and sesame seeds, toasted

Directions:
Barbecue the chicken breasts, wait until they cool then cut them into small squares.
Shred the cabbage, mix together cabbage and chicken, set aside.
Make the dressing including the ingredients listed above, mixing it together just before serving to mix the oil and vinegar (best to have guests self serve the dressing to keep the salad from getting soggy).  I also often double this recipe and make 3 times the dressing and there is always great lunch leftovers remaining.  :)  People also love the dressing so more typically goes onto the salad when you let thems self serve than would normally, and that's ok, it makes it very flavorful.
Top with the toasted almond/sesame seed mixture to taste just before serving.  You can also crush up the top ramen not used when making the dressing, and top the salad with these as well.  I prefer them without.
