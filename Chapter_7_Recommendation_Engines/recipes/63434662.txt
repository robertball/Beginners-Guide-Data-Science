Description: 
I served these at our Thanksgiving party.  To say they were a hit would be an understatement.  One guest said it was an orgasm in his mouth (he even moaned a few times), I wasnâ€™t sure what to say but there was a rush to the dessert tray and my other poor cupcakes were quickly overlooked.
