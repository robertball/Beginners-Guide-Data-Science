Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 pounds moose roast
2 cups apple juice
1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the roast on all sides in the hot oil. Remove, and transfer to a slow cooker.
Sprinkle onion soup mix over the roast, then pour in the apple juice. Cover and cook on MEDIUM for 6 to 8 hours, or until meat is very tender. Check occasionally to make sure there is sufficient liquid, and add more juice if necessary. Serve roast with juices, or thicken them for a tasty gravy.

Description: 
I had a moose roast sitting in my freezer for a couple of months, because I had no idea how to cook it, not being a wild game fan.  A friend suggested this method of cooking it and it was delicious.  I made it at Christmas along with the turkey, thinking my guests could have a taste and I wouldn't have to feel guilty about it being in my freezer anymore, but it was the hit of the dinner!
