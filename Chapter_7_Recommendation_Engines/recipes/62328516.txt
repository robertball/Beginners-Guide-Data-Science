Ingredients:
- 4 boneless, skinless, chicken breasts, butterflied
- 14 gms (1/2 ounce) dried porcini mushrooms, soaked for 20 minutes in 150 ml (2/ Cup) boiling water, then removed from the water and squeezed throroughly so that the drips add to the soaking liquid
- 25 gms (1 ounce) butter
- 40 gms (1 1/2 ounces) pancetta (or streaky bacon)
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 1 fat garlic clove, peeled and crushed
- 175 gms (6 1/4 ounces) open cap mushrooms, chopped
- a grating of nutmeg
- 1 heaped teaspoon chopped fresh sage leaves
- salt and freshly milled black pepper
* You will also need 4 pieces of lightly buttered alu foil, each 10 inches (25.5 cms) square
For the sauce:
- 1 teaspoon oil
- 40 gms (1 1/2 ounces) pancetta (or streaky bacon)
- 1 shallot, peeled and finely chopped
- 3 small mushrooms, finely sliced
- 1 teaspoon finely chopped sage leaves
- 1 level Tablespoon plain flour
- The liquid used for soaking the porcini mushrooms
- 150 ml (2/3 Cup) dry Marsala
- Salt and freshly milled black pepper

Directions:
In a heavy skillet, melt the butter and cook the pancetta until golden and crisp. Set bacon aside.
Add onion to the pan, and gently fry to soften, about 5 mins.
Meanwhile finely chop the porcinis, then add them to the onion along with garlic, open cap mushrooms, nutmeg, sage and return the pancetta to the pan. Stir thoroughly to coat everything and heat until the juices start to run from the mushrooms, then reduce the heat to low and let it cook, uncovered, for about 30 minutes, until all the juices have evaporated and you have a thick paste. Remove from heat. Season to taste with s and p. Leave to cool completely.
Season each chicken breast lightly with salt and pepper, spread 1/4 of the mushroom paste onto each.
Do NOT clean the pan.
Roll each breast up like a Swiss roll and place in the centre of an alu foil square.
Wrap up each, making sure that the ends form a good seal, then chill these parcels for at least an hour.
When ready to continue, pre-heat the oven to 230°C (450°F).
In the mushroom pan, add the cooking oil, warm it, then gently fry the pancetta and the shallot for about 5 minutes before adding the mushrooms and sage.
Continue cooking, stirring, for another minute or so until the juices of the mushrooms begin to run.
Then stir in the flour to soak up the juices, increase the heat and gradually add in the porcini soaking juices, followed by the Marsala and a seasoning of s and p.
Keep stirring until it thickens and starts to bubble, reduce the heat (add a spoon of Marsala if too thick) - cook very gently, about 20 minutes.
During this last phase, pop the chicken parcels into the oven on a baking sheet, let cook for 20 minutes and allow to rest for 10 before unwrapping and serving, each cut in 4, at an angle. Cover with sauce.
Serve immediately.
