Ingredients:
4 slices white or whole wheat bread
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Trim the crusts from the bread and roll out the bread with a rolling pin until it is flattened to about 1/16-inch thick. Cut into 4 squares, brush on both sides with butter, and fit into 16 mini-muffin pan cups.
Bake until the toast cups are golden and crisp, about 10 minutes.
