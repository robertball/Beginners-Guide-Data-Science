Description: 
These meatballs use pecan meal as a meat replacement. They are so good, you don't even miss the meat! This recipe does have eggs and cheese in it, so it is not quite vegan. But those items can be substituted to make it so. The ingredients may sound funny, but the result is amazing! The sauce is very zesty so if you don't want it to be too strong cut down on the vinegar some.
