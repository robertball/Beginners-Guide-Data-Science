Ingredients:
1 C KaroÂ® Light Corn Syrup
1 C sugar
1 C creamy peanut butter
2 C crispy rice cereal
4 C Graham Cereal (I like Moms Organic Honey Grahams)
2/3 Bag of Mini Marshmallows
Enough regular sized Hershey Chocolate Candy bars, or a bag of your favorite chocolate chips to line the bottom of a 13 x 9 Pan.

Directions:
Grease 9x13 pan.  Line bottom with the Hershey bars or chips.
Cook corn syrup and sugar together in a large pan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Bring mixture to a boil.  Remove from heat. Stir in peanut butter; mix well.  Add both cereals, and marshmallows; stir until evenly coated. (Don't stir until marshmallow disappear.  I like the globs of marshmallow throughout the bar.  Pour into greased 13x9-inch pan and pat into place.
Cool at least 45 minutes or 5 hours if you live in AZ, or until firm.  Cut into bars.
