Ingredients:
24 graham cracker squares
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup mini semi-sweet chococalte chips
1 cup unsalted butter (no substitutes)
1 cup firmly-packed brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Line a 15" x 10" rimmed cookie sheet with aluminum foil.  (Important!  Make sure your sheet will fit in the freezer before starting the recipe.  If it doesn't fit, you can use a couple of smaller pans that will fit.)  Sray foil lightly with cooking spray.  Place graham crackers in a single layer on the foil.  Sprinkle evenly with pecans and chocolate chips.
In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat melt butter.  Add brown sugar and stir and cook until mixture comes to a full boil.  Boil for 1 minute.
Pour butter mixture evenly over the pecans, chocolate chips and graham crackers.  Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes.
After baking, immediately place the cookie sheet in the freezer.  Freeze for 1 hour.  Break into pieces and store tightly covered at room temperature.

Description: 
This is my favorite treat to make during the holidays.  I've taken a recipe from the newspaper and put my own touch on it by adding chocolate chips.  It is very easy to make.  If you love pecan pie, you will love this!
