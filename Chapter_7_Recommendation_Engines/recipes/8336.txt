Description: 
This recipe was modified from several that I found at the Cake Recipe   site, some of it is taken from the recipe for Secret Cake, but it  has other random ingredients. It's very, very nice, moist and   chocolaty. And the name is a random conglomeration of words from the  various recipes that I used to come up with this one.
