Ingredients:
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/3 cup prepared horseradish
2 slices ham

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
In a small bowl, mix brown sugar, lemon juice and prepared horseradish.
Heat the brown sugar mixture in the microwave on high heat 1 minute, or until warm.
Score both sides of ham slices. Place on the prepared grill. Baste continuously with the brown sugar mixture while grilling. Grill 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.

Description: 
This is a longtime favorite of my family -- even the most selective 'diners' like it! Cooked ham is basted with a warm, zesty sauce while grilling. Smoked turkey slices may be substituted for ham.
