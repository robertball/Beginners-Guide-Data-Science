Ingredients:
1/2 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, roughly chopped
4 medium tomatoes, roughly chopped
1/2 cucumber, roughly chopped with skin on
1/4 cup coconut milk
1 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon heavy cream
1 teaspoon chopped mint leaves
1/4 teaspoon maharajah style curry
1/4 teaspoon salt
pinch black pepper
3 drops lime essential oil (or 3 teaspoons lime zest)

Directions:
1. Heat olive oil in a medium pan over medium. Add the onions and saute for 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for another 2 minutes or until you begin to see the tomatoes give up their juices. Remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool slightly.
2. Puree the tomato mixture in a blender by pulsing several times. Add the cucumbers and pulse until chopped into small pieces. Add in the remaining ingredients and pulse until well combined.
3. Chill the soup for a minimum of 1 hour. Serve in bowls garnished with mint leaves and a grind of black pepper.
