Ingredients:
10oz. can of cream of mushroom soup
1 cup of water
1 cup of milk
3 cups of fresh cubed chicken breast
2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese
2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese
3 cups of broccoli (I use 5, but I'm a broccoli lover!)
1 cup of rice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cook chicken in a frying pan over medium heat until cooked. Mix soup with one can(use soup can) of water. Add the cup milk, and the cup water in large bowl and stir with wire whisk to combine. Add remaining ingredients(except mozzarella cheese) and stir to blend. Pour into 3 quart casserole dish and cover. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, then remove from oven and stir well. Bake uncovered for an additional 20 minutes, stir thoroughly and add mozzarella cheese to top(do not stir in). Bake for 20-25 minutes longer until rice is cooked and edges are bubbling. Enjoy!
