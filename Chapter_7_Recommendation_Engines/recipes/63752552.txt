Ingredients:
19 ounces cream cheese
3 eggs
1/4 cup sugar
1 tsp vanilla
caramel:
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup evaporated milk
crust:
1 cup almond meal
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon fine Sea Salt
1/4 teaspoon ground Cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon Baking Soda
1/4 cup melted butter

Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Crush your slivered almonds.
In a mixing bowl whisk together the almond flour, almonds, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Add the butter and combine with a spoon.
Line a muffin tin with liners. Push the almond mixture into the bottom of the liners.
Bake for 10 minutes to set.
Turn oven down to 300Â°.
In a mixing bowl, add cream cheese, vanilla, sugar and eggs. Beat until light and fluffy.
Spoon mixture into the muffin tins with prepared almond crust.
Bake for 40 minutes.
While cakes are cooking, start on the caramel.
Combine granulated sugar and 2 tablespoons water in a medium, heavy saucepan over medium-high heat; cook until sugar dissolves, stirring gently for 3 minutes.
Stop stirring and continue cooking 10 minutes or until the color of light brown sugar. Remove from heat; carefully stir in butter and milk. Place pan over medium-high heat until caramelized sugar melts. Bring to a boil; cook 1 minute.
Remove pan from heat; cool caramel to room temperature. Cover and chill 1 hour or until slightly thickened.
Take cheesecakes out of the oven when they are done. Once cool, the middle will slightly fall and this is the perfect indent for the caramel.
Spoon about 1 tablespoon caramel over each cheesecake.
