Ingredients:
4-5 medium potatoes
1 can of beets
4 eggs
2 tablespoons of mayo
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Peel potatoes and cut into medium dices. Place potatoes in pot to boil until you can poke fork through potatoes.
Place the eggs to boil until ready.
While potatoes and eggs are boiling, open up canned beets. Remove the juice or liquid and cut beets into very small pieces.
Place beets in a large bowl. Once potatoes are soft, place in bowl with beets. Dice the hard boiled eggs and also place in the bowl. Add the mayo and salt and pepper to taste. Peas are optional but I prefer without.
And Voila an easy Russian salad with a very pretty color!!!
