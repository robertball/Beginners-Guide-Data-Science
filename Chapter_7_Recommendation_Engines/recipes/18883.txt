Description: 
Hoagie rolls baked with slices of turkey and provolone cheese and a mushroom/onion saute mixture, then topped with olives, tomato and lettuce. This is a favorite meal with my family. I make it using the turkey and cheese from our local grocery store deli. Note: If desired, spread mustard and mayonnaise on top half of bread before completing sandwich.
