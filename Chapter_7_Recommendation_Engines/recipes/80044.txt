Ingredients:
3 cups water in a microwave-safe measuring cup
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
2 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto, minced
3/4 cup quick grits
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, preferably Reggiano
1 teaspoon butter
Black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Microwave water until very hot, 3 to 4 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add prosciutto; saute until moisture evaporates and bits start to fry and crisp, about 3 minutes. Remove prosciutto; set aside.
Add the hot water to the empty pan and bring to a boil. Whisk in grits and salt. Simmer, uncovered, over medium-low heat until thick, about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in prosciutto, cheese, butter and pepper to taste. Let stand to cool and allow flavors to blend, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve.

Description: 
To avoid midmorning hunger, I eat smart but well at breakfast. Like grits. Often cooks will enliven this hot cereal with lots of cheddar cheese and bacon as a side dish. I substitute leaner Parmesan and prosciutto to get big taste for fewer calories.
