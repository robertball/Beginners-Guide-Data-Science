Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups instant white rice, uncooked
1 (10 ounce) can 25%-less-sodium chicken broth, divided
6 RITZ Crackers, finely crushed
2 tablespoons KRAFT 100% Light Parmesan Grated Cheese
4 (4 ounce) boneless skinless chicken breasts
2 teaspoons oil
1/4 cup water
1/3 cup PHILADELPHIA Herb and Garlic Cream Cheese Spread
3/4 pound asparagus spears, trimmed, steamed

Directions:
Cook rice as directed on package, using 1 cup of the broth and 1/2 cup water.
Meanwhile, mix cracker crumbs and Parmesan cheese on plate. Rinse chicken with cold water; gently shake off excess water. Dip chicken in crumb mixture, turning over to evenly coat both sides of each chicken breast with the crumb mixture.
Heat oil in large nonstick skillet on medium heat. Add chicken; cook 5 to 6 minutes on each side or until golden brown on both sides and cooked through (170 degrees F). Place on serving plate; cover to keep warm. Add remaining 1/4 cup broth, the water and cream cheese spread to same skillet. Cook on medium heat until mixture just comes to boil, stirring constantly. Simmer 3 minutes or until sauce is thickened, stirring frequently. Spoon over chicken. Serve with the rice and asparagus.
