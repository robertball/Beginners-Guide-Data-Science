Description: 
I love lentils and split peas (no need to soak) so here is my recipe for a hearty comfort food soup. Using the pressure cooker is wonderful because after working all day, this is a quick and energy-saving way to make a meal in around 30 minutes! Serve with a nice hearty piece of warm bread.
