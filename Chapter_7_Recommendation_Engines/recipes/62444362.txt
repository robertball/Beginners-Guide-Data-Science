Ingredients:
Topping:
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/4 cup granulated white sugar
1/4 cup light brown sugar
1/3 cup shredded coconut
1/3 cup old-fashioned rolled oats
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces and frozen
Filling:
5 cups all-purpose apples, peeled, cored and sliced
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar

1 tablespoon vanilla
2 tablespoons tapioca

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and spray with cooking spray a 9 inch pie plate or 8x8 inch square pan.  (If doubling the recipe, use a 9x13 inch pan)
For Topping:  Place all the topping ingredients (excluding chopped nuts) in a food processor and process until the mixture is crumbly (looks like coarse meal) and there are no large pieces of butter visible.  Stir in the chopped nuts.
For Filling: combine all the filling ingredients together.
Place the filling in the prepared pie plate or baking dish and spread the topping evenly over the apples.
Bake for 30-40 minutes, until crisp is bubbly and golden brown.
