Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon onion juice
1 tablespoon grated onion

1 (22 ounce) jar baby dill pickles

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix cream cheese, mayonnaise, onion juice and grated onion.
Spread the mixture thinly on the white bread slices. Roll 1 baby dill pickle in each slice of bread. Place in a medium glass baking dish with the seam side down. Cover and chill in the refrigerator 8 hours, or overnight.
To serve, slice each bread roll into 1 inch slices.

Description: 
This is a very easy, delicious appetizer. A creamy mixture flavored with onion is spread on white bread and rolled with a crisp baby dill pickle. I usually at least triple the recipe for parties, because it disappears quickly.
