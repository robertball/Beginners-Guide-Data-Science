Ingredients:
1/2 cup avocado oil
2 brown onions, roughly chopped
5 pounds dried black beans, picked over and rinsed
water to cover
1 (24 ounce) jar tomato paste (such as TukasÂ®)
1 head garlic, peeled and sliced
1/4 cup dried onion
4 tablespoons mustard seeds
5 dried pasilla chile pods
5 sticks cinnamon
2 tablespoons ground cardamom
5 teaspoons cumin seeds
1 tablespoon dried Mexican oregano
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon dried epazote, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a 12-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add onions; saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beans and enough water to cover by 3 to 4 inches. Stir in tomato paste, garlic, dried onion, mustard seeds, chile pods, cinnamon sticks, cardamom, cumin seeds, oregano, brown sugar, and epazote. Bring to a boil.
Cover and reduce heat. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until beans are tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours.
Uncover and increase heat to high. Boil, stirring from the bottom to make sure the beans do not burn, mashing a bit as you stir, until the sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes. Season with salt.

Description: 
These scrumptious and fragrant vegan black beans will complement any fiesta! Muy delicioso! If you have time, soak the dried beans overnight in plenty of water. The beans will expand, so cover them with twice the amount of water to soak.
