1. Sift together 1 cup flour, 1/4 tsp sea salt, 1/4 tsp baking soda and 2 tsp baking powder.
2. Cut in 1/3 cup butter until pea sized.
3. Add 1 cup starter and stir just until dough holds together.

Description: 
These are perfectly fluffy and tasty biscuits that go together quick. Perfect for topping a pot pie or putting under sausage and gravy. When I made them with half white flour, they reminded me of Kentucky Fried Chicken's biscuits.
