Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup shortening
3/4 cup buttermilk
1 tablespoon butter or margarine, melted
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons finely snipped fresh parsley
milk
grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a medium mixing bowl stir together flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Using a pastry blender, cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in center of dry mixture, then add buttermilk all at once. Using a fork, stir just until moistened.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Quickly knead dough by folding and pressing dough gently for 10 to 12 strokes or until dough is nearly smooth. Roll dough into 13-inch circle. Brush with melted butter or margarine. Sprinkle with 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese and the parsley. Cut into 12 wedges. Roll up each wedge from the wide end to the point.
Place crescents seam side down about 2 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet, curving to form crescents. Brush with milk and sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese. Bake in a 425 degree F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden. Remove crescents from baking sheet and serve warm.
Make-Ahead Tip:  Cool baked rolls and transfer to freezer container or plastic freezer bag. Seal, label, and freeze up to 1 month. To reheat: wrap rolls in foil; bake in 350 degree F oven for 10 to 12 minutes.
