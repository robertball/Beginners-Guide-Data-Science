Walnut Burgers Recipe

Ingredients:
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
½ medium onion, finely chopped
1 cup finely chopped mushrooms (about 4 ounces)
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil (optional)
2 cups bread crumbs (I made my own by grinding up 4-5 slices of vegan whole grain bread)
1 cup cooked rice (white or brown is fine)
1 cup walnuts (finely ground to almost meal consistency in a food processor or blender)
6 tablespoons gluten flour (also known as vital wheat gluten)
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley (or dry ground)
1 clove garlic, minced
2½ tablespoons soy sauce (or to taste)
3 tablespoons water or unsweetened soymilk (Actual amount needed may vary slightly.)

Directions:
In a skillet, saute celery, onion, and mushrooms in 1 tablespoon of olive oil (or a few tablespoons of water) until they are soft.
In a large bowl, combine all remaining ingredients (and sauteed veggies when they are finished.) You may have to adjust how much liquid (water or soymilk) is needed based on whether you use store-bought bread crumbs or make your own out of fresh bread, like I did. I recommend adding extra water or soymilk 1 tablespoon at a time until your burger mixture reaches your desired consistency (not sopping wet, but soft, moist, and malleable).
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Shape burger mixture into round ¼ cup sized patties and place on an oiled or non-stick lined cookie sheet. Bake patties for approximately 30 minutes, flipping each patty over after the first 15 minutes.
Allow patties to cool for a few minutes before serving. Allow patties to cool to room temperature before freezing.
