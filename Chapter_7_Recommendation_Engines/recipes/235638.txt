Prepare the linguine according to the package directions in a 3-quart saucepan. Add the broccoli during the last 2 minutes of the cooking time. Drain the linguine mixture well in a colander.
Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until well browned and cooked through, stirring often.
