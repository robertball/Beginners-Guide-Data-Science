Ingredients:
1/2 cup corn syrup
1/2 cup peanut butter
3 cups rice crispies
1 pint vanilla ice cream

Directions:
Mix the first 2 ingredients together.  Add the cereal.  Press into a buttered 13X9 pan.  Cover & freeze until firm.  Top one half of the layer with ice cream.  Cut the other half and place over the top of the ice cream layer.  Freeze again.  Once totally frozen through, cut into bars and wrap individually in foil.
