Ingredients:
1/4 cup chicken soup base
5 cups water
6 potatoes, peeled and diced
2 carrots, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1-2 small Bay leaves
1/2 tsp. Ground Allspice (or 5 whole)
1 egg, beaten
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup milk, may not need all of it
Kitchen scissors

Directions:
Whisk the chicken soup base and water together in a large pot. Add the potatoes, carrots, and celery, and bring to a boil; cook until the vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce heat to simmer, and stir in the evaporated milk.
In a mixing bowl, mix together the egg, flour, and milk using your hands.Cut noodle dough with kitchen scissors, (about 1/4 inch thick, very small they swell) into the hot soup.They will end up like a closed shell-shaped noodle.They will float but make sure they are done in the middle. Allow the dumplings to cook in the soup until firm.
