Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
¼ cup chopped walnuts
1 teaspoon olive oil
½ pound shiitake mushrooms, sliced
1 teaspoon olive oil
½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 ¼ cups fat-free chicken broth
3 cups ( lightly packed) baby arugula, very coarsely chopped
1 (5.9 ounce) package Parmesan-flavored couscous
¼ cup chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Place a saucepan over medium heat for about 1 minute and pour olive oil into hot pan. Cook and stir walnuts in hot oil until lightly browned and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer walnuts to a bowl.
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in same pan; cook and stir shiitake mushrooms until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove mushrooms from pan. Add 1 more teaspoon olive oil to pan; cook and stir chicken and garlic until chicken is browned and meat is no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes.
Pour chicken broth into chicken mixture, add arugula, and stir contents of couscous seasoning packet into mixture; bring to a boil and simmer for 1 minute. Stir couscous into mixture, cover pan, and remove from heat. Let stand until liquid has been absorbed and couscous is tender, about 5 minutes. Add walnuts and basil, lightly fluff couscous with a fork to combine, and serve.
