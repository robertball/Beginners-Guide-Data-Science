Ingredients:
24 elderberry flower heads
4 1/2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 quarts boiling water
1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
2 ounces citric acid powder

Directions:
Combine the elderflower heads, sugar, lemon juice, and citric acid in a large acid-proof container. Pour the boiling water over the ingredients and let steep for 24 hours, stirring occasionally.
Strain the liquid by pouring it through muslin into a large bowl. Ladle into bottles and refrigerate, or pour into freezer containers and freeze.

Description: 
This is a terrific drink for hot summer days, and a fantastic rival to lemonade. You'll find food grade citric acid at a health food store or Asian market. Since this recipe makes a concentrate, dilute with water to taste or pour over ice to serve.
