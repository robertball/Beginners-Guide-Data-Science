Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste
1 red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
1 sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®), thinly sliced
1 (8 ounce) package assorted sliced mushrooms, or to taste
3 cloves garlic, smashed and chopped
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 tablespoon dried basil
2 teaspoons ground turmeric
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
3 pinches cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons water (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute bell pepper and sweet onion in hot oil until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir mushrooms and garlic into the pepper mixture; cook until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir Worcestershire sauce, parsley, ketchup, basil, turmeric, red pepper flakes, cumin, and cayenne pepper into the pepper mixture. Place cover on the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until mixture thickens, 20 to 30 minutes. If mixture is too dry, add water and stir.
