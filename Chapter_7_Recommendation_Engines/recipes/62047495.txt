Ingredients:
1 package refrigerated crescent rolls, separated into 8 triangles
1 tub (or 8 tbsp.) whipped cream cheese
8 hot dogs (your choice)
1 jar (or 8 tbsp.) pickle relish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  After you separate crescent rolls, spread each triangle with 1 tbsp. each cream cheese and relish (if you like cream cheese, you can add more).  Position hot dog at the wider end of the crescent and roll tightly.  Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve with ketchup and mustard.

Description: 
These are real kid pleasers, but my husband admits he really enjoys them, too!  If cream cheese isn't your thing, you can substitute a slice of the cheese of your choice.
