Ingredients:
6 cups thinly sliced yellow squash
1 cup shredded carrots
1 chopped onion
1 chopped red bell pepper
1 cup sliced fresh brown or white mushrooms
1 (8 ounce) container light dairy sour cream
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
2 eggs
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning blend
1 dash ground red pepper
3 cups chopped cooked chicken
4 cups crumbled cornbread
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Place the squash, carrots, onions, bell pepper, and mushrooms in a pan. Pour in enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tender and easily pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and drain well using a sieve or colander.
Mix the sour cream, chicken broth, cream of chicken soup, eggs, Italian seasoning, and red pepper together in a large bowl. Toss the sour cream mixture with the chicken, cornbread, and 2 cups Cheddar cheese until evenly blended. Stir in the vegetable mixture. Spread the mixture evenly over the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until the center sets, about 50 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup of Cheddar cheese. Bake until the cheese melts, about 10 minutes more. Serve immediately.

This casserole is pure comfort food. During the winter, it will surely warm you and your family. Plus, it's a great way to sneak in those daily veggies in a great-tasting dish!  The cornbread really gives the casserole texture, while the squash gives it color, and it smells wonderful as it's pulled out of the oven.
