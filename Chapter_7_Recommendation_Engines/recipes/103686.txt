Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons lemon and herb seasoning to taste
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon chopped parsley
black pepper to taste
1 egg
1 tablespoon butter, cut into small pieces
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil.
Mix together the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, lemon herb seasoning, garlic powder, parsley, and pepper in a large bowl. Beat egg in a small bowl.
Dip chicken breasts in egg, then in bread crumb mixture to coat. Place coated chicken on greased baking sheet and top evenly with butter pieces.
Bake in the preheated oven until crispy and cooked through, about 7 minutes per side. Drain chicken on paper towels to remove excess oil before serving.
