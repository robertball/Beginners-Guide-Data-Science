Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger root
1 cup brown rice
1 cup green lentils
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 1/2 cups water

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion has softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add ginger and stir until fragrant, 1 minute. Add brown rice and stir to coat rice with oil.
Stir lentils, cumin, salt, black pepper, and cinnamon into rice mixture; cover with water. Place lid on pot and simmer over low heat until lentils are tender and rice has absorbed the water, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
One of my 'Israeli' recipes that I've adapted for whole rice (that in my opinion needs more seasoning). Good as a whole meal or as a side dish. Freezes fairly well, too.
