Stir in chicken broth, tomato and clam juice cocktail, bloody mary mix, basil, hot sauce, garlic salt, and black pepper. Partially cover saucepan with lid and simmer until reduced, about 20 minutes.

A rich and flavorful soup that is quick and easy to prepare. Tomato and basil meld together with the smoky spice of mild tabasco sauce as well as the kick of bloody mary mix. Also a great base for vegetable-based soups or as a topping for appetizers.
