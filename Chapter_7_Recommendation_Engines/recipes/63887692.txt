Ingredients:
2 lb. Granny Smith apples
2 lb. Braeburn apples
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
3/4 c. granulated sugar
1/2 c. butter
1 c. firmly packed light brown sugar
1 (14.1 oz.) packaged refrigerated piecrusts
1 egg white
2 T. granulated sugar
Butter-pecan ice cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350ยบ. Peel apples, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges. Toss apples with cinnamon and 3/4 cup granulated sugar.
Melt butter in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat; add brown sugar, and cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes or until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat, and place 1 piecrust in skillet over brown sugar mixture. Spoon apple mixture over piecrust, and top with remaining piecrust. Whisk egg white until foamy. Brush top of piecrust with egg white; sprinkle with 2 Tbsp. granulated sugar. Cut 4 or 5 slits in top for steam to escape.
Bake at 350ยบ for 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes or until golden brown and bubbly, shielding with aluminum foil during last 10 minutes to prevent excessive browning, if necessary. Cool on a wire rack 30 minutes before serving. Serve with butter-pecan ice cream.

Description: 
This recipe is by Mrs. James Wright from Chattanooga, TN and was published in the September, 2011 edition of Southern Living.  It is absolutely the best and easiest apple pie. I make it in and serve it from my 10 inch cast iron skillet. Butter Pecan or Vanilla ice cream just put this over the top of delicious!  I use 5-6 medium sized apples. -Shearone
