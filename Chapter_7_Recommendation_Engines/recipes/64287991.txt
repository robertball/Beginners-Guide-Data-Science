Directions:
Preheat oven to 375. Grease a 8x8 baking dish. Cream the cream cheese and mayonnaise together. Stir all the peppers into the cream cheese mixture. Stir in the cheese. You have two options: stir bacon into mixture now or save bacon to sprinkle on top of dish. Spoon and spread into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle enough cornflake or Panko crumbs evenly over the top to cover. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until top is lightly browned and edges are bubbly. If you did not mix bacon into mixture, sprinkle bacon on top now. Serve with corn Tortilla chips for dipping.
