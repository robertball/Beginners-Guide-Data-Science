Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 large onion, chopped
2 carrots, chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 pound zucchini, sliced
3 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1 1/2 ounces grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion, carrots, and parsley until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add zucchini and saute until zucchini is tender, about 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Butter a baking dish. Heat a kettle or pot of water to boiling.
Beat eggs, cream, and Parmesan cheese together in a bowl; stir in zucchini mixture. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish.
Place a clean kitchen towel in the bottom of a roasting pan. Arrange the baking dish on top of the towel and pour boiling water halfway up the sides of the baking dish, creating a water bath.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and set, about 45 minutes.
