Description: 
I go this recipe from a long-time friend several years ago and it's my most-used. I love to serve this melt-in-your mouth corn bread hot from the oven with butter and syrup. It gets rave reviews on holidays and at potluck dinners.                                                              --Nicole Callen                                                               Auburn, CaliforniaModified from: Buttery Corn Bread
