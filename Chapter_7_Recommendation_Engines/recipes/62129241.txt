Ingredients:
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups flour
1 large egg yolk
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup dried cranberries (such as Craisins), finely chopped
3 cups whole pecans, lightly toasted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease cookie sheets.
Cream together the butter, vanilla, and egg yolk in a large bowl.
Sift in powdered sugar, flour, and baking soda. Mix well.
Stir in the chopped cranberries.
In a food processor (or with a knife), chop 2 cups of pecans VERY finely. Add to dough.
Chop the remaining pecans into slightly larger pieces and stir into the dough.
Use hands to form dough into one-inch balls. (Refrigerate dough if needed)
As each dough ball is placed on the cookie sheet, flatten slightly with your palm until it is about 1/4 inch thick.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden.
