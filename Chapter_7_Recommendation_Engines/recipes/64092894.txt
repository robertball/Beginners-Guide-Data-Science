Ingredients:
2-1/2 cups warm water
5 tsp yeast
1 Tbsp sugar
1 Tbsp salt
6 cups bread flour
1 egg white, beaten with fork

Directions:
In large mixing bowl measure the warm water, yeast, sugar, salt and 2 cups flour.  At low speed with electric mixer, beat until mixed.  Increase speed to medium and beat 2 minutes.
Gradually add 2 cups flour and continue beating for another 2 minutes.  With spoon, stir in enough additional flour (about 2 cups) to make a soft dough.  Knead dough.
Shape into ball, place in greased bowl, cover and let rise until double.  Punch down and cut into 4 equal pieces.  Cover with cloth for 15 minutes.  Roll into loaves and place on greased cookie sheets.  With sharp knife, cut 4 diagonal slashes 1/4" deep on top of each loaf.  Brush loaves with beaten egg white.  Let rise until double.
Bake at 400 degrees F. for 15 minutes.  Brush again with egg white and continue baking 15 minutes longer.  Makes 4 loaves.
