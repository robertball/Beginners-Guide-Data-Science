Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups fresh or frozen unsweetened blueberries (or cherries or strawberries)
2 cups water
1 tablespoon sugar

Directions:
Bring berries, water and sugar to a boil in a medium pot.  Turn heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.  Occasionally mash the berries with the back of a spoon to release their juices.  Pour into a fine mesh strainer over a bowl, pressing with the back of a spoon until all the liquid is released.
Store in refrigerator for 3 days or freeze in 1/4 cup portions.
This recipe also yields about 3/4 cup blueberry pulp that can be added to Purple Puree or smoothies.
