Ingredients:
2 large old bananas, mashed
1 cup of  oats (quick or regular! if you use regular, weâ€™d suggest chopping them a little so everything holds together better)
optional:
-a handful of chocolate chips (1/4 cup?)
- 1/4 cup crushed walnut pieces
- 1 tsp. cinnamon
- 1/4 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix the banana and oats together.
Then add in what sounds yummy to you! (or nothing!)
Since all bananas are different sizes, the needed measurements can vary. If it seems too runny and the cookies would flatten out too much, add in more oatmeal.
Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes on a GREASED cookie sheet or use parchment paper.
