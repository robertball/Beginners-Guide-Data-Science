Ingredients:
10-12 potatoes your choice (I prefer red)
1 large onion diced
1/2-3/4 cup broth (chicken or vegetable)
1/4 cup white vinegar
1/4 cup oil
1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
salt & pepper to taste
optional: 6 cooked bacon slices, chopped

Directions:
Peel & chop potatoes.  Do not chop evenly, various sizes will create a more interesting texture.
Boil or steam potatoes until tender, drain.
Combine broth, vinegar, and oil in a pan large enough to accommodate potatoes as well.  The variance on measurement of broth is to account for the size of potato you choose(If smaller like a red use the smaller amount, if large, use larger amount.
Bring to a boil and add diced onion.  Depending on personal preference, onion can be cooked until slightly firm or until tender (2-6 mins).
Remove from heat and add potatoes and dill(if using bacon it would also be added at this point).  Stir gently until incorporated.  Salt & pepper to taste.
Can be served warm, room temp or chilled.
*note: for vegetarians use vegetable broth and omit bacon.
