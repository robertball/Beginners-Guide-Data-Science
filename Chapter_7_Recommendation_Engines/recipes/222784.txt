Ingredients:
1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
1 pound ground beef
1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce

1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
1 onion, diced
1 tomato, diced
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped
1 lime, juiced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 onion rolls, split

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place half the chopped cilantro into a large bowl and mix with ground beef, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, mushrooms, and Worcestershire sauce. Set remaining cilantro aside. Form the beef mixture into 4 patties.
Lightly toss remaining cilantro in a bowl with avocado, onion, tomato, jalapeno peppers, lime juice, salt, and black pepper.
Grill burgers on the preheated grill until browned and no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes per side. Serve the burgers on onion rolls topped with avocado salsa.
