Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dry lentils
6 cups water, or as needed
1 bay leaf
1 onion, chopped
1/2 (16 ounce) package bacon, chopped, or more to taste
garlic powder

Directions:
Rinse lentils well under cold running water. Drain and transfer to a slow cooker. Pour in water until water level is twice as high as lentils. Add bay leaf and set slow cooker to High.
Meanwhile, heat onion and bacon in a skillet over medium heat. Cook until bacon is crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with garlic powder and transfer bacon-onion mixture to the slow cooker.
Cook on High until lentils are tender, about 5 hours.
