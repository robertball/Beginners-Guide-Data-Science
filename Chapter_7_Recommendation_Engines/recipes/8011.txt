Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
2/3 cup white sugar
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar, sifted
3 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, melted
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Sift together flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in a small mixing bowl.
In a separate bowl, cream 3/4 cup butter and white and brown sugars at medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Add 2 teaspoons vanilla. At low speed, begin by adding a little of the flour mixture to the butter mixture. Alternate with buttermilk until all are blended together. Start and end with flour.
Line bottoms of 2 9-inch pans with waxed paper; grease and flour. Pour batter in.
Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 25-30 minutes. Test with toothpick. Cool in pans for 10 minutes before turning onto racks to cool completely.
To Make Frosting: Cream together 3/4 cup butter and confectioners' sugar. Slowly add melted chocolate and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Beat until light and fluffy. Frost cooled cake.
