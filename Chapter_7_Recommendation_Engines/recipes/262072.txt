Ingredients:
1 pound top round steak, trimmed
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried dill
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/3 cup all-purpose flour (spooned and leveled)
1 cup fat-free reduced-sodium beef broth
1 (8 ounce) container reduced-fat sour cream
2 cups hot cooked egg noodles

Directions:
Cut steak diagonally across the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices. Place steak, mushrooms, onion, mustard, parsley, garlic, salt, dill, and black pepper into a 3-quart slow cooker; stir well.
Place flour in a small bowl; gradually add broth, stirring with a whisk until blended. Add to slow cooker; stir well. Cover with the lid; cook on High for 1 hour. Reduce heat to Low and cook until steak is tender, 7 to 8 hours.
Turn slow cooker off and remove lid. Allow stroganoff to stand for 10 minutes. Stir in sour cream. Serve over noodles.
