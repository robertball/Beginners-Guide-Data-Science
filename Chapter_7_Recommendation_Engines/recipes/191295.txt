Ingredients:
Crust:
Nonstick cooking spray
1 (7 ounce) box kosher for Passover chocolate cookies, can be sugar free
2 tablespoons sugar
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
Filling:
2 teaspoons instant espresso powder or instant coffee
1 (6 ounce) container Dannon® All Natural coffee yogurt, divided
3 (8 ounce) packages reduced-fat (not fat-free) cream cheese, at room temperature
1 1/2 cups Dannon® All Natural vanilla lowfat yogurt
1 cup sugar
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon potato starch
Ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Spray a 10-inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray. Place it on cookie sheet and set aside.
Place chocolate cookies into food processor and pulse until it forms crumbs. Place 1  cups of crumbs into medium bowl. Mix 2 tablespoons sugar and melted butter.  Stir to combine.  Use spatula to spread evenly into bottom of springform pan.
In small bowl, mix espresso powder and 3 tablespoons coffee yogurt.  Stir until powder is dissolved. In mixer, beat cream cheese and vanilla yogurt on low speed until creamy.  Gradually add remaining sugar. Gradually add eggs one at a time, vanilla, potato starch and espresso mixture. Beat until smooth. Pour into pan.
Bake for 60-70 minutes - center will appear nearly set when gently shaken. It may seem loose, but cheesecake will firm as it chills. Remove from oven and cool for 15 minutes.
Spread remaining coffee yogurt in a circle over center of cheesecake. Chill in refrigerator at least 4 hours or overnight.
Sprinkle top with cinnamon. Release the sides of the pan.
