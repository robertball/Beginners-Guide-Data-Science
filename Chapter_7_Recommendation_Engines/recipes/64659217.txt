Ingredients:
Slow Cooker Ingredients:
2/3 of a large pineapple, peeled/cored/chopped into small chunks (save the rest for later)
1 small white onion, quartered
3 garlic cloves, halved
1/2 cup orange juice
2 tbsp white vinegar
1-2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (about 1 1/2 tsp of adobo... most supermarkets sell these together in a can)
2-4 guajillo chilis, seeded/stems removed
1-2 chilis de arbol
1 tablespoon fresh oregano, minced
1/2 teaspoon ancho chili powder
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon cumin, dried
1/4 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground
2 tablespoons achiote powder or paste
~3 pound pork loin (or shoulder), cubed
Taco ingredients:
20 corn tortillas (for 10 tacos, plus more as needed)
1/2 cup pineapple, diced (use some of the leftover pineapple)
2/3 white onion, diced
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, roughly chopped/stems removed
Crema or Sour Creme (optional, for garnishing)
lime wedges (for garnishing)
1-2 tbsp canola oil

Directions:
Place the 3/4 pineapple, 1 small white onion, garlic cloves, chipotle peppers + adobo, guajillo chilis, chilis de arbol, and oregano into a food processor and blend until smooth. Transfer to a mixing bowl and add orange juice, white vinegar, ancho chili powder, cumin, salt, lime zest, and black pepper. mix well.
Place cubed pork loin in a crockpot and cover pork with pureed mixture. Cover crockpot and cook on low for about 7-9 hours.
Once pork has cooked through, use two forks to shred the pork and mix to coat with the sauce.
35-40 minutes before the slow cooker is finished, begin heating the tortillas. Heat a pan on high with the 1 or 2tbsp of canola oil. Add each tortilla, flipping after 30 sec â€“ 1 min (until each side has spots on it) and then place on a plate.
To make tacos: use a slotted spoon to scoop out the meat and place atop the taco (two tortillas per Taco) . Top with 1/3 cup diced pineapple, 1/2 diced onion, cilantro, a small amount of Creme (if desired), and squeeze a bit of fresh lime juice on top and serve.

Description: 
My buddy says it ain't al pastor unless I use a spit.  Well, I don't own a spit so there's that.  Also, I have dandruff and I buy my clothes from the grocery store.  Still, I think this is decent.
