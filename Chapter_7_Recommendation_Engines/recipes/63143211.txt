Description: 
This simple pot roast makes its own gravy in the slow cooker.  As a single parent to girls I am always trying to get the food groups into my abbreviated meals.  I threw in potatoes, carrots, yellow squash and zucchini to add to the original base recipe.  They love stew....so this leads them that direction but is still a roast.  It was a hit. I hope you enjoy it!Modified from: Awesome Slow Cooker Pot Roast
