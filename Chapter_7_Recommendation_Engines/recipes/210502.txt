Ingredients:
1 teaspoon cooking oil
1 1/2 cups fresh mint leaves
2 teaspoons cooking oil
6 dried red chile peppers
1 tablespoon skinned split black lentils (urad dal)
1 tablespoon coriander seed
1 teaspoon chana dal beans
1 teaspoon mustard seed
1 teaspoon tamarind paste
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the mint leaves and fry until slightly wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a skillet (or a kadhai, if you have one). Add the red chile peppers, black lentils, coriander seed, chana dal, and mustard seed; cook in the hot oil until the lentils brown and the seeds start to splatter; remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Grind the mixture into a coarse powder using a mortar and pestle; add the mint leaves, tamarind paste, and salt; continue crushing until the mint is completely integrated.
