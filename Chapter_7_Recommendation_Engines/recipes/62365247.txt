Drain and rinse. Cut chicken into cubes and mash potatoes. Leave the skins on for more nutrients. Add all ingredients in pan and heat until peas are hot. And once it is cooled your dog can enjoy.

Description: 
My dog has a lot of allergies. He is a Boxer and his name is Carter. I went to our friends pet store, where he sells organic dog food. He told me of the dangers in commercial dog foods and why my dog was itchy. The vet could not give me an answer. My friend was right and we have not much itchy problems since. Except for when people feed him things he should not have. My friend said it is better and safer for your dog to eat natural food. So I whipped up some of the things at home that are in the organic dog food from his store. Remember if you can recognize the ingredients  it is okay for Fido
