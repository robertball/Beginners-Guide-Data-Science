Ingredients:
For the pandan layer:
6 pandan leaves, chopped
190ml (3/4 cup) water
1 tablespoon agar agar powder
625ml (2 1/2 cups) water
200g white sugar
For the coconut-pandan layer:
1 tablespoon agar agar powder
250ml (1 cup) water
2 tablespoons sugar
500ml (2 cups) coconut cream
5 pandan leaves, cut into 4 cm lengths
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
1. To make the pandan layer, first make pandan juice by blending the pandan leaves with the 190ml water. Strain through a cheesecloth and discard the leaves. You should be left with about 125ml pandan juice.
2. Place the agar agar powder and water in a small wok or pot and heat until agar agar is completely dissolved. Add the sugar and cook until dissolved, do not boil. Add the pandan juice and stir well.
3. Remove from the heat and place in a small bowl that is sitting in a bowl of warm water. You do not want to let the mixture cool completely.
4. Next, make the coconut-pandan layer. Place the agar agar powder in a small wok or pot and cook until the agar agar has completely dissolved. Add the sugar, coconut cream, pandan leaves and salt and cook until the sugar and salt have dissolved - do not boil.
5. Strain out the pandan leaves and place the mixture in a small bowl sitting in a bowl of warm water. You do not want to let the mixture cool off.
6. While the two batches of layers are still warm, prepare 8 x 250 ml jelly cups.
7. Place 2 tablespoons of the coconut-pandan layer in the jelly cups. Let the layer almost set, then place 2 tablespoons of the pandan layer in the cups. Repeat this process until all cups are full or you run out of agar agar mixture.
8. Let the jellies set completely. To serve, remove the jellies from the cups and enjoy.
