Ingredients:
1 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoons baking powder
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 eggs
2 cups of all purpose flour
1 1/2 cups warm milk
1/3 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 tsp cinnamon
For the churro topping-
1 cup of white sugar
1/2 cup cinnamon
1/2 cup of melted butter

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together flour, salt, baking powder and sugar; set aside.  Also at this time you can combine your churro topping and set it aside. Preheat waffle iron
In a separate bowl, beat the eggs. Stir in the milk, butter and vanilla. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture;  Next fold in three shakes of cinnamon beat until blended
At this time you can also melt your 1/2 cup of butter used to pour over waffles. Next generously spray your waffle iron with no stick cooking spray. Than ladle the batter into a preheated waffle iron. Cook the waffles until golden and crisp. Once fully cooked immediately pour melted butter on each side of the waffle and than dip each buttered side into your cinnamon/sugar churro mixture.
Devour immediately!...... I mean serve immediately, Enjoy!
Oh and I drizzled my waffles with a little extra syrup at the end. Although this waffle is obviously sweet enough, those with a definite sweet tooth can give it a whirl! In the end though I thought they were perfecto without the dulce ( sweet) extras.

Found this recipe on Pinterest. It looks like a winner! I would love to try dipping strips of these waffles in warm cinnamon spiced chocolate sauce.
