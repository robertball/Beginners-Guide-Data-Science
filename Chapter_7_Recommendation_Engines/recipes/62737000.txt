Description: 
Delicious, and very easy to make. Once the spaghetti is boiled, the recipe is fast to make from there. If you prefer a less richer sauce, omit the olive oil. You can use different flavors of spaghetti sauce too, this one just gives it a little more flavor. I hope your family enjoys this as much as mine, it always gets eaten up!! Great recipe for families.
