Ingredients:
2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1 inch cubes
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 clove garlic, minced
2T vegetable oil
1 (4oz) can tomato paste
2 small boiler onions, chopped
3 cups beef broth (from concentrate)
2 potatoes, diced
2 carrots, sliced

Directions:
In a medium bowl toss together flour, salt and pepper.  Lightly dust the pieces of meat in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess flour.
In a heavy bottom pan (not non-stick) heat oil over medium high heat. Add flour coated stew meat and brown on all sides.  Add to slow cooker. De glaze the pan with 1 cup of the beef broth.  Add cut carrots, garlic, and onions to pan and allow vegetables to begin to caramelize.  Add the can of tomato paste to the vegetables and continue to cook for a few minutes more. Stir in the remaining beef broth and add to stew meat in the slow cooker.
Cover, and cook on Low setting for 10 to 12 hours, or on High setting for 4 to 6 hours.

Description: 
This hearty beef stew is a cinch to make by letting the slow cooker do all the work.  I keep my eye out for my local grocer to have pot roast on sale and cut up the stew meat myself. I do a few minutes extra prep to add an extra richness to this stew. If I happen to have a can of mushrooms in the cupboard I like to throw those in as well.Modified from: Slow Cooker Beef Stew I
