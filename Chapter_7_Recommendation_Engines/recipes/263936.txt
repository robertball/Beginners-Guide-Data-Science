Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork
1 cup ketchup
1 cup bottled Bloody Mary mix
1 (4 ounce) packet saltine crackers, crushed, or more to taste
1 small onion, chopped
1 (3 ounce) jar sliced green olives, drained, or to taste
1 egg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix beef, pork, ketchup, Bloody Mary mix, onion, crushed crackers, olives, and egg together in a large bowl. Form into a loaf in an 11x7-inch baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
When I was first married, I got my meatloaf recipe from the oldest woman in the grocery store, and it was so good. However, my husband wanted more flavor, and this recipe evolved from what we had in the fridge. It will melt in your mouth. I don't generally measure anything when I make meatloaf, so the measurements are a best guess.
