Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
6 tablespoons icing sugar
2 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons boiling water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Cream butter, add sugar and beat.
Add milk, beat until milk is fully mixed into the butter mixture (you will think this isn't working, keep beating)
Add boiling water 1 tablespoon at a time. Keep beating and beating. This can take up to 20 minutes or more depending on your mixer. (you will think that the recipe is ruined, keep beating)
Handy tip:  If your mixer has a spash guard, use it for this recipe so that you can put the mixer on a higher setting without making a sticky mess everywhere.

Description: 
This is a very creamy, melt in your mouth icing that is more buttery than sweet.  You will think that it is not turning out.  Keep beating, beating and beating.  Don't know how they did it by hand in the olden days.  It is definately worth the time and effort and good for a special cake.
