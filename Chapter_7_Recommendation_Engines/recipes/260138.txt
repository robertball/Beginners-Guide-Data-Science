Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) container extra-firm tofu, drained
1 teaspoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
¾ cup sliced mushrooms
3  scallions, thinly sliced
1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and sliced into 1/4-inch slices
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon kosher salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
½ cup grape tomatoes
3 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste
1 ounce crumbled queso fresco

Directions:
Place tofu onto a plate and place another plate on top. Set a 3- to 5-pound weight on top (a container filled with water works well). Press tofu for 20 to 30 minutes; drain and discard the accumulated liquid. Crumble tofu into 1/4-inch pieces.
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms, scallions, and jalapeno; cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in crumbled tofu and red pepper flakes. Cover and cook until flavors blend, about 4 minutes.
Season the tofu mixture with salt and pepper. Stir in tomatoes and 3 tablespoons cilantro; cook and stir until tomatoes are just heated through, about 2 minutes. Spoon tofu scramble onto 2 plates; sprinkle queso fresco on top. Garnish with the remaining cilantro.
