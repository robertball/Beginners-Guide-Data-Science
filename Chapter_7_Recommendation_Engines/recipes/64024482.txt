Ingredients:
-Live crawfish (approx 5 lbs per person; keep crawfish in an ice chest in the sack they came in; keep ice on top of crawfish and leave plug out of cooler; water must drain or they will drown.
-Powder crawfish/crab boil seasoning (whatever brand you like; I prefer Swamp Fire; bag will tell you what amount is necessary based on crawfish quantity)
-Liquid crawfish/crab boil seasoning (16 FL oz)
-Jar of minced garlic (32 FL oz)
-2 sticks of butter
-Little smokies cocktail sausages
-Red potatoes (2-3 per person)
-10 lemons
-1 yellow onion
-Corn on the cob cut in half (3-4 per person)
-Small bag of ice
-Squirt bottle of mustard

Directions:
-Fill pot a little more than 2/3 full of  water. (100quart pot with basket)
-Pour powder boil and liquid boil into pot. Use recommended amount on packaging for both based on amount of crawfish being boiled.
-Cut lemons in halves and squeeze juice into pot. I throw the peels in trash after squeezing
-Stir up, put lid on pot, and bring to a boil.
-Once water is at a boil throw in potatoes, corn, onion cut in half, little smokies, sticks of butter, and jar of garlic into basket/pot.
-Start timer
-Dump crawfish out of the sack into the cooler you were keeping them cool in. Add enough water so the crawfish start swimming around. Drain water. Repeat until the water is clean. This is to purge them and get them cleaned up.
-After 7 minutes take lil smokies and corn out of boil. Continue boiling potatoes for another 8 minutes.
-Dump live crawfish in the basket that the potatoes are still in.
-Submerge in pot and start timer
-Cook for 7 minutes(don't wait for the water to start back up to a boil once you put the bugs in. You'll over cook them.  As soon as you place them in the water give them 7 minutes)
-Kill flame
-Throw small bag of ice in the pot with crawfish and stir (this slight temperature change makes the crawfish absorb the liquid and much more juicy)
-Let the bugs "soak" in the pot for 30 minutes (no flame on)
-Dump bugs and potatoes out of the basket into the cooler with sausages and corn.
-Squirt some mustard over everything in the cooler and then lightly dust with some of the powder boil seasoning. Shake up cooler to spread seasoning.
-Let sit 30 min. with lid closed on cooler (this is steaming them)
-Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Description: 
I put this process together after several years of doing many boils and figuring out what worked what didn't work. You kind of have to play with the seasoning based on how spicy you want them.
