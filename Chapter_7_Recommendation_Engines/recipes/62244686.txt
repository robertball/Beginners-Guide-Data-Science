24 Oreos
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup whipping cream
8 oz. cream cheese
3 Tbsp. sugar
3 Tbsp. fresh key lime juice
1 tsp. or more freshly grated lime zest

In a mixer, beat the cream until peaks form.
Place the cream cheese, sugar, lime juice and zest in the food processor and blend until smoth.  Add the melted white chocolate and blend.  Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture.  Spread over crust and chill at least 2 hours.
