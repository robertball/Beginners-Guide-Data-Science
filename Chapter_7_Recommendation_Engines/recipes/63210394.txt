Ingredients:
9 ounces bittersweet chocolate  unsweetened
1/4 cup butter
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste

Directions:
In a saucepan or a double boiler, over low heat, melt the chocolate with the butter.
Stir very often to prevent sticking or burning.
Add the sugar, stir, and stir, over low heat for 3 minutes.
Add the cream, a little at a time, stirring until it is well-combined, and you have added all of it.
Over low heat continue stirring until thickened, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the vanilla.
Remove from the heat.
Serve.
Eat.

Description: 
You can get as creative as you want when making this recipe.  Sometimes I add a little orange peel or lemon.  Maybe a sprinkle of smoked cherry wood salt.  Or a shot of bourbon.  Or just as Grandma use to make it … pure.
