2 Cups of shredded Colby Jack Cheese or Veggie Cheese
Minced Onions to taste

Directions:
1. Combine pecan meal, crushed cereal, eggs and cheese. Add seasoning and minced onion to taste and mix until well combines. If mixture is not staying together well add another egg.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray rectangle pan with cooking spray. Shape mixture into balls and place balls side by side in pan. Place meatballs in oven for 45 minutes.
3. While meatballs are baking combine all of the ingrediants for the sauce together. When the meatballs are done take them out and poor the sauce over them. Place the meatballs back in the oven until the sauce is bubbling, approximately 5-10 minutes more.

Description: 
These Meatballs use Pecan Meal as a meat replacement. They are so good, you don't even miss the meat! This recipe does have eggs and cheese in it, so it is not quite vegan. But those items can be substituted to make it so. The ingrediants may sound funny, but the result is amazing! The sauce is very zesty so if you don't want it to be too strong cut down on the vinegar some.
