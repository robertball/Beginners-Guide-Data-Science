Ingredients:
2 cups packed brown sugar
1 (8 pound) cured, bone-in picnic ham
1 8 oz can crushed pineapple
2 Tbsp ground cloves

Directions:
Spread about 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar on the bottom of the slow cooker crock. Place the ham flat side down into the slow cooker - you might have to trim it a little to make it fit. Use your hands to rub the remaining brown sugar onto the ham. Pour crushed pineapple over ham. Sprinkle ground cloves on top of ham. Cover, and cook on Low for 8 hours.
