Ingredients:
1 package Nutter Butter Cookies  (these are non dairy)
4 ounces cream cheese (I use soy)
1/2 cup peanut butter
1 14 oz packge of chocolate candy melts  (I use store brand chocolate chips in the 12 oz bag, as they have no milk/dairy)

Directions:
Place cookies in food processor and pulse until fine crumbs.
Add cream cheese and peanut butter.  Pulse until mixture comes together and a ball of "dough" forms.
Remove "dough" and shape into approximately 36, 1 inch,  balls.
Place on cookie sheet and refrigerate 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat chocolate candy melts until smooth and creamy.
Dip chilled balls in melted chocolate and place on parchment lined cookie sheet. (if adding sprinkles or toppings, do so before chocolate completely sets)
Refrigerate balls to set the chocolate.
Store in airtight container in the refrigerator.
