Ingredients:
1 cup water
3 cups dried figs
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon milk
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Soak figs in the water for 1 hour. In a small saucepan, combine the fig mixture with the sugar, and cook over medium heat until thick and stewy. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Beat in the milk and vanilla until smooth. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt, stir into the creamed mixture. Cover and refrigerate for one hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.
Divide the dough into two pieces and knead each piece about 5 or 6 times. On a well floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Line the prepared pan with one piece of the dough. Spread the fig mixture over it, then cover with the other piece of dough.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Cool and cut into squares.
