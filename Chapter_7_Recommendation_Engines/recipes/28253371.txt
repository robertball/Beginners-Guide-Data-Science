Ingredients:
4 or 5 frozen boneless chicken breast
1 extra large can of chicken broth
1 stick of butter
1 tsp. salt
1 to 2 tsp. pepper
2 1/2 cups of uncooked long grain rice (not instant)

Directions:
Defrost the chicken breast in the microwave. Usually you need to defrost them for approximately six minutes on each side.
Pour chicken broth in a 4 qt. cook pot that has a lid.
Add butter, salt, and pepper.
Add defrosted chicken breast and cook on high until chicken is white and tender.
Add the cups of rice and stir.
Place the lid on the pot.
Keep the heat on high until the ingredients begin to boil. (You'll be able to tell by watching the lid.)
Reduce the heat the medium for 10 minutes.
Then reduce the heat to low for 10 minutes.
Turn off the burner but do not open the lid.
The chicken 'n rice should be ready to eat in 30 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
You can make your own stock by boiling the chicken in water, but the broth and butter seem to add more flavor.
