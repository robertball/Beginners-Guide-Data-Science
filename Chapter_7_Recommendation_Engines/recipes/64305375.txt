Ingredients:
½ cup popcorn kernels
¼ cup sugar
¼ cup vegetable oil
Salt to taste

Directions:
Get out a large pot with a lid. I have one with a long handle and a glass lid that works really well. Add the vegetable oil and heat it over medium heat.
Add your kernels and and the sugar. If you're not sure if the oil is hot enough, toss in a couple of kernels and see if they pop.
Add the lid and holding the lid with one hand, move the pan around, tossing the kernels in the vegetable, sugar mixture. Alternate having it on the heat and moving the kernels around by gently shaking the pot right above the burner until most of them have popped.
Pour your movie snack into a large bowl and add some salt to taste.
