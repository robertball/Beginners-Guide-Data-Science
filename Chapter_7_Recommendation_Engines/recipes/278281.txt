Ingredients:
1 Red Delicious apple - peeled, cored, and grated
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 tablespoons milk
1 egg
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon avocado oil, or as needed
1/2 teaspoon powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 175 degrees F (80 degrees C).
Mix together grated apple and cinnamon in a small bowl. Whisk milk and egg together in a second bowl.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; mix to combine. Stir in milk mixture until a dough forms. Fold in grated apples.
Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit the bottom of the air fryer basket. Brush paper with avocado oil until well coated; place into the air fryer basket.
Scoop out 1/4 of the dough and place in one corner of the air fryer basket; repeat with another 1/4 of the mixture to make 2 cookies.
Air fry cookies until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes, brushing with more oil after about 4 minutes. Carefully transfer cookies to a plate and lightly dust with confectioners' sugar. Repeat with remaining cookie dough.

Description: 
Every now and then I crave something slightly sweet but I don't want to make a whole sheet of cookies because I would eat them all. This recipe is perfect for those days--it makes only 4 cookies!
