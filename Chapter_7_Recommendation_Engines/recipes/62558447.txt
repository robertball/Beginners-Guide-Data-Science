Ingredients:
6 Roma tomatoes quartered and seeded
1 C. Cilantro leaves (fresh from the produce dept.)I recommend not using many stems...
1 Red Onion peeled and quartered (medium sized)
6 Garlic Cloves quartered
1 Jalapeno Pepper seeded and quartered (remove stem)
1 Habanero Pepper seeded and quartered (remove stem)
1 fresh Lime halved
1 t. Margarita or Coarse Kosher Salt
a dash of ground Cumin

Directions:
In a food processor, add tomatoes, Cilantro, Onion, Garlic, Hot Peppers (the more peppers you use the hotter the salsa will be... like it mild? use prepared jalapeno's to taste). Squeeze the juice of 1 Lime over top of ingredients, sprinkle on the salt and dash-dash the cumin. Process on low to start the "chopping" then switch to "pulse" until you achieve desired consistancy. Serve with White, Yellow or Blue tortilla chips.
