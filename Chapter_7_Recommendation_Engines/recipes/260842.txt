Ingredients:
1/2 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 onion, diced
1/4 pound smoked ham, diced
1/4 pound calabresa (Portuguese smoked sausage), cut into 1/4-inch slices
4 cloves garlic, minced, divided
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 bay leaf
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
4 leaves collard greens, cut into fine ribbons, or to taste
1 1/2 cups cassava flour
1 1/2 teaspoons butter, or to taste
4 cups cooked white rice
4 oranges, cut in wedges, or as desired
1/4 cup coarsely chopped cilantro

Directions:
Combine beans, onion, ham, calabresa, 3 cloves garlic, salt, cumin, black pepper, and bay leaf in a pressure cooker; cover with water to fill line.
Close cooker securely and place pressure regulator over vent according to manufacturer's instructions. Cook at high pressure until regulator is gently rocking, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce pressure to low. Cook, adding water halfway if needed, until beans are tender and water is reduced to your liking, about 1 hour.
Turn off heat. Let pressure release naturally according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock lid and remove. Let feijoada cool until ready to serve.
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute remaining 1 clove garlic and collard greens until just tender, about 2 minutes.
Place cassava flour in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until toasted, about 3 minutes. Stir in butter.
Serve feijoada with the collards-garlic mixture, toasted cassava flour, rice, orange wedges, and cilantro.
