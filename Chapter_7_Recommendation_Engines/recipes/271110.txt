Ingredients:
1/2 cup salted butter
1 1/4 cups cassava flour
1/4 cup almond flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch sea salt
2 tablespoons coconut sugar
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1/3 cup coconut sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 eggs

Directions:
Heat butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and stir until melted. Continue stirring gently until butter begins to darken in color and releases a slightly nutty smell, 2 to 3 minutes. Immediately remove from heat.
Pour butter into a heat-proof mixing bowl and place into the freezer to cool slightly, about 10 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Sift together cassava flour, almond flour, baking powder, and sea salt. Mix 2 tablespoons coconut sugar and cinnamon together in a separate bowl and set cinnamon sugar aside.
Remove butter from freezer. Add 1/3 cup sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract and beat until well combined using an electric mixer. Gradually add flour mixture and continue beating until just combined.
Scoop up little balls of dough with a medium cookie scoop and roll in cinnamon sugar. Place on the prepared baking sheet leaving ample room in between.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 11 minutes. Allow to cool completely on the baking sheet before moving to a serving plate.

Description: 
These grain-free cassava flour cookies are made with coconut sugar, so they're much healthier than the traditional version, slightly less sweet, and full of cinnamon-y goodness. Because cassava flour is more starchy, expect a bit drier cookie and be sure to let them cool completely on the cookie sheet.
