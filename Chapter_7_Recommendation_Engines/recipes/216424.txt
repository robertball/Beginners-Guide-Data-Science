Ingredients:
3 pounds beef sirloin, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon ground ancho chile powder
2 teaspoons ground chipotle chile pepper
2 tablespoons salt-free seasoning blend
1 1/2 teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
3/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
black pepper to taste
2 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Place the beef cubes into a large mixing bowl. Season with brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, ancho powder, chipotle powder, salt-free seasoning, liquid smoke, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.
Cook the beef in batches in the hot oil until browned on all sides and cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 3 minutes for medium. Drain the beef cubes briefly on a paper towel-lined plate before serving. Allow the oil to become hot again before cooking the next batch of beef.
