Ingredients:
2 acorn squash
olive oil
1 tbsp minced garlic
1 jalapeno pepper, diced
1/4 c sliced leeks
1/4 c diced celery
1/2 c diced red bell pepper
1/2 c sliced daikon radish or turnips
2 c vegetable stock or broth
1 c brown rice
1 c washed greens (collard, turnip or mustard)
1 tbsp curry
1/2 tbsp red curry paste
1/4 c chopped walnuts
1/2 c crumbled feta

Directions:
Cut each squash in half.  Remove seeds and pulp.  Wrap each half in plastic wrap.  Place cut side down in microwave and cook 12-15 minutes or until soft.  Leave wrapped and set aside.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in large skillet.  Saute garlic, jalapeno, leeks, celery, red pepper and daikon or turnips until soft.  Add vegetable stock and brown rice, stirring to combine.  Cover and simmer about 10 minutes until broth is mostly absorbed and rice is cooked.
Add greens to top of rice mixture.  Cover and simmer about 5 more minutes until wilted.  Stir to combine.
Gently stir in curry and curry paste.  Add walnuts.
Unwrap squash and set one squash half face up in shallow soup bowl.  Spoon about 2 tbsp feta into each squash half.  Add a large scoop of rice mixture on top of feta.  Add additional feta on top of rice if desired and serve.
