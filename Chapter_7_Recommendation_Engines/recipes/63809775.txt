Description: 
You need to give my Saute Cod over an Italian Sauce a try! I was not sure what to call the sauce but it is amazing. To make this sauce I started taking out ingredients from the refrigerator and pantry! This recipe follow the Paleo diet and is a delicious Italian dinner for any weeknight or entertaining.
I used cod loin because it is thicker and I wanted a nice piece over the sauce on each individual plate.
