Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 cups lightly packed sliced chanterelle mushrooms
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 pound boneless pork ribs, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups water
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir chanterelle mushrooms and garlic in the hot butter until mushrooms have softened, 8 to 10 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir pork in the hot oil until browned and meat is no longer pink inside, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate, leaving pan drippings in saucepan. Pour mushroom mixture with butter into pan drippings.
Stir flour into mushroom mixture until thoroughly combined; mix in water and bring gravy to a boil, stirring often. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Serve pork cubes with chanterelle gravy.
