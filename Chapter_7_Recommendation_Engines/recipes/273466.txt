Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups water
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup cracked freekeh
1 cup natural peanut butter
1/2 cup cocoa nibs
1/2 cup chopped goji berries
3 tablespoons coconut oil
2 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Combine water and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add freekeh, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand for about 5 minutes. Allow to cool completely, about 1 hour.
Combine 2 cups cooked freekeh, peanut butter, cocoa nibs, goji berries, coconut oil, and honey in a bowl. Mix everything into a large ball, cover, and freeze for 10 minutes.
Roll into small bite-sized balls using moist hands. Store in the refrigerator.
