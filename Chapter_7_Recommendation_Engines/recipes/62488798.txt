Ingredients:
1 can premade pizza dough (I use the pillsbury cans)
2 TBS olive oil
1 tsp. minced garlic.
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 bell pepper, cored, seeded and cut into strips
1/2 red onion, sliced vertically
1 1/2 boneless chicken breast halves, grilled and diced
3 slices bacon, cooked until crisp and crumbled.

Directions:
1) Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
2) Unroll the pizza dough onto a large cookie sheet. Drizzle with 1 TBS olive oil and garlic, followed by 1/2 cup each of mozzarella and cheddar cheese. Scatter bell pepper, onion, chicken and bacon over cheese. Sprinkle remaining cheese over pizza and drizzle remaining olive oil.
3) Bake for 25 minutes or until crust is browned. Serve.
