Ingredients:
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup canola oil
1/4 cup pineapple juice
2 Tbsp dried minced onion
2 Tbsp sesame seeds
1 Tbsp brown sugar
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp  salt
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
6 to 7 pounds chicken leg/thigh quarters

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine first 10 ingredients. Set aside 1/3 cup for basting; cover and refrigerate. Pour remaining marinade into a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken; seal and turn to coat. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.
Prepare grill for indirect heat, using a drip pan. Place chicken over drip pan; grill, covered, over indirect medium heat 45-60 minutes or until a thermometer reads 170°-175°, turning and basting frequently with reserved marinade during the last 20 minutes.
Cooks Note: To prepare in oven, heat oven to 350 degrees. Bake covered for one hour then uncovered basting for an additional 20 minutes.

Description: 
What I love about this recipe is that during the summer I can use the grill to keep the heat out of the kitchen and make a great tasting meal.  You also have the option of using the oven during those cold winter months to remind you that summer still exists.
