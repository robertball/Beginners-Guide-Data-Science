Ingredients:
1 packet sazon seasoning, or more to taste
1 pinch freshly cracked black pepper, or to taste
2 pounds untrimmed skirt steak, or more to taste
2 green bell peppers, seeded and diced
2 red bell peppers, seeded and diced
1 large onion, diced
6 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Sprinkle sazon seasoning and black pepper over steaks; rub in lightly with your fingers. Arrange steaks close together, but not overlapping, in a large casserole dish.
Mix green bell peppers, red bell peppers, onion, and garlic together in a large bowl. Spoon over steaks in the casserole dish. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until peppers are soft and steaks are cooked through, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Description: 
Another recipe taught to me by my beloved mother-in-law in Puerto Rico. The only changes I have made is the reduction of additional table salt; the sazon seasoning has plenty. A savory,  melt-in-your mouth skirt steak recipe that is slow-roasted with diced vegetables and seasonings. Perfect served with arroz con gandules and tostones.
