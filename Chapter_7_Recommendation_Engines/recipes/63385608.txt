Ingredients:
1 qt almond milk
1/2 c arrowroot powder

Directions:
In a large saucepan, heat the almond milk on medium high.  Combine the 1/2 c arrowroot with 1 c of water in a separate jar.  Shake jar so that no lumps are present.  While whisking the almond milk, add the arrowroot mixture.  Continue to whisk the almond milk in pot as it thickens.  This usually takes until the milk almost reaches the boiling point.  Remove almond milk from pot.  If you need the cream quickly, you can pour the almond milk into a bowl and set the bowl in a large bowl of ice water to chill the amond milk quickly.  If you aren't in a hurry, you can put the almond milk in a storage container in the frig for a couple of hours.
