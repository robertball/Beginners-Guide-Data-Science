Ingredients:
20 strawberries, hulled
20 pieces cantaloupe or 50 pieces mandarin oranges
20 pieces pineapple, canned
20 pieces kiwi fruits or 20 pieces honeydew melon
40 blueberries
20 bamboo or other disposable skewers (such as plastic)

Directions:
If using wooden or bamboo skewers, make sure all the splinters are off of them by rolling two together in your hands, or rub them over each other, as if you are sharpening a knife.
Cut the fruit that is not already small into 1-inch, or bite-size, chunks.
First, skewer the strawberry.
Then, skewer the cantelope or orange.
Then, skewer the pineapple.
Then, skewer the kiwifruit or honewdew melon.
Then, finish the skewer with 2 blueberries on the pointed end. Make sure to push them up fairly high, so they don't slip off.
