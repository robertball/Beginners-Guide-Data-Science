Ingredients:
1 chopped red onion
1 cup chopped red bell pepper
3 Scotch bonnet chile peppers, chopped
1 large papaya - peeled, seeded and cubed
1 head garlic, peeled
2 tablespoons dry mustard powder
2 cups white sugar
3 cups dry white wine
1 cup malt vinegar
1 cup water
1/2 cup lemon juice
2 cups prepared yellow mustard

Directions:
Place the onion, red pepper, Scotch bonnet chiles, papaya, and garlic in a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped. Scrape into a large pot, and stir in the mustard powder, sugar, wine, vinegar, water, and lemon juice.
Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and continue simmering, stirring frequently until the mixture has thickened, about 1 hour. Once thick, remove from the heat, and stir in the yellow mustard.

Description: 
The sauce is good on just about anything from pork, chicken, and seafood. I like it on boneless-skinless chicken breast seasoned with fresh thyme, salt and pepper, broiled until about done then heavily basted with the sauce to finish. This recipe fills a Dutch oven over half the pan. Plenty for leftovers.
