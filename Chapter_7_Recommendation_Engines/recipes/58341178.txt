Description: 
I learned to cook many things from my grandmother. One of the family favorites was noodles, however Grandma taught by handfuls and pinches of this and that.  I since have tried to convert to US measurements.  My grandmother would be 102 if still living.Modified from: Homemade Egg Noodles
