Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 parts extra virgin olive oil
1 part balsamic vinegar
1 pinch garlic powder (or 1 clove garlic, minced)
1 pinch dry mustard
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground pepper
1 pinch dill seeds

Directions:
Pour the olive oil into a small bowl (just eyeball it based on how much dressing you need). Pour the balsamic vinegar, trying to make the ratio about 3:1 -- but it doesn't have to be perfect.
Add everything else, whisk vigorously until combined, and pour over salad.

Description: 
I adapted this recipe from a cookbook when I was just learning to cook. Every time I make it, people say it's the best salad dressing they've ever had...and it takes no time to make! So much better than bottled.
