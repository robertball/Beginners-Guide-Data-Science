Ingredients:
Pizza:
3 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 (0.25 oz.) pkg. of active dry yeast
1 tsp. sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
1 cup water
2 tbsp. olive oil or vegetable oil
Topping:
2 (8 oz.) pkg. cream cheese, softened
2 (6 oz.) cans crabmeat - drained, flaked and cartilage removed
1/4 cup milk
1 cup crumbled feta cheese
1 tsp. dried basil
1 tsp. dried oregano
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1 cup Swiss cheese, shredded and divided

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups flour, yeast, sugar and salt. In a saucepan, heat water and oil just to a boil. Add to dry ingredients; beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down; divide in half. On a floured surface, roll each piece into a 13-in. circle; transfer to two 12-in. pizza pans. Build up edge slightly. Prick dough thoroughly with a fork. Bake crusts at 450 degrees for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Combine the cream cheese, crab, milk, feta cheese, basil, oregano and garlic powder; spread mixture over each crust. Sprinkle each with 1/2 cup Swiss cheese. Bake 10-12 minutes longer or until crust is golden and cheese is melted. Cut into wedges.
