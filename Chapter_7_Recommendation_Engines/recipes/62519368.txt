Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into strips
1 small onion, thinly sliced (about 1/4 cup)
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup mushrooms (about 3 ounces)
1 can (10 3/4 ounces) Campbell'sÂ® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup
1/2 cup Sauvignon Blanc or other white wine
2 cups corkscrew-shaped pasta (rotini), cooked and drained (about 4 cups)

Directions:
Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and cook until well browned, stirring often.
Stir the onion, garlic and mushrooms in the skillet and cook until the vegetables are tender.  Stir in the soup and wine.  Reduce the heat to low.  Cook for 20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through, stirring occasionally.
Place the pasta into a large bowl.  Add the chicken mixture and toss to coat.
