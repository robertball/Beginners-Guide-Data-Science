Ingredients:
2 (15 ounce) cans chili with beef and beans
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed
8 corn tortillas
8 hot dogs
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste
2 tablespoons chopped onion (optional)
2 tablespoons sliced black olives (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix chili and tomato sauce together in a bowl.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook corn tortillas, one at a time, in the hot oil until slightly softened, about 30 seconds per side. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
Place 1 hot dog and 2 to 3 tablespoons of the chili mixture on each tortilla; wrap up. Arrange seam-side down in a baking dish. Spoon remaining chili mixture on top. Cover with Cheddar cheese, onion, and olives.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a family favorite - a cross between chili dogs and enchiladas - that makes a cozy dinner on a cold autumn evening. If you serve it on Halloween, call it Hallo-weenie-ladas. Serve with sour cream, hot sauce, and a fresh green salad. Enjoy!
