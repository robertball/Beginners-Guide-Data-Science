Ingredients:
2 pounds beef roast, cubed, 1-inch thick (about 24 cubes)
1/4 cup beef broth, or red wine
1/4 cup olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 red bell pepper, cut into 1 inch squares
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into 1 inch squares
1 green bell pepper, cut into 1 inch square
2 red onions, cut into 8 to 12 wedges each
4 ounces fresh mushrooms, stems removed

Directions:
Place beef in plastic bag.  Combine broth (wine), olive oil, and garlic in a small bowl.  Drizzle half of the marinade over beef, turning to coat well. Combine cayenne pepper, paprika, thyme, cumin, and salt in small bowl.  Add to beef.
Place bag in refrigerator for 2 hours to overnight to allow flavors to  penetrate. Store reserved marinade in refrigerator until ready to grill.
Place meat, peppers, onions and mushrooms alternately on skewers (if using bamboo or wooden skewers, pre-soak skewers in cold water for 30 minutes).
Grill, brushing with reserved marinade, for 5-7  minutes on each side, or until beef is cooked through.
