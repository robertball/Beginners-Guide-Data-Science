Ingredients:
3 cups elbow macaroni
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/2 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon prepared mustard
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 cup French-fried onions

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.
Stir cream of mushroom soup, 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese, milk, mustard, and pepper together in a large bowl; add macaroni and stir to coat. Pour macaroni mixture into a baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, top with remaining Cheddar cheese and French-fried onions, and continue baking until the cheese on top is melted completely, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
My favorite mac and cheese recipe that I found in my mother's recipe box. I always double or triple this recipe. My family loves this recipe and rarely are there leftovers. It is just as good re-warmed and eaten the next day or so.
