3. Whisk eggs into the soured milk. Stir into dry ingredients and set batter aside.
4. Melt butter in a 10- or 12-inch cast-iron skillet. Pour in the batter. Pour cream into center, then slide the skillet into the oven and bake until golden brown on top, about 45 minutes.
5. Slice into wedges and serve warm, with maple syrup if you'd like.
