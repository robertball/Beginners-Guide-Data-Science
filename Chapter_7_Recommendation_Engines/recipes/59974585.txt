Ingredients:
5 russet potatoes, sliced into 1/4 inch slices
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1 quart casserole dish. Cut potato slices with a fun-shaped cookie cutter.
Layer the potatoes into bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
In a medium-size saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Mix in the flour and salt, and stir constantly with a whisk for one minute. Stir in milk. Cook until mixture has thickened. Stir in cheese all at once, and continue stirring until melted, about 30 to 60 seconds. Pour cheese over the potatoes, and cover the dish with aluminum foil.
Bake 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven.

Description: 
My kids and I love these creamy potatoes but I love to make them a little more fun. It takes a little more time but cutting the slices with a cookie cutter really makes the kids smile. I also take out the onions.Modified from: Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes
