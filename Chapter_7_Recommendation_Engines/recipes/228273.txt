Ingredients:
1 teaspoon cocoa powder for dusting, or as needed
4 eggs
2 cups superfine sugar
1 cup margarine, softened
1 cup self-rising flour
1 cup chocolate chunks
3/4 cup cocoa powder
1 cup fresh raspberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12x9-inch baking dish and dust with 1 teaspoon cocoa powder.
Beat eggs, superfine sugar, margarine, flour, chocolate chunks, and 3/4 cups cocoa powder together with an electric hand mixer in a large mixing bowl until smooth. Fold raspberries gently into the batter; spoon into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the top is a bit crusty, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool completely before cutting.

Description: 
The best brownies are soft in the center and have a crust on the top, oh and they also have chocolate chunks and fresh raspberries in them too! This recipe couldn't be simpler-just measure everything into 1 bowl, mix, add raspberries and bake! No doubt these will be one of the best desserts you have EVER made! I use fresh raspberries out of my garden. I am sure you could use frozen, but perhaps you would need to drain off some of the liquid as to not screw with the proportions of the recipe. TRY not to eat the whole pan at once!
