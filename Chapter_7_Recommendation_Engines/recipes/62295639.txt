Ingredients:
- Cloves of Garlic, peeled; 2
- Fresh Ginger, maybe 1 inch long, peeled and finely chopped
- Ground Cumin seeds; 1 Tablespoon
- Ground Cardomom; 1/2 teaspoon
- Chilli powder; 1/2 teaspoon
- Paprika; 2 teaspoons
- Plain natural yoghurt; 150 ml (1/4 pint)
- Salt, a couple of pinches
- Large chicken pieces (breasts, thighs, drumsticks); 4

Directions:
Throw everything except the chicken into a blender and whizz until smooth.
Put the chicken pieces in a shalow dish and spoon over the 'gloop' from the blender. Set aside for 15 minutes, longer is better  - up to say an hour.
Preheat the grill (broiler in the US) to medium hot, then place the chicken under it around 10cm (4 inches) from the heat source.
Cook until the juices run clear, turning once. This is around 15 minutes for boneless joints or 20-25 minutes for those with a bone in. Let the ochre-coloured skin char a little.

Description: 
A good way to use chicken pieces to break free of the same old same old, a lovely Indian influence here.
