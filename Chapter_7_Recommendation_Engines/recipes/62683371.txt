Ingredients:
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
6 slices Swiss cheese
6 slices ham
2 beaten eggs
panko bread crumbs
1 teaspoon paprika
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup dry white wine or chicken broth
2 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
2 tablespoon cornstarch
2 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Pound chicken breasts to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness. Place a cheese and ham slice on each breast within 1/2 inch of the edges. Fold the edges of the chicken over the filling, and secure with toothpicks. Mix the bread crumbs and paprika in a small bowl, and coat the chicken pieces with egg then roll in bread crumbs.
Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the chicken until browned on all sides. Pop into a 350 oven for 20 mins to finish cooking.  Add the wine and bouillon to a saucepan. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 to 20 minutes. Blend the cornstarch with the cream in a small bowl, and whisk slowly into the skillet. Cook, stirring until thickened, and pour over the chicken. Serve warm.
