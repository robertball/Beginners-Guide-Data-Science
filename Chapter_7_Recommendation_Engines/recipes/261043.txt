Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
3 onion, finely sliced
5 cloves garlic, minced
salt
6 tablespoons Hungarian sweet paprika
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
water, divided
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
6 tablespoons tomato paste
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
5 pounds cubed beef stew meat
freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over low heat and cook onions until they are softened, about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add garlic and salt and continue to cook until onions are soft, lightly browned, and caramelized, stirring every 5 minutes, about 15 minutes. Season with paprika and cayenne and stir so onions turn a bright red, about 1 minute.
Pour 2 tablespoons water and vinegar into the pot and stir to combine. Add tomato paste, marjoram, and caraway seeds. Add beef, season with salt, and enough water to cover beef halfway. Cover pot and bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook goulash on a low simmer, stirring every 30 minutes, about 3 hours. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This goulash recipe is a classic German/Austrian goulash recipe where the beef is cooked very slowly mostly in its own juices. It needs to cook for a while, so take your time, and it tastes even better the next day.
