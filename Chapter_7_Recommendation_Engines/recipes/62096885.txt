Description: 
For major shrimp lovers! This was a HUGE hit in our house - and so simple to put together. I had a really good week at the Farmer's Market, so I had some great fresh veg - substitute whatever you have on hand that is tasty and super fresh. The veggies are still crisp, and the spice level is flavorful, and not at all hot (though it sure could be and would be GREAT!) This doesn't make a lot of sauce - just enough to have a moist feel. If you prefer a true sauce, adding a bit of stock at the end would work nicely.
