Ingredients:
1 bottle Red Wine
1/2 can of Fanta
1/3 cup Rum Bacardi
1/3 cup Whisky
1/3 cup Moscatel (like a Spanish sherry)
Chopped fruit (Oranges, Limes, Apples, Peaches)
Sugar

Directions:
Add all ingredients to a pitcher, still in sugar to taste. There is a lot of flexibility in sangrias, so add whatever fruit you fancy and go with it.

Description: 
A recipe I used when I was in Spain. Still not as good as having the local recipes and their ingredients, but stateside, this is a lot better than going to an expensive tapas bar.
