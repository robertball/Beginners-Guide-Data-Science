Ingredients:
7 cups water
2 cups wheat berries
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
Raspberry Vinaigrette:
1/2 cup canola oil
1/2 cup raspberry wine vinegar
1/2 cup raspberry preserves
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Salad:
1 firm pear, cored and diced
1/2 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
1/2 cup dried cranberries
3 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Bring water and wheat berries to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the wheat berries are tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Drain any excess water and cool.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread walnuts onto a baking sheet.
Bake walnuts in the preheated oven until toasted and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove pan from oven and cool.
Whisk canola oil, raspberry wine vinegar, raspberry preserves, mustard, oregano, and black pepper together in a bowl until vinaigrette is smooth. Measure 1/2 cup vinaigrette and store remaining vinaigrette in an airtight container in the refrigerator for another use.
Combine wheat berries, walnuts, pear, Gorgonzola cheese, cranberries, and green onions in a large bowl. Drizzle 1/2 cup vinaigrette over wheat berries mixture; toss to coat. Refrigerate for flavors to blend, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a recipe I created using wheat berries which is a healthy alternative to rice. It's also easy to substitute different nuts or fruit depending on what you have on hand.
