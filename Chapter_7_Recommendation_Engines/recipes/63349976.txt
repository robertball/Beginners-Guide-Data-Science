Ingredients:
3-1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoons cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cloves
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1 cup vegetable oil
1 cup honey
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed (light or dark)
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup warm coffee or strong tea
1/2 cup orange juice
1/4 rye or whisky
1/2 cup slivered or sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Lightly grease 3 loaf pans.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and spices.
Make a well in the center and add the oil, honey, sugars, eggs, vanilla, coffee, orange juice and rye or whisky.
Using a strong wire whisk or electric mixer on slow speed, combine the ingredients well to make a thick batter, making sure that no ingredients are stuck to the bottom of the bowl.  Batter will be liquidy.
Spoon the batter into the prepared pan(s) and sprinkle the top of the cake(s) evenly with the almonds.  Bake until the cake springs back when you
touch it gently in the center - about 45 to 55 minutes for loaf pans.
Let the cake stand for 15 mintues before removing it from the pan.
