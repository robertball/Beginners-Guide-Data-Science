Hot and Sour Soup Recipe

Ingredients:
4 cups chicken broth
3/4 cup mushrooms, sliced
1/2 cup bamboo shoots
1/2 cup water chestnuts
3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar or plain white vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon black paper (optional: 2 teaspoons)
1/2 pound shrimp, thawed, deveined, peeled (optional)
4 ounces tofu sliced into small cubes or strips
1 tablespoon cold water
1 tablespoon corn starch
1 large egg, thoroughly beaten
2 tablespoons parsley or chives or coriander

Directions:
Skim any visible fat from the chicken broth.
Combine broth mushrooms, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, sugar and pepper in a large boiler.
Bring to boil then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
Add shrimp and tofu.
Simmer for at least three minutes to ensure shrimp is cooked.
Mix cold water and corn starch together and stir until no lumps remain. Add to soup.
Very slowly add beaten egg to soup while constantly stirring. Do not do this quickly as you will get large globs of egg instead of long and stringy eggs.
Allow soup to begin to boil very slowly while occasionally stirring. Soup will thicken and become bubbly. Remove from heat and add parsley, chives or coriander.
OPTIONS:
Black pepper may be adjusted for taste.
Shrimp is optional and is easily the most expensive part of the recipe.
Parsley/chives/coriander can be added when served as a garnish.

Description: 
This is a great Chinese soup recipe that I have tinkered with from time to time. It's got a good flavor with an optional zing. It's very easy to make and will keep well for several days if refrigerated.
