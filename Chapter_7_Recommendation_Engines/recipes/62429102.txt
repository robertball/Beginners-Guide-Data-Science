Ingredients:
Poolish:
1/4 tsp yeast
2 1/2 Cups Bread Flour
1 1/2 Cups warm water
Dough:
All the poolish
1 1/2 tsp yeast
3 Cups bread flour
3/4 Cup warm water
2 T olive oil
1 T Italian seasoning
1 T Kosher salt (or 1 1/2 tsp regular salt)
Toppings:
1/4 Cup olive oil
2-3 cloves fresh garlic
1/2 tsp Kosher salt
1/4 Cup grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Mix the poolish by combining the 1/4 tsp yeast, 2 1/2 Cups bread flour and 1 1/2 cups warm water.  Stir and allow to sit on the counter for a couple of hours (up to 12 hours) or in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer combine all the poolish, the additional 1 1/2 tsp yeast, 3 Cups bread flour, italian seasonings.   Mix on low to throughly combine.
Add 3/4 Cup warm water, 2 T Olive Oil, 1 T Kosher salt and knead for 6-8 minutes until the dough is very stretchy.  The dough should climb the dough hook but will still be very sticky and pulling away from the sides of the bowl but will not pull away from the bottom of the bowl.  If the dough isn't pulling away from the sides of the bowl add about 1/4 cup more bread flour and continue to knead. The dough should be smooth and elastic but very sticky.
Line a 13" x 18" sheet pan with parchment paper and coat with a thin layer of olive oil.
Scrape the dough onto the parchment paper.  Stretch the dough into a rough rectangle.  Spray the top of the dough with cooking spray.  Loosely cover with plastic wrap.
Let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
When dough has doubled in size gently stretch the dough to fit the sheet pan.
Using a food processor or blender whirl together 1/4 cup olive oil with the garlic cloves with 1/2 tsp kosher salt.  Spread evenly over the dough.  Using your finger tips, gently press the dough making little dimples in the top of the dough.
Sprinkle with the italian seasoning, parmesan cheese.  Add any other additional toppings you like.
Cover and let rise for about 30 - 45 minutes until dough is puffy.
Pre heat oven to 400
Bake at 400 for about 20-25 minutes.  The focaccia should be lightly brown.
