Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 stalks celery, chopped
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 pound ground beef
1/2 pound spicy chorizo, casings removed and discarded
2 (28 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TELÂ®)
1 (1.25 ounce) package chili seasoning mix, or to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute celery, onion, and garlic in hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir ground beef and chorizo with the vegetable mixture, breaking meat into increasingly smaller chunks as you cook and stir until the meat is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
Stir tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes, tomato paste, and diced tomatoes with green chile peppers into the beef mixture, respectively; season with chili seasoning mix. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook chili at a simmer until thickened, about 1 hour and 45 minutes.

Description: 
We have been looking for chorizo recipes. We fell in love with this sausage, and there just are not many recipes for it. My kids ate this on their hot dogs, and, before I knew, it the entire pot was gone.
