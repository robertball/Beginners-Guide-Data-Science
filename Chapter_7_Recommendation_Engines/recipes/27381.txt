Ingredients:
3 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons cream of tartar
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/4 cup butter
3/4 cup treacle or molasses
1 cup milk, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Sift the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and sugar into a bowl. Rub in butter until it is in crumb-sized pieces. Make a well in the center and pour in the treacle and milk. Stir into a soft dough. Roll out on a floured surface and cut in to rounds with a biscuit cutter. Place on a baking sheet.
Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bottoms are lightly browned.
