Ingredients:
5 cups mashed potatoes, or as needed
6 slices cooked ham
6 eggs
1/4 cup butter, cut into small pieces
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley, or as desired
1 tablespoon prepared Hollandaise sauce, or as desired

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat bottom of a 12x12-inch casserole dish with butter.
Spread mashed potatoes into the bottom of the prepared casserole dish to a depth of about 2 inches. Press ham slices into the mashed potatoes to form cup shapes. Break an egg into each ham cup. Dot mashed potatoes with butter. Sprinkle with parsley.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set, 25 to 30 minutes. Scoop ham cups and mashed potatoes onto serving plates and drizzle with Hollandaise sauce.

Description: 
This is a very simple recipe that came out of the hard times of the Great Depression. It uses few ingredients and inexpensive ingredients (leftovers work well). My family of six loves this meal. It is a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes and ham from a Sunday dinner. Add some Hollandaise sauce and it's almost eggs Benedict. Add and adapt the recipe to use up odds and ends in the fridge. Great meal for a Monday! Leftover chives or shredded cheese...add them to the potatoes. The recipe begs you to be creative and use up what you have. Garnish with parsley, grated cheese, or chopped scallions.
