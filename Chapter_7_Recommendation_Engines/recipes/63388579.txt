Ingredients:
Olive oil
4 links of apple chicken sausage, diced
2 Cups sweet potatoes, diced
2-3 cloves garlic
1/2 Cup red onion, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
salt and pepper
1 Cup green grapes, halved
3 oz cream cheese, softened
1/2 - 3/4 Cup blue cheese crumbles
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
Puff pastry, 2 pieces
sliced almonds, optional

Directions:
Saute the chicken sausage, sweet potatoes,garlic, onion, bell pepper and celery over medium high heat until the veggies are cooked through yet still firm.  Remove to a large bowl and add salt and pepper to taste and the green grapes.
Mix together the cream cheese, blue cheese, and rosemary, set aside.
Arrange the puff pastry on an baking sheet.  Using a rolling pin, flatten and connect the two pieces of pastry.  On the longest sides of the baking sheet, cut pastry into strips 1 1/2 inches apart, 3 inches deep (there will be several inches in the middle for the filling).
Spread the filling evenly over the middle of the dough.  Drop the cheese mixture over the top.  To braid, lift the strips of dough to meet in the center, twisting one time.  Continue until all the strips have been twisted and cover the filling.  Sprinkle the sliced almonds on top, if using.
Bake at 400 degrees for 30 min. or until golden brown.
