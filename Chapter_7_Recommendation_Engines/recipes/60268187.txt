Description: 
If you don't have a small slow cooker or are short on time before guests arrive, try making buffalo chicken dip on the stove top instead of in a slow cooker. Serve with pre-sliced celery and crackers and you have a satisfying appetizer in less than half and hour.Modified from: Buffalo Chicken Dip
