Description: 
AFTER our children were married and gone, I prepared this entree often for my husband and me, especially on our anniversary. It was one of our favorites.    We found that one of the nicest ways to enjoy each other's company was to have a great meal together. -Ruby Williams, Bogalusa, Louisiana
