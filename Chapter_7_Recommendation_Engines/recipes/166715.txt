Description: 
This is a perfect sauce to pour over fish, chicken, rice and noodle dishes.  One of my friends even likes to pour it over waffles, but I don't recommend that, she's a little nutty.  It makes a good dip for chicken fingers, shrimp rolls (what can't it do?) I make extra large batches and give some away bottled.
