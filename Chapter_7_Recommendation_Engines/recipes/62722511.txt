Ingredients:
2.5 pounds boneless beef roast, such as cross rib
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
salt and pepper to taste
1 onion, quartered
2 celery stalks with leaves
16 baby carrots
4 cloves garlic, crushed with a knife handle and husks removed
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of broccoli soup
1/2 cup of beef broth

Directions:
Cut off all of the fat from the roast and tenderize the meat all over with a multi-blade meat tenderizer tool. Sprinkle salt and pepper all over the meat. Preheat a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the roast in the oil for 2 minutes per side or till both sides are well browned and set aside.
Place the onion, carrots, garlic and celery in the bottom of a slow cooker. Place the roast on top of the vegetables and pour the soups and broth over the roast and the vegetables.
Cover the slow cooker and cook on low setting for 8 to 10 hours, stirring once.
Transfer roast to a serving platter and place the vegetables around it, discard the celery and reserve the garlic cloves for other recipe uses. Pour the roast gravy from the slow cooker through a strainer and serve with mashed potatoes.
Use any leftover meat, onions and the reserved garlic cloves with fresh diced potatoes for making roast beef hash the next day or two. Delicious!
