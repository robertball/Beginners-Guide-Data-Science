2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 1/2 cups milk (let sit out until room temp)
1 egg
4 to 6 tablespoons butter, melted
2 teaspoons vanilla
For a twist, can add 1 teaspoon cinnamon & 1 teaspoon nutmeg.

Directions:
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Mix wet ingredients together. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth w/ a wire wisk.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.

This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.Modified from: Good Old Fashioned Pancakes
