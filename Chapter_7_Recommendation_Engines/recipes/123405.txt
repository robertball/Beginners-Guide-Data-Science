1/2 cup whole wheat flour
10 tablespoons quick cooking oats

1 1/3 cups buttermilk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine the first six ingredients. In another bowl, beat eggs, buttermilk and oil; stir into dry ingredients and mix well. Pour batter by 1/3 cupfuls onto a lightly greased hot griddle; turn when bubbles form on top of pancakes. Cook until the second side is golden brown.

Description: 
Is your family tired of the same old breakfast pancakes? If so, try this recipe! Brown sugar wakes up your taste buds while oats add stick-to-your-ribs texture to carry you through lunchtime. These pancakes are so nicely sweet they don't need syrup...and they're a fun way to get kids to eat oats.                                                           --Karen Ann Bland                                                                    Gove, Kansas
