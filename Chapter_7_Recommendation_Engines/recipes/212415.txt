Ingredients:
Salad:
30 baby beets, any color, trimmed with 1-inch tops remaining
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon sea salt
2 bunches watercress, washed, spun dry and trimmed
1 1/2 pounds seared ahi tuna
Ginger Vinaigrette:
1 lemon, juiced
1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
1/4 cup orange juice
2 tablespoons champagne vinegar
1 tablespoon fish sauce
2 packets Stevia Extract In The Raw®
2 tablespoons fresh peeled and chopped ginger
1 garlic clove, peeled and chopped
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Salad: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F
Rinse beets in cold water. Place on roasting pan and add enough water to cover three-fourths. Cover pan tightly with foil and roast about 50 minutes or until just under fork tender. Remove from oven. Beets will finish cooking during the cooling process.
While beets are still warm, peel using soft towel rubbing skin off gently. Remove root top with a paring knife. Toss beets in bowl with olive oil and sea salt and set aside.
Prepare ahi tuna and slice. Place on bed of watercress with roasted beets and ginger vinaigrette.
Ginger Vinaigrette: In small container combine all ingredients in an airtight non-metallic container and shake vigorously to combine.
