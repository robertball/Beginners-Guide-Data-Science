Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef, browned
19 ounce can black beans
2 tablespoons taco seasoning mix
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup salsa

Directions:
Brown the ground beef. Drain and rinse the black beans and add to ground beef. Add 2 tablespoons taco seasoning mix, water and salsa and stir well and warm through.
Serve with taco shells topped with lettuce and cheese or my favorite use on a taco salad with cheese, tortilla strips, salsa ranch dressing, romaine and peppers. Yummy!
