Ingredients:
1 small ripe banana
1/4 cup golden flax seeds
2 teaspoons chia seeds
2 scoops vanilla protein powder
1 tablespoon powdered peanut butter
2 tablespoons dairy-free mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mash banana in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Blend in flax seeds and chia seeds. Mix in protein powder and powdered peanut butter. Fold in chocolate chips using a spatula.
Drop 6 cookies onto the baking sheet using an ice cream scoop. Flatten each cookie with the palm of your hand.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are firm in the center and edges are browned, 8 to 9 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; cool for 10 minutes.
