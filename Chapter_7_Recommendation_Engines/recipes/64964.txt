Description: 
This is beautifully coloured apples with little sausages sticking out at perky angles. Great Christmas Eve supper item. My grandma gave me this recipe after serving it for many years at holiday time. Serve hot in leafy green wreaths of watercress or lettuce. Accompany with fluffy rice or hot cheese sauce.
