Ingredients:
1 (13.5 ounce) can full-fat coconut milk
5 tablespoons Dutch-process cocoa powder
1/4 cup white sugar, or less to taste
1/4 cup fresh raspberries
1/4 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Combine coconut milk, cocoa powder, sugar, raspberries, and almond extract in a blender. Blend on high until mixture is thick and fluffy like pudding, about 2 minutes.
Fill disposable cups with the mixture, smoothing over the tops. Insert sticks.
Freeze until solid, at least 3 hours.
Run hot water over the bottoms of the cups until the fudge pops slide out easily.
