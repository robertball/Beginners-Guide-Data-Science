Ingredients:
1 large head broccoli, cut into florets
10 ounces baby potatoes, halved
1 large carrot, sliced
1/2 red onion, roughly chopped
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons whole grain mustard
2 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 mild Italian sausage links

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place broccoli, baby potatoes, carrot, and onion in a large bowl. Pour in olive oil, mustard, Pecorino Romano cheese, thyme, oregano, salt, and pepper. Toss well to coat, then spread vegetables in an even layer on a sheet pan. Arrange sausages in the pan, pushing aside the vegetables so that the sausages touch the bottom of the pan.
Bake in the preheated oven, flipping sausages and vegetables halfway through until sausages are no longer pink in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
