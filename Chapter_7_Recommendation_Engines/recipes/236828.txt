Ingredients:
4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 (900 ml) carton 25%-less-sodium chicken broth
2 (5 ounce) Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 cups frozen corn
1 cup KRAFT Creamy Herb & Garlic Shredded Cheese with a TOUCH OF PHILADELPHIA, divided
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided

Directions:
Cook and stir bacon in medium saucepan on medium heat until crisp. Remove from heat with slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Discard all but 1 tablespoon drippings from pan.
Add onions and garlic to reserved drippings; cook on medium-low heat 5 minutes or until onions are crisp-tender, stirring frequently. Stir in flour; cook and stir 2 to 3 minutes or until bubbly. Gradually stir in broth. Add potatoes; bring to boil on medium heat. Simmer on medium-low heat 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender, stirring frequently.
Use potato masher to carefully smash most of the potatoes. Stir in corn; cook 4 minutes. Add 3/4 cup cheese and 2 tablespoons parsley; cook and stir 3 to 5 minutes or until cheese is melted.
