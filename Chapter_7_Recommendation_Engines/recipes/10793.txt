1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped white chocolate
1/3 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Blend sugar and butter together until smooth and creamy. Add the egg and vanilla; blend well.
Sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder; combine these ingredients with the creamed mixture.  Add chopped white chocolate and nuts.
Spoon dough out onto a cookie sheet.  Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 5 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown on the bottom.  Let cool slightly on the cookie sheet before removing, or they'll break.
