Ingredients:
aluminum foil
cooking spray
1 1/2 pounds beef oxtails
2 pounds beef marrow bones
3 carrots, washed and sliced
3 stalks celery, washed and thickly sliced
1 large unpeeled onion, quartered
8 cloves garlic, halved
1 leek, white and tender green parts only, halved lengthwise and sliced
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns
4 cups water, or as needed
2 bay leaves
cheese cloth

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray.
Spread out oxtail, bones, carrots, celery, onion, and garlic on the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes. Scrape contents of the baking sheet into a slow cooker. Add leek, apple cider vinegar, salt, and peppercorns. Add enough water to cover the contents but not more than 2 inches below the rim.
Cook on Low for 22 hours. Add bay leaves and cook for another 2 hours.
Strain broth through a fine mesh strainer that is lined with a double layer of cheese cloth. Refrigerate. Skim off the fat before using or freezing.

Description: 
Meaty oxtail and marrow bones are perfect for bone broth, these will produce a jelly-like bone broth that is dark in color and nutritious. Roasting the bones adds a beautiful color and a richer flavor. I tend to go light on the salt so taste and adjust accordingly.
