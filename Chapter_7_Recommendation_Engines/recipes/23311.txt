Ingredients:
2 quarts blueberries, rinsed and drained
2 cups water
1 tablespoon grated lemon peel
3 cups white sugar
4 cups water
2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Place blueberries in a large stockpot and crush with a potato masher. Add water and lemon peel; simmer over low heat for 5 minutes. Strain fruit through cheese cloth, metal strainer or food mill to remove pulp and seeds; reserve juice.
In a large saucepan, mix sugar and 4 cups water. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, until temperature reaches 260 degrees F (125 degrees C). Add blueberry juice and boil for 1 minute. Stir in lemon juice and remove from heat. Let cool and freeze or can as desired.

Description: 
My mother-in-law gave me this recipe.  My family puts it on anything from pancakes to vanilla ice cream.  It is best served warm, right after making.  Fresh blueberries are recommended.
