Ingredients:
9 cups water, divided
2 cups dried mung beans
2 1/2 cups millet
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 carrot, shredded, or more to taste
2/3 bunch chopped flat-leaf parsley
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated
2 teaspoons dried basil, or more to taste
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 cups chopped tomatoes
2 teaspoons salt
ground black pepper to taste
2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Bring 4 cups water and mung beans to a boil in a pot; cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until beans are tender, 45 to 60 minutes.
Bring 5 cups water and millet to a boil in a separate pot; cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until water is absorbed and millet is tender, 10 to 20 minutes.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, green bell pepper, celery, carrot, parsley, garlic, ginger, basil, oregano, cumin, curry powder, and cayenne pepper until vegetables are slightly tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir tomatoes, salt, and pepper into vegetable mixture.
Mix mung beans, millet, and Cheddar cheese into vegetable mixture; cook and stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
