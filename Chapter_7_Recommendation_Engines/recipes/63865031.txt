Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni (an 8-ounce box isn't quite 2 cups)
4 tablespoons (1/2 stuck) butter, cut into pieces
2 1/2 cups (about 10 ounces) grated sharp Cheddar cheese
3 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup sour cream
1 (10 3/4-ounce) can condensed Cheddar cheese soup
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup whole milk
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Boil the macaroni in a 2 quart saucepan in plenty of water until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain.
In a medium saucepan, mix butter and cheese. Stir until the cheese melts.
In a slow cooker, combine cheese/butter mixture and add the eggs, sour cream, soup, salt, milk and pepper.  Stir well.
Add drained macaroni and stir again. Set the slow cooker on low setting and cook for 3 hours, stirring occasionally.

Description: 
This is the best macaroni and cheese we've ever tried.  I believe the recipe is from Paula Deen.
