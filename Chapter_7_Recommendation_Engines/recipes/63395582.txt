Ingredients:
6-7 large sweet potatoes (not yams)
4 cups packed brown sugar
2 cups butter
1 cup pure maple syrup
4 tablespoons pure vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.
Thoroughly scrub sweet potatoes, place in large pot and cover with water. Boil until fork tender and promptly remove from water.
Once potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel off the rough skin. Slice into 1"-thick rounds and layer evenly in 9" x 13" pan.
Combine brown sugar, butter, maple syrup, vanilla and salt in saucepan and bring to boil, stirring often. Pour mixture over sliced potatoes.
Bake for 1 hour and serve hot.
