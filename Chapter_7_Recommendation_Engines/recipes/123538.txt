Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon pepper
4 salmon steaks (1 inch thick)

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine the first six ingredients. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved. Meanwhile, grill salmon, covered, over medium-hot heat for 5 minutes. Turn salmon; baste with the butter sauce. Grill 7-9 minutes longer, turning and basting occasionally, or until the salmon flakes easily with a fork.

'We eat salmon all summer long, and this is our favorite way to fix it,' jots Janis Smoke from King Salmon, Alaska. 'The mild sauce-brushed on as the fish grills-really enhances the taste.'
