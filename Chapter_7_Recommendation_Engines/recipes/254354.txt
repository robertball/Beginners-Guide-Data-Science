Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup rice
2 cups water
4 sprigs fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon salt
3 drops lemon juice

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add rice and mix until clumps form.
Stir water, cilantro, salt, and lemon juice into the saucepan. Simmer uncovered until most of the water has been absorbed, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat, cover, and cook until rice is tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
