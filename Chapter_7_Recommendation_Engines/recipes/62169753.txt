Ingredients:
For Gravy:
3 onions, grated or pureed
1 teaspoon ginger paste
1 teaspoon garlic paste
3 tomatoes, chopped fine
2 green chillis, slit in halves
½ teaspoon turmeric (haldi) powder
½ teaspoon red chilli powder
Salt to taste
¼ cup cream (optional)
Chopped coriander leaves for garnish
For Kofta:
2 large potatoes, boiled and mashed
2  3 slices of white bread, edges trimmed
1 cup paneer, drained and mashed
½ teaspoon garam masala
¼ teaspoon fennel seeds (saunf)
2 green chillies, chopped fine
Salt to taste

Directions:
To make koftas:
Heat oil for deep frying.
Dip bread slices in milk or water. Squeeze out excess liquid and crumble the bread. Add to a bowl. Add all the other kofta ingredients. Mash well with your hands. Taste for seasonings. Make koftas into lime-sized balls.
Deep fry the koftas till golden brown. Set aside on paper. It is important to fry the koftas as soon as they are formed otherwise they will get soggy and break when fried. If you mixture is too wet, add some plain flour (maida) to bind it.
To make gravy:
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a frying pan. Add the onions and fry till deep golden brown. This is key to getting a nice gravy. Add the ginger, garlic, and green chillies and fry for a few minutes. Add the turmeric powder, chilli powder, garam masala, salt, and tomatoes. Cook till tomatoes are soft, about 10 minutes.
When you are ready to serve, bring the gravy back to a boil (add some water if too thick). Reduce heat to simmer. Add the cream. Add the koftas to the gravy and simmer till koftas are heated through. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve.
