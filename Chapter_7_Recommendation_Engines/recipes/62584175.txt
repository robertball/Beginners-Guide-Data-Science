2 Teaspoons Seasoning Salt

Add the 4 cups of cheddar cheese and the cheddar/monteray jack cheese to the milk mixture and mix well but do not use mixer.
Pour milk/cheese mixture over cooked macaroni and mix all together so that mixture is blended well.
Take each slice of velveeta cheese and break in to 4 small squares and lay on top of mixture until all 6 slices are laid out.
Pour melted butter all over mixture (especially on sides of baking dish).
Bake in preheated oven 30 mins (uncovered) or until mixture is bubbly and cheese is melted.
