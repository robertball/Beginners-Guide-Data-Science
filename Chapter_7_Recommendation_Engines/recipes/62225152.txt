Ingredients:
1 pound hamburger
1 1/2 cup water
14 1/2 ounces tomatoes
1 1/2 t paprika
2 1/2 t chili powder
1/2 t garlic powder
1/2 t onion powder
1/2 t accent
1/2 t seasoning salt
1/8 t garlic salt
1/4 t cayenne pepper

Directions:
In large skillet, begin by breaking up hamburger meat.  Pour in 1 cup water and, by using your hands, incorporate the water into the ground beef breaking beef up as minutely as possible.
Bring to low simmer, continually stirring and breaking up beef.  Once moderately cooked, quickly drain fat off.
Return to stove and add remaining 1/2 cup water, and return to low simmer.
In blender, puree canned tomatoes.  Add to meat mixture and stir to incorporate.  Add remaining spices (I like spicer and add more cayanne than noted above).  Let mixture simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.
