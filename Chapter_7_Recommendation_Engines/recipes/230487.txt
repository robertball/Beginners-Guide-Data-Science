Ingredients:
Chipotle Mayonnaise:
1 1/2 cups mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 cup diced green onions
1 1/2 tablespoons ground chipotle chile powder
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 tablespoon garlic basil spread (see footnote for recipe link)
1 teaspoon ground cumin
salt and freshly ground black pepper
Filling:
2 pounds beef tri-tip steak, thinly sliced
2 Anaheim chile peppers, diced
1 onion, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 lime, juiced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground chipotle chile powder
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon Mexican oregano
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 jalapeno peppers, sliced (optional)
Assembly:
4 Italian-style hoagie buns, split lengthwise
1/2 pound sliced Asiago cheese, divided
1 avocado, sliced - divided
1 cup halved cherry tomatoes, divided
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided

Directions:
Combine mayonnaise, sour cream, 1/2 cup cilantro, green onions, 1 1/2 tablespoon ground chipotle peppers, 1 tablespoon lime juice, garlic basil spread, 1 teaspoon cumin, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Stir until combined. Cover and refrigerate chipotle mayonnaise for at least 1 hour.
Combine beef tri-tip, Anaheim chile peppers, onion, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, juice of 1 lime, olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper, smoked paprika, and Mexican oregano in a large bowl; season with salt and black pepper and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate beef mixture for at least 4 hours.
Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until onions soften and become golden and beef browns, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in 1 cup chopped cilantro and jalapeno peppers.
Spread each hoagie bun with 2 tablespoons chipotle mayonnaise. Spoon beef mixture into buns and top each sandwich with 2 ounces Asiago cheese.
Place sandwiches on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bread is toasted and warm, about 5 minutes. Divide fresh avocado, cherry tomatoes, and 1/2 cup cilantro over the 4 sandwiches.
