Ingredients:
1 ½ teaspoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons olive oil
Pinch of red pepper flakes
1 lb. Brussels sprouts
¼ t. sea salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325F and put rack in top third.
Mix oil, mustard and red pepper flakes and set aside.
Remove outer leaves of Brussels sprouts by trimming the end to release leaves—remove the greenest leaves, about 5, from each sprout and reserve inner sprout for roasting at another time.
Toss leaves in sauce; use fingers to ensure that surfaces of all leaves are coated. Spread leaves on foiled baking sheet. They will be crowded, but try to get all separated and in one layer so that edges can crisp.
Roast 15 minutes on top shelf of oven. Remove in crispy leaves (there may only be a few), then roast 5 minutes more. Remove crisped leaves at 5 minute intervals until all are crisped and serve immediately.
