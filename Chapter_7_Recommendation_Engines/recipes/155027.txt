1 egg, beaten
1 cup eggnog
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 pinches ground nutmeg

Beat the egg, eggnog, and sugar together in a bowl. Pour into two small baking dishes. Sprinkle tops with nutmeg. Place the baking dishes into the dish with the water. Add more water if necessary to reach halfway up the sides of the baking dishes.
Bake in preheated oven until tops are set, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool before serving.
