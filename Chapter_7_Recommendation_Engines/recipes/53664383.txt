1/4 cup white sugar
2 limes, zested and juiced
1/4 cup orange juice

1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed (reduce amount added to pie so that pie keeps its shape better - maybe 3/4 of the container)

In a medium bowl, combine crushed pretzels, melted butter, and sugar.  Press mixture into a pie pan.
In a large bowl, mix together lime juice, lime zest, orange juice, and sweetened condensed milk. Fold in whipped topping. Spoon filling into pretzel crust. Chill pie for 25 to 30 minutes.
