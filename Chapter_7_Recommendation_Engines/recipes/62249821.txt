Ingredients:
4 l- 6 lamb shanks
10 garlic cloves
2 medium onions chopped
3 carrots cut into 1 inch rings (I use at least 5-love carrots!)
l  28-oz. can diced tomatoes in juice
l bottle (750 ml) dry red wine (I like cabernet sauvignon)
2 cups low salt chicken broth (or 14 1/2 oz. can)
2 cups low salt beef broth (or 14 1/2 oz. can)
5 tsp. fresh rosemary chopped
2 tsp. fresh thyme chopped
3 tsp. grated lemon peel
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Brown lamb shanks in olive oil.  Remove
Saute onion, carrot and garlic until just golden.  Add garlic last so it doesn't burn.
Add all but salt and pepper and simmer 2 hours covered. (You can stop here and chill until later.)
Uncover and simmer 30 minutes to thicken.
Remove shanks and boil juices to thicken.  I add several Tbsp. of cornstarch stirred into 1/2 cup of cold water to thicken.
Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Lamb shanks cooked in a rich sauce of red wine, tomatoes and vegetables served over creamy rosemary polenta. Could be made with veal shanks too.  The sauce has a depth of complex flavors.  Meat falls off the bone as it cooks slowly.  Make s a great company dish because you can make it up to the last steps ahead of time.
