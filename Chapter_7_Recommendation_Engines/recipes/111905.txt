Ingredients:
1 lime, juiced
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1/4 cup orange juice
1/2 cup white wine
1/4 cup honey
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon chipotle chile powder
1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 pinch red pepper flakes
1 pinch cayenne pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil
6 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, pounded to 1/2-inch thickness

Directions:
Whisk together lime juice, vinegar, orange juice, wine, and honey in a bowl until the honey dissolves. Add salt, pepper, chipotle powder, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, chili powder, cinnamon, oregano, cumin, ginger, red pepper flakes, cayenne, and olive oil; whisk to mix. Place chicken breasts into a resealable plastic bag, pour in marinade, and coat well. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 days.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil grate.
Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade. Cook chicken on the preheated grill approximately 5 to 7 minutes per side, or until the juices run clear and there are no signs of pink in the meat.
