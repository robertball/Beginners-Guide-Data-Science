Ingredients:
For the Stir-Fry
1 lb boneless skinless chicken thigh (skinless boneless breast substitution ok)
6 tablespoons cornstarch
1 large onion, diced
1 cup frozen peas and carrot
cooking oil
hot steamed rice
For the Sauce
1/4 cup oyster sauce
1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
1 teaspoon rice wine or sake

Directions:
1 Note: This recipe calls for boneless thigh meat, which is preferred, but I tried using breast meat and the result was fine also.
2 Mix together sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
3 Cut chicken into a small dice, about 1/4-inch.
4 Heat 1-2 cups peanut or other cooking oil in your wok.
5 Place cornstarch in a small bowl and begin to dust chicken pieces, shaking off excess.
6 Fry in hot oil in small batches until crispy and golden, about 2-3 minutes; drain.
7 Remove oil from wok and discard.
8 Heat 1 tbsp oil in wok and stir-fry onion about 1 minute; add peas and carrots and cook another 30 seconds.
9 Add sauce mixture to wok along with chicken pieces and stir to coat everything evenly.
10 Serve at once with hot steamed rice.

For Shae, who discovered this on a Chinese buffet. I had found this on a buffet also. It is a great little dish, with a little bite of pepper that is quite addictive!
