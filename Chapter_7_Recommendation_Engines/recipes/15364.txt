Ingredients:
4 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/2 cup skim milk, heated
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 pound lean ground turkey
1/4 pound lean ground beef
1 onion, chopped
2 carrots, sliced
1 cup low fat, low sodium beef broth
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 cup frozen green peas, thawed
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place potatoes in a pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Boil for 20 minutes, or until tender. Drain off water, then mash potatoes with hot milk and olive oil until fluffy. Set aside.
In a nonstick skillet, brown the turkey and ground beef. Add onion and saute for 5 minutes. Add carrot and saute an additional 5 minutes.
Drain off any excess fat. Add beef broth to meat mixture and bring to a boil.
In a small bowl whisk together cornstarch and water. Add cornstarch mixture and tomato paste to meat mixture. Simmer until thickened, stirring frequently. Add peas, salt, and pepper. Stir well, then spoon mixture into a 2 quart casserole dish. Top with potatoes, then sprinkle with cheese.
Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes or until potatoes are browned.
