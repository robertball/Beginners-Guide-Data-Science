Too Much Chocolate Cake Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package dark chocolate or fudge cake mix
1 (5.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix
1 cup sour cream
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
3/4 cup brewed strong coffee  (you will not taste coffee in the cake, it just deepens the chocolate flavor of the other ingredients)
1 cup semisweet mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 330 degrees F.
In a large bowl, mix together the cake and pudding mixes, sour cream, oil, beaten eggs and coffee.  Stir in the chocolate chips and pour batter into a well greased 12 cup bundt pan. (Batter will be very thick)
Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until top is springy to the touch. It will still look moist, and a tooth pick inserted to check for doneness will not be accurate. Do not over bake. Cool cake thoroughly in pan for about an hour before inverting onto a plate.  If desired, dust the cake with powdered sugar and drizzle with additional melted chocolate chips.

Description: 
Start with a box of chocolate cake mix and add a few ingredients like sour cream and chocolate chips to make a moist, intensely-flavored chocolate cake. Rich and fudgy, almost like a brownie, but still a cake.Modified from: Too Much Chocolate Cake
