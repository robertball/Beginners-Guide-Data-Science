Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
warm water as needed
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup shortening (such as Crisco®)
1 1/2 tablespoons shortening (such as Crisco®)
1/2 cup butter, melted
5 egg yolks
1 egg
2 teaspoons vanilla-butternut flavoring
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon salt
8 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups warm milk
6 egg whites
8 cups chopped pecans
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water in a bowl according to package instructions. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
While yeast softens, combine sugar, 1/2 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons shortening, butter, egg yolks, egg, vanilla-butternut flavoring, nutmeg, and salt in a mixing bowl. Beat using an electric mixer until creamy and thoroughly combined.
Combine flour, milk, and yeast mixture in a separate bowl; mix into egg mixture until well combined and a dough forms. Set aside to rise in a warm area until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Knead risen dough down gently; cut into 4 equal pieces. Set the pieces aside and let rise for an additional 20 minutes.
While rolls rise, beat egg whites using an electric mixer in a mixing bowl until stiff. Add pecans, sugar, honey, and vanilla extract; beat to combine.
Roll out each piece of dough using a lightly floured rolling pin on a lightly floured work surface, to approximately 13x18-inch rectangles, 1/4-inch thick.
Spread pecan mixture approximately 1/4-inch thick onto the dough. Roll up dough, beginning from the side. Place rolls 2 1/2-inches apart on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 45 minutes.
