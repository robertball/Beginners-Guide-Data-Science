Eton Mess Recipe

Ingredients:
Meringues:
4 Egg Whites
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
2/3 cup Splenda Sugar Blend
2 pint whipping cream
2lb hulled and chopped strawberries (or use canned unsweetened strawberries)
Optional: 6 tablespoons Kirsch
Optional: 4 oz dark chocolate for decoration

Directions:
First make the meringues (or buy 12 pre-made nests...)
Heat over to 250 deg F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Beat egg whites, cream of tartar and vanilla at high speed until foamy.
Add the Splenda I tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff peaks form and the Spenda dissolves.
Spoon heaped tablespoons onto baking sheets.
Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, turn oven off (if meringues begin to brown reduce oven temperature to 225 degrees). Let meringues stand in oven with door closed and oven light on for 8 hours or overnight. (If keeping for later store in airtight container)
Next day or when meringues are ready, break them into rough chunks.
If using canned strawberries drain them very well. Reserve some for decoration.
Whip the cream until it forms stiff peaks.
Mix the meringue, cream, strawberries - and Kirsch if using - together roughly. It needs to look a mess! You get great streaks of red running through it.
Decorate with reserved strawberries.
Optional: Grate some dark chocolate on the top too.
Serve immediately

Description: 
A Yummy Dessert Concoction with Meringue, Cream, Strawberries and/or Raspberries! Easy and always a winner! I'm not much of a dessert eater since I enjoy a low carb diet but making this with Splenda makes it kind of acceptable!!! Adding Kirsch turns this into an adult dessert.
