https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes
1/2 cup pomegranate juice
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup cold butter, cut into tablespoon-sized pieces

Directions:
Wrap the sweet potatoes with plastic wrap, and place into the microwave. Cook on High until the sweet potatoes are tender, about 4 minutes, depending on the microwave. Unwrap the potatoes, and refrigerate until cool enough to handle.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a small baking dish.
Bring the pomegranate juice, water, vinegar, sugar, and cinnamon to a simmer in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut into large cubes; place into the prepared baking dish, and dot with the cubed butter. Pour the pomegranate sauce evenly overtop.
Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes until the pomegranate sauce has thickened into a glaze. Gently stir the potatoes occasionally as they bake to coat them in the glaze.

Description: 
I don't like sweet potatoes, but this is good tasting and almost good for you.  I love the convenience of plastic wrapped sweet potatoes that cook in the microwave for 4 minutes.  Baking your own would work too.
