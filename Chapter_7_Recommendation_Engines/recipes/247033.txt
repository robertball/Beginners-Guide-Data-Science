Ingredients:
1 cup diced SPAM® Less Sodium
6 tablespoons brown sugar
3 cups Belgian waffle mix (just add egg and oil variety)
2 large eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup maple syrup (optional)

Directions:
Preheat a broiler for high heat. Line a baking sheet with parchment.
Heat a saucepan over medium heat; add diced SPAM(R) Less Sodium and brown sugar, stirring to coat; cook until brown sugar is melted, about 2 minutes. Turn brown sugar-coated SPAM(R) Less Sodium onto prepared baking sheet.
Broil under the preheated broiler until deep golden brown, about 15 minutes, stirring often to avoid scorching.
Let candied SPAM(R) Less Sodium cool.
Preheat and lightly grease waffle iron.
Whisk Belgian waffle mix, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth; stir cooled candied SPAM(R) Less Sodium into batter. Pour about 2/3 cup batter onto the waffle iron.
Cook waffles until golden-brown, about 3 minutes, or follow your waffle iron manufacturers cooking instructions. Repeat until all batter is gone. Top with maple syrup and enjoy!
