Ingredients:
1 pkg of baby back ribs- 1-3 lbs  cut slabs to fit pot
favorite tomato sauce- 1 lg jar (or homemade)
onion-small cut in rings
cabbage leaves ( 1/2 half of small head)
1 lb seashell pasta noodles cooked al dente
top with shredded parmesan cheese if desires

Directions:
Salt and pepper the ribs and place in slow cooker or dutch oven. (cut into slabs if necessary).  Pour the sauce over the ribs (reserving about 1/4 cup).  Place the onion in the pot on top of the ribs and around the sides. Take the cabbage and pull off into leaves.  Place the leaves over the ribs.  Drizzle the remaining sauce over the cabbage.  Cook in crockpot on low for 6-7 hours .  If baking in the oven you can slow cook them at low heat 300 degrees for approx 3 hours or until tender. Serve the cabbage and ribs over the seashell noodles with lots of sauce. Long slow cooking will give you fall off the bone tenderness!!
