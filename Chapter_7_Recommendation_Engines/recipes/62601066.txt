Ingredients:
1 pkg smoked sausage or kielbasa sliced and quartered
1 can diced tomatoes (I use the italian seasoned ones)
1 pkt of taco seasoning, mild, low sodium
1/4 cup peach preserves
Rice (serve over rice, optional)

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook the smoked sausage/kielbasa, and drain and return to heat.
Add tomatoes, taco seasoning, and peach preserves and cook until peach preserves "melts" and blends in. You may want to cook longer to blend the flavors (about 10 minutes).
Serve over rice.
