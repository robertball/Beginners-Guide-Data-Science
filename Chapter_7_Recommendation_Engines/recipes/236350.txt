Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) box BarillaÂ® Campanelle
1 pound pork spareribs
4 cloves garlic, minced, divided
1 sprig fresh rosemary
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1/2 cup dry white wine
3 cups thinly sliced cabbage
1 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Marinate pork ribs overnight with 3 of the minced garlic cloves, rosemary, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and black pepper, to taste.
Place ribs in a shallow roasting pan, cover with aluminum foil, and bake in a 425 degrees F oven for 20 minutes; remove from oven, add wine, and bake uncovered for an additional 15 minutes.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook Campanelle according to package directions.
Meanwhile, saute in a medium skillet the remaining garlic in 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat for 2 minutes, or until garlic turns slightly golden in color. Add cabbage, chicken broth, salt, and pepper to taste; simmer until the cabbage is tender and thoroughly cooked.
Remove meat from the ribs and add to the sauce; simmer for 5 minutes. Drain Campanelle and toss with the sauce.
Stir in butter and cheese and toss before serving.
