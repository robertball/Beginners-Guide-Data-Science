Ingredients:
salt
pepper
garlic pwder
onion pwdr
2 cloves garlic minced
seasoned flour
2-4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
4 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup lemon juice
8 oz mushrooms
1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
4 tablespoons capers, drained
4 lemon wedges optional

Directions:
Season chicken with spices on all sides and coat with seasoned flour, shake off excess. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Shake excess flour from chicken, then brown in hot oil until both sides are golden-brown, and the inside has turned white and firm, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
Remove the chicken, and set aside in a warm place. Pour white wine into the skillet and allow to boil as you dissolve the cooked bits from the bottom of the pan.Add mushrooms and garlic,saute for a few minutes. Add the lemon juice, and allow to come to a boil, cook for a few minutes until reduced by half.
Sprinkle the cubed butter into the boiling sauce. Swirl and shake the pan vigorously to dissolve the butter, thus thickening the sauce. The butter must never come to rest, or the sauce will separate and become oily. Once the butter has completely incorporated, remove from heat and stir in capers.
To serve, pour lemon-caper sauce over the chicken, and serve with a wedge of lemon.
