Ingredients:
3 cups finely chopped onion
12 cups coarsley chopped tomato
3 6oz. cans tomato paste
3 tbs. dried oregano
3 tbs finely chopped fresh basil (1 tsp. dried)
3 bay leaves
6 tsp sugar
3 tbs. salt (*I use less)
Fresh ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
First of all, I add a whole clove of fresh, finely chopped garlic to saute with the onion.  I also added a small dash each of onion and garlic powders (no 'salt' garlic/onion powder),
Saute onion (with garlic if desired) in 3-4 tbs EVOO over med. heat 7-8 minutes till onion translucent but not brown.
Add tomatoes, paste, and all fresh herbs and spices, bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to low, simmer one hour. I cook it much longer to get a thicker consistency.
**I use much less salt than required...if you too realize that this much salt is too overpowering for you, add a TINY bit of baking soda to cut the salty flavor. Use too much and it will make it worse.  I added much more sugar to mine last time to cut the salty taste.
Should boil off about 3 c. water from tomatoes.
This recipe is a tripled version of the 3 cup yield original recipe.  I had to triple it due to my huge leftover of fresh tomatoes that were going to go bad at the end of summer.

Description: 
This is a First Generation Italian recipe that my husband's aunt received from a true-blue Italian family she once was neighbors with.  I spruce it up a little using a dash of this, a dash of that; see below. Makes a superb sauce!
