Description: 
I got this recipe from a coworker from Mexico. Since I live in the southwest, I make this recipe year round at work, but it is demanded in summer! My customers and anyone else who tries this loves it! You can add small shrimp to make this a main course or serve as a light lunch or appetizer. Keeps refrigerated for 1 week.
