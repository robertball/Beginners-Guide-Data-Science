Ingredients:
2 cups water
8 russet potatoes, scrubbed

Directions:
Pour water into the bottom of a pressure cooker (such as Presto(R)). Place a trivet into the pressure cooker and turn the heat on high.
Place potatoes in a single layer in the pressure cooker and lock the lid. Cook over high heat until the pressure regulator reaches 15 psi, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Allow pressure to drop naturally, 10 minutes. Unlock and remove lid.
