Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) can crabmeat, drained and flaked
1 (5 ounce) can tuna, drained and flaked
4 cups cubed French bread
8 ounces Muenster cheese, cubed
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
4 eggs
3 cups milk
3 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons mustard powder
1 teaspoon grated onion

Directions:
In a small bowl, stir together the crabmeat and tuna. Place a layer of bread cubes in the bottom of a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish. Cover with a layer of the crab and tuna, then a layer of cheese and a sprinkle of parsley. Repeat layers 2 more times ending with cheese and parsley on top.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, butter, mustard powder and onion. Pour over the layers in the dish. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or overnight.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Let the dish come to room temperature while the oven preheats.
Bake uncovered for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until puffed and golden.

Description: 
My dad used to make this recipe when I was a child. It was the only way I would eat seafood. Now that I've become a seafood lover, I really enjoy this one even more!  Good for special occasions since it has to be chilled overnight.
