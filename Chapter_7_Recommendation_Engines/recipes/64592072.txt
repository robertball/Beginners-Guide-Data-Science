Ingredients:
1 T-bone steak
1/2 tbsp kosher salt
1 tbsp clarified butter
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp sriracha

Directions:
The day before you cook your steak, remove from package and pat down with a paper towel. Sprinkle 1/2 of the amount of kosher salt to use on both sides and set in the fridge uncovered overnight. This will pull out any excess moisture.
The next day, about 20 minutes before cooking your steak, remove from fridge and pat down again with another paper towel. This next step is an optional step, but I did it anyway. Take a fork and poke small holes in both sides of the steak, then beat slightly with a meat tenderizer mallet.  Take your garlic powder and mix with your melted clarified butter.Add a pinch of salt to the butter. After doing so divide the butter evenly into two small bowls. Take a brush and generously brush both sides from only one of the bowls.  Sprinkle the rest of the salt on both sides of steaks, and add pepper and paprika.Brush sriracha evenly on both sides.
Take a skillet and turn to medium high heat. Cook steak for 6 minutes on first side and flip.  Take your unused garlic butter and spoon over the top of the steak and cook another six minutes. Remove from heat and let rest for 5 minutes.
The result was one of the most tender, flavorful steaks I've had in a while. So tender I could tear it apart with a fork!
