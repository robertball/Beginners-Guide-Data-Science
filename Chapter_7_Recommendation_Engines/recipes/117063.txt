Ingredients:
2 large sweet red peppers
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 cup sliced celery
1/4 cup chopped, pared apple
1 garlic clove, minced
3/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 cup uncooked couscous
1 teaspoon olive oil
2 tablespoons golden raisins
1 tablespoon pine nuts, toasted
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley

Directions:
Cut tops off peppers and remove seeds. In a large kettle, cook peppers in boiling water for 3-5 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain and rinse in cold water; set aside.
In a nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, saute the onion, mushrooms, celery, apple and garlic for 4-5 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Remove from the heat and set aside.
In a saucepan, combine the broth, salt, cumin, pepper and turmeric if desired. Bring to a boil; stir in couscous and oil. Remove from the heat; cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Stir in the vegetable mixture, raisins, pine nuts and parsley. Spoon into peppers.
Place in an 8-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes or until heated through.
