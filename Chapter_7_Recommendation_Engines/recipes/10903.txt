Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
In a small bowl, combine 4 tablespoons white sugar and 2 tablespoons cinnamon for topping.  Set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt.  Mix with wire whisk and set aside.
In a large bowl, beat together both sugars on medium speed.  Add butter and mix to form a grainy paste.  Add eggs and vanilla, mix at medium speed until fluffy.  Add the flour mixture a little at a time on low to medium speed just until combined.
Shape dough into 1 inch balls and roll each ball into the cinnamon-sugar mixture.  Place on ungreased cookie sheet, about 2 inches apart.  Bake about 13-18 minutes until lightly golden.  Place immediately on a flat surface to cool.
