Ingredients:
1 package Duncan Hines® Red Velvet Premium Cake Mix
1 1/4 cups water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 large eggs
1 (6 ounce) package milk chocolate chips
1 (8 ounce) container frozen non-dairy whipped topping, thawed
1 (16 ounce) container Duncan Hines® Creamy Home-Style Cream Cheese Frosting
Chocolate shavings

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare, bake and cool cake according to package directions for two 8-inch round baking pans.
For chocolate hearts garnish, pour melted chocolate chips into heart shaped molds or spread melted chocolate in 1/8-inch thickness on waxed paper lined baking sheet. Cut shapes with heart cookie cutter when chocolate begins to set, and loses its shine. Refrigerate until firm. Push heart shapes out and set aside.
To assemble torte, split each layer in half. Place one split layer on serving plate. Spread one-third of whipped topping on one layer. Repeat with remaining layers making sure to place bottoms of each layer together. Leave top plain.
Frost sides and top of cake with frosting. Garnish with chocolate hearts and shavings, if desired. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
