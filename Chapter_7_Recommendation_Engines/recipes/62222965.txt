Description: 
This recipe was brought over on the Mayflower with my family in 1620 and has been altered many times to catch up with today, but this one was the most interesting recipe from my Great Aunt Mary around 1880.  I just thought it would be fun to see how they baked way back when.  These are a soft cake-like cookie, really great for dunking.
