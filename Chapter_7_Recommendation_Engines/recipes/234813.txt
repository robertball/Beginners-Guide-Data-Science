Ingredients:
Nonstick cooking spray
2 (11 ounce) packages Ghirardelli Classic White Chips
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
3/4 cup Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips, divided

Directions:
Line an 8x8x2-inch pan with foil, extending foil over the edges of the pan. Coat foil with nonstick cooking spray.
In a large saucepan, combine Ghirardelli Classic White Chips and sweetened condensed milk. Heat and stir over very low heat until melted and smooth. Watch carefully to avoid scorching. Quickly pour half of the mixture into the prepared pan. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of the Ghirardelli(R) 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips. Top with the remaining mixture of chips and condensed milk. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup bittersweet chips. Let stand for 1 minute to allow the chips to soften. Gently swirl the mixtures together with a knife.
Cover and let stand at room temperature for 2 hours or until firm. When fudge is firm, use foil to lift it out of the pan. Cut into 1-inch pieces.
Enjoy immediately, store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.
