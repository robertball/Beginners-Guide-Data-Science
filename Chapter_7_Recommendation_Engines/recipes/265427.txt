Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 cups cake flour, divided
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups white sugar
1 cup butter, at room temperature
4 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray.
Mix 2 3/4 cups flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl; set aside.
Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract and beat until fluffy.
Add the flour mixture to the bowl and beat until well combined. Dredge blueberries in remaining 1/4 cup flour. Fold blueberries into the batter. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.
