Ingredients:
1/2 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese, for garnish
1/2 cup crumbled bacon bits, for garnish
sprinkle of parsley
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup half-and-half
4 cups milk: whole, reduced fat (2%), or low fat (1%)
2 chicken bouillon cubes, dissolved in 1/2 cup hot milk
2 tablespoon all-purpose flour
8 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 medium carrots, diced about the same size as the onion
1 small onion, diced
1/2 stick butter

Directions:
In a 4-quart saucepan, melt the butter and saute the onion and carrots until slightly tender, about 5 minutes.  Whisk in the flour and cook about 1 minute.  Add the potatoes, milk, and dissolved bouillon cubes.  Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes, until the potatoes are very soft and some of them have begun to dissolve into mush.  Add the half-and-half, parsley, salt, and pepper.
Serve soup sprinkled with bacon bits and grated cheddar cheese.
