Ingredients:
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tomatoes, peeled, cored, seeded, and cut into 1/4-inch dice
1 (1 ounce) package Hidden Valley® Original Ranch® Salad Dressing & Seasoning Mix
1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 cups shredded white farmhouse Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup dry white wine

Directions:
In a heavy, 4-quart saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Add the tomatoes and saute, stirring frequently, until the tomatoes just begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the package of Hidden Valley(R) Original Ranch(R) Salad Dressing & Seasoning Mix and stir gently to dissolve the seasoning mix.
While the tomatoes are cooking, combine the flour and cheese in a bowl and toss to coat the cheese.
Add the wine to the tomato mixture, stir once, and then add the cheese, a handful at a time. Heat and stir until the cheese is completely melted. Transfer to a fondue pot set over an alcohol or sterno flame to keep it warm. Serve immediately.
