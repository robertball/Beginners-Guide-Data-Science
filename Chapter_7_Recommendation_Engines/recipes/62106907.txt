6 small bell peppers, any colors
1 14 oz can of tomato paste
3 cups of water

Combine all the first set of ingredients together and you have your rice mixture to stuff the vegetables.
Now, Arabs use a utensil to remove the insides of the squash, potato, or eggplant.  You must make sure the opening of the these vegetables are small.  Once you have removed the insides where the walls of the vegetables are thin to the touch, you can stuff the vegetables.
Make sure you do not pack the rice mixture so as to cook properly.  If you do decide to pack it, fill it only 3/4 of the way.
Place it in a pot, layered, then add the water until covering the vegetables as well as the tomato paste.  Add 1 teaspoon of chicken bouillon (maggi) and cook for 30 minutes, covered.
