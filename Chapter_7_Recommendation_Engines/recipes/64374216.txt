Ingredients:
2 Betty Crocker Sugar cookie mixes
16 ounces softened cream cheese
2 cups sugar
1 to 2 cups whipped cream or cool whip
2 or 3 lbs. strawberries washed and sliced
Strawberry glaze - you can buy it in jars, box mixes or make it using cornstarch
Whipped Cream for topping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.
Prepare the cookie mixes with the butter and egg as the directions on the bags say to. Spread in a Texas sheet cake pan (like 10x15 I think) to make the crust. Bake at 375 for about 15 minutes or until golden brown.
Mix softened cream cheese and sugar with hand mixer until well blended. Then fold in the whipped cream or cool whip. When cookie crust is done and slightly cooled spread the cream cheese mixture over the crust.
Then mix strawberries with glaze of your choice (or even just mix strawberries with sugar and let sit overnight in fridge and they would work) and pour the mixture over the top and chill for about four hours or more.
Serve with whipped cream on top!
