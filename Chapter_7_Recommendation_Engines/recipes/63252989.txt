Ingredients:
Topping:
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
1/3 cup old fashioned oats
1/2 cup all purpose flour
3 Tbsp softened butter
1/4 tsp cinnamon
Filling:
3 Tbsp softened butter
1/2 cup light brown sugar
3 tsp cinnamon
5 tsp water
Muffin:
1/2 cup butter, melted
3/4 cup milk
2 large eggs
1 3/4 cups all purpose flour
1/2 cup old fashioned oats
2 Tbsp cornstarch
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 tbsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 cup white chocolate chips
Glaze (*optional):
1 cup powdered sugar
1 Tbsp softened butter
2 Tbsp milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400Â°
Line muffin tin with cupcake liners, or spray with cooking spray.
Topping:
Mix all ingredients together with a fork until crumbly. Set aside.
Filling:
Mix all ingredients together until consistency is similar to a loose frosting or pudding. Set aside.
Muffins:
In a large bowl whisk together butter, milk and eggs. In another bowl combine flour, oats, cornstarch, sugar, baking powder, salt, nutmeg and white chips.
Pour the dry ingredients into the wet and stir until just combined.
Using half the batter, fill each muffin tin with 2 Tbsp batter. Then drop 2 tsp of filling into each tin. Finish, by dropping another 2 Tbsp of batter on top. Depending on the size of the muffin tin, you may get more than 12 muffins.
Now sprinkle your topping evenly on the muffins (about 1 tbsp on each).
Bake 20-25 minutes until centers are set.
Cool on wire rack.
Glaze:
Combine butter, sugar and milk, stirring until there are no lumps, adding more powdered sugar or milk until desired consistency is reached. Drizzle on muffins when ready to serve.
