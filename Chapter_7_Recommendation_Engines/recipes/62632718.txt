Ingredients:
A touch of oil (I use E.V. Olive Oil)
A small chunk of Ginger Root
Half a Medium Yellow/White Onion - Chopped or diced
Half a kg of Ground Beef
1/3 cup Oyster Sauce

Directions:
- Heat up a pot or sautee pan at med. and put in a touch of oil (just enough so the onion doesn't burn).
- Toss in ginger root and onion to soften onion.
- Add ground beef until completely cooked.
- Turn off heat and mix in oyster sauce to your taste.
- Take out the chunk of ginger (unless you want to eat it or see who gets it)
- Go eat!
