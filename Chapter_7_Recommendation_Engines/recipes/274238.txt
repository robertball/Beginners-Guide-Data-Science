Ingredients:
1/3 cup flaxseed meal
1/3 cup water
1 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon coconut oil
2 eggs
1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1/3 cup brewers' yeast
1 tablespoon Himalayan pink salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 cups steel-cut oats
1 1/2 cups miniature semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix flaxseed meal and water together in a bowl; let sit for 3 to 5 minutes.
Beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, and coconut oil into the flaxseed mixture using an electric mixer until a dough forms. Add eggs and mix well. Pour in vanilla extract and mix to combine. Beat in brewer's yeast, pink salt, and baking soda. Add in flour a little at a time on low speed. Stir in oats, chocolate chips, and cranberries.
Scoop cookies onto a baking sheet, flattening a little so they are not balls.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and golden, about 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool 10 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
This is a delish cookie recipe I have perfected to make soft but firm cookies. These are made for lactating mommies, however my whole family enjoys these cookies. If you don't need them for lactation you can remove the brewer's yeast.

 The ingredients which help boost milk supply for breast feeding are the coconut oil, oats, brewer's yeast, and flax meal, so do not skip those. Store in an airtight cookie jar. Dough can be frozen.
