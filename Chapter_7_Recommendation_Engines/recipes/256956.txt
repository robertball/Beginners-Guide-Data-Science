1 1/2 cups water
1/2 cup white chocolate chips
1/2 cup blueberries, fresh or frozen
1/2 cup raspberries, fresh or frozen
1/2 cup strawberries, fresh or frozen
1/2 cup water
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
4 tablespoons Hungry Jack® Original Syrup

Directions:
Whisk together 2 cups of the pancake & waffle mix along with 1 1/2 cups of water, according to the package's instructions. Stir in the white chocolate chips.
Heat a greased pan or grilled to medium heat, when hot pour about 1/3 cup of batter for each pancake. Flip and repeat until the remaining batter is gone.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, water and sugar. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about 10 minutes.
Stack pancakes and serve with syrup, berry sauce, sliced fruit, and additional white chocolate chips, if desired.
