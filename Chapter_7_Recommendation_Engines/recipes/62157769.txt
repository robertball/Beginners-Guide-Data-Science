Ingredients:
1 1/2 - 2 lbs green beans (frozen or fresh)
3/4 c. apple vinegar
1 cup of raw onion
6 - 8 pieces of bacon
3/4 c. brown sugar
1/4 tsp. liquid smoke
1 tsp. peanut or polyunsaturated oil
1/2 tsp. black pepper

Directions:
Pre-cook the green beans, adding a bit of water. Use the microwave to 'speed cook' the dish.
Using a large wok or other large pan add oil and cook onion. Remove and discard the oil and set aside the onion.
Cook the bacon, remove to paper towel, thoroughly dry, reserve 4 - 5 tablespoons of oil.
Cut the bacon into bite sized bits.
Add onion, brown sugar, vinegar and liquid smoke and insure that the mix bubbles and the brown sugar is well cooked.
Next add the green beans to the wok or large skillet. Once the mixture is nicely combined and warm move it to the microwavable casserole and set aside. Add black pepper at the last minute as desired.
Allow the dish to warm. Serve immediately if possible or warm gently in the microwave.
Serve immediately.
