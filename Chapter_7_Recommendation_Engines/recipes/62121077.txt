Ingredients:
2 cups of buttermilk
3 Tbsp of oil
1 1/4 cup of sugar
3 eggs
1 tsp of baking soda
1/2 tsp of salt
1/2-1 tsp of cinnamon
1 cup of raisins
4 cups of flour

Directions:
Mix all of the above ingredients.(The batter will be very stiff)
Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees.
Deep fry till golden brown.
(I usually heat them 5 minutes, flip them over, and cook another 2 1/2 minutes.)
Poke with a fork to make sure they are fully cooked.
Drain on a paper towel.
While warm, coat with either white sugar, or powdered sugar.
Taste best warm.Leftovers, (if there are any), and can be microwaved briefly!
