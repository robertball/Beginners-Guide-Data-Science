Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1  onion, chopped
2  jalapeno peppers, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
3 (15.25 ounce) cans whole kernel corn, drained
2 cups chicken broth
1  skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into small cubes
1  lime, cut into wedges (optional)
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
¼ cup sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion, jalapeno peppers, and garlic in the hot oil until the onion is tender, 5 to 7 minutes; season with cumin and cayenne pepper. Add corn, chicken broth, and diced chicken.
Bring the soup to a boil. Reduce heat to low, place a cover on the saucepan, and cook at a simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and let soup cool.
Pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return pureed soup to the saucepan.
Place saucepan over low heat; warm soup, stirring occasionally, until hot, about 5 minutes. Garnish servings with lime wedges, cilantro, and sour cream.
