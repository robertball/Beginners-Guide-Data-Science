Ingredients:
4 large Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced
1/2 cup butter, melted
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup quick cooking oats
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon allspice

Directions:
Spread the apples evenly in an 8 inch square glass baking dish. A deep dish glass pie plate will also work. In a medium bowl, mix together the melted butter, brown sugar, oats, flour, cinnamon and allspice. Sprinkle this topping evenly over the apples.
Cook on full power in the microwave for 10 to 12 minutes, until apples can easily be pierced with a knife. Enjoy!

Description: 
I don't usually like 'baking' with the microwave, but this recipe works great. The topping comes out crispy on top, moist inside, and delicious all around. It's a wonderful dessert that's quick and easy to make. Best served warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped topping.
