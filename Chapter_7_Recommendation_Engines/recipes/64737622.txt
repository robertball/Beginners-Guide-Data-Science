Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2-3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 tablespoon capers with some juice
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 small jalapeno (seeded and finely chopped)
1/2 small habenero (seeded and finely chopped)

Season scallops with kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper, then dredge in flour to coat all sides
Melt unsalted butter in skillet over medium heat and add scallops. Cook approximately 2 minutes per side.
Add pesto, capers and finely chopped jalapeno/habenero ; mix will.
Stir in heavy cream and bring to a soft boil to mix then remove from heat and serve.
* note use both peppers if you like extra heat if not...all good...we understand.

Description: 
Scallops are one of my favorite dishes to make. This dish is a tweak from a recipe that I lost members name.  So hope you enjoy if you like heat added to you dishes. I add both peppers because I love the heat added. Please just adjust to the heat index you can take.  serve with some wild rice and chopped cherry tomatoes...As always create on my friends!
