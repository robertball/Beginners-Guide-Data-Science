Ingredients:
4 large baking potatoes
2 tablespoons butter, melted
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup real bacon bits
1 green onion, chopped

Directions:
Scrub potatoes. With a sharp knife, slice potatoes thinly but not all the way through, leaving slices attached at the bottom. Place on a microwave-safe plate; drizzle with butter.
Combine the Parmesan cheese, rosemary, salt and pepper; sprinkle over potatoes and between slices.
Microwave, uncovered, on high for 12-18 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Top with cheddar cheese, bacon and onion. Microwave for 1-2 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.

Description: 
Fancy enough for company, these baked potatoes look like you fussed but are really simple to fix. Our home economists sliced each one into a fan, covering them with cheese, bacon and savory seasonings. (For a quick how-to on creating potato fans, turn to page 50.)
