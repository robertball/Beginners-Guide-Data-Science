2 pounds red seedless grapes
1 (16 ounce) package peeled, baby carrots
1 medium red onion, cut into wedges

1 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).  Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Toss together the grapes, carrots, and red onion in olive oil to coat.  Sprinkle with cumin and toss to evenly distribute.  Spread mixture on baking sheet.
Roast in preheated oven until carrots have begun to soften, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is an Indian dish I had while visiting a French family in the Luberon Valley. So I guess it's a French-Indian side dish. I love it and make it all the time.
