Ingredients:
1 pie shell
Filling
2 cups heavy cream
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg

Directions:
1. Make pie crust, pierce bottom with fork, and refrigerate until firm. Preheat oven to 425°.
2. Make the filling: Whisk the heavy whipping cream, sugar, flour and vanilla in a bowl. Pour into the chilled crust, dot with the butter and sprinkle the nutmeg on top. Carefully transfer the pie plate to a hot baking sheet and bake 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350° and continue baking until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbly in spots, about 55 more minutes (the center will still jiggle slightly). Cover the edges with foil if they are browning too quickly.

Description: 
The first recipes for cream pie appeared in the 1800’s in the Indiana Amish communities. Like the Vinegar pies and buttermilk pies, the cream pie is thought to have been created as solution to empty apple bins and could be made with household ingredients every farm would have had on hand.
Cream Pie can also go by the name of Sugar Cream Pie, Hoosier Sugar Cream Pie, Indiana Cream Pie (it became the state pie in 2009), Sugar Pie, and Finger Pie (some recipes called for stirring the filling in the crust with a finger).
