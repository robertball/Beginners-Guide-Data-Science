Ingredients:
3 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - Cooked and cubed (or pulled apart)
2 cups sliced carrots
1 1/2 cup frozen green peas
1 1/4 cup sliced celery
1 cup butter
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon celery seed
3 3/4 cups chicken broth
2 cups half and half
4 (9 inch)unbaked pie crusts (or make your own)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
In a large saucepan over medium heat, cook onions in butter until soft and translucent.
Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed.
Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick.
Add chicken, carrots, peas and celery.
Cook for 5 more minutes.
Remove from heat and pour into pie crust(s).  Cover with top crust and seal edges as if making a pie. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
