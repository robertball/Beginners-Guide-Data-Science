Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground thyme
1 pinch ground cumin
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped
2 eggs, or as needed
2 (14.75 ounce) cans salmon, drained and flaked
1 cup water
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Mix flour, parsley, baking powder, salt, thyme, and cumin together in a large bowl. Add chopped onion and jalapeno pepper; mix again. Add eggs and salmon; mash salmon and mix until combined. Add water and stir into a very thick batter.
Heat 1/4 inch oil in a frying pan just below the medium heat setting. Scoop up 1 tablespoon batter per fritter; drop carefully into the hot oil in batches of 3. Fry until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a dish lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining batter for about 16 fritters in total.

Description: 
Adapted from fried Caribbean accras, which are made from salted cod. A recipe that my dad used to make on the occasional Sunday. I didn't have salted cod, so I substituted canned sockeye salmon and it turned out awesome.
