1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup butter, softened

1 1/4 cups white sugar
1 egg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, shortening, and sugar until smooth. Beat in egg and vanilla. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients. Roll rounded teaspoonfuls of dough into balls, and place onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden. Let stand on cookie sheet two minutes before removing to cool on wire racks.

Description: 
These quick and simple sugar cookies bake into little bites of sweetness with crispy edges and chewy centers.  By substituting half the amount of butter for vegetable shortening, these cookies become very cost effective to make.  Be creative and try rolling them in colored or spiced sugars for an added special touch.Modified from: Easy Sugar Cookies
