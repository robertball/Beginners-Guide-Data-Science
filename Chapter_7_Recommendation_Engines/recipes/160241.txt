Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1 pound ground pork
1 tablespoon cooking oil
1 carrot, minced
1/2 red bell pepper, minced
1/2 onion, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/3 cup thawed frozen chopped spinach
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup wheat germ (optional)
2 eggs, room temperature
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon ketchup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Set the ground turkey and ground pork out at room temperature to warm slightly.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the carrot, bell pepper, onion, garlic, and spinach in the heated oil until soft; set aside to cool.
Mix together the turkey, pork, bread crumbs, wheat germ, eggs, 2 tablespoons ketchup, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add the vegetable mixture and continue to mix until evenly combined; shape into a loaf; lay on the prepared baking sheet.
Whisk together the honey and 1 tablespoon ketchup in a small bowl; spread over the meatloaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 60 to 70 minutes; remove to a serving platter and allow to rest 5 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
This soft-textured meatloaf is speckled with vegetables. My kids and I love the flavor of this dish. There's always enough for sandwiches the next day and crumbled into spaghetti sauce the day after that.
