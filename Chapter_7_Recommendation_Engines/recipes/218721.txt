Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
5 very ripe bananas, mashed
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/2 cup milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup white sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup unsalted butter, cubed
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large loaf pan.
Mash together the brown sugar and 1/2 cup of softened butter until smooth and creamy in a large bowl; beat in the eggs. In a bowl, combine the mashed bananas with lemon juice, and add them to the butter-sugar mixture. Beat in the milk and vanilla extract until smooth.
In a bowl, whisk together 2 1/2 cups of flour, baking soda, salt, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Mix the flour mixture into the banana mixture in 2 or 3 increments, beating well after each addition. Scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Mix together the white sugar, 1/3 cup of flour, 1/4 cup of unsalted butter, and 1 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon with a fork until the mixture is crumbly. Spoon the crumble mixture over the loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until the bread is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Description: 
It will cool and then be gone, so be prepared to double the recipe or make more.  This is by far the best banana bread I have ever had. The banana bread is better if the bananas are extra ripe!
