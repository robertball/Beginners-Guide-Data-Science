Ingredients:
3/4 pound ground beef chuck
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2/3 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
1 (14 ounce) pre-baked pizza crust
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup chopped onions
1/2 cup dill pickle slices
1 cup shredded lettuce (optional)
1 cup diced tomatoes (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, salt, and pepper in the hot skillet until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Mix ketchup and mustard in a bowl; spread mixture over pizza crust. Spread mozzarella cheese and Cheddar cheese over ketchup mixture and top with beef and onions. Transfer pizza to a large baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 20 minutes. Top with pickles and allow pizza to cool for 5 minutes. Top with shredded lettuce and tomatoes before slicing and serving.
