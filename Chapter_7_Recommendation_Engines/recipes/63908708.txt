Fall off the bone Ribs Recipe

Ingredients:
Whisky bbq sauce:
1 cup water
3/4 cup light corn syrup
1/2 cup tomato paste
2/3 cup vinegar
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 tbsp molasses
1 1/4tsp liquid smoke
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
1/4 tsp ground mustard
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/8 tsp paprika
Dash cayenne
1 oz whisky (I use Johnny Walker Black Label)
Ribs:
3-4 lemons

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan over high heat and whisk until smooth. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered 90-120 minutes. The sauce will thicken a little and reduce about half. This recipe is good for for 2-3 racks of ribs.
Ribs: While sauce is simmering, prepare a large pot of boiling water, large enough to hold all the ribs all at once.
Prepare your ribs, by cutting them in sections; I cut them in half. Squeeze juice of the lemons into boiling water. The water should have a gentle boil. Add ribs for one hour.
Preheat oven to 250c, when ribs and sauce are almost complete.
Place ribs and sauce in an oven pan with cover. I usually use a roasting pan and cover with aluminum foil. Coat the ribs in sauce and place in oven for 2-2 1/2 hrs, basting every half hour.
To make them sticky:
After cooking, throw them on the bbq, over medium heat and coat with more sauce. Grill for 5-10 minutes.
