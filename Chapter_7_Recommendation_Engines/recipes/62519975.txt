Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar (or use Xylitol for sugar-free)
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 jumbo egg
1 tbsp milk
1 medium lemon's finely grated lemon zest (yellow part only!)
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
2 tsp lemon extract
1/4 cup poppy seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350ยบ. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Wisk together butter and sugar (or Xylitol) until very creamy.
Beat in egg, milk, lemon peel and extracts.
Add flour and poppy seeds; mix well. The mixture will look crumbly, but it will take shape.
Divide in two and shape into two dense rolls about 1,5 inches in diameter; wrap each in plastic wrap.  Roll a couple of times to improve the round shape.
Refrigerate for 3 hours or until firm.  Unwrap.
On a cutting board, with a serrated knife, diagonally cut rolls into roughly 1/3-inch-thick slices.
Arrange biscotti on a baking sheet and bake at 350ยบ for 7-10 minutes on each side or until the color turns bright golden.  Watch your biscotti -- the distance between bright golden and burnt is a short one. ^_^
Cool on baking sheet for 1-2 minutes.  Remove to wire racks to cool completely.
