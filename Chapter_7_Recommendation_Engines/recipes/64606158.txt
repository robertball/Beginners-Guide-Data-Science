Ingredients:
1 Tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 pint cherry tomatoes
2 cups water
1/2 cup white wine
1/4 tsp thyme
1/4 tsp fennel seeds
2 Tbsp butter
1 1/2 pounds tilapia filet
1/2  tsp salt

Directions:
Heat the oil in a  deep cast iron skillet over medium high. Add the garlic, cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, water, wine, thyme and fennel seeds and bring to a boil. Continue boiling 15 minutes, until broth colors and becomes slightly thickened. Reduce heat to simmer. Swirl in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until melted.
Season the fish with salt and place in the skillet; spoon some liquid over the fish and gently simmer until fish is cooked through, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Crazy water is a translation from the Italian name for this very flavorful broth that is based on water. (It's crazy that water can taste this good, and that such a tasty broth can be this easy!) You can certainly poach other kinds of fish in crazy water: try cod, arctic char, bass, and catfish, for example.
