Ingredients:
½ cup tofu
3 tablespoons soy sauce, divided, or to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
½  onion, finely chopped
1  carrot, peeled and finely chopped
2 ½ cups cooked rice, or to taste
3  eggs
1  tomato, chopped
1 teaspoon white sugar
salt to taste
ground white pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine tofu and 2 tablespoons soy sauce in a bowl and marinate while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions and carrot; cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add tofu and marinade and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in rice and cook for 3 minutes while stirring.
Move all ingredients to one half of the skillet and crack eggs into the empty half. Cook for 2 minutes until eggs start to set. Mix eggs and the rest of the ingredients until well combined. Season with remaining soy sauce and sugar; mix well.
Stir tomato into the skillet; cook and mix for 1 minute. Season with salt, white pepper, and more soy sauce if desired.

Description: 
I make this fried rice recipe with tofu all the time, as we always seem to have leftover cooked rice. You can add other vegetables or leftover cooked chicken as well. Make sure you have all your ingredients prepared by the time you start cooking!
