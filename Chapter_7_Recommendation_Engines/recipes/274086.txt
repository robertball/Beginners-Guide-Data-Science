Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (12 ounce) sirloin steak, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 cup beer (preferably lager)
2 (15 ounce) cans kidney beans, rinsed and drained

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute ground beef and sirloin steak with onion and garlic in the hot skillet until beef is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes.
Sprinkle flour, chili powder, cumin, paprika, and oregano over meat mixture and cook for 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, and beer; bring to a fast simmer.
Reduce heat to low and cook for 15 to 20 minutes. Add kidney beans and continue to simmer until beans are heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.
