Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup cold butter or shortening
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
3/4 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
1 egg, lightly beaten
4 tablespoons melted butter, divided

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In another bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water; add to crumb mixture. Add milk; mix well. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Divide dough into four equal portions. On a lightly floured surface, roll one portion into a 12-in. circle. Brush with 1 tablespoon melted butter; cut into 12 pie-shaped wedges. Roll up, beginning with the wide end, and place on greased baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks.

Description: 
This dinner roll, slightly sweet and so very flaky, was my mother's recipe. It's a simple recipe to prepare, requiring no kneading skills, and the dough is easy to handle. My grandchildren have renamed them 'Grandma's Croissants'!
