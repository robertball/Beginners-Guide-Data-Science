Place bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat, and cook until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.
Bring the water to a boil in a pot. Boil the peas 1 minute, until just tender, and drain. Cool peas under cold running water.

Description: 
This easy salad came about in an attempt to satisfy my son who loves peas and my husband who doesn't. It has become a huge hit. You may want to double the recipe if you want any leftovers!
