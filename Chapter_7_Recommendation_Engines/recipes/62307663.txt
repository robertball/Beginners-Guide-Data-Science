Ingredients:
1/2 cup oil
2 ½ cups flour
2 tsp. baking powder
½ cup sugar
1 egg
1 1/4 cups milk
cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg to taste (optional)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients except oil in bowl; mix well.
Heat oil in frying pan on low heat.
Drop batter a tablespoonful at a time into hot oil (maandazis will get bigger as they cook).  You can put in a lot of spoonfuls at once depending on the size of your pan, but make sure the "glops" of batter don't touch each other in the oil.
Fry the maandazis on both sides until golden brown.  You may need to add more oil if it starts to run low.
Poke maandazis with knife or toothpick to check that the inside is no longer goopy, before removing with slotted spoon and placing on paper towels to absorb some of the oil as they cool.

Description: 
These Kenyan treats (pronounced mun-DAH-zeez) are a little like drop scones or donuts (though not as sweet).  Our next door neighbor in Nairobi shared this recipe with us.
