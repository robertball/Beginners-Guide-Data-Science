1/2 cup SMUCKER'S® Sweet Orange Marmalade
1/2 cup Dickinson's® Tomato Ketchup

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine marmalade, soy sauce, ketchup and water. Add chicken pieces and cover. Refrigerate for three to four hours, or overnight, turning chicken pieces occasionally.
Remove chicken and place in a single layer, skin side up, in a baking pan. Brush with marinade.
Bake, uncovered, in a 375 degrees F oven 45 to 50 minutes, or until chicken is tender. Brush with marinade several times during cooking, to within 15 minutes of removing from oven. Discard remaining marinade.
