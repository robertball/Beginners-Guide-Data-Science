Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
1/4 cup crushed garlic-herb croutons
2 eggs
2 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon hot sauce
1/2 (8 ounce) package block Cheddar cheese
10 slices deli ham

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine ground beef, onion, croutons, eggs, garlic, Italian seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce in a bowl until well blended. Scoop half of the meat mixture into a 9x12-inch baking dish and flatten.
Cut cheese widthwise into 10 rectangles. Wrap each piece of cheese with ham. Layer the ham and cheese rolls side by side on top of the beef mixture. Place remaining beef mixture on top and press down.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatloaf is cooked through, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
