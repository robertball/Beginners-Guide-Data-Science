Ingredients:
3 eggs, beaten well
3 cups brown sugar
2 tablespoons anise seed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 tablespoons hot water
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
Beat eggs and brown sugar together in a large bowl until smooth. Stir anise seed and salt into the egg mixture.
Dissolve baking soda in hot water; stir into the egg mixture. Add flour and mix into a dough. Form into 36 small balls.
Spread white sugar into a wide, shallow dish. Roll the cookie dough balls in the sugar to coat. Arrange onto prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart.
Bake in preheated oven until edges are crispy, about 10 minutes.
