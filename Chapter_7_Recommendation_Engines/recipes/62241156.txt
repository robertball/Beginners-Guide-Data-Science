Ingredients:
4 small potatoes
2-3 small carrots
2 medium beets
3 small dill pickles
3 scallions, white parts included
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 Tbsp Champagne or Balsamic vinegar
Salt to taste

Directions:
Boil potatoes, carrots and beets with skin on until just tender or until the vegetables are easily pierced with a knife. Boil beets in a separate pot.  Drain, cool and remove the skins. Dice and put in a large bowl. Dice pickles, add to the bowl. Drizzle oil and vinegar over the mixture. Add chopped scallions. Add salt to taste (sometimes pickles provide all the salt needed). Mix and chill. Beets will color everything red. If you like other vegetables to retain color you need to put beets aside and put some dressing on them separately. Then carefully fold them in with the rest of the salad.
