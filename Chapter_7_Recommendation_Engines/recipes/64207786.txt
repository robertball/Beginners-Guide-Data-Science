Ingredients:
1 (4-lb) boneless chuck roast
1 Tbsp olive oil
3 Tbsp barbecue seasoning, (such as Grill Mates Smokehouse Maple)
½ cup beef broth
1 tsp liquid hickory smoke
2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
2 cups your favorite barbecue sauce
8-10 Kaiser rolls

Directions:
Spray the inside of a 6 quart oval slow cooker with cooking spray.
In a small bowl, stir together the beef broth and liquid smoke. Pour into the bottom of the slow cooker.
Rinse the chuck roast and pat dry with a paper towel. Drizzle with 1 Tbsp of olive oil.
Rub the chuck roast on all sides with 3 Tbsp of barbecue seasoning. Center the roast in the slow cooker.
Drizzle the top of the roast with 2 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce.
Cook on low for 7-8 hours until fork tender. Check for doneness at 7 hours using a fork.
Remove from the slow cooker and using 2 forks, pull apart the meat, removing all visible fat.
Discard the cooking liquid reserving ½ cup.
Whisk the reserved cooking liquid with 2 cups of your favorite barbecue sauce.
Return the pulled beef to the slow cooker. Drizzle with the sauce.
Cook on high for 30 minutes until the sauce is bubbly. Serve on Kaiser rolls with a side of cole slaw.
