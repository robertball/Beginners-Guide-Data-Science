Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups water
4 cups fresh cranberries
2 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup orange juice
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 cups frozen whipped topping (such as Cool WhipÂ®), thawed

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat and add cranberries and sugar. Reduce heat and let simmer until berries pop open, about 15 minutes. Pour into a colander set over a freezer-proof bowl. Mash or press out cranberry juices and discard skins, unless you want to use them for something else.
Stir orange juice and lemon juice into the cranberry juice. Freeze until mushy, about 1 hour.
Stir in whipped topping and mix well. Freeze, stirring occasionally, for 24 hours.
