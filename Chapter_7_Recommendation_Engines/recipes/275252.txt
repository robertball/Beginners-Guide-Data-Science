Ingredients:
4 ounces fresh blueberries
3 ounces red currants
3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint, divided
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, divided
1 tablespoon fresh marjoram, stems removed
1 habanero pepper, seeded and minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons agave syrup
2 limes, divided
1/2 cup cashews
8 ounces halloumi cheese, cut into 8 slices

Directions:
Place blueberries and red currants into a mixing bowl. Add 2 tablespoons mint, 2 tablespoons cilantro, marjoram, habanero, olive oil, agave syrup, and juice of 1 lime. Mix and set aside.
Heat a nonstick griddle over medium-high heat. Cook cashews until browned, stirring often to keep from burning, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer cashews to a plate and set aside. Reduce heat to medium and brown halloumi cheese slices, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Place halloumi cheese onto a plate, top with berry salsa mixture and remaining 1 tablespoon mint and cilantro. Chop cashews and spread on top of halloumi. Garnish with lime wedges from remaining lime. Serve immediately.
