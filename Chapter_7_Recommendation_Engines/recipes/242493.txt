Ingredients:
1 cup UNCLE BEN'SÂ® Basmati Rice - cooks in 10 minutes
2 cups vegetable stock
1 small sweet onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
3 tablespoons butter, divided
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup chopped fresh asparagus
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt 2 tablespoon butter in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until softened and turning translucent, about 1 minute. Add garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in the rice, asparagus, and stock. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low.
Stir occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Continue cooking until the rice is tender, about 10 minutes.
Turn off the heat and gently stir in the Parmesan cheese and remaining butter. Serve immediately.
