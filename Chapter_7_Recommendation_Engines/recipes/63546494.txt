Ingredients:
2 cups minus 2 tablespoons cake flour
1 2/3 cups bread flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt
2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter
1 1/4 cups light brown sugar
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla
1 1/4 pounds chocolate chips
1 bag sea salt caramels
1/2 cup cream
Sea salt for sprinkling

Directions:
Whisk together the flours, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
Using a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars together until very fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low, add dry ingredients, and mix until just combined. Drop in chocolate and mix to combine. Refridgerate overnight if you have time.
Preheat the oven to 325.
Unwrap all caramels and cut into small pieces. Place cream in a microwaveable bowl and heat until warm. Place caramels in the bowl and mix until melted, microwaving for 10 seconds at a time if necessary. be VERY careful not to burn the caramel.
Press half of the cookie dough into a greased 9x13 pan. Pour caramel on top, trying to leave a 1/2 inch perimeter around the outside of the pan. Press the rest of the cookie dough on top, covering all of the caramel.
Bake for 30 minutes at 325, or until golden brown. Refridgerate for 30 minutes afterwards to set the caramel, then serve.
