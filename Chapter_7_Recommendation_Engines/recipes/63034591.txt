Ingredients:
1 pound orecchiette pasta
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 bunch broccoli rabe, stems removed, leaves chopped
1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes (not packed in oil), or 1 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes (about 12 pieces), sliced
1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, rinsed
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
Ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add pasta and cook until al dente according to package directions. Reserve a cup of the pasta cooking water and drain pasta thoroughly. Meanwhile, if using sun-dried tomatoes not packed in oil, soak tomatoes in 1 cup boiling water 10 minutes. Drain and slice. ??
In a large sauté pan over high heat, heat olive oil. Add garlic and cook until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Add half the broccoli rabe and sauté until lightly wilted but not brown, about 2 minutes. Add remaining broccoli rabe to pan and cook for another minute or two. Add sun-dried tomatoes, cannellini beans, salt and pepper and toss lightly.
Add hot drained pasta to the pan (or to a larger bowl if needed) and toss with the vegetables. Stir and add a few tablespoons of reserved pasta cooking water if mixture seems dry. Serve immediately with Parmesan cheese.
