Ingredients:
1 butternut squash, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 medium potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 carrot, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon pepper seasoning
1 teaspoon salt, divided
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon Caribbean seasoning

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine butternut squash, potatoes, carrot, 1/4 cup olive oil, lemon pepper seasoning, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl; toss to combine. Transfer vegetables to a baking sheet.
Toss chicken breasts in the same bowl with 1 tablespoon olive oil, remaining salt, and Caribbean seasoning until coated. Add to baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center, juices run clear, and vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
