Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 boneless chicken breasts, boiled & chopped
8 oz. cream cheese, softened
5 oz. Frank's hot sauce
12 oz. Marie's Chunky Blue Cheese dressing
1/2 c. shredded cheddar cheese
Dip is best served with Frito's Scoops and/or celery sticks.

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl.  Make sure to blend it very well.  It works well if you wear gloves and squeeze it all together as it shreds the chicken and makes it much smoother.  Place in a 9 x 9 baking dish.  If you like, sprinkle a little more cheddar cheese on top.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until bubbly.
