Ingredients:
3 small or 2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and diced (about 3 cups)
1 pound ground turkey
1 yellow bell pepper
1 cup onion, diced
½ cup mozzarella, shredded
½ cup water
¼ cup cilantro, chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil
1.5 tablespoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon garlic, minced
1 teaspoon chili powder
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon pepper
1 can (15oz) black beans, drained (optional)
Lime juice (optional)

Directions:
In a large cast iron skillet (need a lid later in recipe), heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute and then add ground turkey. Use a wooden spoon to break apart meat and continue cooking approximately 8 minutes until browned.
Add cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper. Stir well to incorporate.
Add onion and bell pepper, and cook for 3-4 minutes.
Add diced sweet potato and water. Stir and cover with a lid for approximately 6-8 minutes until the sweet potatoes soften. Add additional water during this process if needed to keep the meat from drying out.
Remove lid and add additional salt and pepper if needed.  Optional - Add drained black beans and stir in to heat through. Top with shredded mozzarella and allow it to melt. Remove skillet from heat and garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.  Can also serve with additional chili powder, hot sauce, or lime juice.

Description: 
Easy and healthy.  This is the original recipe, but I thought it needed some more salt and chili powder.  I also add a little lime juice to it at the end.
