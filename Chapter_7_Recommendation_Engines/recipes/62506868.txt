Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil or butter
1 large onion, chopped
2 stalks celery with leaves, chopped
1 large carrot, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups chicken or vegetable stock
1 large can organic green lentils, rinsed and drained
1-2 tbsp curry powder, more to taste, depending on the quality, really.
1 tsp coriander
1/2 tsp cumin
1 bay leaf
juice of half a lime
salt and pepper
(water, if too thick)

Directions:
In a stock-pot, saute onions, celery and carrots over low-medium heat, in oil or butter, about 7 minutes, seasoning with salt and pepper.  Add diced garlic and saute for a minute longer.
Add chicken stock, and bring to a simmer.  Add lentils, curry powder, coriander, cumin, and the bay leaf.  Simmer for 20 minutes, covered, over low heat.  Add the lime juice, and check for seasoning, adding salt, pepper, and added curry if necessary. Remove the bay leaf and enjoy!

This is warm, slightly spicy, and perfect for a cool day!  So full of flavor, it seems like it must take hours, and pages of ingredients to make, but is quite simple.
