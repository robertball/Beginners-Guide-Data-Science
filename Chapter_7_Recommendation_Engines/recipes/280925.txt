Ingredients:
2-tier 6 1/2- inch bamboo steamer basket with lid

4 stalk (blank)s large broccoli florets, stems removed
1 large carrot
16 eaches fresh green beans
2 leaves napa cabbage

Description: 
Fresh, al dente vegetables steamed in your Instant Pot® using Chinese bamboo baskets. Cooking time is minimal, making one wonder why all the fuss to use a pressure cooker instead of traditional steamer basket. I have found that this method creates a crisp but tender vegetable with minimal mess and much safer than an open steamer set-up. This recipe uses a two-tier, 6.5-inch basket with lid, in a 6-quart pot.
