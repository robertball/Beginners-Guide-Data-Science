Ingredients:
1/4 medium onion(s), yellow chopped
2 1/2 teaspoon oil, olive, extra-virgin divided
1/2 stalk(s) celery small, cut into small dice
1 clove(s) garlic minced
1/2 cup(s) lentils, green (lentilles de Puy) or brown lentils, rinsed
1 teaspoon thyme, fresh chopped, or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 1/4 cup(s) broth, chicken, less sodium
1 teaspoon vinegar, sherry
2 fillet(s) fish, sea bass, fillets (4 ounces each), with skin
salt to taste
pepper, black ground to taste
1 tablespoon parsley, fresh chopped

Directions:
Warm 2 teaspoons of oil in large Dutch oven or heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and celery; cook until softened, about 8 minutes, stirring. Add garlic, lentils, and thyme; stir 1 minute. Add broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, 30 minutes, until lentils are tender. Stir in water to desired consistency, if needed. Stir in vinegar.
For fish:
Preheat oven to 450F. Using tweezers, remove any bones from fish. Pat fillets dry with paper towel; season with salt and pepper.
Warm 3 teaspoons of oil in large heavy ovenproof skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking. Add fillets, skin-side down. Sear for 3 minutes, until golden brown. Flip, place in oven, and roast uncovered for 8 minutes, until just cooked through.
Ladle lentils into shallow serving bowls. Place fillet atop lentils; garnish with parsley.
