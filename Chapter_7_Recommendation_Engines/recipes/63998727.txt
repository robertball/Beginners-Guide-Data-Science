Ingredients:
4 cups full fat coconut milk, divided (note 1)
1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin
1/3 cup raw honey
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup seasonal berries

Directions:
Sprinkle gelatin evenly over part of the coconut milk (1 cup) in a medium sauce pan, and allow to sit until the gelatin is soft (about 10 minutes).
Heat over medium heat stirring constantly until the gelatin is completely dissolved and the milk begins to steam.
Remove from heat and stir in the rest of the coconut milk (3 cups), honey, and vanilla. Allow to cool for 10 minutes.
Pour into 6 serving glass serving dishes and refrigerate until set (about 5 hours). Top with seasonal berries just before serving.
