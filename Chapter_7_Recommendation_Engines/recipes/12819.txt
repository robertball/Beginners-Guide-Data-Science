Description: 
This recipe is a staple in Mexico.  Raw seafood is cooked by the lime juice!  Now don't wrinkle your nose!  You would never know the seafood was not cooked prior to serving.  Make sure to always use the freshest ingredients! You may substitute many types of seafood for scallops, for example: halibut, red snapper, flounder, or swordfish.
