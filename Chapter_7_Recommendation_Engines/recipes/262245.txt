Description: 
Greek yogurt that's homemade so that you control everything - the thickness, the tartness, and the added sugar! The longer the yogurt cultures develop, the more tangy the yogurt will be. The longer the yogurt is strained, the thicker it will be. Strain overnight for a cream cheese consistency. Add fruit or fruit compote, etc.
