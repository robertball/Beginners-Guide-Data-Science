Ingredients:
6 cups cabbage, shredded
1 carrot, shredded
1/2 cup bean sprouts
1 celery stalk, diced
2 tablespoons onion, minced
1 (4 ounce) can shrimp, drained
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
pepper to taste
cornstarch
20 egg roll wrappers
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together cabbage, carrots, sprouts, celery, and onion.
Stir in shrimp, soy sauce, garlic powder, and pepper.
Sprinkle top with cornstarch, mix, and allow to sit 10 minutes.
Mix 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cold water. Set aside.
Place 2 or 3 tablespoons of the shrimp mixture into the center of an egg roll skin. Dip a spoon into the water and cornstarch mixture, and moisten all corners but the bottom corner. Fold the egg roll skin from the bottom over the mixture, making a tight tube of the shrimp mixture. Fold corners in from the sides, and press to stick against folded roll. Then roll the rest of the way. Repeat with remaining egg roll wrappers.
Pour vegetable oil into a deep frying pan to a depth of 3 or 4 inches, and heat oil to 350ยบ. Carefully place egg rolls into hot oil, and fry until golden brown.
Remove to paper towels.
