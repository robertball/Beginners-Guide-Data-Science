Ingredients:
1/2 cup biscuit/baking mix
1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
2 tablespoons 2% milk
1 cup cherry pie filling
1/4 cup orange juice

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the biscuit mix, sugar and orange peel. Stir in milk just until moistened; set aside.
In a small nonstick skillet, combine pie filling and orange juice; bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Drop biscuit mixture in two mounds onto boiling cherry mixture. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Uncover; simmer 5-7 minutes longer or until a toothpick inserted into a dumpling comes out clean.

Description: 
Once a week, my husband and I enjoy a candlelight dinner after our two children are fed and in bed, shares Kari Damon from Rushford, New York. This is a perfectly sized dessert for those special 'date nights.'  TIP: This cobbler also tastes wonderful with apple or blueberry pie filling instead of cherry.
