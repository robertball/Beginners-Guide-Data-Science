Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided
1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks in juice, drained, and patted dry
1 pound frozen, large shrimp, thawed, peeled and cleaned
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1/4 cup canned, diced mild green chilies
1 teaspoon soy sauce
3 cups hot cooked rice (optional)

Directions:
Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add half the oil and heat until smoking, about 10 seconds. Add the onion and stir-fry until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Add the pineapple and stir fry gently until pineapple browns lightly, about 1 minute. Remove pineapple to a bowl and set aside.
Add remaining oil to the pan. Add shrimp and stir-fry until opaque, about 1 minute. Add garlic and red pepper, if desired, and stir fry for 10 seconds.
Add the tomatoes, chilies, and reserved pineapple and stir fry until heated through, about
1 minute. Stir in soy sauce and serve over rice, if desired.

Description: 
Stir-fries are speedy, but this one-skillet meal is even faster because all of the vegetables come right out of your pantry. There's no chopping, no peeling, and very little cooking.  But the ease and convenience don't mean you're sacrificing flavor.  The combination of shrimp, canned tomatoes, peppers, and pineapple is sweet, tart, and dynamic.
