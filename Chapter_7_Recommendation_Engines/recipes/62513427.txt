Ingredients:
Salmon 			- 4 thick portions - about 1 1/2 to 2 lbs. before trimming
Crab meat		- 1 can chunk
Smoked Gouda cheese	- 4 slices
Sour Cream		- 1 8oz container
Fresh Dill		- 1 Tbs finely chopped
Capers			- 1 small jar
Butter			- 1/2 stick, melted
Juice of 2 Lemons (bottled lemon juice is fine)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Trim Salmon so portions have no thin edges.  Slice Salmon in half horizontally, leaving one edge attached.
Fold open the salmon and divide the crab meat equally inside the 4 portions.  Cover the crab with a slice of smoked gouda and fold the salmon closed.
Place each portion in an individual-sized baking dish (may all be cooked in one large Pyrex casserole but individual dishes may be served directly on a plate, thus keeping the salmon hot).
Mix melted butter with the juice of 1 lemon.  Pour the butter/lemon over each salmon portion.
Bake 30 minutes.
Mix sour cream with dill and juice of 2nd lemon.  Pour equal amounts of sour cream mixture over baked salmon, sprinkle liberally with capers and serve immediately.

After eating this at a restaurant in Blowing Rock, North Carolina, I was surprised that the chef was willing to give me the recipe.  My favorite way of preparing salmon.
