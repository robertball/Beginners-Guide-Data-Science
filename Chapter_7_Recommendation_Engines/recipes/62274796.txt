Ingredients:
2 boxes Chocolate instant jell-o pudding
2 cups skim milk
½ cup Amaretto
4 Bakers semi-sweet baking squares
1  8 ounce tub Cool Whip Fat Free thawed
¼ cup grated Coconut
1 Oreo pie crust

Directions:
In the microwave or sauce pan, melt semi sweet baking squares. Some of the semi sweet chocolate was not melted 100% and gave it a wonderful chunky texture.  I call them burst of chocolate!
Mix instant jell-o pudding and milk with blender.
Add thawed cool whip and blend.
Add melted semi sweet baking squares and blend. Pour in Amaretto and blend.
Pour mixture into Oreo pie crust.
Sprinkle with coconut and put in the freezer for a few hours.

Description: 
Cannot go wrong with Oreo’s and Coconut can be optional. I wrote serves 6 but that is only if you can keep them from having more than one piece - good luck!  The Amaretto gives it that what's in here” delicious taste.
