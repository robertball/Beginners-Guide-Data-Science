Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup cornmeal
1/2 cup white sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups chopped fresh strawberries
1 (8 ounce) container naturally flavored strawberry yogurt
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 egg, lightly beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 muffin cups or use paper liners.
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl gently toss strawberries in 1/2 cup of flour mixture.
Whisk yogurt, melted butter, and egg together. Stir the yogurt mixture into the flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Fold in strawberries. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until a tooth pick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
