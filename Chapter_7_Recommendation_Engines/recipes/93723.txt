Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast
1 tablespoon Filippo Berio Extra Virgin Olive Oil or Filippo Berio Olive Oil
3 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Coat a large bowl with oil; set aside. In a glass measuring cup, mix the water and the yeast to dissolve. Pour into another large bowl. Add the oil and 1 cup flour. Beat until smooth. Add 1 cup flour and the salt; beat until smooth. Add 1 cup flour. Stir until the mixture forms a clump.
Place the remaining 1/2 cup flour on a work surface. Push most of the flour to the side. With a dough scraper, lift the dough onto the surface. Sprinkle lightly with flour. With the scraper, fold the dough several times to get rid of surface stickiness. With your hands, knead for 5 to 6 minutes until the dough is resilient. Use additional flour only to prevent surface sticking. Some flour may remain. Place in the prepared bowl. Coat lightly with oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Set aside to rise for about 45 minutes, or until doubled in size.
Punch down the dough. Shape into a ball and transfer to a work surface. Let sit 5 minutes. Shape, add toppings, and bake according to recipe directions.
