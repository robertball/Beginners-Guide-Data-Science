Ingredients:
3 Tablespoons butter
1 1/2 Cups chopped onion
2 Carrots, unpeeled and chopped
3 Cloves garlic, minced
4-5 Pounds vine-ripened tomatoes, chopped
1 1/2 Teaspoons sugar
1 Tablespoon tomato paste
1/4 Cup packed, chopped fresh basil
3 Cups chicken or vegetable stock
1 Tablespoon salt - to taste
2 Teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
3/4 Cup heavy cream
Pinch of Cayenne pepper

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot.  Add onions and carrots and sautee until tender (about 10 minutes).  Add garlic and cook one minutes.  Add remaining ingredients except heavy cream and stir well.  Bring mixture to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, uncovered, 30-40 minutes until tomatoes are very tender.
Add the heavy cream to the soup and process in batches in a blender until smooth.  Add soup back to pot and reheat to serve.  Garnish with julienned basil leaves.
