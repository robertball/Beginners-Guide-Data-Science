Description: 
This is 2 a minute salad: 2 minutes to cook  2 minutes to eat. It doesn’t matter how much of it you cook, it will evaporate in the air at the same speed.
Apples and carrots is a match made in heaven, and, if the apple is sweet, you don’t even need a sugar in this salad. (or you may substitute with honey).

All in all a perfect breakfast-lunch-dinner-late night salad  if you are dieting or just hungry
