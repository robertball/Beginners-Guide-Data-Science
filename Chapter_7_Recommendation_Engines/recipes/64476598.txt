Ingredients:
1 Lb ground beef
1 Large sweet onion
3 Tbsp minced garlic
2 Tbsp of parsley
1 bag of frozen mixed vegetables
1 box of instant mashed potatoes
3 cans of tomato soup (About 31 oz. as the family size can is not enough)
1 lb of Colby or sharp cheddar cheese
Worcestershire sauce to taste (I usually splash generously twice around the pan)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees
Brown hamburger until no longer pink, add chopped onion and 1-2 tbsp of minced garlic, add about 2-3 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce (I've found i like a little bit more, if tomato soup darkens when added it seems to be perfect). After onion is translucent pour in bag of frozen mixed vegetables and tomato soup and cook on medium heat for about 10 minutes. While this is cooking make approx 10 servings of mashed potatoes, adding 1 heaping tbsp of minced garlic to boiling water and parsley when done. Potatoes should end up a little dry as they will absorb liquid when cooking in oven. Pour hamburger mixture into 9x13 cake pan, spread mashed potatoes on top (should end up with at least an even inch all over, adjust amount if needed), and top with 1 lb of sharp cheddar cheese. Cook in oven for about 1 hour or until top is slightly browned. Remove and let settle for about 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This is my version of the traditional beef shepherds pie. Leftovers reheat very well and it all disappears the next day.
