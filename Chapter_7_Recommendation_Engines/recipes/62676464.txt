Ingredients:
1 1/2 to 2 1/2 pounds pork shoulder roast
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon celery seed
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
1/4 cup ketchup
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup water
cider vinegar and Tabasco, to taste

Directions:
Brown roast in a small amount of fat; place in a large roasting or baking pan. Mix the next 9 ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Pour over roast and cover with foil. Bake in a preheated 325Â° oven, about 40 minutes to the pound, until done and very tender, basting occasionally with drippings.
Transfer pork roast to a cutting board. Remove meat from the bone and chop or shred the pork into small pieces. Season pork to taste with additional vinegar and hot sauce. Serve hot, on sandwich buns, with coleslaw, potato salad, and baked beans.
