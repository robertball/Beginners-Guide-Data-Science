Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs tilapia (use salmon for a stronger fish flavor)chopped into bite sized pieces
Marinade:
1 tbsp paprika
3 tbsp lime juice
1 tsp salt
2 tsp crushed garlic
1 tbsp cumin
1 tsp ground black pepper
2 onions, sliced and chopped in half
4 large bell peppers, halved and sliced (green is fine, I use green, red, and yellow for added color)
1 16 ounce can diced tomatoes, lightly drained
1 12-16 ounce can coconut milk
olive oil or butter for cooking
1 bunch cilantro chopped (optional)
Freshly cooked rice or tortillas

Directions:
Mix marinade and toss with cut fish pieces. Place in bowl or plastic zip baggie while marinating. This step can be done up to a day beforehand to allow flavor to soak. Marinade for at least 20 minutes, up to 24 hours.
In medium-large cooking pot, melt butter or heat oil on medium high heat.
Add sliced onions to pan and saute for 1-2 minutes. Turn heat down to medium.
Add sliced bell peppers on top of onions, then add fish pieces on top of bell peppers.
Pour lighty drained diced tomatoes on top of fish.
Pour coconut milk on top of tomatoes.
Cover with lid, simmer for 20-30 minutes until fish is cooked. Stir occasionally.
Add chopped cilantro during the last 5 minutes if desired.
Serve with hot rice or warm tortillas

Description: 
This super easy but hearty dish is full of flavor and absolutely delicious! It's a simplified version of a common Brazilian dish that I remember from my childhood and it's become a favorite even among my kids and I, even though we don't like fish! This can be made easily on the stovetop or the crockpot for a no fail convenience meal.
