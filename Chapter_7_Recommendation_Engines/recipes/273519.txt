Description: 
Heat is something you cannot take shortcuts with when it comes to tinga. Classic tinga is spicy and that is a fact. Where you can take shortcuts is in the cooking of the chicken. Let your multi-functional pressure cooker take the fuss out of things for you while you kick back and enjoy this classic! Garnish with sliced avocado, cilantro, and cotija cheese if desired.
