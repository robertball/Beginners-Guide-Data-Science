Ingredients:
Dough:
1/2 c. bread flour
1/4 t. salt
3 T. warm water
1/2 t. extra-virgin olive oil
Toppings:
1/2 c. basil leaves (stems removed)
1 clove garlic
2 T. fat-free chicken broth
1 T. parmesan cheese
1 t. olive oil
1/2 c. roma tomatoes diced
1/3 c. mozzarella/provolone cheese, shredded

Directions:
Preheat oven to 500 degrees.
Using 3 cup food processor, mix flour and salt.
Combine water and oil and pour into processor.
Process until a dough ball begins to form and then continue to process a few more seconds.
On a floured surface, use a rolling pin roll out into a 15x 5 inch rectangle (dusting with flour as needed)
Place dough onto silicone mat on cookie sheet.
To prepare pesto, place basil and garlic into processor and pulse until coarsly chopped.
Add broth, parmesan and oil (through chute if available).  Process until well blended.
Spread pesto( I tilt to omit liquid) over crust leaving small border around the edge.
Cover with diced tomato and cheese.
Place in oven for 10-12 minutes or until cheese melted and crust lightly browned.

Description: 
This is a tasty, healthy, quick dish that has a taste similar to Bruschetta.  Since the dough does not contain yeast, it is quick to prepare.  You can multiply the recipe to make several individual sized pizzas.  Pesto is only one of many topping options.  This makes it a wonderful option for families and it can be fun for kids to create their own.  I have also tried traditional toppings and BBQ chicken pizza as well.
