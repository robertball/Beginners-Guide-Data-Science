Ingredients:
1.5 lb of fresh green snap beans
1 clove of garlic (finely chopped)
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 drop of sesame oil for flavor (can be substituted with Olive oil if you do not like sesame oil)
1/4 tsp crushed red peppers (optional)
1/2 tsp black pepper

Directions:
Snap off the ends of the beans and wash thoroughly.  Let drain.  In a large skillet spray with non stick spray and add your garlic and butter OR oil.  Let that sit for about a minute on low heat so garlic flavor can blend with the butter OR oil.  Add your beans, soy sauce, pepper and red peppers (if you want a little spice).  Increase heat to medium and mix well.  Cover and let cook for about 15 minutes or until desired tenderness.
