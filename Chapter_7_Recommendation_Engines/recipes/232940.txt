Ingredients:
4 cups water
1/2 pound Chinese long beans, cut into halves
1 chayote squash, cut into small wedges
1 (1 inch) piece ginger, peeled and sliced thick
1 green onions, chopped
2 frozen thick ahi tuna steaks, thawed
2 heads bok choy, chopped
1 tomato, chopped

Directions:
Put water in a pot; add long beans, chayote, ginger, and green onion. Bring the water to a boil, place a lid on the pot, and reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking until the vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes.
Gently drop tuna steaks into the water; add bok choy and tomato. Return cover to pot, reduce heat to low, and cook until the tuna is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove pot from heat; cool 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This fish soup is SO SIMPLE, DELICIOUS, and amazingly HEALTHY for you! You can make it with things you probably already have in your fridge and is great served with a cup of rice! Try it with frozen albacore tuna too! Feel free to use any vegetables you want, as well as other types of thick steak fish such as albacore tuna. I buy my frozen fish for soups at Trader Joe's which are both affordable and very fresh!
