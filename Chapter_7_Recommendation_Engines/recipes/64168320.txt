Apple Fritters Recipe

Ingredients:
Vegetable oil for deep frying
2 cups Original Bisquick® mix
½ cup cold water
1 egg
¼ cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1½ cups peeled and chopped apple (I used Golden Delicious)
Cinnamon Sugar Coating:
¾ cup sugar
1½ tsp cinnamon
Glaze Coating:
3 cups powdered sugar
3-4 Tbsp milk

Directions:
In deep fryer or 4-quart heavy saucepan, heat oil to 350°F.
While oil heats, prepare the fritters. In large bowl, combine the Bisquick mix, water, egg, granulated sugar and cinnamon. Fold in apple.
Working in batches, drop batter by tablespoonfuls into hot oil. I used my cookie scoop for the batter. I also found it easiest to cook no more than 6 at a time.Cook 2 to 3 minutes, turning occasionally, or until golden brown.
Use a metal slotted spoon to remove fritters from oil; drain on paper towels for a minute.
If using the cinnamon sugar coating, roll in the combined mixture now. And enjoy the fritters while still warm.
If using the glaze coating, you need to let the fritters cool. You don't want the glaze to melt right off. Once cooled, roll in the glaze and place the glazed fritters on a cooling rack with a cookie sheet of piece of wax paper place underneath to catch any glaze that may drip off. Allow the glaze to harden and enjoy.
