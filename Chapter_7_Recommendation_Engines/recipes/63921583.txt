Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 cup water
2 tablespoons grape jelly
1 cup mayonnaise
1 tsp vanilla
2 cups heavy cream
2/3 cup hot chocolate mix (or 1/3 cup Dutch Cocoa powder and 1 Tablespoon “Sweet Cream” coffee creamer)

Directions:
Place a metal or glass bowl in the freezer for 30 minutes while making cupcakes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 15 muffin cups or line with paper baking cups.
In a large bowl, stir together the white sugar, flour, cocoa, and baking soda. Make a well in the center, and pour in the water, grape jelly, mayonnaise, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Mix just until blended. Spoon the batter into the prepared cups, dividing evenly.
Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pan set over a wire rack. Frost when cool.
To make frosting, in the ice-cold bowl, whip the heavy cream for 1-2 minutes. Add the chocolate mix (and cream if desired) and continue whipping until frosting is of desired consistency.
Top cupcakes with chocolate whipped cream frosting.
