Description: 
This recipe was passed on to me by a hospice patient's wife. It is absolutely fabulous, and not for the faint of heart. Great as a dip or as a sauce for enchildas and other mexican dishes. Feel free to mix and match the peppers, depending on your heat tolerance/preference. I guarantee your friends and family will love it!  This will keep in fridge up to 1 month, if it lasts that long!
