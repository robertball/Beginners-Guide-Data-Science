Ingredients:
1 lbs mushrooms sliced ( I use baby bella’s )
14oz artichoke hearts - frozen or canned
4oz pancetta
2 Tbs capers (rinsed and drained)
4 garlic cloves minced
2 chicken breasts butterflied if needed, and pounded thin
3-4 tbs flour for dredging the chicken
salt and pepper to taste
2 tbs avocado/grapeseed oil for frying the chicken + 2 tbs for sauteing the mushrooms
1Lb angel hair pasta
For the lemon butter sauce:
1/4 cup lemon juice
4tbs white wine
1cup heavy cream
1cup chicken broth
1 tsp corn starch
3 tbs butter
salt and pepper

Directions:
Heat a pan on the stove top, and add the pancetta - cook until browned and crisp.
To the same pan, add the mushrooms, and 1 tbs of oil if needed. Season with salt and black pepper, and saute until mushrooms are fully cooked - about 8-10 minutes.
Slice the artichoke hearts into quarters and add to the pan with the mushrooms.
Add the capers and garlic, and cook for a few more minutes.
Butterfly the chicken breasts if they are quite thick, or simply pound them to flatten to 1/4 inch thickness. (I like to put the chicken in a zip lock, one piece at a time, and completely seal it, before I flatten it with a meat mallet). Cut the flattened chicken into smaller pieces, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and dredge in flour lightly.
In another pan, heat the remaining 2 tbs of oil, and fry the chicken pieces, approximately 3 minutes per side. Add cooked chicken to the mushrooms and artichokes.
Boil 4qts of water and 1tsp salt for the angel hair. Follow the cooking instructions on the box.
Make the sauce by heating the lemon juice and white wine, in a sauce pan, and boil until reduced by a third.
Add cream and cook until slightly thickened. Mix 1 tsp corn starch with a bit of chicken broth, to remove lumps, and add to the pan, with the remaining chicken broth. Cook until sauce thickens.
Add butter to the sauce slowly incorporating it, by whisking. Taste and adjust the salt and pepper. If too sour, add more chicken broth and corn starch.
RECIPE NOTES
1. You can make this with marinated artichokes with the same great result. If you do, make sure you add less lemon - only a splash, so you don't end up with quite sour sauce.
2. The sauce in this recipe is a little less than 2 cups. If you like your meal saucier, double the amounts.
