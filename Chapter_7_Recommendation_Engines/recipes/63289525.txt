Ingredients:
8 small flour tortillas
Vegetable (or canola) oil

Directions:
Pour 1/4"-1/2" of oil in a heavy 10" frying pan.
Bring oil to around 360 degrees F over a medium-high heat.  This will take around 8 minutes, depending on your pan, stove, and oil depth.
While the oil heats, cut the tortillas into 8 triangles.
When the oil is at the right temperature, gently add the triangles.  Do not overcrowd the pan.
Flip the triangles frequently with a slotted spoon, until they are an even golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.
Remove triangles with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper-towel lined plate to drain.  Place in a warm oven while frying the next batch.

Description: 
We first had these while on vacation in the Caribbean.  After returning, I had to figure out how to make them.  We now prefer these to store bought corn tortilla chips.
