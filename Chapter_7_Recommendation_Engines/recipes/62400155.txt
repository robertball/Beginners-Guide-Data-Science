Ingredients:
3 deciliters flour
5 deciliters milk
1/2 deciliter sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
butter for the pan
a slab of bacon, diced

Directions:
Sift the flour, sugar and salt together, then mix in half of the milk until it's smooth. Then mix in the rest of the milk and beat in the eggs. Allow the batter to rest for 1/2 hour before cooking.
In the meantime, your bacon should be chopped, so heat a small skillet over medium heat and brown the bacon until you have crunchy bacon bits. You don't need extra fat, since the bacon will render much of its own.
After the batter is finished resting, heat an 8" skillet over medium heat and spread a thin layer of batter over the bottom (see the picture above). You can tilt the pan to help spread it around evenly. The pancake should pretty much fill the skillet and be about the thickness of a crepe. As the first side cooks, sprinkle some of the bacon bits over the top of the still-raw side. When the cake becomes solid, which doesn't take very long, flip it over and cook until done on the other side. Transfer to a plate while you finish up with the rest.
Serve with sugar, which should be sprinkled over the pannekaker. Fold into fourths and enjoy.

Description: 
Sprinkled with sugar and folded in fourths, they're eaten for dinner, with little else beside. You don't need much else, as these are pretty filling.
