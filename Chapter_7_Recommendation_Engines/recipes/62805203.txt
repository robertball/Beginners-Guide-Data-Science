Ingredients:
1 1/2 lb. boneless pork butt or shoulder ( with marbling)
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
2 T vegetable oil
1-2 Bay leaves
1 tsp. coarse gr. black pepper
1/2 tsp. salt, or to taste
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 jar pimentos, sliced
1 pkg. frozen sweet peas
1/2 tsp. white sugar, to taste
1 cup chicken stock
2 T Patis (fish sauce), (optional)*

Directions:
Cut pork into bite size pieces. Add 2T veg. oil to a skillet over medium high heat. Add pork and stir, about 3 to 4 minutes. Next, add the onions and garlic. Stir together until the pork is brown and onions translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes. Can drain some or all of the pork fat, if desired.
When pork is brown add chicken stock, tomato paste, bay leaves, salt and blk. pepper. Stir until incorporated. Bring to a boil, cover pot with lid, then simmer on low, about 45 to 55 minutes, until pork is soft and tender. Stir often. Tomato sauce will eventually thicken up (can add more chicken stock, if desired).
Add frozen peas, stir to incorporate. Add 1/2 tsp. sugar, to taste, and one jar pimentos last, simmer for 5 minutes. Add salt and black pepper, if needed.  Remove bay leaves right before serving. Best served over white rice.
