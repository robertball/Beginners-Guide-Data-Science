Ingredients:
1 pound bacon, cooked and crumbled
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
24 cherry tomatoes

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat for 6 to 8 minutes, or until evenly brown. Once cooled, crumble and set aside.
In a bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, bacon, green onions, and parsley until well blended. Set aside.
Cut a small slice from the top of each tomato. Using a melon baller or small spoon, scoop out the inside of each tomato and discard. Fill each tomato with the bacon mixture, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Serve chilled.
