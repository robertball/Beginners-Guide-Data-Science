Ingredients:
1 cup coarse salt, or as needed
6 pounds beef short ribs
6 limes, quartered

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Coat the ribs heavily with salt. This brings out the fat.
Grill for 5 to 7 minutes on each side, or to desired doneness. Remove cooked ribs to a large glass serving dish, and squeeze lime juice over them. Serve immediately.

Description: 
At first glance you'll say 'whoa! that's way too salty for me to try...' but stick with it.  This is one of the best rib recipes I've ever tried.  Very quick and easy.
