Ingredients:
4 bone-in chicken breast halves (8 ounces each)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon grated onion
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper
1/4 teaspoon rubbed sage
1/8 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
4 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley

Directions:
Arrange chicken in an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Whisk together the oil, onion, garlic, thyme, salt, rosemary, pepper, sage, marjoram and hot pepper sauce. Pour over chicken.
Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until juices run clear and a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F, basting occasionally. Remove and discard skin from chicken. Sprinkle with parsley. Drizzle with juice.

Description: 
Judy Sargent of Rome, New York sent the recipe for this moist and tender chicken. Nicely seasoned with a variety of herbs, it's easy to prepare...but seems special enough for company.
