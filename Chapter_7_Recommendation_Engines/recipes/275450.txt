Ingredients:
6 slices thick-cut bacon
1/3 pound shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 (12 ounce) jar diced jalapeno peppers with juice
1/2 (8 ounce) package cold cream cheese, cubed
7 large eggs
1/3 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup sun-dried tomato pesto
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place bacon in a cast iron skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and chop.
Sprinkle chopped bacon evenly into the cast iron skillet. Top evenly with Cheddar cheese. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup diced jalapeno peppers. Drop cream cheese cubes evenly over peppers.
Whip eggs in a bowl until slightly thickened. Add heavy cream, pesto, 5 tablespoons reserved jalapeno liquid, salt, and black pepper; beat until well mixed. Pour over ingredients in the skillet.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown and eggs are set, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes before serving.
