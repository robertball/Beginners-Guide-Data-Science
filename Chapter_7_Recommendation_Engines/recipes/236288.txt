Description: 
I created this recipe after experimenting with many different types of frozen-fruit smoothies. My husband and I no longer make it except when we're hosting guests in our home in Hawaii, as we were drinking it too often (and it is certainly not a low-calorie beverage). It is an awesome substitute for frozen alcoholic mixed drinks.
