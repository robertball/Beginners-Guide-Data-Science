Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 yellow onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
2 cups mashed sweet potatoes
2 cups cooked quinoa
sea salt to taste
freshly cracked black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon coconut oil, or as needed

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion with a pinch of salt in hot oil until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant; about 1 minute. Stir in thyme and cook for about 30 seconds; transfer mixture to a large bowl.
Stir sweet potatoes, quinoa, sea salt, and black pepper together with onion mixture until well-combined. Divide mixture into golf-ball size balls and press into patties.
Heat coconut oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes per side.

Description: 
These are kind of like a twist on falafel. Goes well in pita bread. Enjoy with a generous sprinkling of fresh thyme leaves and some finishing salt! You can use vegan butter instead of coconut oil, if desired.
