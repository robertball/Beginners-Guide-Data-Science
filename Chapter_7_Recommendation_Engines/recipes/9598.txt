Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 egg yolks
1/2 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup shortening
2 egg whites
9 apple - peeled, cored and sliced
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and salt. Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of milk, stir into the flour mixture.
On a lightly floured surface, roll half of the dough out to the size of the prepared pan. Cover the inside of the pan with the dough. Spread dough with a light coating of egg white.  Fill with sliced apples and sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on top. Roll out remaining dough and place on top of apples.  Brush with a light coating of egg white.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until the crust is golden. In  a small bowl, beat together the confectioners' sugar, salt, vanilla and milk until smooth. Drizzle over cooled bars, cut into squares.
