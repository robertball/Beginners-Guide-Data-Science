Ingredients:
1 pound broccoli, cut into 1-inch pieces
3 onions, quartered
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 cup milk
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2/3 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 1/2 cups soft bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring broccoli and onions to a boil in a pot of salted water until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Drain. Arrange vegetables in a baking dish.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into melted butter until smooth, about 2 minutes. Whisk milk into flour mixture until thick and bubbly, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and add cream cheese. Stir until smooth.
Pour cream cheese mixture over vegetables, stirring lightly. Top with Cheddar cheese. Combine 2 tablespoons melted butter with bread crumbs in a bowl; sprinkle over vegetables.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bread crumbs are golden brown, about 30 minutes.
