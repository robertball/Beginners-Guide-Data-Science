Ingredients:
Soaking
6 cups Rolled oats
2 cups buckwheat groats (rye flakes)
1/2 cup butter melted
1/2 cup organic coconut oil
1 14 oz can unsweetened coconut milk
2 cups filtered water
4 tbsp apple cider vinegar
Baking
3/4 cup honey
3/4 cup pure maple syrup
1 tsp sea salt
1 1/2 tbsp ground cinnamon
1 tbsp pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine the ingredients under the soaking title in a large bowl. Place a towel over the bowl and let the grains soak in the mixture overnight.
Early next morning, combine the ingredients in the baking section together and pour over the soaked oatmeal mixing well.
Put wax paper down on two large cookie sheets. Spread half of the granola mixture in a thin layer on each cookie sheet.
Preheat oven to 200 degrees and place cookie sheets in. Bake the granola for 8 hours stirring the granola every 2 hours over with a spatula. When done, let the granola cool overnight in the warm oven. The granola will harden as it cools.
Add 1 cup of coconut flakes, almonds, walnuts, raisins, craisins, or dried apple as you desire. Makes 16 cups.
