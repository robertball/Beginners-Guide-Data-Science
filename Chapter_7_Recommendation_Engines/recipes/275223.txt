Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups farfalle (bow-tie) pasta
1 pound ground turkey
3/4 cup ketchup, or to taste
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning blend
1 pinch garlic salt
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon poppy seeds

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground turkey in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
Reduce heat to low and add ketchup, brown sugar, Italian seasoning, and garlic salt. Let simmer for 1 to 2 minutes; remove from heat and cover.
Drain cooked pasta and pour into a medium casserole dish. Stir in mozzarella cheese, Cheddar cheese, and poppy seeds. Spread turkey mixture on top and serve.

Description: 
A super easy, yummy, kid-friendly pasta casserole. My little sister and I were making lunch when we made up this casserole. She doesn't like hamburger, but she is a huge pasta and turkey fan. It goes together really quickly if one person makes the turkey part and another person makes the noodle part. Refrigerate leftovers.
