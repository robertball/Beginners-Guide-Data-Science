Ingredients:
•1 Pkg Shrimp Powder (about 4-5 tablespoons)
•6 Eggs
•Oil to fry (about 1 cup)
•Sauce:
•2 Chile Anchos (stems & seeds removed)
•1/2 White onion
•2 Garlic cloves
•1-1/2 Chicken cubes
•1 Jar nopales (rinsed and drained)
•Cilantro (optional)

Directions:
In bowl of warm/hot water soak the chile anchos until tender. About 20 minutes
Place oil in pan and heat. Stir eggs w/fork to combine the whites and yolk. Add the shrimp mixture and stir again.
When oil is hot pour egg mixture into small circles about 2" in diameter and fry until golden brown on both sides.
Place chilies, onion, garlic and water into blender. Blend until smooth. You may need to add more water, you want it to be a soup consistency. Then pour this mixture into a pot, add chicken cubes and turn heat to medium.
As the patties are getting done place them aside on a plate. Once they are all done frying, add them to the mixture of chile sauce.
Cook about 5 minutes, then add the nopales. Then reduce heat to low and cook 5 more minutes and remove from heat.
You may serve this with rice and tortillas (also some like to top it with cilantro), or I just eat it like a soup!
