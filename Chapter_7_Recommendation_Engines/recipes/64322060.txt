Ingredients:
1/2 tablespoon pepper(s), chipotle chiles, in adobo sauce chopped, or more to taste
1/2 pounds beef, flank steak about 1" thick
1 leaves lettuce, romaine large, shredded
1 medium tomato(es), plum chopped
1/2 tablespoon sour cream, reduced-fat
1 teaspoon lime juice, fresh
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 whole wrap, whole wheat 8 inches each

Directions:
Rub chiles onto both sides of steak; place steak in a resealable plastic bag and let marinate at room temperature for 1 hour.
Heat the broiler and broiler pan for 10 minutes. Place steak on broiler pan and cook for 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Remove from the broiler, transfer to a cutting board, and let steak rest for 5 minutes. Cut into thin slices across the grain.
In a medium bowl, combine lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, lime juice, and salt. Heat wraps in the oven or microwave according to package directions. Divide lettuce mixture and steak evenly among wraps, roll up, and serve.
