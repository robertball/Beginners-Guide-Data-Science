Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
3 cloves garlic minced
1/4 cup finely chopped parsley
4 ounces cream cheese, cubed
1-1/4 cups heavy whipping cream, 2 tablespoons seperated
1/2 cup of milk
salt to taste
fresh ground black pepper, to taste (I like a couple grinds)
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup grated Romano cheese
1/4 cup grated Mozzarela cheese
1/4 cup grated Asiago cheese
1 egg yolk, lightly beaten
4 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese for garnish

Directions:
Melt butter or margarine in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and saute until fragrant and golden.  Add cream cheese, heavy cream and milk stirring constantly until smooth. Stir in salt, ground black pepper, nutmeg, grated cheeses. Stir constantly until melted. Whisk 2 tablespoons heavy cream with egg yolk. When alfredo is smooth and simmering, slowly add egg yolk mixture whisking continously. Simmer over medium low heat for 5 minutes. Add half of the parsley, save rest for garnishing.  Garnish with additional grated Parmesan cheese and remaining parsley.

Description: 
This is a combination of several recipes that I came up with to create a creamy alfredo sauce.  Serve over penne or fettucini noodles. Add some grilled chicken to the top and garlic bread for a delicious dinner!
