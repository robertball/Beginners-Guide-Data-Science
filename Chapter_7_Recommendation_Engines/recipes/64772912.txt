Ingredients:
For the Crust
1 1/2 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons butter, cold cut into pieces
2 tablespoons vegetable shortening, cold
For the Filling
2 cups heavy cream
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg, fresh grated

Directions:
1. Make the crust. Pulse flour and salt in a food processor. Add the butter and shortening and pulse until it looks like course meal with pea sized bits of butter. Drizzle in 3 tablespoons ice water and pulse a few times until it comes together (add more water if necessary). Turn out onto plastic wrap and pat into a disk. Refridgerate for at least one hour, up to a day.
2. Roll the dough out into a pie pan shape. Ease into pan, crimp out a shape on the edges. Pierce the bottom all over with a fork. Refridgerate until firm, about 30 minutes.
3. Place a baking sheet on a middle oven rack and preheat to 425. Make the filling. Whisk heavy cream, sugar, flour and vanilla in a bowl. Pour into the chilled pie crust, dot with butter, and sprinkle on nutmeg.Transfer to the oven and bake 10 minutes. Reduce the temp to 350 and bake until crust is golden and filling is bubbly in spots, about 55 more minutes (the center will still jiggle slightly). Cover the edges with foil if they are browning too quickly. Let cool completely. Serve cool or at room temperature.
