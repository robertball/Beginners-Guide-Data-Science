Description: 
Three ingredients are all you need for Luke Walker's Mexican twist on grilled cheese. The Unionville, Ontario teenager says the tasty wedges are ideal as an after-school snack or with soup at lunchtime. Youngsters can easily assemble the quick quesadillas but should get an adult's help popping them under the broiler.
