Ingredients:
1 lb. boneless chicken breast cutlets
3 tbsp. olive oil
1/2 lemon (juice and peel)
2 tbsp. tarragon
1 tsp. dijon mustard
5 tbsp. olive oil
1/4 cup canola/vegetable oil
1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1 egg, whisked
8 oz. Goat Cheese (cut into 8 rounds)
8 oz. baby salad greens
1/2 cup sunflower seeds
1/3 cup cooked corn kernels, drained

Directions:
Heat olive oil in medium heat skillet. Cook chiken.
Grate 2 tsp. lemon zest into medium sized bowl. Add the juice of the half lemon. Whisk in dijon mustard, tarragon, and olive oil.
Heat 1/4 cup oil in skillet at medium heat. Dip one flat side of the cheese rounds into the egg, then coat the same side with bread crumbs. Set in the skillet long enough to turn golden but do not allow cheese to melt. Remove cheese and set cooked side down on paper towel to remove excess oil.
In a large bowl, pour tarragon dressing over greens and turn to coat. Serve topped with chicken, warm goat cheese, corn, and sunflower seeds.
