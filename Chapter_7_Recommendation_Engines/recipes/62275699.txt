Ingredients:
For the Base:
50g (2 oz) Butter
2 Tablespoons Golden Syrup
150g (5 oz) Malted Milk Biscuits, finely crushed
For the Filling:
250g (8 oz) Mascarpone Cheese
200g (7 oz) Fromage Frais
50g (2 oz) Caster Sugar, sifted
Grated rind and juice of 2 limes
150ml (1/4 pint) double cream
To Decorate:
250g (8 oz) Strawberries, halved or sliced if large
125g (4 oz) Fresh blueberries
Sifted icing sugar

Directions:
To make the base, melt the butter and syrup in a saucepan.  Stir the biscuit crumbs into the butter mixture, mix well and press into the base of an 18cm (7 Inch) loose-bottomed, fluted flan tin.  Put in the refrigerator to chill.
Beat the mascarpone in a bowl to soften, then stir in the fromage frais, sugar and lime rind.  Gradually beat in the lime juice.
In a second bowl whisk the cream until if forms soft peaks, then fold in the mascarpone mixture.  Spoon the creamy filling on to the biscuit base and swirl the top with the back of a spoon.  Refrigerate for 3 hours or longer.
Carefully remove the cheesecake from the tin, decorate with berries and a dusting of icing sugar.
