Ingredients:
Butter flavored cooking spray
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup white sugar
4 eggs
3 cups milk (I use Lactaid no-fat)
1/2 cup CocoRibe Rum (or 2 tbsp coconut extract and increase milk to 3.5 cups)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup white chocolate chips, divided in half cup portions
1 1/2 cups coconut flakes, divided into 3/4 cup portions
1 (16 oz) stale loaf of Hawaiian sweet round bread, cut into 1 inch cubes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with butter flavored cooking spray, and dust with confectioners' sugar by pouring sugar in fine sieve and shaking over buttered pan.
In a large bowl, combine sugar, eggs,CocoRibe rum or coconut extract and cinnamon. Mix until smooth. Stir in 3/4 cup of flaked coconut, and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. Fold in bread cubes until evenly coated. Pour into prepared baking dish. Set aside for 30 minutes.
Sprinkle remaining white chocolate chips on top of bread pudding. Bake on a cookie sheet in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Sprinkle top with remaining 3/4 cup flaked coconut. Continue baking for 30 minutes, or until center springs back when lightly tapped. Let rest for 15 minutes on a wire cooking rack before attempting to cut.

Description: 
I was served a white chocolate bread pudding in a Maui restaurant. This is my version of that dessert to which I added coconut flakes and coconut flavored rum to the white chocolate chips. Serve hot or cold with a drizzle of pure maple syrup; may use whip cream or your favorite hard sauce recipe.Modified from: Coconut Bread Pudding
