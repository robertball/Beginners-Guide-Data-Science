Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup oat bran
1/4 cup flaxseed meal
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder

2/3 cup applesauce
1/2 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Mix whole wheat flour, oat bran, flaxseed meal, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, nutmeg, and cloves together in a large bowl.
Beat egg using an electric mixer in a separate medium bowl; add canola oil. Whisk until smooth. Add pumpkin pie mix, applesauce, and brown sugar. Mix together until smooth. Add to flour mixture and combine until blended.
Spoon batter evenly into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 28 minutes.
