Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup clover honey
1/4 cup cocoa powder
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 pint heavy cream

Directions:
Whip the cream cheese with an electric mixer until fluffy. Beat in the honey, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract.
Beat the cream in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the cream should form a sharp peak that holds its shape. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture.

Description: 
This recipe was created to go with my whole wheat chocolate chiffon cake. It contains no refined sugar and no egg. For white frosting, reduce the honey to 1/2 cup and omit the cocoa powder.
