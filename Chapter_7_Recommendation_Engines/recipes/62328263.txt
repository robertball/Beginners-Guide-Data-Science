3. Meanwhile, prepare the corn-bread mix according to the label directions. Stir in the Cheddar.
4. Remove the chili from the heat and spread the corn-bread batter over the chili. Place the skillet in the oven and bake 15 to 20 minutes or until golden. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
