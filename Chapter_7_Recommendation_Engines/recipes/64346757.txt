Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 egg
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 shallot, micro planed
1 lg clove garlic, micro planed
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup thinly sliced onion
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cup beef broth
1 tablespoon cooking sherry
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 pound, sliced mushrooms
4-6 tbs melted butter

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, pepper, salt, onion, garlic , and Worcestershire sauce. Form into 6 balls, and flatten into patties.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the patties and onion in the oil until patties are nicely browned, about 5 minutes per side. Remove the beef patties to a plate, and keep warm.
In a another pan cook onions until translucent, add mushrooms and cook for another five minutes.
Remove as much oil as possible from pan.
Sprinkle flour over the melted butter in the skillet. Stir in flour with a fork, scraping bits of beef off of the bottom as you stir. Gradually mix in the beef broth and sherry. Season with seasoned salt.  Simmer and stir over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, until the gravy thickens. Add the onions and mushrooms. Turn heat to low, return patties to the gravy, cover, and simmer for another 15 minutes.
