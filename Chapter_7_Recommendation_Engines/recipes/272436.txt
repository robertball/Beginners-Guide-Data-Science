Ingredients:
1 pound rutabaga, peeled
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/3 cup water
3 tablespoons butter
1 clove garlic, minced
5 leaves fresh sage, chopped
1 pinch salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste
1 pinch crushed red pepper (optional)

Directions:
Cut rutabaga into thin noodles using a spiralizer.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute rutabaga noodles, stirring constantly, until the noodles start turning a bright yellow color, 4 to 5 minutes. Add water and cover with a lid. Lower heat to medium and steam noodles until they soften to an al dente texture, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove lid and toss noodles until water has evaporated. Transfer noodles to a bowl and keep warm.
Wipe out skillet and melt butter over medium heat. Swirl butter until brown specks begin to appear in the bottom of the skillet, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic to skillet and stir for 2 to 3 minutes, taking care not to burn. Add sage and stir to coat. Return rutabaga noodles to the pan and toss to combine. Season with salt and freshly cracked pepper. Garnish with crushed red pepper and serve immediately.

Description: 
These rutabaga noodles are much lower in carbs than traditional pasta and have a nice nutty flavor with a hint of sweetness. They even look like real pasta!
