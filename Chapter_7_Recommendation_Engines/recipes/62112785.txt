Ingredients:
3 cups Flour
2 teaspoons Baking Powder
1 cup Sour Cream
1 cup butter
1/4 teaspoon salt
Apples (approx 4 or 5) - peeled, cored and chopped fine
Cinnamon Sugar

Directions:
Combine flour, baking powder, sour cream, butter and salt until soft dough forms (similar to a pie crust) that is easy to work with.  Roll thin and cut in 2 1/2" squares.  Put approximately 1 tsp of chopped apples in the center. Bring up the four corners of the dough and pinch together to close, leaving the sides slightly open so it looks like a little pouch.  If corners are not sealing well, use a dab of beaten egg white to help seal.  Bake on cookie sheets at 350, approximately 15 minutes, until golden brown.  While still warm, dredge cuddles in cinnamon-sugar. Best served warm and can also be frozen.
