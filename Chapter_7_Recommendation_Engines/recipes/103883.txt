Ingredients:
2 teaspoons harissa
1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk
1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
1/4 cup fresh orange juice
2 pounds Atlantic sea bass, diced
1/4 cup red onion, finely chopped
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped Moroccan preserved lemon
1 tablespoon caraway seed, lightly toasted and then crushed
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chervil
kosher salt to taste

Directions:
In a large glass or ceramic bowl, whisk together the Harissa, coconut milk, lemon juice, lime juice and orange juice. Add the sea bass, onion, ginger, olive oil, preserved lemon, caraway seed, cumin and chervil. Stir to blend, then press everything down so there is a layer of liquid covering the top.
Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or until the fish is opaque and white. Season with salt and add more harissa if desired before serving.
