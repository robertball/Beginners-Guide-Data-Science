Ingredients:
2 (6 ounce) boneless thick-cut pork chops
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup BUITONIÂ® Refrigerated Pesto with Basil, divided
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup sliced onion

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Cut each pork chop horizontally three-fourths of the way through the meat creating a pocket, being careful to not cut all the way through. Rub pork chops with cumin, paprika and salt. Fill each pork chop with 1 tablespoon pesto; secure with wooden picks.
Heat oil in medium, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Add pork chops; cook for 1 minute on each side until brown. Place skillet in oven.
Bake pork chops and onion for 15 to 20 minutes or until pork is cooked through. Remove wooden picks; top with remaining 3 tablespoons pesto.
