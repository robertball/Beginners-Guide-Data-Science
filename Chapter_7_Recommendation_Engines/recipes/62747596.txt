Ingredients:
1 package (16 oz) lasagna noodles; no boil variety
1 1/2 lb ground beef
1 large onion
3 cloves garlic
1 1/2 quarts spaghetti sauce
32 ounces small curd cottage cheese
2 eggs
1 package (8 oz) cream cheese, softened
2 lbs grated mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Take out cream cheese to soften.
Brown ground meat and drain.
While ground meat is being cooked, chop onion and garlic.
Add onions and garlic to cooked ground meat in pot. Cook until onions are translucent. Add spaghetti sauce and remove from heat.
Cook lasagna noodles if needed, drain, and set aside.
In separate bowl, mix cottage cheese, eggs, and cream cheese.
Spray Dutch oven with cooking spray. Note: Lining Dutch oven with foil is not recommended for heavy tomato sauce recipes.
In Dutch oven, layer one third the sauce mixture, 1/2 noodles, and 1/2 cottage cheese mixture. Repeat layers, pour remaining spaghetti sauce on top and then spread cheese on top. Bake at 375 degrees for 1 hour (uncooked noodles) or 45 minutes (cooked noodles). You should see the cheese melted, bubbly, and noodles are cooked.
Enjoy!
