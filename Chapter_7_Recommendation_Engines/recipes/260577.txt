Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) balls fresh mozzarella cheese
4 teaspoons chopped fresh basil
4 teaspoons sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and chopped
2 eggs
1 cup panko bread crumbs
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Cut 1/3 off the top of each mozzarella ball. Scoop out some of the cheese with a teaspoon to make a hole in each ball. Stuff hole with 1 teaspoon basil and 1 teaspoon sun-dried tomatoes; cover with the top.
Beat eggs using a fork in a shallow bowl. Pour panko bread crumbs, salt, and pepper into a second shallow bowl.
Dip mozzarella balls into beaten eggs, holding them with 2 forks so the top doesn't fall off. Dip in bread crumbs, turning gently to coat.
Heat oil in a large saucepan to about 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Test if oil is hot by dropping a few bread crumbs into the oil. If the oil fizzles, it is hot enough. Drop mozzarella balls carefully into the hot oil and fry on both sides until nicely browned and crispy, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
