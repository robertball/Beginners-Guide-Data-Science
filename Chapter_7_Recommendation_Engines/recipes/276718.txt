Ingredients:
Soup:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups diced onion
3/4 cup finely diced carrot
2/3 cup finely diced celery
2 teaspoons minced garlic
6 cups low-sodium vegetable broth, or more as needed
1 1/4 cups dried green split peas
2 sprigs fresh thyme
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Gremolata:
1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes
3/4 teaspoon garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, and celery; cook until softened, about 6 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook 30 seconds more. Stir in broth, split peas, thyme, bay leaf, salt, and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer, partially covered, until peas are falling apart, about 1 1/4 hours.
Meanwhile, stir together parsley, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, paprika, and salt in a small bowl.
Remove thyme sprigs and bay leaf from soup; discard. Add more broth or water to thin as desired, and more salt to taste. Serve topped with gremolata.
