Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
1 pound hot Italian sausage
1 medium red bell pepper, diced
2 cups sliced mushrooms
1 (24 ounce) jar RAGÚ® Old World Style® Traditional Sauce
1 (9 ounce) package no-boil lasagna sheets, broken into large pieces
1 cup water
1/2 teaspoon crushed dried rosemary
8 ounces ricotta cheese
8 ounces part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded and divided
2 tablespoons minced fresh Italian parsley

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and add olive oil. Swirl to coat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the sausage, red pepper, and mushrooms; saute until meat is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the Ragu(R) Old World Style(R) Traditional sauce, broken lasagna noodles, water, and rosemary. Cover and turn heat down to medium-low.
Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente.  Remove the lid and add the ricotta, 2/3 of the cheese, and parsley; stir to combine. Top with remaining mozzarella and serve immediately.
