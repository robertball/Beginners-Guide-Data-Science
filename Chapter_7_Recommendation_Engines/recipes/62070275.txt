Description: 
This twist on Rice Crispie Squares are sinful but oh so good!  A friend brought them to a birthday party, and I asked for the recipie immediatley!  If you like, peanut butter chips can be substituted for chocolate chips on the topping.  To prevent sticky fingers, make sure you refrigerate these until the chocolate has cooled!
