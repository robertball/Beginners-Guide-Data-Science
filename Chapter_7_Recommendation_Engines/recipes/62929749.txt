Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups leftover turkey (dark meat)
1/2 cup leftover gravy
1/4 cup water
1 carrot peeled and sliced thin
1/2 cup frozen peas
1/2 small onion chopped
Salt and pepper to taste
1 pinch summer savory or spice to your taste (ie rosemary, thyme, etc.)
1/2 Tbsp. cornstarch mixed with 1 Tbsp. water for thickening
3 or 4 small potatoes sliced thin (1/8 inch)
1 tsp melted butter

Directions:
Cut up turkey and add water, seasonings and gravy.  Warm over medium heat until gravy reconstitutes.  Add sliced carrots, chopped onion, and peas.
Heat until boiling.  Thicken with cornstarch paste a little at a time until slightly thickened (the mixture should not be too thick). Add seasonings and salt and pepper to taste.
Pour into a greased 1 quart casserole.  Arrange sliced potatoes over the top of the casserole.  Brush potatoes with melted butter and dredge top with a little salt and cracked pepper.
Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes covered. Remove cover and broil for 5 minutes until potatoes are browned.
Let sit for 15 minutes covered before serving.
