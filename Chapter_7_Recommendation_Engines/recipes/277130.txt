Ingredients:
16 ounces brown rice penne pasta
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 cup diced onion
4 slices turkey bacon
3 cups sliced Swiss chard
3 cups sliced red kale
1/2 cup ricotta cheese
1/4 cup soy milk
2 large eggs
2 large egg yolks
sea salt to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook penne in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes less than package instructed cooking time, about 5 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of pasta water. Set aside.
Heat oil in a large, high-sided skillet over medium heat. Saute onion in the hot oil, 4 to 5 minutes. Add turkey bacon and saute until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove bacon and set aside. Add Swiss chard and kale to the same pan and saute until tender, 3 to 4 minutes.
Crumble bacon, return to the skillet, and reduce heat to low.
Whisk ricotta cheese, soy milk, eggs, egg yolks, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk reserved pasta water slowly into egg mixture to temper eggs. Remove the skillet from heat and toss in cooked pasta as you pour over the egg mixture; heat from pasta will gently cook eggs and create a sauce. Serve immediately.
