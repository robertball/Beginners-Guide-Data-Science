Ingredients:
2-4 bags of Lipton tea depending on how strong you take your tea
4 or 5 cloves
3 cardamon
1 small stick of cinnamon
1 tsp dried mint
4-5 cups of water

Directions:
Put 4 or 5 cups of water in a tea kettle.  1 cup of water per person drinking.
Put the water to boil on the stove top and add the spices right away, so that by the time the water boils it will have a nice flavor.
As soon as the water boils add the tea bags and turn off the stove.
Let the tea steep, but be sure not to leave the tea bags steeping for too long so that the tea doesn't become too strong and over power the spices.
Remove the tea bags and spices.
Sugar to taste and enjoy!
