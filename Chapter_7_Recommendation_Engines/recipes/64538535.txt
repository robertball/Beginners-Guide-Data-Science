Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken thighs (4 ounces each)
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp plus 2 Tbsp Dijon mustard, divided
3 Tbsp honey
2 Tbsp butter

Directions:
Flatten chicken to 1/4-in. thickness. In a shallow bowl, combine garlic, bread crumbs and 1 teaspoon of mustard. In another shallow bowl, combine honey and remaining mustard. Dip chicken in honey-mustard mixture, then coat with crumbs. Put chicken in the fridge for about 15 minutes so the coating sticks better while cooking.
In a nonstick skillet, cook chicken over medium heat in butter for 4-6 minutes on each side or until chicken juices run clear.
