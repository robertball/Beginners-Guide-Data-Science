Description: 
I looked into my refrigerator to see what I had...and the ingredients jumped to my imagination. I thought: I think this has to taste good and go well with my baked grouper dinner...and it was not only good but great! The mild bitterness of the arugula and the sweetness of grapes and pickled veggies is a perfect combination. A cool crisp pinot bianco is the perfect match.
