Ingredients:
12 ounces cranberries
6 ounces unsweetened apple juice concentrate

Directions:
In a saucepan cook cranberries and apple juice concentrate over medium heat until cranberries have burst. Chill and serve. You may also add some white sugar if the recipe isn't sweet enough for you. Only add the extra sugar one tablespoon at a time to avoid over sweetening.
