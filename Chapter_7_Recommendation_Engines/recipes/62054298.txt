Ingredients:
4 slices of bacon
1 can of peas, drained (15 oz can)
2 heaping Tablespoons flour
1/2 can of evaporated milk (NOT condensed)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Fry 4 slices of bacon and remove to plate. In bacon grease empty can of peas. Warm on low.
In separate bowl, combine 2 heaping Tablespoons flour and salt and pepper to taste.
Add 1/2 can evaporated milk slowly, a little at a time, stirring all the time. This will keep the lumps out.
Pour milk mixture into peas. Stir. (If it starts to thicken too fast, rinse out your milk bowl with about 1/2 c. water and pour into peas.)
Cook until warmed through, stirring all the time. This will only take about 5 minutes or so. Don't cook on high heat, medium or low heat is best.

Description: 
This is my grandmother's recipe for creamed peas. These aren't creamed peas like you think of baby food creamed peas. You add peas to a cream sauce made with evaporated milk, flour and bacon. So yummy! Really a comfort food.
