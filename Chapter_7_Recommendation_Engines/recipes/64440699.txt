Ingredients:
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/4 teaspoons fresh cracked black pepper
1 large spaghetti squash (about 2 pounds)
4 slices nitrate free bacon, cut into small strips crosswise
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1/4 cup chicken broth
2 egg yolks plus 1 whole egg
1 cup freshly grated Vegan Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Prick the squash all over with a fork.  Roast on a foil lined pan  1 to 1 1/2 hours. (I did 60 mins but would go longer next time)  Let cool a bit.  Slice in half lengthwise, scoop out seeds and shred the squash with a fork.  Transfer to a large bowl.In a large saute pan, over medium heat, cook the bacon until it becomes crispy.  Add the garlic. Saute for 1 minute. Add the broth and cook until the liquid has completely evaporated.In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs together with the cheese. Season with the remaining salt and pepper. Combine the eggs with the bacon mixture, warming the eggs in the pan. (Do not let the eggs cook through.) Add the spaghetti squash and toss to thoroughly combine and until squash is heated through. Adjust seasoning, if necessary and serve immediately.
