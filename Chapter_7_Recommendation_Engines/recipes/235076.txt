Ingredients:
4 cups chicken broth
1 large head cauliflower, chopped
2 large potatoes, chopped
1 large onion, sliced
2 carrots, sliced, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup milk

Directions:
Bring chicken broth, cauliflower, potatoes, onion, carrots, salt, and pepper to a boil in a stockpot; reduce heat, cover pot with a lid, and simmer until vegetables are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove pot from heat.
Mash vegetables using a potato masher or puree in a blender. Return pot to low heat and stir in milk. Cook soup until heated through, 3 to 5 more minutes.

Description: 
This soup is the best comfort food for a cold day and freezes well without the milk. Try cream in place of milk for a thicker soup.
