Ingredients:
4 slices bacon, chopped
6 eggs
2 tablespoons sour cream
1 tablespoon oil, or as needed
1 tablespoon chipotle-flavored hot sauce (such as Tabasco® Chipotle Pepper Sauce)
3 vine-ripened tomatoes, chopped
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and chopped
1 (6 ounce) package fresh spinach
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels.
Lightly beat eggs and sour cream together in a bowl.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir egg mixture and hot sauce in the hot oil until light and fluffy, 5 to 7 minutes. Fold tomatoes, avocado, and spinach into egg mixture just until warmed, 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over egg mixture and cook until cheese is lightly melted, 1 to 2 minutes; season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
In my family, I'm (Ian) called the 'Eggs Extraordinaire', and Molly and I take turns topping each others egg concoctions. This is by far the best. We've found that a couple dabs of chipotle Tabasco® sauce make all the difference when cooking eggs.
