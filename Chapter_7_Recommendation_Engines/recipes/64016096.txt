Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
4 extra-thick slices of bacon
12 spears of asparagus
8 oz shredded cheese
4 12-inch lengths of string
2 Tablespoons butter, divided
2 fresh jalapeños
3 Tablespoons flour
2 cups warm milk
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400
Line a 9 x 9 pan with parchment
Trim asparagus spears to stick out an inch on each side of the thighs
Place about a cup of the cheese into a separate bowl (this avoids cross-contamination)
Flatten out the thighs with your hands, then put a quarter of the cheese from the bowl in the thigh, followed by the three spears of asparagus
Roll the thigh around the stuffing, then wrap a slice of bacon around the outside
Tie the string around the bacon, ensuring the ends are secured under the string
Place the four stuffed thighs in the lined pan and bake for 30 - 40 minutes. Thigh meat is done at 160 degrees
While the chicken is baking, cut off the stems, seeds, and ribs of the jalapeños. Either chop very finely or pulverize in a mini food processor
Put one tablespoon of butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, then add the jalapeños. Let cook, stirring regularly, until the water has cooked off and you can see the oil of the butter again
Add the rest of the butter, allowing to melt completely
Add the flour. Stir this until the flour starts to brown, 1 to 2 minutes
Start adding the warm milk, about 1/3 cup at a time, mixing completely between each addition
Once all of the milk is added, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to medium-low. Cook at a low boil for 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. You now have a jalapeño béchamel!
Add the salt and pepper
Add the remaining cheese, stirring gently to incorporate it into the béchamel. Don't over-stir, as this affects the texture of the cheese
Once the thighs are done, cut off the string and smother with the jalapeño cheese béchamel
