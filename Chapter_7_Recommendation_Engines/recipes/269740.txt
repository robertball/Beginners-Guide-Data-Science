Ingredients:
12 baby red or white potatoes, halved
1 (8 ounce) package baby carrots
1 cup broccoli florets
1 tablespoon butter, at room temperature
4 (5 ounce) salmon fillets
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3/4 cup chicken stock
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
1 garlic clove, chopped

Directions:
Place potatoes and carrots in a large pot. Cover with a generous amount of cold water. Bring to a boil; cook until tender yet still firm, about 5 minutes. Add broccoli and cook for 2 minutes more. Drain vegetables well. Rinse under cold running water and drain well again.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Place salmon fillets in the baking pan. Surround salmon with parboiled vegetables; season with salt and pepper. Combine chicken stock, lemon juice, dill, and garlic in a bowl. Drizzle over the salmon and vegetables. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until salmon fillets flake easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.
