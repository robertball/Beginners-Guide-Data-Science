Ingredients:
4 cups flour
2 cups rolled oats
2 tsp baking soda
2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp salt
1-1/2 cups butter
1-1/2 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup sugar
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
1-16 oz can pumpkin
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Combine flour, oats, soda, cinnamon and salt; set aside.
Cream butter, brown sugar and sugar. Add egg and vanilla.  Alternate additions of dry ingredients and pumpkin, mixing well after each addition. Stir in chocolate chips.
For each cookie, drop 1/4 cup dough onto greased baking sheet and spread into pumpkin shape using a thin metal spatula.  Add a bit more dough to form a stem.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until cookies are firm and lightly browned.  If desired, decorate with icing to affix raisins or nuts.
