Ingredients:
1 pkg. (8 serving size) sweet potato vermicelli
1/2 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup boiling water
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Break the vermicelli into small pieces and place in a deep-sided dish. Cover with hot tap water and soak for ten minutes; drain.
Whisk together the soy sauce, brown sugar, and boiling water; pour over the drained noodles; allow to soak 2 minutes.
Pour the vegetable oil into a skillet and place over medium heat. Add the noodles and soy sauce mixture to the skillet and cook and stir until hot, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle sesame seeds over the noodles just before serving.

Description: 
After lots of trial and error, I have managed to recreate one of my favorite appetizer dishes served at a Korean restaurant. While this is not the traditional Jap Chae that includes meats and vegetables, this one is sweet and delightful. Great served as an appetizer or a side dish to chicken and meat! Enjoy.
