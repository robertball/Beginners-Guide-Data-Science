Ingredients:
1 package of plain round wafers (usually about 12 inches in diameter)
1 can of sweetened condensed milk
any amount of fruit

Directions:
Put the can of condensed milk into a medium pot filled with water.  Make sure the water covers about 4/5 of the can and doesn't overflow.  Bring water to a boil.  Let it boil for 1 hour and 40 minutes.  Drain the water and let the can cool for a few minutes.  After you open it, the color of the condensed milk will be light brown. Take 5 wafers out of the package.  With a spoon, spread the cooked condensed milk onto five of the layers.  Dice any fruit and put it on the top layer.  It should stick to the condensed milk that is also on the top layer.  You can eat it as soon as the condensed milk stops dripping and solidifies a bit or you can let it stand.  It is best after standing for a few hours.
