Ingredients:
3 TB Cognac vinegar
1 TB Dijon mustard
1 clove garlic, minced
3/4 c strong beef bouillon
3 TB avocado oil
salt and freshly-ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Put all ingredients into a pint jar and shake to mix.  Super simple!

Submitter: 
The Magpie
Description: 
Super simple and way delicious -- and far less vinegar-y than commercial dressings!  This will accent the flavors in your salads rather than cover them up.  I used techniques and combinations I learned from vintage 1930's and 1940's cookbooks in my collection to create this one.  I hope you enjoy it!
