Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, diced
1 pound thinly sliced rib-eye steak, chopped
1/2 (4 ounce) jar diced jalapeno peppers (optional)
1/2 (4 ounce) jar diced pimento peppers (optional)
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese (such as Philadelphia®), softened
1 (15 ounce) jar processed cheese sauce (such as Cheez Whiz®)

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion in the hot oil until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove onion from skillet to a bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving oil in skillet. Cook and stir steak in the same skillet over medium-high heat until browned and liquid has evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir onion, jalapeno peppers, and pimento peppers into steak until thoroughly mixed. Add cream cheese to steak mixture; cook and stir until cream cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Stir cheese sauce into steak mixture; cook and stir until dip is heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve hot.

Description: 
If you live in Philadelphia, or have visited, you have probably gone to the famous Pat's or Geno's Steaks. When you order, you have to order a 'Whiz Wit' or a 'Whiz Wit-out.' This means a cheese steak with Cheeze Whiz® and with or without fried onions. This is a cheese steak in a dip. Perfect for tailgating or football games and is best served in a slow cooker with cut-up hoagie/sub rolls. Enjoy!
