Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter
20 mushrooms, stems removed
1/2 (8 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 cup dry white wine
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1/2 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Place butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Dip the bottom of each mushroom cap in melted butter and place on a rimmed baking sheet.
Stir Monterey Jack cheese, garlic powder, and thyme into the remaining melted butter. Stir in wine and soy sauce. Add enough bread crumbs to make a wet and sticky mixture.
Spoon bread crumb mixture into each mushroom cap, mounding it slightly to use up all the filling.
Broil in the preheated oven until brown and bubbly, 3 to 4 minutes. Cool slightly before serving, about 5 minutes.
