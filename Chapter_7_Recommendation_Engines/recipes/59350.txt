Ingredients:
5 small potatoes, cubed
2 (15 ounce) cans sliced beets, drained
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup red wine vinegar, or to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain, and cool.
Run potatoes and beets through a ricer, or through a food processor with a grater attachment. Stir in salt and pepper.
Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the potato and beet mixture, and pat down evenly. Fry until heated through, and browned on the bottom. Serve with more butter and red wine vinegar to taste.

Description: 
This recipe has been passed down from my great-grandmother to my Nana to my Mom and now to me. Boiled beets and potatoes are grated and fried in butter for a classic New England treat. Very simple to make and very much a comfort food in our house!
