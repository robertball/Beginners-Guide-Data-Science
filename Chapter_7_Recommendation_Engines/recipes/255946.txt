Ingredients:
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds
2 dried rose buds
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon ground paprika
1 head cauliflower, broken into florets
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small yellow onion, diced
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Preheat a large skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and coriander seeds; cook, stirring occasionally, until toasted and fragrant, about 1 minute.
Transfer cumin seeds and coriander seeds to a mortar; crush with a pestle. Add rose buds and crush to a powder. Mix in red pepper flakes and paprika with a spoon.
Place cauliflower in a food processor; pulse into grains the size of rice.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in the skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in riced cauliflower until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle cumin mixture evenly over cauliflower and stir to distribute evenly. Remove from heat and cover; let "couscous" steam for 5 minutes.
Sprinkle cilantro over couscous. Fluff with a fork and drizzle extra-virgin olive oil on top.
