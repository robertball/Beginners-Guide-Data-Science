Ingredients:
1 block of cream cheese
1 can of pitted black olives, drained
1 can of sundried tomatos in oil, drained
5-8 garlic cloves, depending on how much you love garlic!

Directions:
Put block of cream cheese on plate and set aside.  Combine remaining ingredients in food processor until finely diced, not liquefied.
Scoop over cream cheese block and gently form a mold with your spoon around the cream cheese.  This can be served right away, but is even better if it sits in the fridge for a few hours marinating.
