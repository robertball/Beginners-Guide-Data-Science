Ingredients:
2 cups almond flour
1/2 cup tapioca flour
1/2 cup coconut palm sugar, plus more for sprinkling
1/4 cup coconut flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon sea salt
6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes
2 large eggs at room temperature
1/3 cup unsweetened coconut cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1 cup diced fresh peaches

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Stir almond flour, tapioca flour, 1/2 cup coconut sugar, coconut flour, baking powder, and sea salt together in a bowl using a fork to break any lumps of baking powder. Cut butter into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter.
Beat eggs, coconut cream, vanilla extract, cardamom, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl until smooth; pour into the flour mixture and stir with a spatula just until evenly moistened and sticky. Gently fold diced peach into the mixture.
Shape the dough into a ball and move to the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle coconut sugar over the top of the dough ball. Press dough into a somewhat flattened disc.
Bake in preheated oven until surface is dried, about 10 minutes. Cut the disc into 8 wedges and continue baking until golden brown on top, 10 to 15 minutes more. Let cool on sheet for 5 minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
You may have noticed a few peach recipes lately! I am enjoying eating them and cooking with them! I hope you love my paleo peach scones as much as we do! I even spread a little almond butter on mine when they were warm.
