Description: 
Hubby and I were at the Farmers Market and picked up tons of fresh vegetables, fish dip and a leg of lamb for Easter and a few tenderloins.  Last night I really wanted salmon and I created this amazing side dish and it's Paleo for you to enjoy!

I used only 3 tablespoons of organic cheddar for the au gratin and wow was this a perfect side.  I hope we have left overs as it will be all stored together and enjoyed for lunch today!
