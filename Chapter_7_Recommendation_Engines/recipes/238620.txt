Ingredients:
4 large baking potatoes, scrubbed
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
6 cups baby spinach leaves
1 (15 ounce) jar ClassicoÂ® Fresh Creamy Alfredo Sauce
1 roma (plum) tomato, diced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place rack in the center of the oven.
Arrange potatoes on a baking sheet. Bake until easily pierced with a fork, 50 minutes to an hour.
Heat butter and olive oil in skillet over medium heat. Saute mushrooms until they begin to soften and brown. Add spinach; cook and stir until spinach is wilted, 3 to 4 minutes.
Stir in the Classico(R) Fresh Creamy Alfredo Sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook about 5 minutes to slightly thicken the sauce.
Cut a slit in the potatoes and squeeze the sides to loosen the flesh. To serve, pour some of the creamy spinach-mushroom sauce into and over the potato. Sprinkle with chopped tomatoes.
