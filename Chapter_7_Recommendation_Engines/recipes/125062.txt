Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar, divided
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter or margarine
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons milk
8 cups thinly sliced peeled baking apples
2 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca
TOPPING:
1 tablespoon milk
3/4 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in butter until crumbly. In another bowl, lightly beat eggs and vanilla; add to crumb mixture. With a fork, gently mix in milk to moisten. Stir until dough forms a ball. Press half of the dough into the bottom of a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Chill the remaining dough. Toss apples with tapioca, cinnamon and remaining sugar; place over dough in pan. On a lightly floured surface, roll chilled dough to fit top of pan. Place over apples. Brush with milk. Combine sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle on top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until apples are tender and crust is golden.
