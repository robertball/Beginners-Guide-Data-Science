Description: 
Basil pesto is one of my favorite foods, especially in the summer. Unfortunately pesto is very high in fat and calories, so I have been working to create a lower fat and calorie version. This pesto is creamy and delicious without the guilt! This recipe is also great with any type of stock or nuts that you have at home.
