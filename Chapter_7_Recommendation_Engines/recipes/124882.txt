Ingredients:
3/4 cup sugar
2/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
1/4 cup orange juice
1/2 cup dark corn syrup
1/2 cup dark molasses
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream sugar and butter. Blend in orange juice, corn syrup and molasses. Combine dry ingredients; add to creamed mixture and mix well. Chill 3-4 hours or overnight. Roll dough, a portion at a time, on a lightly floured surface to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut into desired shapes. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-14 minutes. Cookies will be soft and chewy if baked 12 minutes; crunchy if baked longer.
