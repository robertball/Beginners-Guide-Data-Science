Ingredients:
Lemon Sauce:
2 cups chicken stock
4 tbs lemon juice
3 tbs flour
3 tbs butter
2 tbs Splenda
Chicken:
2 tbs olive oil
1 tbs Garlic; diced
2 tbs Lemon juice
1/2 cup white wine
2 cups Vegetable of choice; Asparagus, broccoli, etc.
4 Boneless chicken breasts; cut into 1/2" cubes

Directions:
Lemon Sauce:
Heat chicken stock and 4 tbs lemon juice in pan to simmer.
In separate pan, melt butter and add flour 1 tbs at a time to make your roux.
Spoon the chicken stock mixture into the roux slowly, stirring with each added portion. Return to pan that stock mixture was in and bring just to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Thin to your liking with 2:1 chicken stock to lemon juice. Stir in Splenda (or sugar).
Chicken:
In a large saute pan, heat olive oil and garlic until oil starts to shimmer. Add diced chicken. When chicken is just cooking, add 2 tbs lemon juice and wine.
If you choose to cook your vegetables with the chicken, put them in just after the wine. Or you can steam the vegetables and add at the end.
Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is nicely browned.
Serve chicken with quinoa, lentils, couscous or rice and drizzle the lemon sauce generously over everything.
