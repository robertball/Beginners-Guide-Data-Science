Ingredients:
1 medium sweet onion, chopped
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1 egg
1 cup cream-style corn
1/3 cup milk
2 drops hot pepper sauce
1 (8.5 ounce) package corn bread/muffin mix
1 cup sour cream
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dill weed

Directions:
In a skillet, saute onion in butter until tender; set aside. In a bowl, combine egg, corn, milk and hot pepper sauce; stir in muffin mix just until moistened. Pour into a greased 8-in. square baking pan. Combine sour cream, 1/2 cup cheese, salt, dill and sauteed onion; spoon over batter. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake at 425 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cut into squares; serve warm.
