Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups fresh pumpkin seeds, washed and dried
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon curry powder
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Combine pumpkin seeds, brown sugar, cinnamon, and curry powder in a bowl. Add vegetable oil gradually, until lightly coated. Spread seeds evenly on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove the sheet from the oven and flip the seeds. Continue baking, flipping seeds every 10 minutes, until crunchy and golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
