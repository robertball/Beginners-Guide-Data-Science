Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup miniature chocolate chips
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1 egg yolk
4 (1 ounce) squares semisweet baking chocolate, chopped
6 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons seedless raspberry jam
1 cup frozen whipped topping, thawed
2 drops red food coloring (optional)
16 chocolate curls (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Line an 8 inch square baking pan with aluminum foil.
In a large mixing bowl, beat the sugar, 2 whole eggs, and vanilla until combined. Mix in butter. In another bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt; stir into butter mixture, mixing just until incorporated.  Fold in the chocolate chips.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs attached, 25 to 30 minutes.  Cool pan on wire rack.
Whisk together the evaporated milk and egg yolk in a small saucepan.  Heat over medium low, stirring constantly, until the mixture is very hot and thickens slightly; do not boil.  Place the 4 ounces of chopped semisweet chocolate in a medium bowl, and slowly pour in the hot milk.  Stir until the chocolate is melted and smooth.  Pour the filling over the cooled brownies; refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.
Beat the cream cheese with the raspberry jam in a large bowl until smooth.  Fold in the whipped topping, and add the food coloring if desired.  Top the cooled brownies with the frosting, using a cake comb to create a design.  Cut brownies into 16 squares, then cut each square in half diagonally to form triangles.  Garnish with chocolate curls if desired.

Description: 
These moist chocolate brownies are topped with a rich fudge layer and a fluffy raspberry cream cheese frosting. To make them even prettier, I like to garnish them with chocolate curls.
