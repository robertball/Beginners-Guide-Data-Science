Ingredients:
2 oz. whole butter
2 oz. all-purpose flour
1 quart heavy cream
1/2 cup Pecorino Romano, plus 1 tablespoon for garnish
Salt & pepper
14 oz. sliced roasted turkey breast
2 slices Texas toast (or any thick-sliced toast), crust trimmed
4 slices of bacon, cooked until crisp
2 tomatoes, sliced or halved
Paprika and chopped parsley, for garnish

Directions:
1.In a two-quart saucepan, melt butter and slowly whisk in flour until combined and forms a thick paste (roux). Continue to cook roux for two minutes over medium-low heat, stirring frequently. Whisk whipping cream into the roux and cook over medium heat until the cream begins to simmer, about 2-3 minutes. Remove sauce from heat and slowly whisk in Pecorino Romano cheese until the Mornay sauce is smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste.
2.For each hot brown, place one slice of toast in an oven safe dish and cover with 7 ounces of turkey. Take the two halves of Roma tomato and set them alongside the base of turkey and toast. Next, pour one half of the Mornay sauce to completely cover the dish. Sprinkle with additional Pecorino Romano cheese. Place entire dish under a broiler until cheese begins to brown and bubble. Remove from broiler, cross two pieces of crispy bacon on top, sprinkle with paprika and parsley, and serve immediately.
