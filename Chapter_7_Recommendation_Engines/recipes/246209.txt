Ingredients:
2 tablespoons liquid egg substitute
1 tablespoon vanilla-flavored soy milk (such as SilkÂ®)
1 dash vanilla extract
1 dash ground cinnamon
1 banana, thinly sliced
2 slices whole wheat bread
cooking spray

Directions:
Combine egg substitute, soy milk, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a shallow dish.
Overlap banana slices over 1 slice of bread. Place second slice of bread on top and press down so sandwich holds together. Dip sandwich in egg mixture and coat both sides.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat; spray with cooking spray. Place sandwich in hot skillet and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Flip it over carefully and cook second side until browned, about 3 minutes more.

Description: 
This is something I just tinkered with until it came out to my liking. I tried it with jelly on the inside, but I couldn't taste it, so I just decided to leave the jelly out. The bananas still stay in between the bread without it. It's very delicious and low-fat as well. It doesn't even need syrup.
