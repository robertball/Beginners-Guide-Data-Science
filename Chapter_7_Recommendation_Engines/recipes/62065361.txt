Ingredients:
1 1/4 C very warm (but not hot) water
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/6 C sugar
3 Tablespoons melted butter
3 egg yolks
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups flour
1 beaten egg (for eggwash)

Directions:
1) In a large bowl, combine yeast, water, and sugar. Whisk until dissolved.
2) Beat in egg yolks and melted butter.
3) Add salt and flour, mixing after each cup.
4) Once dough is firm enough to be handled, turn onto a floured work surface, and knead for 5-10 minutes, sprinkling with as little additional flour as necessary to keep it from sticking. Dough should be smooth and somewhat elastic, but not rubbery.
5) Rub with a few pinches of flour and return to bowl. Cover loosely with damp towel and allow it to rise for about 2 hours, until a fingerprint left in the top does not spring back.
6) Uncover and punch down.
7) Divide into 3 (or as many strands as you wish to braid) parts, and roll into "snakes" 1-2 inches thick. If dough begins to tear, allow to relax for a minute or two, then resume forming. Pinch edges of strands together and braid.
8) Lightly spray challah and a sheet of plastic wrap with cooking spray (i.e. PAM). Loosely cover dough with plastic and allow to rise for an additional 2 hours.
9) Preheat oven to 425 F.
10) Brush a generous coat of eggwash over challah, using as much of the egg as possible.
11) Bake for the first 5 minutes at 425, then turn down oven to 375 and continue baking for 30-40 minutes. Finished loaf should make a thumping sound when you knock on its bottom.
12) Cool completely before serving.

Description: 
This recipe has evolved over many weeks practice, and continues to do so. so far, this is the incarnation that tastes the most like the challah i grew up with. however, if and when i find another variation that works well, it will become version 2.0
