Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 yellow onion, chopped
1 large carrot, chopped
1 (10 ounce) can golden corn, drained
salt and pepper to taste
5 cups chicken broth
1 (15.5 ounce) can white beans
1 cup diced fresh tomatoes
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried summer savory
1 teaspoon dried parsley

Directions:
Heat oil in a large stock pot over medium-high heat. Saute garlic and onion until tender, approximately 5 minutes. Stir in carrot and corn, season with salt and pepper, and cook another 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in chicken broth, beans, tomatoes, thyme, savory, and parsley, and bring to a low boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook approximately one hour.
Separate soup into 2 equal portions, and allow to cool to room temperature. Once cooled, puree half of the batch in a blender or food processor until smooth. Return both batches to the stockpot, and heat until warmed through. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. Serve hot.
