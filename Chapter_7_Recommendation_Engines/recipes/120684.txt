1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup milk

1 egg, beaten
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the milk, mayonnaise and egg; mix just until combined. Fold in the cheese and onions. Spoon into a greased 9-in. round baking pan.
Bake at 425 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Refrigerate any leftovers.
