Ingredients:
1 cup butter, at room temperature
¾ cup brown sugar
⅓ cup white sugar
¼ cup instant coffee powder
2  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
¾ cup cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
½ cup white sugar
24  dark chocolate wafers

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Combine butter, brown sugar, 1/3 cup sugar, and coffee powder in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Blend in eggs and vanilla extract. Mix in flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together until dough is uniform.
Pour 1/2 cup sugar onto a shallow plate. Shape dough into 2-inch balls and roll in the sugar until coated. Arrange on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, about 10 minutes. Immediately press a dark chocolate wafer into each cookie. Let cool on a wire rack.
