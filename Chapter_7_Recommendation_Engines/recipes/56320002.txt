Ingredients:
2 teaspoons blackening seasoning
2 teaspoons lemon pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
salt
1 teaspoons pepper
1 pound catfish fillets
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup Italian-style salad dressing

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.
In a shallow, medium bowl, mix blackening seasoning, lemon pepper, garlic powder, salt and pepper.
Brush both sides of catfish fillets with butter. Rub fillets with the pepper mixture on both sides.
Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat until really hot. Add fillets, and fry approximately 2 minutes on each side, until slightly blackened.
Arrange blackened fillets in a single layer in the prepared baking dish, and coat with Italian-style salad dressing. Bake 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until fish is easily flaked with a fork.
