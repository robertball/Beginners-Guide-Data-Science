1 pound ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can chicken noodle soup
3/4 cup instant rice

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook the ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat until the beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes; season with salt and black pepper.
Drain excess grease from the ground beef mixture; transfer to a casserole dish.
Stir the cream of chicken soup, chicken noodle soup, and instant rice through the ground beef mixture; season again with salt and black pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges begin to bubble, 40 to 45 minutes.

My mom used to make this before little league games. It's an oldie but probably still my favorite home-cooked dish.  Its simple, quick, and everyone loves it!
