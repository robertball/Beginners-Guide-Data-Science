Image:

Ingredients:
water
chicken soup base to taste
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
6 carrots-diced
6 Celery stalks-diced
1 Onion-diced
1 teaspoon diced garlic
1 Tablespoon dried tarragon
2 Teaspoons dried basil
1 cup uncooked long grain rice
Pepper to taste

Directions:
I fill a dutch oven or small stock pot about 3/4's full with water and mix the soup base in it.  Depending on how salty you like your soup, will depend on how much of the soup base you need to add.
Add the spices.
Add uncooked chicken breasts and boil until completely cooked through and remove from fluid.  Leave fluid onto simmer.
While fluid is simmering, I dice up and add all the veggies.
Dice up the Chicken and add to soup.
Add uncooked rice and allow soup to continue to simmer until thickened.
This makes a very thick soup--with a bite of something in every spoonful.  If too thick, add more water or chicken broth.

Description: 
When I make this soup, I always get rave reviews.  The tarragon gives it a special taste.  Tastes great the next day for left overs!!  To be honest I don't measure the ingredients when I make this recipe, so this is my best guess at how much of each I use.
