Ingredients:
Olive oil
1 lb lean ground beef
1 lb Italian sausage
1 medium onion, diced
2 green peppers, finely diced
1/2 lb mushrooms, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 28-oz can tomato sauce
1 15-oz can tomato sauce
1 28-oz can crushed tomatoes
1 3-oz can tomato paste
1 Tbsp dried oregano
2 Tbsp dried parsley
1 Tbsp dried basil
Pinch of garlic powder
2 Tbsp red or white wine vinegar
1 Tbsp to 1/4 cup sugar, to taste (optional)
Salt
Pepper
1 lb dry lasagna noodles (total of 18 noodles)
2 15-oz containers of ricotta cheese
3 lb mozzarella cheese, grated
8 oz Parmesan cheese, grated

Directions:
1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet, and brown ground beef and sausage; drain. In drippings, add onion, green pepper, mushrooms, and garlic- saute until softened. Add meats and vegetables to large pot. Add all ingredients through salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and simmer, stirring frequently for an hour (this part may be prepared in advance in a crockpot, if desired).
2. When ready to assemble: Cook lasagna noodles as directed on box; drain. Set the oven to 375 degrees. Assemble as follows in 2 13x9 baking pans:
*Ladle one cup of sauce in each baking pan, and spread it around in the pans.
*Layer 3 noodles in pan, overlapping the edges to fit if necessary.
*Ladle a third of remaining sauce over noodles.
*Apply a third of the mozzarella cheese.
*Dollop 1/2 of the ricotta cheese on top, about 2 inches apart (it will spread as it bakes).
*Sprinkle 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese over.
*3 noodles on each pan
*Half of the remaining sauce
*Half of the remaining mozzarella cheese
*Dollop on the rest of the ricotta cheese
*Sprinkle on the rest of the Parmesan cheese
*Layer on the remaining noodles, and spread on the last of the sauce. Top with the remaining mozzarella cheese.
Tent lasagna pan with aluminum foil (don't let it touch the lasagna, or all of the cheese will stick to the foil.) Bake for 45 minutes. Allow to cool before serving, so it has a chance to set up in the pan a little.
