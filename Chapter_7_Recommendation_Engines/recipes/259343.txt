Description: 
Creamy herb paste/sauce perfect for all seasons! Main dish or side dish your guests (and yourself) will love. I made this on a whim when I ran out of basil. In my opinion I like this better than traditional pesto. It's perfect for short pasta shapes. Amount it serves is up to how much you use for your meal.
