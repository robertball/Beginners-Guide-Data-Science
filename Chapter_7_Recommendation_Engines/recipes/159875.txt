Ingredients:
1 (32 ounce) container plain whole-milk yogurt
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
2 tablespoons sliced almonds

Directions:
Line a large strainer with a large coffee filter, or several layers of cheesecloth. Pour the yogurt into the lined strainer, and set it over a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until the yogurt has reached the consistency of soft cream cheese, about 8 hours.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch pie tin.
Discard the liquid that has drained from the yogurt. Place the yogurt into the bowl, and whisk in the condensed milk. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until the mixture is firm and the top is lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, and sprinkle almonds over top. Cool to room temperature before slicing into wedges and serving.

Description: 
This is a light and tasty cheesecake-like desert. This version is ridiculously easy and was made for me by my friend Anu Choudhury in Mexico City.
