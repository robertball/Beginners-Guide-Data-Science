Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (18 ounce) jar peanut butter
1/2 cup butter
1/3 cup milk
10 large marshmallows
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x15-inch jellyroll pan.
Melt 1 cup butter and 1/3 cup cocoa powder together in a saucepan over low heat, stirring often, until smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.
Combine white sugar, flour, and salt together in a large bowl; add chocolate mixture. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until blended, 1 to 2 minutes. Add eggs and vanilla extract; stir until combined. Pour batter into prepared jellyroll pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges begin to become crisp, about 20 minutes.
Warm peanut butter in microwave for about 2 minutes, stirring once. Spread over warm brownies. Chill brownies in refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Heat 1/2 cup butter, milk, and marshmallows in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until marshmallows are melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; whisk in 1/4 cup cocoa. Gradually stir confectioners' sugar into marshmallow mixture until smooth. Spread frosting over peanut butter layer of brownies. Chill in refrigerator until set, about 20 minutes.
