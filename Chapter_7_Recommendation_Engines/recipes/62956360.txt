Ingredients:
1 bag frozen seasoned curly fries
2-3 cups chopped or shredded cooked chicken, pork, or beef
1 lb frozen green beans (or leftover veggies from previous dinner)
1 can of condensed cream based soup (such as cream of mushroom, celery, etc.)
1 tsp worcestershire sauce
1/4 c. sour cream
1 Tbs dried onion flakes
2 cups shredded cheese (your choice, but I like cheddar)

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 degrees.  Spread curly fries on a baking sheet.  When oven is hot, bake curly fries for 10 minutes.  After baking fries, remove from oven and lower oven temperature to 350 degrees.
While fries are cooking, heat beans in a covered dish in the microwave for 5 minutes,or until warm.  Mix beans, condensed soup, sour cream, onion flakes, worcestershire sauce together an place in a large casserole dish.  Spread chopped meat over the bean mixture.  If your meat was not already well-seasoned, add spices or salt and pepper to improve the flavor.  Sprinkle half the cheese over meat.  Place casserole in oven for 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes, add fries to the top of the casserole, and continue baking 20 minutes or until bubbly.  Add remaining cheese on top of fries, and return to the oven for 2-3 minutes.

Description: 
This is an easy dinner that kids (and the guys) seem to love.  It's not gourmet,but it effectively hides those leftovers that nobody wants to eat again.
