Ingredients:
1 (4 ounce) fillet swai fish
3/8 cup Catalina salad dressing
1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as SrirachaÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/8 teaspoon sea salt
3/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon mustard powder
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
Place a large piece of aluminum foil on a work surface; pinch edges together forming a boat-like shape to contain liquids. Pour Catalina dressing in the middle of the aluminum foil. Place fish fillet in the dressing, turning to coat fish in dressing completely.
Mix chile-garlic sauce, garlic powder, ground black pepper, sea salt, red pepper flakes, mustard powder, and white pepper together in a small bowl. Coat both sides of fish fillet with spice mixture. Wrap aluminum foil around coated fish fillet and dressing, sealing the edges together.
Cook fish on the preheated grill until opaque and flakes easily with a fork, 8 to 12 minutes.

Description: 
Tasty grilled fish fillet with a tantalizing color and zesty, zingy taste. I love to experiment with grilling fish and marinades, and this is one I've recently come up with. Recipe also works well with trout; haven't tried it with other types of fish, though. If cooking more than one fish, grill each in separate foil to preserve flavor.
