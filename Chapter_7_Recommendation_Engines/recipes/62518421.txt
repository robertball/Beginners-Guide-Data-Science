Ingredients:
Pastry
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup butter, cold, cut in cubes
1 cup cream cheese, cold, cut in cubes
Filling
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup finely chopped toasted pecans
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 cup raspberry jam
Glaze
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup coarse sugar

Directions:
Instructions:
Step 1: Place flour in a food processor or large bowl. Cut butter into flour until crumbly. Cut cream cheese into mixture and combine to form a dough. (If you are doing this in a food processor be careful not to overprocess.) Divide dough into 4 balls and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for a few hours or overnight.
Step 2: In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, pecans and cinnamon.
Step 3: Roll each ball of dough into 10" circle. Spread each circle with about 2 tbsp jam and sprinkle with 1/4 of brown-sugar mixture.
Step 4: Cut each circle into 12 wedges. Roll up each wedge from the wide end. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Step 5: Brush each cookie with beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Bake in a preheated 350ÂºF oven for 20-25 minutes, or until browned and crusty. Cookies can also be frozen baked or unbaked. Bake unbaked cookies directly from the frozen state; they may take a few minutes longer to cook.
Makes 48 cookies
