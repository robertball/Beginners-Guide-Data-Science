Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) box whole wheat rotini pasta
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons white vinegar
lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon honey
2 avocados - peeled, pitted, and chopped
1 green bell pepper, sliced
1 large carrot, cut into matchstick-size pieces
6 green onions, sliced
1 stalk celery, sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon lemon zest
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes; drain and run under cold water to prevent sticking.
Whisk olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, and honey together in a bowl until dressing is smooth.
Mix pasta, avocados, green bell pepper, carrot, green onions, celery, garlic, basil, parsley, and cilantro together in a bowl. Drizzle dressing over pasta mixture and toss to coat. Add lemon zest, salt, and pepper to pasta salad. Serve at room temperature.

Description: 
This dish incorporates one of my favorite things in the universe, avocado, into a side dish with other fresh vegetables.  It also works as a vegan main course dish.
