Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/4 cups vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 eggs, beaten
3 1/2 cups apples, peeled and chopped
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 1/4 cups packed brown sugar
1/3 cup milk
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch pan.
In a large bowl, sift together flour, sugar, salt, and baking soda. Make a well in the center and add oil, eggs, and vanilla. Mix well (batter will be thick). Fold in chopped apples and nuts. Spread batter into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Glaze while still hot.
To make the glaze: In a saucepan, combine brown sugar, milk, and butter. Bring to a boil and continue cooking for 2 1/2 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour over cake while still hot.
