Ingredients:
21 ounces cauliflower, including stalks
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
1/3 cup diced onion
1/3 cup chopped celery
1/3 cup diced carrot
1/3 cup peas
7.5 ounces chicken breast
1.5 ounces diced bacon
2 ounces cremini mushrooms
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
2 Tbs cornstarch + 1.5 Tbsp water
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 50°C. Put the cauliflower into the bowl of a food processor and pulse until it resembles rice. Transfer to a bowl and microwave for 5 minutes. Set aside. Let the cauliflower cool completely, approx 10 minutes.
Place the cauliflower rice in a cheesecloth. Squeeze out as much water as possible. You need the cauliflower to be as dry as possible to insure that it crisps during the cooking process. Spread the cauliflower onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Put into the warm oven and allow to bake for 15 minutes, stirring at 8 minutes.
Remove the cauliflower, stirring to mix and dry as it cools. Turn up the oven to 200°C to preheat.
Put the cooled cauliflower rice into a bowl. Add 1/2 cup shredded cheese, the egg, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp ground black pepper. Mix until completely combined. Press the mixture into an 8-inch round, non-stick, baking pan. Press into the bottom and around the edges to form a crust. Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 25 minutes.
Heat a cast iron skillet on medium-high heat. Add the bacon, sautéing until the fat has rendered. Add the onion, carrot, and celery sautéing until soft, add chicken and cook until cooked throughout. Add peas and mushrooms cooking until heated through and the mushrooms soften.
Add the chicken broth, cream, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper. Stir well and reduce heat. Simmer at a low boil until the sauce has reduced by one-fourth.
Mix together the corn starch and water to create a slurry. Add it slowly to the chicken, stirring constantly. Stir until thickened.
Pour the chicken mixture into the cauliflower crust. Top with remaining 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese and place under the broiler until browned and bubbling.
Allow to cool about 5 minutes before serving.
