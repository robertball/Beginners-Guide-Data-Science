Ingredients:
1 cabbage (roughly 1 pound)
2 cloves garlic
1 tablespoon Soya sauce (or to taste)
1 tablespoon cooking oil
1 tablespoon Chinese cooking wine (or rice wine)

Directions:
Cut the cabbage into desired size. Personally, I prefer to tear them apart using my hands.
Dice the garlic.
Heat frying wok or pan with medium fire (make sure you are using a gas stove).
When the wok is hot, add cooking oil and diced garlic and stir-fry for about 10 seconds.
Add in cabbage, and cover the wok for about 1 minute.
Uncover, add in soya sauce and stir-fry the contents for another minute.
Turn fire to maximum, add in Chinese cooking wine, flip the wok a few times to create a bit of fire effect in the wok.
Serve.

Description: 
A very simple stir-fry dish. The reason for using only soya sauce for stir-frying cabbage is that it brings out the natural sweetness in the cabbage itself.
