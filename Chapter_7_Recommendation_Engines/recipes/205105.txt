Ingredients:
Crust:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 envelope Fleischmann's® Pizza Crust Yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup very warm water (120 degrees to 130 degrees F)*
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Toppings:
1/4 cup pizza sauce
1/4 cup ketchup
1 tablespoon prepared mustard
1/4 cup diced onions
8 ounces ground beef, cooked and crumbled
Spice Islands® Fine Grind Black Pepper
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or as needed
12 dill pickle slices

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Combine 1 cup flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add very warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Dough should form a ball and will be slightly sticky. Knead** on a floured surface, adding additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes.
Pat dough with floured hands to fill greased pizza pan or baking sheet. OR roll dough on a floured counter to 12-inch circle; place in greased pizza pan or baking sheet. Form a rim by pinching the edge of the dough.
Combine pizza sauce, ketchup and mustard; spread over crust. Sprinkle with onions and ground beef. Season to taste with black pepper. Evenly sprinkle cheese over pizza; top with dill pickle slices.
Bake on lowest oven rack for 12 to 15 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and crust is browned.
