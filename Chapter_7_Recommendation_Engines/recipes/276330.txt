Ingredients:
4 cups canned coconut milk, shaken
1/4 cup cane sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup long grain white rice

Directions:
Combine coconut milk, sugar, and vanilla extract in a medium pot and stir until combined. Add rice and bring to a boil over medium heat, about 5 minutes. Cook, gently stirring, until rice has softened and mixture has a slightly soupy but not too drippy consistency, about 20 minutes.
Spoon into small serving dishes. Serve warm or place in refrigerator to chill.
