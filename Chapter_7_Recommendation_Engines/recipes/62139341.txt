Ingredients:
1 wheel of brie
2 tsp brown sugar
1/3 cup (approx) chopped walnuts
1/4 to 1/3 cup Grand Marnier

Directions:
Place the wheel of brie on a cookie sheet and slice the top back and forth with a knife.  Sprinkle with brown sugar and the chopped nuts.  Drizzle with the Grand Marnier.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees, and cook, uncovered, for approximately 15 to 18 minutes - just until brie is softened, but not overflowing the rind.
Serve on a plate with apple slices and crackers or a sliced baguette.
