Ingredients:
3 cups uncooked wagon wheel pasta
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon minced garlic
1/8 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper
1/2 pound ground beef
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons seasoned bread crumbs
1 1/2 cups meatless spaghetti sauce
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat the egg, salt, garlic and pepper. Add beef and mix well. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs; mix gently.
Crumble beef mixture into a large skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the spaghetti sauce. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 2-4 minutes or until heated through.
Drain pasta; place in a serving bowl. Add beef mixture; sprinkle with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Toss until pasta is well coated and cheese is melted. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella.

Description: 
'Our three kids just love the fun wagon wheel shapes in this quick-and-easy recipe,' relates Janine Freeman from Blaine, Washington. 'The mildly seasoned sauce is something that even the pickiest eaters enjoy.' TIP: For variety, try it with Italian sausage instead of ground beef, Janine recommends.
