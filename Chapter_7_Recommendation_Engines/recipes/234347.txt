Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 cup fresh bread crumbs
2 eggs
4 ounces crumbled blue cheese
1/2 cup diced onion
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with aluminum foil.
Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, eggs, blue cheese, onion, pepper, and salt together in a bowl; shape into 22 meatballs and arrange onto prepared pan.
Bake meatballs until they are very firm, hot, and grey in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
Juicy meatballs with tasty bursts of blue cheese and onion. My own recipe, and my husband absolutely loves them.
Good enough to eat alone. 
I personally think they would also be good in hoagie sandwiches.
