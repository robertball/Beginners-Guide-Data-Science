Directions:
Preheat oven to 375Â° F.

In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
In a large 4-cup measuring cup, mix together the bananas, sugar, egg and butter.
Pour the wet into the dry mixing only until all is moist.
Spoon into muffin tins.
Sprinkle with brown sugar and walnuts.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes for mini muffins (or 18 to 20 minutes for regular sized muffins.)
