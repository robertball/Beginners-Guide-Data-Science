Ingredients:
2 pounds new red potatoes
3 eggs
3/4 pound thick cut bacon
1/2 cup sliced black olives, drained
1/2 cup diced green onions, divided
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cup sour cream
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Boil potatoes until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and dice.
Place eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and dice.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and crumble.
In a large bowl, mix together the potatoes, eggs, bacon, olives, 1/4 cup green onions, mayonnaise, sour cream, salt and pepper. Increase quantities of mayonnaise and sour cream as necessary to create desired consistency. Garnish with remaining green onions.
