Shape the rolls at once or kneed down dough and let rise again 1/2 hour if you want to make rolls. Bake in an over at 350 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown
If you want fried dough, cut off pieces and fry them in a skillet or deep fryer with canola and olive oil until puffed and floating to the surface.
Put finished dough in a greased bowl and turn the bread upside down to grease it on both sides.

Description: 
This recipe is a family favorite passed down to me by my Grandma Doris from Illinois. At catfish fries at my uncle's house, us cousins would beg Grandma to make this recipe to go with the fish. It usually never even made it to the plate with the fish, as we stood around her and snatched finished pieces like vultures! It's a great family memory from my childhood, and I am glad she made me a hand made copy of it before she died. It was especially good served with her homemade raspberry jam.
