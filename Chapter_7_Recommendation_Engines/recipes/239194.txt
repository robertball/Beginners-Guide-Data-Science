Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) salmon fillets
3 tablespoons barbeque sauce
2 tablespoons coarse-grain mustard
2 tablespoons white wine
4 teaspoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking dish with aluminum foil.
Place salmon into the prepared baking dish. Stir barbeque sauce, mustard, white wine, soy sauce, and maple syrup together in a small bowl; pour mixture over salmon.
Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
My favorite salmon recipe. The sweetness of the BBQ sauce and syrup balances nicely with the grainy mustard and white wine.
