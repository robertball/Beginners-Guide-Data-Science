Ingredients:
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 pounds pork tenderloin, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes
3/4 cup tzatziki sauce
6 Greek pita breads
3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
6 cherry tomatoes, sliced

Directions:
Whisk together lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add pork and stir to coat. Let marinate for at least 10 minutes.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Drain and discard excess marinade from pork. Cook pork in the hot skillet until cooked through and juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Spread tzatziki sauce over each pita round. Divide feta cheese evenly among pitas. Divide pork among pitas. Sprinkle each pita with sliced tomatoes. Fold pitas over and serve.
