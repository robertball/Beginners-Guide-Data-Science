Ingredients:
2 ears fresh corn, shucked
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 large avocados
7 ounces black beans, rinsed and drained
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and finely chopped
1 small bunch cilantro, roughly chopped
2 limes
1 pinch sea salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
12 corn tortillas
Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium-high heat.
Brush corn with olive oil and individually wrap with Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil. Place on the grill, turning frequently for 20 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before handling.
Cut corn off the cob and combine with black beans, jalapeno, cilantro and the juice of 1 lime. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.
Slice avocados in half and remove the seeds but do not remove the skin yet. Squeeze the juice of the remaining lime over the avocados and lightly brush them with olive oil.
Grill flesh side down for 2 to 3 minutes and then remove. Quarter each avocado half and then carefully peel off the skin.
Wrap tortillas in foil and place on the grill while the avocados are cooking.
Build tacos by placing avocado slices on tortillas and then top with the corn and salsa.
Serve with your favorite hot sauce and additional lime wedges.
