Ingredients:
2 large plantains, peeled and broken into chunks
2 eggs
1 tablespoon olive oil, or more to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.
Blend plantain, eggs, olive oil, and salt in a food processor until smooth, scraping down sides occasionally. Spread plantain mixture into a rectangle about 1/2-inch thick onto the prepared baking sheet; sprinkle salt over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until bread is lightly browned and holds together, about 15 minutes. Cool on pan for about 5 minutes before slicing with a pizza cutter.
