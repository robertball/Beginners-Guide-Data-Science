Ingredients:
SUPPLIES:
Popsicle sticks
One dozen small paper cups
INGREDIENTS:
1 cup of lime juice
12 oz. of sweet condensed milk
3/4 cup of water
A "shot" of tequila, or enough to taste/preference
4 lemons or limes for reinforcing/holding the popsicle sticks
Margarita salt, to taste/preference

Directions:
Mix the lime juice, condensed milk, water, and tequila together.
Fill each small paper cup near-full with the lime juice/milk/water & tequila cocktail, leaving about half of an inch between the liquid and the lip of each cup.
Cut your 4 lemons/limes into twelve total thin discs. Spear the popsicle sticks through the middle of each lemon/lime disc, so that the discs sit evenly in the center of each stick length.
Place one lemon/lime stick into each small paper cup containing the lime juice/milk/water & tequila cocktail, so that your lemon/lime is sitting on top of the liquid and half of the stick is submerged.
Freeze these for about eight hours, then rip & peel the paper cups off of the popsicles before consuming. Dip them just slightly in the margarita salt for extra flavor, if you wish!
