Ingredients:
3 pounds ground chuck
1 chopped white onion
2 cups minute rice
65 ounces tomato sauce
27 ounces sauerkraut
1 cup water
1 small head of cabbage chopped
¼ tsp garlic powder
2 tsp salt
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp cayenne pepper
3 tsp paprika

Directions:
Brown chuck and onion together and drain. Return to pot. Add all other ingredients and cook over low heat 3 – 4 hours until cabbage is tender. You can add more water if it thickens too much. Omit cayenne pepper if you don’t like it spicy like I do.
