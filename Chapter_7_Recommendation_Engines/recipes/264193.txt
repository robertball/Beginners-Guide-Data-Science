Description: 
Light vegan cheesecake... zero sugar added! 
These low-calorie, decadent-tasting vegan cheesecake cups taste like the love child of a regular cheesecake and ice cream cake! For storing, I line a plastic container with parchment paper, arrange the little cakes in a single layer without touching. They keep beautifully in the fridge for a whole week and can be stored in freezer for a month if kept in molds with plastic wrap on.
