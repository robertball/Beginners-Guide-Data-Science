Ingredients:
1 pound whole wheat fettuccine pasta
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 white onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon ground thyme
1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups shredded cooked chicken
1 1/2 cups frozen peas

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a separate pot over medium-low heat. Cook and stir onion in the oil until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes, adding 1/4 cup water if it starts to burn. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add butter and let melt, about 1 minute.
Cook flour in the hot butter for about 2 minutes. Stir in basil, thyme, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. Pour in milk and turn heat up to medium, continually stirring. Cook until sauce is thickened, 3 to 5 minutes; reduce heat to low, making sure it does not boil. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Stir in chicken and peas and heat through, 3 to 4 minutes.
Drain water from cooked pasta and transfer pasta into the sauce; stir to combine.
