Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup sugar
3 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon orange extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup dried cranberries, coarsley chopped
2/3 cup pistachios, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons grated orange peel

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in extracts. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well (dough will be sticky). Stir in cranberries, pistachios and orange peel. Chill for 30 minutes.
Divide dough in half. On a floured surface, shape each half into a loaf 1-1/2 to 2-in. diameter. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes.
Cool for 5 minutes. Cut diagonally into 3/4-in. thick slices. Place slices, cut side down, on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 9-10 minutes. Turn slices over. Bake 10 minutes more or until golden brown. Cool on wire rack. Store in an airtight container.

Description: 
A twice-baked Italian cookie, biscotti makes a wonderful 'dunker'. A pretty way to present a batch is on a Christmasy plate arranged in a wagon-wheel fashion.
