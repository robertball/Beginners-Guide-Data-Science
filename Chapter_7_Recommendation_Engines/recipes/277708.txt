Ingredients:
1 rack pork baby back ribs
Marinade:
4 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
3 tablespoons white wine
1 tablespoon sesame oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
1/4 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
BBQ Sauce:
3 tablespoons hoisin sauce (such as Lee Kum Kee)
3 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon white wine
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Peel membrane off the bone side of ribs, if desired. Poke meat all over with a fork; place ribs in a resealable plastic zip-top bag.
Mix soy sauce, white wine, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, five-spice, and black pepper together. Pour over the ribs in the bag, seal, and marinate at least 1 hour, ideally overnight. Shake bag occasionally.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove ribs from marinade and place in a greased baking pan. Discard marinade.
Bake in the preheated oven, turning once, until meat pulls away easily from the bone, 50 to 55 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Meanwhile, mix hoisin sauce, honey, sesame oil, wine, brown sugar, five-spice, garlic powder, and pepper together for the BBQ sauce. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Keep ribs wrapped in aluminum foil until ready to grill.
Grill ribs over medium-low to medium heat, brushing with the BBQ sauce, until sauce is thick and ribs are heated through, with some grill marks, 15 to 20 minutes. Do not overcook or they will become dry. Slice before serving.

Description: 
Always the crowd pleaser at any BBQ. Sweet and sticky. This family favorite was handed down to me. I wouldn't do ribs any other way. It's a little involved: overnight marinade, baking, then finishing off on the BBQ, but well worth the effort. And kids love them too! I like to serve this with corn on the cob, an herb or pilaf rice, roasted potatoes, or a salad.
