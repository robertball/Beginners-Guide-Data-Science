Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
2 ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 cup creamy natural peanut butter
2 eggs
1/4 cup flax seed meal
1/4 cup almond flour
1/4 cup plain non-fat Greek-style yogurt
1/4 cup agave nectar
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 tablespoon powdered stevia baking blend
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon maple-flavored extract (optional)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 15 muffin cups or line with aluminum foil liners.
Mix oats, bananas, peanut butter, eggs, flax meal, almond flour, yogurt, agave nectar, vanilla extract, stevia, cinnamon, maple-flavored extract, baking powder, and baking soda in a stand mixer or food processor until batter is smooth. Fill each muffin cup 3/4-full with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool muffins in the muffin cups for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
