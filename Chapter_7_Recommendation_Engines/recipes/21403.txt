Description: 
My Mom created this recipe and I really enjoyed it as a child.  As an adult, my taste changed just a bit so I modified her recipe to 'kick it up' a bit.  It is fabulous even though the ingredients list is quite short!  This is a must make with leftover ham and everyone agrees it's absolutely delicious.
