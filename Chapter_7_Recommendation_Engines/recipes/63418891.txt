Description: 
I make my own sweetened condensed milk with this recipe as well as using our own cooked pumpkin instead of the store's canned pumpkin.  A few times I've layered the pie crust w/mini marshmallows, popped in oven to melt & pour our pie filling.  It's been a big hit during the holidays.  Serve with cool whip.  Enjoy :)
