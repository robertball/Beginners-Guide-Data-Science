Ingredients:
3 cups hot water (to about 110*)
1/3 cup honey
4 tsp yeast
3 cups unbleached all purpose flour
2 cups whole wheat flour
3 Tbsp butter, melted
1 Tbsp salt
2 (+) cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 Tbsp melted butter (to brush on top after baking)

Directions:
Combine water, honey, yeast, all-purpose flour and 2 cups of whole wheat flour in large mixing bowl.  Cover with towel and let rise until full and bubbly.
Stir and deflate.  Transfer to kitchenAid mixer bowl with dough hook.  Add butter, salt and additional flour.  Set to stir and then up to #2.  "Knead" in this way for 5-10 minutes.  Using a strong wooden spoon, "guide" dough off the hook every couple of minutes.  Transfer back to LARGE mixing bowl, cover, and let rise.
Dough should double in size.  Punch down and ball out onto cutting board and divide into two dough balls.  Let rest 5-10 minutes.  Then take out any and all aggression on the dough.  Punch it out.  Really punch out air.  punch each ball for 3-6 minutes.  Form into loaves and place in greased loaf pans.  Cover and let rise until dough is just barely rounded above the sides.
Bake at 350* for 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and brush about 2 Tbsp melted butter on top.  Let cool in pan about 10 minutes and turn out.  Let cool completely.
