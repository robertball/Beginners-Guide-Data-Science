Ingredients:
6 large sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
4 large baking potatoes, peeled and diced
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 tablespoon chopped chives
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 slices crisply cooked bacon, crumbled
2 green onions, finely chopped
1 red onion, finely chopped

Directions:
Place the diced sweet potatoes and potatoes in a Dutch oven, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Boil until the potatoes are fork tender, but not mushy, about 20 minutes. Drain and cool the cooked potatoes slightly.
Meanwhile, mix together the mayonnaise, mustard, balsamic vinegar, turmeric, chives, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add the bacon, green onions, red onion and cooked potatoes and toss to coat. Serve garnished with extra chives or green onion.
