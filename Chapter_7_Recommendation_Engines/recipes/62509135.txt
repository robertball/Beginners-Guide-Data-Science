Ingredients:
250 g of flour
3 eggs
pinch of salt
25 grams of sugar
1/2 l of milk
spoonful of salt

Directions:
stir in a large mixing bowl flour and eggs (my french host grandma always told me to stir in the center of the bowl)
add the salt and sugar little by little
mix in the milk
batter should be a liquid
traditional crepe recipes sit for 4 hours before they are cooked...I never pay attention to this rule
dip a paper towel into some oil and wipe down a skillet (repeat this step between each crepe)
pour a spoonful of crepe batter into the skillet and move it around to cover as much of the pan as possible
once the bottom side starts to brown flip the crepe!
