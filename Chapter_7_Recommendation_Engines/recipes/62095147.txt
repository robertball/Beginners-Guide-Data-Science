Ingredients:
One large ripe honeydew melon
one cup coconut milk ( 1/2 can)
one bunch peppermint
2 jiggers melon liqueur

Directions:
Cut chilled melon and remove seeds. IF desired press seed pith through a sieve and reserve the resulting liquid.
Cut melon into sections and remove the rind with a sharp knife.
In a tall narrow pot (asparagus pot or baine marie) put the chunked melon pieces. Add reserved liquid.
Push an immersion blender to the bottom and puree the melon.
Add the coconut milk and blend again.
Add melon liquere to brighten the light green color and add flavor.
Roll enough mint to have a ball the size of an egg. Tie the mint with kitchen string and drop in the pot.
Ideally chill the soup for two hours or over night.
Remove mint ball before serving.
Use a small ladle to serve into chilled soup cups.
Garnish with a small tip sprig of mint.
Volume varies with the size of the melon. I use 5 0z servings.
