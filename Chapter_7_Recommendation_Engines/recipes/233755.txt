Ingredients:
3 cups crushed strawberries
2/3 cup frozen orange juice concentrate
1/4 cup orange liqueur (optional)
6 cups white sugar
1 (3 ounce) pouch liquid fruit pectin
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 orange, zested
7 half pint canning jars with lids and rings

Directions:
Combine strawberries, orange juice concentrate, and orange liqueur in an 8 to 10-quart pot. Gradually stir sugar into mixture until dissolved. Bring mixture to a boil, continually stirring. Add pectin, vanilla extract, and orange zest; return to a boil and boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat and skim off foam using a metal spoon.
Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 5 minutes.
Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.

Description: 
Tastes just like a strawberry-infused orange creamsicle! Just like dessert. If you like this, you might also like strawberry margarita jam, which I highly recommend!
