Ingredients:
12 new potatoes
1 lemon, sliced
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
2 teaspoons minced garlic
4 (4 ounce) fillets skinless salmon
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups freshly squeezed orange juice
1 cup finely chopped fresh mint, divided
12 broccolini
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, place lemon slices on the bottom of a large skillet. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon ginger and 1 teaspoon garlic over the lemon slices. Season salmon with salt and pepper and place into the skillet. Pour in enough orange juice to just cover the lemon slices. Sprinkle 1/2 cup mint and remaining ginger and garlic on top of the salmon. Place broccolini on top. Cover the skillet.
Steam salmon over medium heat until no longer pink in the middle and flesh flakes easily with a fork, 8 to 10 minutes.
Transfer 5 tablespoons of the orange juice mixture from the skillet to a small bowl. Whisk in remaining mint and olive oil to make a vinaigrette.
Drain potatoes. Serve salmon fillets on a platter with potatoes, broccolini, and vinaigrette on the side.
