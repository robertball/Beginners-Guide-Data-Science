Ingredients:
1 cup canned corn
2 tomatoes, chopped
1 sweet bell pepper, chopped
1/4 red onion, chopped
1 avocado, chopped
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped
2 teaspoons fresh lime juice
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Serve right away or refrigerate for 30 minutes (if you let it sit too long the salsa will become watery and the veggies will soften).

Description: 
This is a very refreshing salsa that goes great with chips, fish, chicken, and is great for BBQ. It's fantastically refreshing and can be altered to your tastes. Try adding some scallions for color and extra zip or some finely chopped jalapeno if you like it spicy. If you don't like avocado - leave it out.
