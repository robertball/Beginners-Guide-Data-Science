Ingredients:
6 sugar ice cream cones
Vegetable cooking spray
All-purpose flour
1/2 (17.3 ounce) package Pepperidge Farm® Puff Pastry Sheets, thawed
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 cup milk
1 (3.4 ounce) package vanilla instant pudding and pie filling mix
3/4 cup canned pumpkin
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 cup caramel topping, warmed
1/2 cup toasted chopped pecans

Directions:
Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Wrap each cone tightly in aluminum foil, covering it completely and tucking any excess foil into the cone cavity. Spray the foil cones with the cooking spray.
Sprinkle the flour on the work surface.  Unfold the pastry sheet on the work surface. Cut the pastry sheet along the fold marks to form 3 rectangles. Cut each rectangle lengthwise into 4 strips, making 12 strips in all.
Press the ends of 2 pastry strips together. Starting at the pointed end of the cone, wind the pastry strip around 1 cone, slightly overlapping edges of pastry (strip will not reach the bottom of the cone). Spray the pastry cone with the cooking spray and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar. Place the pastry cone on its side, with the end of the strip facing down, onto a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pastry strips.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the pastries are golden brown.  Let the pastries cool completely on the baking sheet on a wire rack. Carefully remove the foil cones from the baked pastry.
Beat the milk, pudding mix, pumpkin and cinnamon in a medium bowl with a whisk until the mixture is thickened.
Beat the heavy cream in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the pumpkin mixture. Spoon or pipe the mixture into the pastry cones.
Stir the caramel topping and pecans in a small bowl. Place the pastries onto serving plates and drizzle with the caramel mixture.
