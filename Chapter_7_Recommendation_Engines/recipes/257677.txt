Ingredients:
1 pinch vitamin C powder
5 stalks cardoon, outer membranes and strings peeled
1/4 cup lemon juice
salt
2 eggs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup olive oil for frying

Directions:
Dissolve vitamin C powder in a large bowl of water. Soak cardoon stalks to keep from turning brown, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Bring 2 quarts of water, lemon juice, and salt to a boil in a large pot. Add cardoon stalks; cook until tender yet still firm, 30 to 60 minutes. Drain. Cut into lengths 1/4-inch thick. Cut into 1/8-inch widths.
Whisk eggs, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and parsley together in a large bowl. Mix in flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper. Add cardoons; mix until evenly coated with batter.
Heat olive oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Spoon batter into the hot oil to make 3-inch fritters; cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side.

Description: 
I made up this recipe based on my grandma's zucchini fritter recipe. I have cardoon growing in my garden and wanted to find a good way to use it. This is one of my two favorite ways. The cardoon in the cooler weather (like now in January on the Oregon coast) is not nearly as bitter as the spring. These also make nice appetizers, just make them smaller.
