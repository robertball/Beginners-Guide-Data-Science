Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar, divided
1/2 cup butter
6 fresh peaches - peeled, pitted and halved
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 egg yolks
1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and 2 tablespoons of sugar into a large bowl. Cut in butter by pinching between your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Press into the bottom and up the sides of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place the peach halves cut side up on top of the crust in a nice pattern. Mix together the remaining sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over the peach halves.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven. While the peaches are baking, whisk together the egg yolks and cream in a medium bowl. Pour over the peaches after the 15 minutes are up.
Reduce the oven's temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Return the dish to the oven, and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until golden brown.
