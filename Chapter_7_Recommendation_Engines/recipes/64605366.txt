Ingredients:
DRY
2 cups flour
2 cups yellow corn meal
1 1/3 cup sugar
Sacco buttermilk powder (enough for 2 cups)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
WET
1 cup melted butter
4 eggs
2 cups milk

Directions:
While at home, mix all dry ingredients in a ziplock bag, shake to mix, then pack the ziplock along with the remaining ingredients with your food for camping.
When at camp, start 45 briquettes about an hour prior to meal time. While briquettes are getting hot, double line a deep 12" dutch oven  with hefty aluminum foil. Once briquettes are good and hot,  preheat dutch oven by distributing 23 briquettes on the lid and 7 underneath.  Add another10-12 more briquettes to your chimney to heat up. These briquettes will be used to replenish the heat as needed throughout the baking process.
While dutch oven is preheating, melt butter.
In a medium size bowl, combine all wet ingredients to dry and mix well.
Add 2 tablespoons of butter to the dutch oven. Once it is melted, pour the batter into the dutch oven.
Be sure the briquettes are still hot, if not replace the briquettes with new and cook cornbread for 30-40 minutes until edges are brown and toothpick comes out clean.
