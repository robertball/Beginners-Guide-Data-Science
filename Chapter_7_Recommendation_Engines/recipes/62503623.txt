Ingredients:
Steak-
1 1/2 lb of round steak cut into fairly thin strips about 1 1/2 inches long or so.
2 Tbl cooking oil
1/2 diced onion
1 tsp salt or to your taste
1 tsp pepper or to your taste
1 tbl garlic powder
1 cup of diced carrots
1 can of beef stock or broth
3 cubes of beef bouillion
Dumplings:
2 eggs beaten
1 tsp salt
2 c flour
3/4 water, maybe a little more
1/4 baking powder
Pot of boiling salted water

Directions:
Fry steak in oil with the pepper, salt and garlic powder till no longer pink. Don't drain.
Add carrots, onion and beef stock/broth. I like to also add more salt, pepper and garlic powder too.
Add beef bouillion cubes.
Bring to a slight boil. Cover and simmer on low for at least 1 1/2 hours. Stir occasionally.
When dinner is ready to about go on the table, make your dumplings. Have your boiling water ready. Don't make dumpling mix ahead of time or it will dry out.
Combine all the dumpling ingredients and stir well. You want it to be very thick but moist. Add water by the tsp until you get a thick, moist batter.
Drop tablespoon sized dumpling mix into your boiling, salted water. They will eventually rise to the top. Let them boil for about 4 minutes once risen to the top.
Carefully scoop out dumplings and serve hot!
Excellent with the steak gravy poured over the top.

Description: 
This is a great recipe my Mom used to make. I believe its a Depression Era recipe since its made with round steak and flour dumplings. The trick is to let it simmer for a few hours to get the meat fork tender. Enjoy!
