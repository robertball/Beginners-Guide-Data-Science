Ingredients:
1 2/3 pounds boneless lamb shoulder, chopped
1 quart water
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 onion, thickly sliced
8 potatoes, peeled and quartered, divided
2 carrots, peeled and thickly sliced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Place lamb in a large pot, cover with water, and add salt. Bring liquid to a boil and skim off any fat that comes to the surface. Reduce heat and simmer on low heat, about 30 minutes.
Mix onion and half of the potatoes into lamb mixture; cook until potatoes are soft, about 30 minutes. Break up potatoes using a wooden spoon to thicken the stew.
Stir remaining potatoes and carrots into the stew; simmer until potatoes are soft, 20 to 30 minutes. Season stew with salt and pepper; stir in parsley.

Description: 
There's nothing more warming on a cold, wet day than a simple Irish stew made with lamb and potatoes. It doesn't need to be complicated to taste good. This is my mum's recipe.
