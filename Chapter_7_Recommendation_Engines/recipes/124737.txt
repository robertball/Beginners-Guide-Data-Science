Ingredients:
8 cups thinly sliced green cabbage
2 large carrots, shredded
1 medium onion, finely chopped
5 tablespoons butter or margarine, divided
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups shredded, processed American cheese
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 teaspoon dried thyme

Directions:
Cook the cabbage and carrots in boiling salted water until crisp-tender. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, saute the onion in 3 tablespoons of butter until tender. Stir in flour, salt and pepper; cook until bubbly. Gradually add milk; cook and stir until thickened. Drain cabbage and carrots; place half in a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. Top with half of the sauce; sprinkle with half of the cheese. Repeat layers. In a small skillet, melt remaining butter. Add crumbs, marjoram and thyme; cook and stir until lightly browned. Sprinkle over casserole. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until the cabbage is tender and the top is browned.

Description: 
I've taken this dish to many church dinners and receive good comments every time. If your children won't eat cabbage, try making this recipe for them (but don't tell them what's in it!).
