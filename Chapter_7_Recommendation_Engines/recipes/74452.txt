Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) envelope rapid rise yeast
2 cups lukewarm water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup cornmeal
5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 pound sliced mozzarella cheese
2 cups canned plum tomatoes, drained and squished
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 cloves garlic, crushed
salt to taste
3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Place the water in a mixing bowl of a stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the water, and let stand for 5 minutes to dissolve.
Pour in the vegetable oil, olive oil, cornmeal and 3 cups of the flour. Mix with the beater for 10 minutes. Add the remaining flour, and switch from the beater to the dough hook. Mix for about 5 minutes. This can be done by hand, but the dough is very rich and moist. Pour the dough out onto a floured surface, and cover with a large bowl. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch down the dough, and let rise again. This time won't take as long.
Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
Grease two 9 or 10 inch round cake pans. Divide the dough evenly between the two pans. Press the dough out so that it goes all the way up the sides of the pans. Lay the slices of  mozzarella cheese onto the crusts like tile. Next put the tomatoes over the mozzarella, and season with basil, oregano, garlic and salt. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the top, and drizzle with olive oil.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is golden and gooey, and the crust a light golden brown.
