Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
3 pounds ground turkey breast
1 (6 ounce) package chicken-flavored dry bread stuffing mix
2 eggs
16 hamburger buns, split
1 (16 ounce) can cranberry sauce
whipped cream cheese

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Heat the butter in a skillet over medium-low heat, and cook and stir the onion and celery until the onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
Place the cooked onion and celery in a large bowl with the ground turkey, stuffing mix, and eggs; mix to thoroughly combine. Form the mixture into 16 patties. Unlike hamburger, these patties will not change shape while cooking, so make them even in size.
Grill the turkey burgers on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Place each patty on a hamburger bun, and top with cranberry sauce and a dollop of whipped cream cheese to serve.
