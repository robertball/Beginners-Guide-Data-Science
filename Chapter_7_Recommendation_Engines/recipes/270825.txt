Ingredients:
1 green plantain
avocado oil spray
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut both ends of plantain and score along the side through the skin only. Peel skin off and cut plantain in half. Peel into strips using a vegetable peeler.
Spray the air fryer basket with avocado oil. Place plantain strips in the basket, making sure they do not touch. Spray top of plantain strips with oil.
Cook in the preheated air fryer for 7 to 9 minutes. Use tongs to turn each strip over, and continue frying until crispy, an additional 3 to 5 minutes. Immediately sprinkle with salt.

Description: 
Green plantains in the air fryer result in potato-like crunchy, crispy chips without being full of calories and fat. These can be sweet or savory, depending on which you are craving - use salt for savory or cinnamon-sugar for sweet chips.
