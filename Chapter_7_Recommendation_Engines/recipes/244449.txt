Ingredients:
24 saltine crackers
6 slices American cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).

Description: 
I enjoy making this recipe as a kid and enjoy teaching it to my kids as well. I will serve it straight from the pan or disposable plates. This recipe was handed down to me from a family friend, who passed it on to me and I'm passing it on to everyone.
