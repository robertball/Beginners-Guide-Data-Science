Ingredients:
3 boxes of grape jello
4 cups of water (plus 2 gallons later)
2 cups sugar
1 can lemonade concentrate
1 48oz. can pineapple juice
1 oz. almond extract
2 2 liter bottles ginger ale

Directions:
Combine 3 boxes of jello and 4 cups of water in a saucepan. Boil to melt jello.
Add 2 cups of sugar and stir till until dissolved.
Add 1 can of lemonade concentrate.
Stir all this up.
Add can of pineapple juice.
Mix up really well.
Add 1 ounce of almond extract.
Stir up and then divide liquid into two separate containers (pretty good size so that you can then add 1 gallon of water into each container along with the mixtures). Stir this together really well, too.
Put lids on containers and freeze at least overnight or longer depending how far in advance you are making it!
Day of serving take both frozen mixes out of freezer and break them up/still keeping them in separate containers.
Pour one container of mixture into punch bowl and pour in ONE of the bottles of ginger ale. STIR. If not serving right away,keep in refrigerator until ready to serve. Repeat with remaining mixture and ginger ale.
If you have a time issue you CAN put the frozen mixes into microwave for a bit to get it soft enough to break up!
