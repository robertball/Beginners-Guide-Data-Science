Description: 
This simple stuffed chicken breast recipe takes minimal ingredients and is fast to make. My brother, future sister-in-law, and niece were the first to try it out and gave rave reviews. I can say it's police officer-, nurse-, and child-approved! Serve with rice pilaf and vegetables, if desired.
