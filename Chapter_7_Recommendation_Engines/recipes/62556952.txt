Description: 
This is a recipe that children will love to make for that special Christmas Eve night. Its very easy and simple to make, and the kids will love going out on Christmas Eve and sprinkling in the yard for Santa's Reindeer.
This is also a neat idea for a project for a children's Christmas party or school function. 

If your going to be making this to be given as a gift I have included the poem that can be used as the tag.


Merry Christmas and God Bless!
