Ingredients:
1 package (1 lb.) graham crackers
2 small french vanilla instant pudding (3.4 ounces each)
3 1/2 cups milk (I used skim)
8 oz. Cool whip
Ingredients for the frosting:
3 tablespoons of Cocoa
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
3 tablespoons of butter (room temperature)
3 tablespoons of warm milk
Mix above ingredients til smooth. Add more powdered sugar if you like the frosting a little thicker. If itâ€™s too thick, just add a little more milk.

Directions:
Mix pudding and milk in a bowl. Blend together for about 2 minutes then fold in the cool whip.
Spray a 9 x 13 pan with non-stick spray. Place a layer of whole graham crackers on the bottom, then top with 1/2 the pudding.
Cover pudding with another layer of graham crackers, top with remaining pudding and another layer of whole graham crackers, then carefully spread the frosting on the graham crackers.
Chill over night or for at least 8 hours.
