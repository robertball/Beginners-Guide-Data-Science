1 1/2 cups ketchup
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1 bulb of garlic, each clove peeled and minced

Directions:
In a large saucepan/dutch oven over high heat bring root beer to a boil.  Add ribs, and simmer for 50 minutes.
In a saucepan combine the ketchup, balsamic vinegar, garlic, onion and cayenne.  Over low heat, cover and simmer sauce until thick and bubbly, about 45 minutes.
Remove ribs from saucepan and baste with sauce.  BBQ ribs on medium heat for 30 minutes until sauce has carmelized.  Baste ribs again and serve with hot leftover sauce.

Description: 
The best BBQ recipe for ribs I have yet to come across.  A friend served these last summer and I then made them for my father - who had three servings!  The sauce is full of flavour - delicious!
