1 cup chopped nuts
1/3 cup butter or margarine, melted
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

2 eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups buttermilk

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; set aside. In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine the dry ingredients; add to creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk. Stir in raisins. Spread half of the batter into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Sprinkle with half of the crumb mixture. Carefully spread with remaining batter and sprinkle with remaining crumb mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
