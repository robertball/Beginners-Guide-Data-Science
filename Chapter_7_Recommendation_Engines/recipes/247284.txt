Ingredients:
2 cups leftover cooked steelhead trout
1 cup soft bread crumbs
1/2 sweet onion, minced
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 lemon, juiced
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil.
Discard skin, bones, and any crust from trout and flake fish with a fork. Combine flaked fish with soft bread crumbs, onion, mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, salt, garlic powder, and black pepper in a bowl. Form mixture into balls and roll each ball in the panko. Arrange balls on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until croquettes are lightly browned and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes.
