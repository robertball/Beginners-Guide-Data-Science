Ingredients:
4 turnips, peeled and chopped
1 bunch green onions, chopped
2 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and chopped
4 slices canned pineapple, chopped
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add turnips and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, and cool.
In a large bowl, combine the turnips, green onions, apples, pineapple and sugar. Stir to evenly coat with the sugar.
Whisk together the oil, water, salt and pepper. Pour dressing over fruit and vegetables. Toss and refrigerate overnight.

Description: 
This seems like an odd mix of ingredients, but it's a great salad with a sweet and slightly sour flavor.
