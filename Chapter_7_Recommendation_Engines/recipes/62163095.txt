Ingredients:
2 tbsp. olive oil
1 lb. halibut (skinless and boneless)
1 egg
1 c. flour (wheat, rice, spelt... it doesn't matter what kind)
2 tbsp. Herbs de Provence
1 tsp. Old Bay Seasoning
1 tsp. salt
dash pepper

Directions:
Heat olive oil on low in a large frying pan.
While the oil is heating, whisk an egg in a soup dish.
In another soup dish, mix together the flour and seasonings.
Cut the halibut into 4 pieces (I use scissors).
Dip each piece of fish in the egg, then dredge in the flour mix to lightly cover both sides. Immediately place in the frying pan. Repeat until all pieces of fish are coated and in the pan. Turn the heat up to medium-low and cook for 5 minutes. Flip the fish and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove from heat and serve.
