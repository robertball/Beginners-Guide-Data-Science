Ingredients:
1/2 C. butter, softened
1 1/2 C. creamy peanut butter
2 C. powdered sugar
1 tbsp. vanilla extract
1 or 2 12 oz. pkgs. white chocolate chips
40 (or so) mini semi-sweet chocolate chips
blue or green food coloring

Directions:
1. In a medium mixing bowl, cream together the butter and peanut butter with an electric mixer until fluffy.
2. Add the vanilla and powdered sugar and beat well.
3. Cover and chill in the refrigerator until firm, at least 1 hour.
4. Roll dough into about 40 eyeball-sized balls. Place on waxed paper or parchment paper and refrigerate another hour or so.
5. Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler or in the microwave.
6. Dip each chilled peanut butter ball in the white chocolate.
7. Place on waxed paper and chill until firm. Repeat for the remaining eyeballs.
8. To the remaining melted white chocolate, add your desired food coloring (if it took awhile for your eyeballs to firm up, you may have to re-melt a bit).
9. Place a colored white chocolate iris on one eye, followed by a mini chocolate chip pupil (do this before the white chocolate sets).
10. Chill until firm.
11. Pour a small amount of red food coloring into a tiny disposable container (a few drops will do).
12. Dip a toothpick into the food coloring and paint a few squiggly "veins" on each eyeball.
