Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup ground almond meal
1/4 cup old fashioned oats
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 ripe banana, mashed

Directions:
Heat griddle to 375 degrees.  Mix dry ingredients in a medium bowl.  In a separate bowl, beat the egg and then add milk, oil and mashed banana.  Pour into dry ingredients and mix until combined, careful not to over mix.  The batter will be lumpy.
Pour pancake batter a half-cupful at a time onto the hot griddle.  When edges become crisp and bubbles have formed, flip the pancake.  Continue cooking for an additional few minutes or until the sides of the pancake are cooked.
Serve warm with maple syrup.

Description: 
After trying and tweaking several different pancake recipes, I'm very happy with this one.  The oats add texture, the bananas make them sweet, and the almond meal adds protein and a delicate crispiness.  My kids love these pancakes on a Saturday morning and I always make sure I save some for myself!
