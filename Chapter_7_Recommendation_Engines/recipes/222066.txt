Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package lime-flavored gelatin mix (such as Jell-OÂ®)
1 cup boiling water
1 cup tequila
coarse salt, as needed
1 cup ice cubes, or as needed
1 cup margarita mix
1/2 cup tequila
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
1 lime, sliced

Directions:
Combine lime-flavored gelatin mix and boiling water in a bowl; stir until gelatin is dissolved. Stir 1 cup tequila into gelatin mixture. Pour into about 24 shot glasses and place in refrigerator to set, at least 1 hour.
Salt the rims of 4 to 6 martini glasses.
Combine ice, margarita mix, and 1/2 cup tequila in a cocktail shaker; shake until well mixed. Place a lime-flavored gelatin shot in the bottom of each prepared martini glass. Pour margarita mixture over the shot, leaving enough room to top with beer. Top each margarita-martini with beer. Garnish with a lime slice.

Description: 
We love this margarita martini recipe because it's not too sweet and has the surprise of a yummy tequila-lime gelatin shot at the bottom of the glass. So good and very pretty!
