Ingredients:
2 large potatoes
1 slice bacon
2 tablespoons butter, divided
2 pinches chopped fresh parsley, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 eggs
1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Prick potatoes several times with a fork and place onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, 50 minutes to 1 hour.
While potatoes bake, place bacon in a skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels. Let cool 10 minutes. Crumble.
Remove potatoes from the oven and let cool 10 minutes.
Slice tops off of potatoes and scoop out insides to form a deep bowl. Add 1/2 tablespoon butter, 1 pinch parsley, salt, and pepper to each potato.
Crack an egg into each potato. Top each with an additional 1/2 tablespoon butter. Divide bacon and Cheddar cheese between the 2 potato bowls.
Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until eggs are set, 15 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle each with 1/2 teaspoon parsley.
