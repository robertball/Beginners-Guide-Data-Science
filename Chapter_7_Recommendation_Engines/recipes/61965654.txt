1 1/2 pounds ground turkey breast or sausage
1/2 cup onion, chopped
1 tablespoon garlic, minced
2 tablespoons freah oregano, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 can red enchilada sauce

Directions:
Stir turkey, onion, garlic, oregano, and cumin in oil until turkey is crumbly and no longer pink about 4 minutes.  Stir in 1 cup enchilada sauce.  Add slat to taste.  Meanwhile, cut tortillas in half.  Arrange fourth of the halves evenly over the bottom of a shallow 3 quart casserole, overlapping to fit.  Sprinkle a fourth of the cheese evenly over the tortillas, then top with a third of the turkey mixture and a fourth of the remaining enchilada sauce, spreading each level.  Repeat to make two more layers of tortillas, cheese, turkey mixture and sauce.  Top with another layer of tortillas and sauce then cheese.  Bake at 425  until cheese is melted and casserole is hot in the center, 18-20 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro.
