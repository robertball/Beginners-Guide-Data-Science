Ingredients:
8 TBS. unsalted butter
1/3 cup honey
1/3 cup of packed brown sugar
2 TBS. fresh lemon juice
1 tsp. natural liquid smoke flavoring
3/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 center cut salmon fillet (about 2lbs.) with skin on

Directions:
Combine butter, honey, brown sugar, lemon juice, liquid smoke, and red pepper flakes in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring until smooth, 5-7 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
Arrange the salmon in a dish just large enough to hold it. Pour the cooled marinade over it, and let it stand for 30 minutes, turning once.
Grill it 5-7 minutes.
