Ingredients:
1 pound chicken livers, rinsed and trimmed
⅔ cup thinly sliced onion
1 clove garlic, chopped
2  bay leaves
¼ teaspoon dried thyme
1 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
¾ cup butter, softened
2 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons cognac

Directions:
Place the chicken livers, onion, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, water, and 1 teaspoon of salt into a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the livers are cooked through, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat, and let sit for 5 minutes. Remove bay leaves.
Place the liver mixture into a food processor, and run the machine; add the butter to the mixture, about 1 tablespoon at a time. Add the hot pepper sauce, 1 more teaspoon of salt, the black pepper, and cognac to the running machine. Process until smooth; spoon into a crock or serving bowl, cover, and chill until firm.
