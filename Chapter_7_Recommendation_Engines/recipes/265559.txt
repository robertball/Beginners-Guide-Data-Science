Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup onion, chopped
1/2 pound vegetarian ground beef
1 (15 ounce) jar tomato sauce
2 tablespoons peanut butter
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground thyme
1/2 teaspoon tomato paste
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste

Directions:
Pierce spaghetti squash halves all over using a fork. Place in a microwave-safe dish and cook in a microwave oven until softened, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add vegetarian ground beef, tomato sauce, peanut butter, oregano, paprika, thyme, tomato paste, turmeric, salt, and pepper and mix well. Simmer until sauce is heated through and starts to thicken, 5 to 10 minutes.
Shred squash flesh using a fork and distribute among 4 plates. Serve with the sauce.
