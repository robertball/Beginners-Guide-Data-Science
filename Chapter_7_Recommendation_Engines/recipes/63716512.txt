Ingredients:
4 green plantains (remove the skin and cut in 3 inch pieces)
2 teaspoons of salt
1 cup of water
1/2 cup of whole milk
1/2 cup of cold water
5 Tablespoons of American cheese or other cheese that you like (grated or cut into small pieces so it well blend well and melt easier)
1/2 stick of butter (cold)
5 strips of bacon
Salt to taste

Directions:
In a large saucepan, place your cut plantains and add sufficient room temperature water (or from tap) to cover the bananas for boiling. Add 2 teaspoon of salt to the water. Cook or boil the bananas for 20 or 25 minutes, until soft. You do not need to boil the water first, simply place the bananas on the stove with water to begin. Add additional water to replace the water that has boiled off, and with a lid
now on the saucepan, cook for another 15 minutes.
Remove from the stove and drain off the water in your saucepan completely.
Mash the bananas with a potato masher (or something similar)  adding the cold water from the refrigerator, 1/2 cup of whole milk and your cheese that you like (you may also add chopped sweet onions if you like). After this mixture has come to the consistency of mashed potatoes. add 1/2 stick of
lightly salted butter.
In a frying pan, fry the 5 bacon strips. Drain off the fat from the bacon and add it to your already prepared Mangu, blending well with a wooden spoon. If
you like, you may also cut the bacon into small pieces and add this also (this is optional).
