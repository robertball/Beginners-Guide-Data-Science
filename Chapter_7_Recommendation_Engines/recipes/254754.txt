Description: 
A pretty simple recipe, quick and easy to prepare, salsa criolla is the perfect accompaniment to many dishes. The lime juice is what makes this onion salsa/relish special. It adds a bright flavor that sweetens the onions and livens up everything else on the plate. Great summer dish! Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
