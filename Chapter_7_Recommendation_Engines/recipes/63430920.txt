Ingredients:
2 quarts boiling water
4 or 5 family-sized tea bags (decaf or regular)
1 packet of Crystal Light Lemonade (2 quart)
1 cup Stevia
pulp-free orange juice to taste

Directions:
Boil 2 quarts of water and steep 4 or 5 family-sized tea bags for 5 minutes. Combine in a one gallon pitcher with Crystal Light lemonade (2 qt) packet and 1 cup Stevia. Add water until the pitcher is almost full, then add pulp-free orange juice to taste Just tinker around until you get it how you like. You can't mess it up.
For a more basic "sweet tea" just omit or lessen the orange juice.
Enjoy! :)

All southerners love their tea-- I just needed to find one that tasted great without all that sugar. This mixture is always in my fridge now. It tastes great, it's light and refreshing and has practically no calories!
