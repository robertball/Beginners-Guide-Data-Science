Ingredients:
cooking spray
3/4 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons butter, softened
6 tablespoons ground flax seed
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
3 ripe bananas, mashed
3/4 cup chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper liners.
Beat sugar, butter, flax seed, vanilla, and eggs together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.
Sift flour, salt, and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Mix creamed sugar mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, into the flour mixture until fully incorporated and batter is stiff. Beat bananas into batter with an electric mixer on low. Fold chocolate chips and walnuts into batter; spoon into the prepared muffin cups, filling each cup 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool in the tins for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
This is a 'most often requested' recipe - friends and family deliberately let bananas get brown so I'll make them! Great for lunch boxes too.
