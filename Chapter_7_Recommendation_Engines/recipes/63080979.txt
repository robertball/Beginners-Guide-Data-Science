Ingredients:
20 New Mexico Red Chile Pods
10 Ancho Chile Pods
2 TBS Canola Oil
1 large yellow onion, chopped
3-4 garlic cloves, chopped
1-2 quarts of chicken stock
1 teaspoon Cumin
1 teaspoon Corriander
1 teaspoon Oregano
Honey (optional)

Directions:
Snap off the stem and shake out the seeds of the 30 chile pods. Throw the stems and seeds away.
Put 2 TBS of canola oil in the bottom of a heavy pot, so that the bottom of the pot is just coated. Add the chile pods.
Turn heat on medium and begin to toast chile pods until they become aromatic (open your kitchen windows, this will make you cough)
When the aroma becomes very strong and the pods are evenly toasted, add the onion and garlic and stir.
When you can smell the onions and garlic, add 1 quart of chicken stock, you want to add enough liquid so that your pods float. You may use a bit more than a quart or a bit less, depending on how dry it is where you are or your elevation. You might use up to 2 quarts, which is why you want to look for floating pods.
When the chile is the texture of wet leather, pour into a blender and blend. Then, strain through a medium strainer, throw away anything that is left in the strainer.
Add 1 teaspoon of each of the following: cumin, coriander and oregano. Add honey to taste if you need to correct bitterness.
Reduce your sauce until it evenly coats the back of a spoon.

Description: 
Red chile is a staple of the New Mexican and West Texan diet and this recipe is my grandmother's recipe. When I make it, it reminds me of the smells of her cooking in her kitchen, fresh corn tortillas, beans and red chile. You can kick up the spiciness by adding more Arbol chile pods.
