Ingredients:
3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/4 cup steak sauce
8 ounces fusilli pasta
1 sweet onion, diced
2 avocados - peeled, pitted and diced
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1 cup ranch-style salad dressing
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Brush chicken with steak sauce and marinate for 10-15 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and set aside to cool.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
Place chicken on hot grill.  Cover and cook until grill marks form, about 6-8 minutes per side or until internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Set aside to cool, then cut into bite-size pieces.
When ready to serve, mix pasta, chicken, onion, avocados, tomatoes and  dressing in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
