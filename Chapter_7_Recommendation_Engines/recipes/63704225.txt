Ingredients:
2 cups minus 2 tablespoons cake flour (8 1/2 ounces)
1 cup plus 2/3 cup bread flour (8 1/2 ounces)
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/4 cups unsalted butter (10 ounces), room temperature
1 1/4 cups light brown sugar (10 ounces)
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar (8 ounces)
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla
3 1/3 cups dark chocolate chips (20 ounces), at least 60% cacao content (I used Ghiradelli chips).
1 1/2 cup walnut pieces (optional--not in the original recipe)
Sea salt, for sprinkling

Directions:
Sift together the dry ingredients and set aside.
Cream together the butter and sugars until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.
Add the eggs, one at a time, until thoroughly mixed, and then add the vanilla.
Reduce mixer speed to low and add dry ingredients until just incorporated.
With a rubber spatula, mix in the chocolate chips and optional walnuts.
Wrap plastic wrap tightly around the dough and refrigerate for at least 24 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 and line baking sheets with parchment.
Scoop 3 1/2 ounces of dough into a ball and place 6 balls on baking sheet.  (I made mine 2 ounces and placed 8 balls on the sheet).
Sprinkle lightly with sea salt.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown but still soft, depending on the size of the cookies.
Transfer the parchment sheet to a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes and then transfer the cookies to another rack to finish cooling.
Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days or freeze them.
