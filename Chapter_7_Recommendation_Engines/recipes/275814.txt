Ingredients:
4 large fresh pears, each sliced into 6 wedges
1 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup brandy
8 ounces BelGioioso Mascarpone cheese
1/4 cup pure maple syrup

Directions:
Toss pear slices in lemon juice to prevent browning. Melt butter in large pan over low heat. Add sliced pears and saute for a few minutes until heated through. Add brown sugar and stir until melted and the pears are coated. Heat mixture until pears start to soften, then add brandy.
Bring to a boil and poach pears until soft and heated through.
Mix mascarpone with maple syrup and serve pears warm or slightly cooled with a dollop of mascarpone cream sauce.
