Ingredients:
2/3 cup Chopped Onion
2 cups Chopped Celery
2 quarts Day Old Grated Cornbread
1 quart Day Old Grated Biscuits
1/4 cup Dried Parsley Flakes
2 teaspoons Poultry Seasoning
2 teaspoons Ground Sage
1 teaspoon Coarse Ground Pepper
4 ounces butter, melted
1 quart + 1-14 oz can Chicken Broth

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
Mix onion, celery, grated cornbread and biscuits, parsley flakes, poultry seasoning, sage, and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Add melted butter to the mixture.
Stir until well blended.
Add chicken broth to dry ingredients and mix well. The dressing should have a wet but not soupy consistency (like a quick bread batter).
Divide the mixture evenly into two 8 x 8 pans that have been sprayed with nonstick spray.
Bake uncovered for one hour or until the dressing is lightly browned on the top.
