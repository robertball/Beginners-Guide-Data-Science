Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups warm water
1 tablespoon white sugar
5 teaspoons active dry yeast
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup melted butter
1 teaspoon coarse salt
1 egg, beaten
coarse salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Mix water and sugar together in a bowl until sugar is dissolved; add yeast. Let mixture stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
Whisk flour, butter, and salt together in a bowl until well mixed; add yeast mixture and stir with a fork until dough starts to cling. Turn dough onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth.
Cut dough into 15 equal pieces and roll each piece between your hands into rope shapes at least the thickness of a pencil. Twist dough into desired shapes and arrange on a baking sheet; brush with egg and sprinkle coarse salt over each.
Bake in the preheated oven until pretzels are browned and cooked through, 8 to 12 minutes.
