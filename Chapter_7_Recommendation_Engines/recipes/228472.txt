Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, finely chopped
3 cups water
2 teaspoons dried dill weed, or to taste
2 teaspoons poultry seasoning, or to taste
1 tablespoon dried parsley
ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons chicken bouillon, or more to taste
1 1/2 cups long grain white rice

Directions:
Heat butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add water, dill weed, poultry seasoning, parsley, ground black pepper, chicken bouillon, and rice; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until water is absorbed and rice is just slightly undercooked, 12 to 14 minutes. Stir, taste, and adjust seasonings if desired. Cool completely before using to stuff a chicken.

Description: 
My mother passed this recipe on to her daughters as it was passed on to her from her mother. It is a delicious alternative to traditional bread stuffing, and my family always requests it when a chicken or turkey is on the menu. It will be a stunning addition to your Sunday night dinner table. As with any good recipe, adjust the seasonings to your taste. This recipe quantity is for an approximately 5-pound chicken.
