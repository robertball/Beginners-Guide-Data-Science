Pour chocolate mixture over cereal and stir until evenly coated. Press cereal mixture into the prepared baking dish and cool for 10 minutes.

Description: 
I used to make a batch of these every two days for my cafe. They were extremely popular and always sold out. A delicious and light chocolate square that packs well in lunches. I like to make for Halloween treats by simply scattering Reese's pieces over the top and pushing into top of square while still warm in pan. Enjoy!
