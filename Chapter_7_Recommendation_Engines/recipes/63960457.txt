Ingredients:
1 lb. ground lean beef (Iowa beef is the best)
1 lb. sage sausage
1 can diced tomatoes
1 8 oz. can tomato sauce
4 cubes beef bouillon
2 medium carrots, shredded (more if you desire)
1 onion chopped
1/3 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. ground black pepper
2 quarts water, divided
4 tsp. minced garlic
1 head cabbage, cored and cut into bit-sized pieces

Directions:
1. Crumble the meat into a large pot. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, beef bouillon cubes, carrots, onion, vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper. Pour in 1 quart of the water and bring to a boil. Stir to break up the meat while heating. Once the soup comes to a boil, cover and simmer for 30 minutes over low heat.
2. Pour in another quart of water and return to a slow boil. Add garlic and cabbage. Simmer for 25 minutes until cabbage is tender.
