Stir in the vegetables, water, broth, sugar and seasonings; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 35-40 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Cool slightly.
In a blender (or immersion blender), process soup in batches until smooth. Return to the pan; whisk in cream. Heat through (do not boil).

Description: 
I've made this soup many times and we love it. It's the quality of the sausage, even though its a small amount, that lends a lot to the spice of the soup. I make a large batch and freeze in small zip-lock bags so I can pull out just a small portion when I need my own personal bowl of soup. I add the cream after it defrosts.
