Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup rolled oats
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/3 cups light brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin
1/2 cup apple butter
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
Stir the flour, oats, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, ginger, and salt in a bowl.
Beat the butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add 1 egg and allow it to blend into the mixture before adding the other along with the vanilla. Add the pumpkin and apple butter; continue beating. Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the walnuts, mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, about 12 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
