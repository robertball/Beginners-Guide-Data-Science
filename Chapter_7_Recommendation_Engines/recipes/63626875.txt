Ingredients:
12 oz. Herdez Mexican Cooking Sauces Traditional Chipotle
1 cup ketchup
1/4 cup molasses
1 tsp. liquid smoke (natural hickory)

Directions:
1.  In a medium saucepan, whisk together all of the ingredients.
2.  On medium low heat, simmer until the sauce thickens up to an hour.
3.  For grilling, use sauce during the last few minutes of cooking so it won't burn.  If smoking meat in a smoker, sauce can be used for the last 30 minutes of smoking time.

Description: 
This will probably be one of the fastest BBQ sauces you will ever throw together.  It has a kick to it, and is great on hot wings.  I love using it in the smoker on ribs too!  Take it along with you for your next tailgating party, and watch the fun begin!  Herdez Traditional Chipotle sauce simplifies this BBQ sauce and gives you the WOW factor you've been looking for...without an extensive list of ingredients.
