Ingredients:
2 pounds ground chuck (the leaner, the meaner)
2 yellow onions, finely chopped
4 tablespoons olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons dried oregano
4 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/4 cup yellow stone ground corn meal

Directions:
Combine the onion, spices, tomatoes and tomato sauce into a large crock-pot. Saute garlic in olive oil then dump both in the pot. Cook ground chuck over medium heat until beef is brown.  Drain.  Place in the pot and heat to boiling, reduce heat to simmer, and stir in the corn meal. Cover.  Cook, stirring occasionally, for about an hour.
