Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine noodles
2 tablespoons butter
2 zucchini, shredded
5 cloves garlic, minced, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 onion, sliced
2 cups cherry tomatoes
1 (4 ounce) log goat cheese, crumbled
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil, or to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain water, reserving 1 cup pasta water.
Melt butter in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat; add zucchini, 3 cloves minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir zucchini mixture in the melted butter until most of the moisture has evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add cherry tomatoes, remaining 2 cloves minced garlic, salt, and pepper to onion; cook and stir, crushing tomatoes to desired consistency, until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Mix fettuccine and zucchini mixture into onion mixture, adding as much reserved pasta water to keep pasta moist. Stir goat cheese and basil into pasta mixture.

Description: 
My mom made up this flavorful pasta. It's very simple and great with fresh tomatoes for a summer night meal! Add shrimp or chicken for a heartier version of this pasta.
