Ingredients:
4  pita breads (8-inch)
Olive oil from mister
1 teaspoon table salt

Directions:
Using scissors, cut around the exterior of the pita bread (splitting it into 2 thin pieces).  Then take a knife, and cut into 6 wedges (total of 12 pieces).
1. Adjust the oven racks to the upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Spread the pita wedges, smooth-side down, over 2 rimmed baking sheets. Spray the top of each chip with oil and then sprinkle with the salt.
2. Bake the chips until they begin to crisp and brown lightly, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the baking sheets from the oven and flip the chips so their smooth side is up. Return the baking sheets to the oven, reversing their positions from top to bottom, and continue to bake until the chips are fully toasted, 8 to 10 minutes longer. Remove the baking sheets from the oven and cool the chips before serving. (The chips can be held in an airtight container for up to 3 days. If necessary, briefly re-crisp in a 350-degree oven for a few minutes before serving.)
