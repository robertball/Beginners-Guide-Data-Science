Ingredients:
4 1/4 pounds waxy potatoes
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 cup hot vegetable broth
5 tablespoons white vinegar
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch white sugar, or to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives (optional)

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Drain. Cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Peel while still warm. Cut into thin slices and put in a large bowl. Add onion.
Mix hot broth with vinegar, oil, salt, and sugar. Pour immediately over warm potatoes and onion; the potatoes need to still be warm so they can absorb the dressing better. Allow to stand for 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve warm.
