Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef, browned
16oz refried beans
1/2 C Velveeta, cubed
1/4 C pickled jalapeños, minced
2 Tbsp chili powder
1 1/2 tsp cumin
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp coriander
1/2 tsp garlic salt
1/4 tsp cayenne
2 8oz packages crescent rolls
1 C sour cream
1 1/2 C pico de gallo

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.  Combine browned ground beef, refried beans, velvet, jalapeños, chili powder, cumin, onion powder, paprika, coriander, garlic salt, and cayenne in a saucepan over medium-low heat.  Stir often to combine until cheese is melted and ingredients are thoroughly combined.  Remove from heat.
Unroll one package of crescent rolls on a flat surface.  Press seams firmly to seal perforations.  Cover with 1/2 of bean mixture and spread to cover evenly.  Starting with long edge, roll up rectangle into log.  Slice log into 3/4" slices and place on ungreased baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining package of crescent dough.  Bake for 15 minutes or until crescents are golden brown.  Allow to cool for several minutes.
Top each taco crescent with a dollop of sour cream and a spoonful of pico de gallo before serving.
