Ingredients:
* Floury potatoes - 600 gms (21 ounces)
* Onion - 1, medium
* Butter - around a Tablespoon
* Vegetable stock - 500 ml (2 US cups, 17 fl oz)
* Mascarpone - 100 g (3 1/2 ounces)
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper (white pepper works as well)
* Lemon Juice
* Gravad Lax (Lachs) - 4 slices around 125g (4.4 ounces) in total
* Chives

Directions:
Peel and dice (small) the potatoes
Peel and finely chop the onion
In a medium saucepan, melt the butter and coat the potato and onions. Sweat gently for 3 minutes.
Increase the heat and add the stock, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to simmer gently, covered, until the potato is soft.
Strain through a fine sieve, pushing through with a ladle (a Passevite does this job perfectly), back into the saucepan.
Bring the soup back to the boiling point and add around 3/4 of the Mascarpone, whisking it in to mix evenly.
Season to taste with the salt and pepper, then add Lemon Juice to heighten the flavours.
Gently roll the Gravad lachs slices into a conical form, making rosettes.
Put these in the warmed soup plates and pour in the hot soup.
Finish with a teaspoon of Mascarpone and drizzle over the chopped chives. You could aslo lay two long unchopped chives across the centre of the plate for a simple and nice decoration.
