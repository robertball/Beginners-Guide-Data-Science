Ingredients:
1 chicken breast cut to bite sized pieces or 3 drumsticks
1 small packet (3 pieces) of your favorite crackers (I use SkyFlakes)
1 piece of bread
2 tsp rubbed rosemary
1 tsp rubbed parsley
1/2 cup lite sour cream
Salt and pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees celsius.
In a food processor, whiz together the crackers, bread, rosemary, parsley with a pinch of salt and pepper; this is what makes the crumbs.
In a different bow, mix the sour cream with salt and pepper and olive oil, and coat the chicken pieces thoroughly.
Empty crumb mix onto a plate and coat the chicken pieces with the crumbs.
Place chicken pieces onto a greases tray (or a tray lined with a silicone mat) and bake for 15 minutes or until golde brown. If you're afraid that they will go dry, spray them with oil before baking.

I always wonder what I'll have for dinner and between running off to classes and reading the stack of papers for my courses, I have limited time to cook. This is one of my favorite chicken recipes and it coems in a single serving; fit for a student. :D
