Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package German chocolate cake mix
1 cup quick-cooking oats
6 tablespoons cold butter (no substitutes)
1 egg, beaten
FILLING:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup caramel ice cream topping
1 egg
TOPPING:
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup quick-cooking oats
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
In a bowl, combine cake mix and oats; cut in butter until crumbly.  Set aside 1 cup. Stir the egg into remaining oat mixture (mixture will be crumbly). Press into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12 minutes or until almost set. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.
Combine filling ingredients; spread over crust. For topping, combine the pecans, brown sugar, oats, butter and reserved oat mixture until crumbly. Sprinkle over filling. Bake 15 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate until firm before cutting.

Description: 
I get at least one recipe request every time I take these cookies to a church potluck. The caramel and cream cheese filling is a winner.                                           --Hazel Baldner, Austin, Minnesota
