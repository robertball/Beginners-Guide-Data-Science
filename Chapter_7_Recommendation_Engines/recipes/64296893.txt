Ingredients:
1/3 cup fresh lime juice
1/2 cup olive oil
1 large clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 or 2 avocados
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
1 can corn, drained (frozen or fresh can also be used--thaw if frozen)
2 tomatoes, chopped OR 2-3 handfuls of cherry tomatoes, halved
4-6 green onions, thinly sliced

Directions:
In a small bowl or jar, add lime juice, olive oil, garlic, salt, and cayenne pepper.  Mix or shake well.
Cut avocado into chunks and add to the dressing.  Let sit to blend flavors of the dressing and to prevent the avocado from browning.
In a salad bowl, combine beans, corn, tomatoes, green onions.  Gently fold in the dressing and avocado chunks.  Can be eaten as a salad or as a chunky salsa with tortilla chips.

Description: 
This is a perfect easy side dish to go nicely with enchiladas or quesadillas. Sometimes when avocados aren't in season I will add some red bell peppers instead. In the summer fresh corn shaved off the corn makes this dish a special treat. I have also use kidney beans instead of black beans. This recipe is flexible and great for Mexican food night.
