Ingredients:
6 fish fillets such as striped bass, flounder or red snapper, about 6 to 8 oz. each
Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper
2.5 Tbl. butter, softened
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp. grated lemon zest, optional
BROWN BUTTERED CORN
3 ears corn, shucked
4 Tbl. butter
4 sprigs thyme, preferable lemon thyme
Coarse sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Chopped fresh soft herbs (basil, mint, parsley, cilantro), optional

Directions:
Preheat over to 500 degrees. Season fillets with salt and pepper and place in a baking pan, skin-side down.
In a small bowl, mash together the butter, about 2/3rds of the garlic, and the lemon zest if using.  Smear on top of the fish fillets.  Roast until cooked through to taste, 7 to 12 minutes depending on fish and thickness.
For brown buttered corn, remove kernels from cobs, scraping cobs to release juices.  Transfer kernels and juice to a bowl.  Melt butter in a saucepan; add thyme.  Let butter cook until you see golden brown specks in bottom of pan and butter smells nutty, about 5 minutes.  Add corn, juices and a large pinch of salt and pepper; stir well and cover pot, cook for about 5 minutes.  Remove thyme sprigs, add more salt and pepper if desired, and serve hot, alone or as a side dish, garnished with herbs if desired.
If using buttered brown corn with fish, puree half the buttered brown corn in blender or food processor with broth or water, oil, lemon juice and remaining garlic.  Stir in remaining corn.  Serve sauce over fish, garnished with herbs.
