Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 medium onion, diced
2 small carrots, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
2 cloves garlic, chopped
salt to taste
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/2 cup barbeque sauce
1/2 cup mild molasses
1/2 cup imitation bacon bits
1/4 cup rum (optional)
2 tablespoons dill
2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
2 (15.5 ounce) cans white beans, drained and rinsed

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion, carrots, bell pepper, and garlic. Sprinkle lightly with salt and saute until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, barbeque sauce, molasses, bacon bits, rum, dill, and mustard and stir to combine. Reduce heat and simmer sauce 20 to 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Pour 1/4 cup beans into a bowl and mash. Pour remaining beans into a casserole dish. Mix mashed beans into the saucepan with the sauce and pour mixture over beans in the casserole dish. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 2 1/2 hours. Uncover and bake 30 minutes more. Let cool for 20 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This is a great alternative to 'traditional' baked beans, in that it has a heavy load of vegetables and no meat. Of course, you can use real bacon, if you're not vegetarian. 

Mashing up some of the beans and returning them to the mix will help keep the beans from being too watery when finished. Serve with sour cream, if you like.
