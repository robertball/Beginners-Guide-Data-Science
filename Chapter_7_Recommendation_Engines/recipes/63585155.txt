Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup granulated white sugar
1/2 cup light brown sugar
2 eggs
4 overripe bananas, well mashed
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground cardamom
1/8 tsp ground allspice
1/4 cup chopped almonds, pecans or walnuts
1/4 cup sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F
Using electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl until smooth and creamy.
Beat in eggs, one at a time, then beat in bananas and vanilla.
In a separate bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, and allspice.
Add flour mixture to banana mixture and fold in with a spatula until well-blended.
Gently fold nuts and sour cream into batter until just blended, being careful not to over mix.
Lightly butter a 10-inch cast iron skillet.
Pour batter into skillet.
Place into oven and bake until a toothpick into center comes out clean, 45 minutes.
Remove from oven and let cool in pan.
To serve, either flip out of pan or serve in skillet, sliced into wedges.

Description: 
Cardamom gives this easy bread a different flavour. Cooking in an iron skillet makes the outside crisp, while the inside stays moist.
