Ingredients:
2 large green tomatoes, sliced 1/3-inch thick
2 teaspoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup milk
2 eggs
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup butter

Directions:
Season each tomato slice with sugar, salt, and pepper.
Beat milk and eggs together in a bowl. Pour flour into another bowl.
Gently press each tomato slice into flour to coat; shake off the excess flour. Dip tomato slices into egg mixture, then press again into flour. Place breaded tomato slices onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.
Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large pan over medium heat. Place tomato slices in melted butter and cook until golden brown on one side, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side until golden brown. Add more butter as need while frying.

Description: 
This recipe comes from my mom and they are, hands down, the best fried green tomatoes. She makes these every summer with fresh tomatoes from her garden. My sister begs her to make them for her as soon as she sees tomatoes growing big and green on the vines. While most recipes call for breadcrumbs and oil, this one calls for flour and has you fry the tomatoes in butter, which helps give these an incredible flavor.
