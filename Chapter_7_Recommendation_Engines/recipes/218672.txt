Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa
2 cups water
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 large fresh peach, pitted and chopped
1/2 cup fat-free Greek yogurt
2 tablespoons honey, or to taste
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon lime juice, or to taste

Directions:
If quinoa is not pre-rinsed, rinse in plenty of cool water to remove coating, and drain. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan, and stir in the quinoa; reduce heat to low, and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain excess water, and mix in the cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg.
Mix the chopped peach with yogurt in a bowl. Serve quinoa in a serving bowl, topped with about 2 tablespoons of the peach yogurt. Drizzle with a teaspoon or so of honey, sprinkle with nutmeg, and drizzle about a teaspoon of lime juice over the top.
