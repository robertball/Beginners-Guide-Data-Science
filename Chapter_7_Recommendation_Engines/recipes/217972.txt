Ingredients:
2 cups chopped fresh strawberries
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup fresh mint leaves
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

Directions:
Combine strawberries, honey, and mint leaves in a small saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until honey dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes.
Pour mixture into blender. Pour the sauce into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the sauce moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches, if necessary, until smooth. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the sauce right in the cooking pot.
Strain sauce through a fine mesh sieve. Stir in lemon juice. Serve warm or room temperature.

Description: 
This is a delicious dessert sauce which can be drizzled over ice cream, biscuits -- or my favorite -- pound cake! I recommend using good quality honey, as it can make all the difference!
