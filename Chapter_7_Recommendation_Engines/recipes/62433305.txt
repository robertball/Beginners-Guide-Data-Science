Ingredients:
Ingredients:
•2 cups lentils
•2 or 3 tomatoes, grated
•1 medium onion, chopped
•3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped or pressed
•4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or cilantro
•2 1/2 teaspoons cumin
•2 1/2 teaspoons paprika (some hot, if desired)
•1 1/2 teaspoons ginger
•1/2 teaspoon pepper
•2 teaspoons salt
•1/3 cup olive oil

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in a pressure cooker or pot. Add 2 liters (about 2 quarts) of water, and bring to a simmer.
Pressure cooker method. Cover, and cook on pressure over medium heat for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. If the lentils are still submerged in sauce, reduce the liquids so that the sauce is ample, but not watery. Adjust the seasoning if desired, and serve.
Pot method. Cover, and simmer the lentils over medium heat about 1 1/2 hours, or until the lentils are tender and the sauce is not watery. (If the liquids reduce too much during cooking, add a little water to prevent the lentils from burning.) Adjust the seasoning if desired, and serve.
Scoop up the lentils with crusty bread, or eat them with a spoon.

Description: 
This lentil dish can be used as a side dish or appetizer with pita bread.  It would be better with German Porcelain garlic and just throwing the whole clove to cook, it melts in you mouth, yummy!
