Ingredients:
2 cups chopped carrots
1/2 cup texturized vegetable protein (TVP)
1/4 cup uncooked long-grain rice
1 onion, sliced
2 (15 ounce) cans sliced potatoes, drained
1 cup salsa
1/8 cup dry sherry
1/8 cup Italian-style salad dressing
2 cups water
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
In a large bowl toss together carrots, TVP, rice and onion.  Transfer to a deep, round casserole dish.  Press mixture down evenly.  Layer potatoes on top of carrot mixture.
In a medium bowl combine salsa, sherry, salad dressing, water and cornstarch.  Slowly pour over potatoes.
Bake, covered, in preheated oven for 1 hour.  Remove cover and sprinkle with bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese.
Heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and bake, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours.  Cool slightly before serving.
