Ingredients:
1 pound fresh crab meat
1  egg
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
Â½ teaspoon ground mustard
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
salt and pepper to taste
4 ounces buttery round crackers, crushed
2 cups oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine crabmeat, egg, mayonnaise, mustard powder, Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper to taste.
In a large skillet, heat 1/4 inch of vegetable oil to a high heat. Roll heaping spoonfuls on the crab mixture in the crackers, then place the ball in the hot oil. Flatten lightly with a spatula so that the crab cake is 1/2 inch thick. Fry the crab cakes, flipping to ensure both sides get browned.
