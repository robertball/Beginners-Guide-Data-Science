Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake the potatoes unwrapped for about 1 hour, or until soft,  in the preheated oven.
When cool enough to handle, cut off a thin slice from top of potatoes, lengthwise. Scoop out pulp into a large mixing bowl, leaving skins in-tac. Add milk, mayonaise, salad dressing,salt,egg,pepper,sour cream,and 1/2 cup cheese. Mix until well blended. Spoon mixture into potatoe shells. Top with onions, bacon, and remaining shredded cheese. Return to oven for about 15 minutes until heated through and cheese is melted and the filling is slightly brown. Remove from oven and serve while still hot.
