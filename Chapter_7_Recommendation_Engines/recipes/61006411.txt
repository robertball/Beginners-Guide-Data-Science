Description: 
For my recipe I used margarine instead of butter, cut the Parmesan in half and omit the parsley, which simply adds color and doesn't add any extra flavor.  The end result  is a rich, cheesy, coats pasta perfectly and makes a great dip for warm bread-sticks.Modified from: Alfredo Sauce
