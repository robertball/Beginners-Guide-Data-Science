Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds baby potatoes, cut into quarters
3 tablespoons pesto
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
aluminum foil
4 ounces mozzarella cheese, diced

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix potatoes with pesto in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a large square of aluminum foil. Cover with a second square of foil and seal the potatoes by pressing the edges together to form a packet (une papillote).
Place the packet on the preheated grill, close the lid, and cook until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Carefully remove the top piece of foil and add mozzarella cheese. Close the grill and cook until cheese is slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
