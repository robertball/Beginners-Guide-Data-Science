Ingredients:
2 (14.75 ounce) cans salmon, drained and bones removed
1 cup plain bread crumbs
1 small onion, finely chopped (optional)
4 large eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons dill weed
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 teaspoon garlic salt (optional)
1 teaspoon onion powder (optional)
2 tablespoons shortening (such as CriscoÂ®)

Directions:
Mix salmon, bread crumbs, onion, eggs, flour, dill, basil, garlic salt, and onion powder together in a bowl; form into 5 large patties.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt shortening in a large frying pan over medium-high heat; fry patties until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Transfer patties to a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until patties are cooked through, about 20 more minutes.

Description: 
This is a clone of the large salmon patties served at my favorite restaurants. I always ask them to put cheese sauce on mine.
