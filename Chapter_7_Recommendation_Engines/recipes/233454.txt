Ingredients:
2 zucchini, grated
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt to taste
1 (8 ounce) package angel hair pasta

Directions:
Mix zucchini and garlic together in a large bowl; stir in olive oil and salt. Set aside for flavors to blend, about 1 hour.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and add to zucchini mixture. Toss to combine and slightly cook the zucchini.
