Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef sirloin
1 cup cooked rice
1 onion, diced
2 eggs
1/2 cup cooked corn
1 carrot, shredded
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato pesto
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill, divided
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 large yellow bell peppers - tops removed, sliced into 2-inch rings, seeded, or to taste
2 tomatoes, sliced, or to taste
1/2 cup pasta sauce
1/2 cup chicken broth
3 green onions, thinly sliced, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine ground beef, rice, onion, eggs, corn, carrot, 1 tablespoon olive oil, bread crumbs, pesto, parsley, 1 tablespoon dill, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl.
Chop any remaining yellow bell pepper pieces and place them in the bottom of a baking dish. Add the remaining olive oil, tomatoes, pasta sauce, chicken broth, green onions, and remaining dill.
Arrange yellow bell pepper rings in the baking dish and fill with the beef-rice mixture. Spoon the pasta sauce mixture on top to cover. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and continue baking until beef is browned and peppers are still crunchy-soft, about 20 minutes more.

Description: 
I use pepper rings instead of the usual whole peppers; since it takes less time to bake, there is more meat taste instead of mostly peppers, and they look so pretty on the plate, in my opinion. I love using colored peppers for a fun visual effect! Serve with sour cream, Greek-style sour cream, or nonfat yogurt.
