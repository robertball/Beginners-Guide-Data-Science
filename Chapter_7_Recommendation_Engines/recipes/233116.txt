1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder

1/4 cup boiling water
Filling:
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 cup cold water
2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Mix flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; mash butter into the flour mixture until crumbly. Stir boiling water into the flour mixture to form a dough.
Dissolve cornstarch in cold water in a separate large bowl.

Drop dough into the skillet by the spoonful. Put skillet onto the prepared baking sheet.
