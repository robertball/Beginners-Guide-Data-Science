Description: 
This recipe was given to my mother in law 30 years ago when my husband was a little boy. He loves these and while time consuming they are well worth the work. I usually make a double batch because they go so quick. The chocolate mixture must be exact in order to get the right consistency. And separate between wax paper for storage.
