Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 pound paneer, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 tablespoons butter
2 onions, finely chopped
1 teaspoon ginger paste
1 teaspoon garlic paste
1 tablespoon ground cashews
1 teaspoon ground red chiles
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 cup half-and-half
1/2 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry paneer in 2 batches until golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer fried paneer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, retaining vegetable oil in skillet.
Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add ginger paste and garlic paste. Continue to cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Stir cashews, ground red chiles, cumin, coriander, and garam masala into onion mixture. Cook and stir for 1 minute.
Stir tomato sauce, half-and-half, milk, sugar, and salt into spice mixture; simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add fried paneer and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes more.
