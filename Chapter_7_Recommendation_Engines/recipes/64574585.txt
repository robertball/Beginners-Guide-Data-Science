Ingredients:
2 Cups flour
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
2 1/2 Cups old fashioned oats
1 1/2 Cups brown sugar
1 1/4 Cups butter, melted
2 eggs
1 Tbsp vanilla
2 1/2 Cups chocolate chips

Directions:
1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
2. Into your stand mixer or large mixing bowl place 2 C flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Toss them together with a fork to combine.
3. Grab 2 1/2 cups Old Fashioned Oats and add them to the mixing bowl.
4. Add 1 1/2 C brown sugar and toss everything together to mix.
5. Melt 1 1/4 C butter and pour it into the bowl. Mix for one minute.
6. Add 2 eggs and 1 Tb vanilla.
7. Mix until the dough has combined. It will be crumbly.
8. Add 2 1/2 C chocolate chips. I used milk chocolate, but semi sweet, butterscotch or cinnamon chips would also be fabulous. Mix the chips in.
9. Spray a 9x13 pan with cooking spray and press the dough into it.
10. Bake for 20 minutes. Stick a butter knife or toothpick into the center. When it comes out clean the bars are done. Don't worry if they look a little bit underdone. They should. :) This will help them stay nice and moist.
11. Allow them to cool completely and then cut into bars, or eat them warm from the pan...whatever suits your fancy.
