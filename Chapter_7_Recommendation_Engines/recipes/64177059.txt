Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 small white or yellow onion,chopped
1 red pepper, diced
2 pounds fresh tomatoes, finely chopped (you can use canned tomatoes)
1 teaspoon cumin
3-4 teaspoons chili powder, depending on how spicy you like it
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon curry powder
3 cups vegetarian broth, plus more if necessary
1 cup green lentils, rinsed
1/2 cup quinoa, rinsed
1- 15 oz can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1-15 oz can black beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup cilantro, finely chopped plus more for garnish
Avocado for topping, if desired

Directions:
Heat olive oil in large pot over medium-high heat. Once oil is hot, add garlic and cook for a minute or until fragrant and slightly golden. Add onion and red pepper and cook for 3-5 minutes or until onion is translucent. Add in tomatoes, cumin, chili and salt and pepper; bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer for 6-8 minutes or until tomatoes begin to break down.
Add broth, quinoa, and lentils; bring back to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 30-40 minutes or until lentils are tender and quinoa has expanded.
Stir in black beans, kidney beans, and cilantro. You can add a bit more broth if you feel you do not have enough, either way chili will continue to thicken. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed. Simmer a few minutes more. Top with avocado if desired.
