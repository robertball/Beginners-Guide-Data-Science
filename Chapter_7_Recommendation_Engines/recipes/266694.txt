Description: 
A simple way to enjoy purslane, which is a weed that you might be able to forage in your own backyard! Purslane has more omega-3s than any other plant source and a pleasant lemony flavor. Here I toss it with a simple mix of cherry tomatoes and cucumber for a cool salad with nice crunch.
