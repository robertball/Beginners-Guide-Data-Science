Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup vegan semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup ground unsalted cashews
2 tablespoons shelled unsalted sunflower seeds
1 tablespoon ground flax meal
1 tablespoon wheat germ
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 cup honey, warmed
1/3 cup almond butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x11-inch baking dish with aluminum foil.
Whisk oats, flour, chocolate chips, ground cashews, sunflower seeds, flax meal, wheat germ, cinnamon, and sea salt together in a large shallow bowl.
Stir warmed honey, almond butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until well-mixed. Pour honey mixture into oat mixture; stir until batter is well-combined. Turn batter out into prepared baking dish. Lay a sheet of waxed paper over batter and press firmly to evenly distribute in the baking dish. Remove and discard waxed paper.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and fragrant, about 12 minutes. Pull aluminum foil from baking dish and cool bars in the aluminum foil for 10 minutes; remove and discard aluminum foil. Cut into bars.
