1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup sliced green onions
1 Tbsp garlic minced
1 Tbsp mustard powder
2 Tbsp Seasame Seeds (optional)

Directions:
In a zippered plastic bag combine all ingredients minus seasame seeds.
Seal the bag, removing as much air as possible.
Allow steak to marinate in the fridge 3-4 hours.
Heat non-stick skillet over medium high heat.
Sear steak for about one minute on each side to seal in juices.
Continue to cook over medium-high for five minutes on each side.
Remove from heat and allow steak to rest for 3-5 minutes before cutting.
Sprinkle with seasame seeds and serve.
