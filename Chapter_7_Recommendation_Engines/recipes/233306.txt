Ingredients:
3 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth, divided
1/4 cup diced white onion
2 teaspoons minced garlic
24 frozen cooked Italian-style meatballs
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can mixed vegetables, drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes
1/2 cup dried small pasta shells
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried cilantro
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Stir 2 teaspoons chicken broth, white onion, and garlic together in a pot over medium-high heat; cook until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Pour remaining chicken broth into the pot; bring to a soft boil. Add meatballs, garbanzo beans, kidney beans, mixed vegetables, pasta shells, ground ginger, oregano, basil, and cilantro; season with salt and pepper. Stirring occasionally, bring soup to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and cook at a simmer until the pasta shells are tender and meatballs are heated through, 12 to 15 minutes.
