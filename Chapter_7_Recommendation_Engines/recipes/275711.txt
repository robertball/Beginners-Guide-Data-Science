Ingredients:
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 (.25 ounce) package powdered gelatin (such as Knox®)
3 cups heavy cream
1/2 cup white sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon zest, divided
1 tablespoon orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier®) (optional)

Directions:
Place lemon juice in a small bowl and sprinkle the unflavored gelatin over it. Let stand for about 15 minutes until gelatin softens.
Combine heavy cream, sugar, and 2 tablespoons lemon zest in a saucepan over medium-low heat; bring to a simmer. Whisk in gelatin mixture until dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in orange liqueur.
Strain the cream mixture into a medium bowl and divide evenly among small glass bowls or ramekins.
Place uncovered panna cottas into the refrigerator until set, at least 4 hours. If time permits, cover the bowls with plastic wrap and chill overnight.
Garnish with remaining lemon zest before serving.
