Ingredients:
1/3 cup fresh lime juice
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons granular no-calorie sucralose sweetener (e.g., Splenda Â®)
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 large carrot, julienned
1/4 large head green cabbage, shredded
1/4 large head coarsely chopped red cabbage
4 green onions, thinly sliced

Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the lime juice, cumin, cayenne pepper, sweetener, salt, and pepper until well combined and sweetener is completely dissolved. Add green and red cabbages, green onions, and carrots, and toss to coat. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving to allow flavors to develop. Serve chilled.

Description: 
I adapted this recipe while on the South Beach Diet. It is a wonderful complement to grilled meat and burgers and a welcome change from the Asian flavored or the mayo-based slaws.  The recipe is easily doubled.
