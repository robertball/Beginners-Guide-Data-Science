Ingredients:
PASTRIES:
2 1/2 to 3c flour
1c milk
1/4 tsp sugar
1(1/4oz) package active dry yeast
1 tsp salt
MEAT MIXTURE:
1 lb hamburger
1/2 tsp minced garlic
1/2 c chopped onions
1/2 c tomato sauce
1/4 tsp salt
1/8 tsp pepper
2 Tbsp parsley
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp ginger
4-8 oz mozzarella cheese (depending on how cheesy you want it)

Directions:
In mixing bowl add 1 1/2 c flour and yeast. In a saucepan heat the milk, salt and sugar until warm. Add the warmed milk to flour mixture. Beat on low speed for 1/2 minute, then beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Stir in as much remaining flour as possible. Place in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and put it in a warm place to rise for 1 hour.
Meanwhile, cook the onions, garlic and hamburger until the onions are tender and the meat is cooked. Drain the meat and add all remaining ingredients. Adding the cheese last.
Punch the dough on to a lightly floured surface, seperating it into 12 balls. Roll out to a 6 inch circle. Drop a spoonful  of meat in the center. BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET ANY OF THE MEAT MIXTURE ON THE EDGES OF YOUR CIRCLE! Fold the dough over and pinch closed. It will look like a pierogie.
Cook in hot oil until the dough starts to brown. Drain on paper towels.
