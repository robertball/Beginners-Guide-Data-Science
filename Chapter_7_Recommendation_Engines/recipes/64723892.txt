Ingredients:
1 lb of Brussels sprouts
2-3 Tbsp Olive Oil
Salt and Pepper
1/3 Cup Balsamic Vinegar
1/3 Cup Honey
1 tsp Rosemary
1/4 Cup Pine Nuts Toasted
1/4 Cup dried Cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Trim and split sprouts placing them face up on a jellyroll pan. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast for 30 minutes.  In a small saucepan toast the pine nuts in a small amount of olive oil and salt. Set aside. Make a balsamic glaze with the honey, balsamic vinegar, and rosemary.
When the sprouts come out of the oven, place them into a bowl. Sprinkle with pine nuts and dried cranberries, drizzle and toss with the glaze.  Serve warm.
