1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup sliced yellow bell pepper
½ cup sliced yellow onion
½ cup bean sprouts
1 tablespoon tamari soy sauce

1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Stir edamame and salt together in a microwave-safe dish; cover and cook in microwave for 1 minute.
Heat olive oil in a large wok over medium heat; add garlic and cook until fragrant and beginning to sizzle, about 1 minute. Add bell pepper and onion; cook and stir until beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Add bean sprouts and soy sauce; cook and stir until soy sauce begins to evaporate, about 1 minute. Add edamame, cooked pasta, sesame oil, and sesame seeds; stir until cooked through, about 30 seconds.

Description: 
I specifically wanted to make a vegetarian dish without tofu since I know how hard it is to be a vegetarian and not like tofu. I went through a lot of experimenting and failed stir-fries before I narrowed in on this recipe, so I hope you like it. Please let me know if you have any suggestions.
