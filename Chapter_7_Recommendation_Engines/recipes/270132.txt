Ingredients:
1 egg white
1/2 (16 ounce) box confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
Beat egg white in a bowl using an electric mixer until foamy. Add 1/2 of the confectioners' sugar and beat until just combined. Beat in remaining confectioners' sugar and lemon juice until soft peaks form and the icing holds an indentation when you "cut" it with a knife.

Description: 
This is a traditional royal icing, but the consistency is perfect for a Martha-style cookie! They are just BEAUTIFUL and the icing hardens but is not rock hard... ahhhhh perfection. Eat your heart out Martha! To add colors, transfer a small amount of royal icing from the base recipe into a different bowl and mix in WiltonÂ® gel icing colors.
