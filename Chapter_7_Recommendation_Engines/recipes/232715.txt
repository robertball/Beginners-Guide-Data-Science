Description: 
This is a great way to use garlic scapes - the curly green tops of garlic that you can get from the farm early in the growing season! The spinach cuts down some of the super-strong garlic flavor. Use as a sauce for hot pasta, a spread for sandwiches, mixed with mayo for a spread or dip, mixed with ranch dressing for salad. The possibilities are endless!
