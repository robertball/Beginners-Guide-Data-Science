Ingredients:
1 c whole mung beans
1/4 tsp turmeric
5 c water
1 - 10 oz pack frozen spinach, thawed (or 1/4 lb fresh, thoroughly rinsed and chopped)
1/2 tsp salt
4 T ghee
1/2 T cumin seed
1 c chopped onion
1 T ginger paste
1/2 T minced garlic
3 T cilantro, chopped
3 hot green chilies, minced
2 Roma type tomatoes, chopped
1/2 tsp garam masala

Directions:
Put the water, dal, salt, and turmeric in a pot and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and cook, partially covered, for about an hour and a half, until the dal is thoroughly softened and has pretty much dissolved.
Add the spinach to the beans.  Stir 'til the spinach has wilted.  Cook at a simmer for another 20 minutes or so.
Heat the ghee on med-high in a small frying pan.  Add the cumin - as soon as they start to brown (about 10 secs) - add the onion.  Stir until the onions start to brown (should take about 10 mins on med-high).
Add ginger, garlic, coriander, and chilies.  Keep stirring and fry for a couple mins longer.  Reduce heat if things look like they might start to burn.
Add tomatoes and continue to stir til the tomatoes are cooked and the mixture thickens.  The ghee may separate out; that's OK.
Pour over the dal mixture, stir, cook for another 5 mins or so.
Serve with rice.
