Ingredients:
4 tbsp. (30 g) flour
1 egg
4 tbsp. (60 ml) milk or other liquid
1 pinch of salt
1/2 tsp sugar (omit for savory)
3 drops vanilla (omit for savory)

Directions:
1. Whisk together egg, milk (or other liquid) and flour........can use juice, stock or plain water.
2. In separate bowl mix flour, salt and sugar.
3.  Combine wet with dry and mix well, until smooth.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 mins or more in the fridge.
4. Melt a little butter or vegetable oil in a 8" or 10" pan (non-stick is best), swirling to coat the bottom.
5.  Pour batter into pre-heated pan, tilting to cover bottom.
6.  When top is set, flip over gently with a spatula or just use your fingers.
7.  Cook briefly and remove from pan.
8.  Top or fill with fruit, yogurt, drizzle with honey or just top with syrup.  Sprinkle with some powdered sugar if you like.
9.  For blueberry sauce, mix 6 oz blueberries, 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup OJ.  Heat til bubbling, over med. heat.  This sauce doesn't get real thick, so you can toss the berries with a little flour or corn starch before cooking.

Description: 
I have always loved crepes, but never tried to make them.  Recipes always seemed to make way too much batter and almost impossible to half the ingreds..  I finally found a recipe that is for 1 crepe.  The ingreds. are very easy to double or triple.
These were filled with cherry preserves and blueberry yogurt and topped with blueberry sauce (recipe follows).
