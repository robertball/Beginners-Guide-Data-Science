Ingredients:
About 1 1/2 to 2 cups frozen french fries, thawed
8 slices lunch meat ham, diced
1/4 pound of your favorite cheese cut into small cubes (I use cheddar)
2 slices white bread cut into cubes (can use stale bread)
8 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
seasoning salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and spray an 8x8 inch pan with non-stick spray.
Spread thawed french fries in pan so they're in a single layer.
Sprinkle seasoning salt and pepper over french fries to taste.
Sprinkle ham, then, cheese, then bread cubes over french fries and finish with another sprinkle of seasoning salt.
In a mixing bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, salt and parsley.  Pour over casserole.
Bake, uncovered, about 40 minutes or until the center is set.  It should be nicely browned, but cover it with foil if it gets too brown.
Let sit 10 minutes and then enjoy!

Description: 
This casserole gets a minimum of dishes dirty (no silly using 3 pots to cook ingredients separately first) and is quick to assemble. It also tastes great! You can use leftover boiled potatoes or frozen hash browns or tater tots instead of the french fries, but raw potatoes will not cook properly. This makes 4 large servings and is our favorite special breakfast!
