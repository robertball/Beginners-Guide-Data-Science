Ingredients:
2 cups White Lily速 Enriched Bleached Self-Rising Flour or White Lily速 Enriched Unbleached Self-Rising Flour
1/4 cup Crisco速 All-Vegetable Shortening
3/4 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons butter, melted (optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 475 degrees F.
Place flour in large bowl. Cut in shortening with pastry blender or 2 knives until crumbs are the size of peas. Add buttermilk, stirring with fork just until flour is moistened.
Turn dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead gently 5 to 6 times, just until a smooth dough is formed. Roll dough into a 7-inch circle that is 3/4- to 1-inch thick. Cut out 7 to 8 biscuits using a floured 2-inch biscuit cutter. Place on baking sheet, about 1-inch apart. (For softer biscuits, arrange so that edges almost touch.) Shape dough scraps into a ball. Pat out until 3/4-inch thick. Cut out additional biscuits.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oven. Brush with butter, if desired.
