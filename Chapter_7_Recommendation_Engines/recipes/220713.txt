Ingredients:
12 asparagus spears
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups fresh bread crumbs
1/2 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
1 cup mayonnaise
2 green chile peppers, finely sliced
15 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Dampen asparagus lightly with water. Coat with flour; trying to avoid coating the tips.
Dip asparagus in beaten egg.
Roll and coat asparagus in a layer of breadcrumbs.
Place coated asparagus on a plate and refrigerate, allowing coating to stick, 15 to 20 minutes.
Stir mayonnaise, green chilies, and hot pepper sauce together in a small bowl for dipping sauce.
Heat vegetable oil in a fry pan over medium heat.
Fry coated asparagus in the hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately with dipping sauce.
