Ingredients:
4 frozen hash brown patties
4 bell peppers, tops cut off, seeded
1/2 pound ground beef
1 (15 ounce) can green beans, drained
1 fresh jalapeno pepper, diced (optional)
salt and pepper to taste
1 pinch cumin
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Cook the hashbrown patties according to package directions.  Mash with a fork and set aside.
Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat.  Place the peppers in the boiling water and turn off the stove.  After 10 minutes remove the peppers from the water and set aside.
In a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain.   Mix in the hashbrowns, green beans, jalapeno, salt, pepper, cumin, and cheddar cheese.
Loosely stuff the beef mixture into the peppers.  Place peppers onto a baking sheet.  Bake 20 minutes in a 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven. Let cool 1 minute before serving.

Description: 
Bell peppers stuffed with hashbrowns, ground beef, green beans, and cheese.  My apartment-mate and I invented this recipe while drinking beer and 'reminiscing' about elementary-school cafeteria food.  When we got around to trying it out, we were pleasantly surprised.  Beats your old school cook's tater tot hot dish!
