Description: 
Sometimes the basics are the best!  I've used this simple recipe for years to make garlic bread, and any leftovers go great on barbecued steaks, pasta, rice or potatoes. Also, fresh or minced garlic in a jar works well, though garlic paste is my favorite to use. Adjust the amount of garlic and add salt (slowly) to your taste.Modified from: Garlic Butter
