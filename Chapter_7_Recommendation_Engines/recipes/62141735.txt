Description: 
This is a very old, very traditional side dish in Scotland.  I had it as the starch one evening in Edinburgh, and really enjoyed it.  It pairs well with steaks or chops, and even works as a stuffing for game birds and steaks.  It's definitely worth a go for a truly traditional scottish side.
