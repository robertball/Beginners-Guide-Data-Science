Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 large onions, chopped
1 (4 ounce) package sliced pepperoni sausage, cut into 1/4-inch dice
4 cloves garlic
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 large carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces
½ head cabbage - cored, cut into 1-inch wedges, and wedges halved crosswise
kosher salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 ½ pounds tomatoes, coarsely chopped
2  zucchini, cut into 1-inch rounds
½ pound fresh green beans, trimmed
3  potatoes
1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat; cook and stir onions, pepperoni sausage, and garlic until garlic is golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer pepperoni mixture to a bowl and set aside.
Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in same pot; cook and stir carrots, cabbage, kosher salt, and black pepper until coated in hot oil. Place tomatoes, zucchini, and green beans into pot and scatter onion-pepperoni mixture over the top. Partially cover the pot and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 50 minutes.
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with lightly-salted water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and let potatoes cool. When cool enough to handle, cut potatoes into 1 1/2-inch pieces.
Gently fold potatoes into the vegetable stew and cook until heated through, about 3 more minutes; drizzle stew with 1 tablespoon olive oil and serve.
