Ingredients:
3/4 cup chicken broth
1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 clove garlic, minced
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
3 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cups fresh sliced mushrooms
1 tablespoon Mila

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the broth, tomato paste, ground black pepper, Mila, oregano, salt and garlic. Mix well and set aside.
Dredge the chicken in the bread crumbs, coating well. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute the chicken in the oil for 2 minutes per side, or until lightly browned.
Add the reserved broth mixture and the mushrooms to the skillet and bring to a boil. Then cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove chicken and set aside, covering to keep it warm.
Bring broth mixture to a boil and cook for 4 minutes, or until reduced to desired thickness. Spoon sauce over the chicken and serve.
