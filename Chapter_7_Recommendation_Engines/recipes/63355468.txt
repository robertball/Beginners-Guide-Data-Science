Ingredients:
3 med red potatoes thinly sliced
1 sweet yellow onion chopped
1 bell pepper (any color) chopped
5 mushrooms sliced
1 lb bacon fried and crumbled
1 tablespoon bacon grease
8 eggs (I like to use duck eggs but regular eggs are fine)
2 cups milk
2 cups cheddar cheese grated
Seasoning Salt 1 teaspoon (I use my own blend which is garlic powder, onion powder, and a little chili powder, but mostly salt.  **For those people that are very gluten sensitive make sure you are using a GF seasoning salt a lot of them have traces of gluten in the mixture.**)
Pepper 1 teaspoon

Heat oven to 350, and grease casserole dish with bacon grease
In kitchen aid put milk, eggs, salt and pepper beat them on med for 5 minutes; turn to low then add in bell pepper, onions, cheese and bacon mix for 1 Â½ minutes.

Bake at 350 for 35 minutes removed tin foil and bake for an additional 30 minutes or until eggs have set.
