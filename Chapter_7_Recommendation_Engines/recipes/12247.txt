Ingredients:
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
6 cups thinly sliced apples
1 lemon, juiced
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup butter, chilled and diced
9 caramel squares, quartered
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine apples, lemon juice, sugars, spices, flour, butter, and caramels.  Stir to coat fruit evenly.
Roll dough out, and cut out two crusts.  Line a pie plate with one of the crusts.  Spoon filling into the bottom crust, and cover with the top crust.  Crimp the edges. Place the pie on a baking sheet covered with foil.  Poke fork holes over top.  Sprinkle lightly with granulated sugar.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 50 minutes.  If you notice overbrowning after 30 minutes, reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Serve warm, or at room temperature.
