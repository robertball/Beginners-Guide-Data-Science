Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/3852182.jpg
Ingredients:
1 ½ pounds chicken wings, cut apart at joints, wing tips discarded
10 sprigs rosemary
½ whole head garlic, separated into cloves - cloves unpeeled and quartered
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 teaspoon lemon pepper
1 teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Arrange the chicken wings, rosemary, and garlic cloves on a broiler-proof baking sheet, making sure the chicken pieces are not touching. Drizzle the olive oil over the chicken and garlic. Season the wings on all sides with the lemon pepper and seasoned salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken meat is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 35 to 40 minutes, turning the wings once about halfway through the cooking time. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a wing should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Take the baking sheet from the oven and set the oven's broiler to High. Remove the garlic and rosemary from the sheet and set aside. Turn the wings again.
Broil the wings until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Garnish with the rosemary sprigs and garlic to serve.

Description: 
A little rosemary, a little garlic, little olive oil, and voila! Delicious and foolproof! Great for entertaining or just an intimate dinner for two. Serve with a Caesar salad, corn, anything you want! I usually use one 1 1/2-pound package of wings and, with salad, it's just about the perfect serving size for two. ENJOY!
