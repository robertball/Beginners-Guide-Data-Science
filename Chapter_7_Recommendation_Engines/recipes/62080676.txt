Ingredients:
16-20 cherry tomatoes
3 oz. jar Hormel Real Bacon Bits
1/2c. Miracle Whip
1/3c. chopped green onion
3T. grated Parmesan cheese(not from the box, I use Sargento's)
2T. chopped fresh parsley, opt.

Directions:
With a small sharp knife cut off the top 1/4th of the tomato & very small slice off the bottom, if needed to sit upright. Scoop out pulp with a baby or grapefruit spoon. Place each tomato, cut side down on paper towels to drain.
Combine remaining ingredients & spoon into tomatoes. Cover, chill till served.
This can be made the day ahead, if tomatoes were drained.
