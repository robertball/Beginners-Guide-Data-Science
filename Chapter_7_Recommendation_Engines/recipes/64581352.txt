Ingredients:
2 English (seedless) Cucumbers, peeled
2 Tbsp. of Rice Wine Vinegar, Roasted Garlic seasoned
1 Tbsp. of Toasted Sesame Oil
1 Tbsp. of Soy Sauce
1 tsp of granulated sugar
1/2 tsp. of salt
1/4 tsp. Toasted Sesame Seeds

Directions:
Using a spiralizer on the thinnest “noodle” setting, spiralize the cucumber into long, thin strands.
Place a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl. Place noodles in the strainer, sprinkle with the 1/2 teaspoon salt, and toss to combine. Let the noodles stand 30 minutes or so for cucumber to lose some of it's water.
Meanwhile, whisk together the vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and sugar in a mixing bowl until the sugar is dissolved.
Add the noodles to the dressing and gently toss to coat. Taste and season with more salt as needed. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.

Description: 
A chilled sesame salad of spiralized cucumber.  It reminds me of the seaweed salad you get at Japanese restaurants, but just cucumbers.
