Ingredients:
3/4 cup marshmallow creme
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 Tbs butter
2 Tbs milk

Directions:
In a microwave safe bowl, microwave the marshmallow creme and butter in 45-second bursts, stirring in between, until melted and smooth.
Mix in the cocoa powder and milk, stirring to blend completely.  If mixture is too thin, it can be thickened by stirring in up to an additional 1/4 cup of marshmallow creme, microwaving for an additional 30 seconds (if necessary) to melt the extra marshmallow creme.

Description: 
I was craving something chocolatey to dip my pretzels in, but I had no chocolate available for melting.  I scavenged in my cupboards and located marshmallow creme and cocoa powder.  These two ingredients, with a little help from some butter and milk, turned into a decadent pretzel dip that more than satisfied my craving!  It is also great for dipping chunks of fruit, pound cake, angel food cake, or even buttery crackers!
