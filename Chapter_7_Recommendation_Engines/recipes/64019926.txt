Description: 
Being gluten-free doesn't mean you have to skip the cookies.  These peanut butter chocolate chip cookies are so tasty that no one will know they are missing the flour.  Great with a cup of coffee or a glass of milk.  I developed this recipe out of necessity.  Gluten-free cookies are expensive and these homemade cookies taste like heaven!
