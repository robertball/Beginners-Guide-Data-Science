Ingredients:
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup vinegar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon cold water
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, cornstarch, cold water, ginger, garlic, and black pepper in a bowl.
Add chicken breasts to marinade and stir to coat.
Pour the marinade and chicken into a 9x9-inch square baking dish.
Cover and marinate chicken in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Bake chicken in marinade until meat is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 40 minutes, turning midway through cooking.

Description: 
A sweet marinade that is just so easy to make! I use this recipe whenever we bring dinner to another couple's house. I marinate it at home, then just cook it there.  It's great with white rice.
