Ingredients:
1 bunch green onions
1 1/2 lb. (24 oz.) shredded monterey jack and cheddar cheese
1 can cream of chicken soup (no water added)
16 oz sour cream
7 oz can diced green chilies
8  16  oz. cooked chicken (optional)
1 doz. corn tortillas
oil for frying
1 tomato

Directions:
Dice green onions (green part, too) and mix with cheese in large bowl.  In medium bowl combine soup, sour cream and green chilies.  If using chicken, chop into small pieces and divide into 4 equal piles.  Have 13” x 9” pan ready.
Heat ½” oil in a small frying pan.  Fry tortillas one at a time for 5-10 seconds on each side, but not enough to make them hard or crisp.  Drain on paper towels.  Place tortilla in pan.  Spoon a large tablespoon of sour cream mixture down center of tortilla.  If you’re using it, add 1/3 of a pile of diced chicken on top of the sour cream.  Place small handful of cheese/onion mixture on top -- not too much or you won’t be able to roll the tortilla into an enchilada.  Roll up tortilla and place in pan, seam down.  Repeat until all tortillas are cooked and filled.  There should be 8 enchiladas side by side in a row across the length of the pan, and two sets of two enchiladas going the other way on the side.
Spread remaining sour cream mixture over the enchiladas so no tortillas are visible.  Spread the remaining cheese/onion mixture over top.  Bake in 350° oven for 30 minutes.  If you’re not using a metal pan, you can heat in microwave for 5-7 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbling, but you’ll have to turn off the carousel – the 13” x 9” pan is too big to turn in most microwaves.
Dice tomato while cooking.  Sprinkle diced tomato on top when done.

A cheesy and tasty Mexican casserole that can be prepared ahead.  I made it for 8 Lake Powell houseboat trips and it got rave reviews every time.
