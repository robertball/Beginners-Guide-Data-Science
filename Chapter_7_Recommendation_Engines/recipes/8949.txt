1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup

Put uncooked spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes or until pasta is al dente. Drain.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl combine the chicken, cooked spaghetti, pimento, bell pepper, onion, soup, wine and 1 cup of the cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste and mix all together.
