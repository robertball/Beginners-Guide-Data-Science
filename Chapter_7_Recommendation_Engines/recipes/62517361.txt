Ingredients:
1.5 Lbs.         Ground Chuck
2 Large          Onions (Large Diced)
1.5 Cans (14 oz) Tomato Sauce
1 Can (14 oz)    Green Beans
2 Cans (14 oz)   Diced Tomatoes
1/2 Cup          Sugar
2 tsp            Rosemary
1/2 tsp          Salt
3/4 tsp          Course Ground Pepper
1/4 tsp          Lemon Pepper
6 Servings       Mashed Potatoes (Stiff)

Directions:
Brown Ground Chuck in  a large skillet.
Drain and discard any excess grease.
Add onions to the browned chuck and simmer slowly until the onions become clear.
Add rosemary, sugar, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, green beans, salt, pepper and lemon pepper. Bring mixture to a boil and then lower heat and slowly simmer (covered) for at least 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Uncover the pan and continue to simmer until mixture thickens stirring occasionally to insure mixture does not become dry.
When the mixture is complete most of the liquid should have been evaporated off.
When meat mixture is about finished make mashed potatoes - 6 servings.
Place the meat mixture in a 9" X 12" baking dish. Cover the meat mixture with mashed potatoes and bake for 30 minutes or until potatoes are golden brown.
Serve.
