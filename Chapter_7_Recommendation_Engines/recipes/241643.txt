Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with garlic and basil, drained
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
3/4 pound frozen pizza dough, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cook and stir beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally and breaking up lumps, until no longer pink, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain beef and return to skillet.
Add tomatoes and black pepper to beef; bring to a simmer and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Spoon mixture into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Scatter mozzarella cheese over the top. Stretch pizza dough over top with your hands, pressing it onto the edge of the pie plate.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting.

Description: 
Frozen pizza dough often comes in two 1-pound balls, and you need only 3/4 pound for this recipe. Either freeze the rest, or cut off a bit, pat it out, sprinkle with parmesan and olive oil, and bake it alongside the pizza.
