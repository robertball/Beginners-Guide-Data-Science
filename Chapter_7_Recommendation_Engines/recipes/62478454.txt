Ingredients:
1 recipe Baked Tortilla Chips (recipe follows) or 4 cups tortilla chips (about 4 ounces)
2 cups shredded Mexican-style four cheese blend, Monterey Jack cheese with jalapeño peppers, Monterey Jack, cheddar, queso quesadilla, Chihuahua, and/or asadero cheese (8 ounces)
1 16-ounce can refried beans or refried black beans
2/3 cup bottled salsa
1-1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 cup shredded cooked chicken or pork; cooked ground beef or bulk pork sausage; finely chopped cooked Spanish chorizo; or chopped cooked shrimp
1/2 cup roasted red or yellow sweet peppers, cut into thin strips and/or pitted ripe olives, coarsely chopped
1 4-ounce can  diced green chili peppers, drained
Toppings: thinly sliced green onions, snipped fresh cilantro, dairy sour cream, refrigerated guacamole, and/or additional bottled salsa (optional)

Directions:
Arrange tortilla chips on an 11- or 12-inch ovenproof platter or round pizza pan. Top with 1 cup of cheese.
In a medium saucepan, combine beans, the 2/3 cup salsa and cumin. Cook and stir over medium heat just until heated through. Remove from heat; spoon bean mixture over cheese and spread evenly (all chips may not be covered).
Sprinkle chicken, roasted peppers, chili peppers and remaining 1 cup cheese over bean mixture. Bake in a 425° oven for 5 to 7 minutes or until heated through and cheese is melted. Serve immediately with toppings, if you like.
Baked Tortilla Chips: Cut six 7- or 8-inch flour tortillas or 5- to 6-inch corn tortillas into wedges with scissors or a sharp knife. Place wedges in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in a 350° oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until light golden brown. Remove the chips from oven.
