Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant pumpkin-spice pudding mix (such as Jello®)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup softened butter
1/2 cup canned pumpkin
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup white chocolate chips
1 (14 ounce) package pumpkin-spice flavored candy-coated milk chocolate pieces (such as M&Ms;®)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine flour, pudding mix, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, and salt in a bowl.
Combine butter, pumpkin, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until fluffy. Beat in eggs, honey, and vanilla extract until incorporated. Mix in the dry ingredients slowly, being careful not to overmix. Stir in the white chocolate chips and pumpkin spice-flavored candies by hand. Drop tablespoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are browned and set, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 3 to 4 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
