Description: 
**I find that this recipe works well when you have company over and it’s so very filling. The broth made from the stock, lagar and seafood is delicious; the French/Italian bread absorbs the gravy so well. A chilled white wine - semi-sweet is recommend. I find that a Moscato, Alsace (chilled), or a Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling or White Zenfindel at room temperature pairs very well with this meal.
*Good food, good friends and great wine, hmm..doesn't get any better than this Chea, Laissez Le Bon Temps Roule'
