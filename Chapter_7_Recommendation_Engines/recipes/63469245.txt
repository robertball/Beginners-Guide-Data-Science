Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, chopped
1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled plum tomatoes with juice
or
4 cups ripe diced tomatoes
or
2 cans (14 oz. each) diced tomatoes
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 tsp chili powder (mild)
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp paprika
Pinch of cayenne pepper (or more to taste-- spicy!)
Pinch of sugar (optional, to taste)
2 slices pickled jalapeno pepper, finely chopped
1/2 tbsp fresh chopped parsley (optional, for garnish)
4-6 eggs
4 (6 inch) pita bread (optional)

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the canned tomatoes, spices and jalapenos; stir, using the back of a spoon to break up the tomatoes as needed.  Simmer for about 25 minutes.
Crack an egg into a small bowl, then gently slip the egg into the tomato sauce. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Cook the eggs until the whites are firm and the yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. If the tomato sauce gets dry, add a few tablespoons of water.
