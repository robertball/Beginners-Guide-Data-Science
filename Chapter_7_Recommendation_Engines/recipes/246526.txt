Description: 
Seattle-based soul singer Grace Love was born in the South, and learned to cook watching her parents in the kitchen. This satisfying dish was created using pantry staples. She calls it smothered because it's covered and finished in the oven. She calls it simple, but it's definitely comfort food at its Southern finest. Serve over steamed white rice.
