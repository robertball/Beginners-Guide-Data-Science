Ingredients:
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon water
1/4 cup orange marmalade

1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
2 (3/4 inch) thick bone-in pork loin chops
1 small lime, thinly sliced

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine the cornstarch, ginger, soy sauce and water until smooth.  Stir in the marmalade, lime juice, oil and garlic until blended.  Bring to a boil; cook and stir mixture for 1-2 minutes or until thickened.
Place the pork chops in a greased 8-in. baking dish.  Spoon glaze over pork, turn to coat.  Top with the lime slices.  Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until pork juices run clear.

Description: 
'I came across the recipe for this glaze in a grilling manual but wasn't satisfied with it.  I kept the combination of orange marmalade and lime juice and adapted the seasonings to my liking,' explains Helen Faddis of Gloucester, Massachusetts.  'It's also great on spareribs and chicken.'
