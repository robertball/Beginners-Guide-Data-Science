Ingredients:
1 750ml bottle of vodka (three olives or Van Gogh works best)
5 bags of gummy candy (haribo or Black Forest non sour)
1 glass 3qt baking pan
1 roll plastic wrap (Saran)
1 spatula

Directions:
Step 1. Take your Gummies and spread loosely throughout the pan, Make Sure no Gummies are sticking together.
Step 2. Add the entire bottle of Vodka, I used three olives bubble.
Step 3. Spread the Gummies throughout the pan making sure no Gummies are sticking together.
Step 4. Cover with plastic wrap and put in refrigerator.
Step 5. Wait 4-6hrs, pull Gummies out of refrigerator. Uncover and throw plastic wrap away. Take your spatula and fingers if necessary, and make sure their are absolutely no Gummies sticking to the pan or each other. (This is vital in producing good infused Gummies) Recover with new piece of plastic wrap and return to refrigerator.
Step 6. Repeat step 5 every 4-6 hours (again this step is absolutely necessary in creating the best infused Gummies)
Step 7. After 24hrs you can eat and enjoy your Gummies. Serve them with a slotted metal or wood spoon, using any non plastic container.(vodka and plastic is a no no) Most recipes say to throw away the vodka Gummy mixture left in the bottom of the pan, I however say to drink it!!! It's still vodka with extra sugar and a bit of gelatin mixture...
