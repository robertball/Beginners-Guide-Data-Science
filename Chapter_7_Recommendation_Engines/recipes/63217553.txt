Ingredients:
1/4 c. butter or margarine
1/4 c. flour
salt and pepper to taste
1 c. milk
1 c. soft bread crumbs
1# can salmon
flour
1 egg, beaten
1 1/2 c. dry bread crumbs
1 can mushroom soup (not condensed)
1 T. lemon juice
1 c. light cream

Directions:
Melt butter in saucepan; stir in flour, salt, and pepper. Add milk slowly; cook till thick. Remove from heat. Blend in soft crumbs and salmon.  CHILL FOR SEVERAL HOURS!
Shape mixture into eight croquettes or patties.  Roll in flour, dip in egg, roll in bread crumbs.
In a heated skillet with oil, fry croquettes till golden.
Combine soup, lemon juice, cream, and a little cornstarch to thicken, and heat till bubbly.  Serve over croquettes. Or make homemade from recipe, but use only homemade veggie broth--bought is too sweet.
