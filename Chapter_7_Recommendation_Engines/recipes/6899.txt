Ingredients:
1/4 cup cornmeal
1 cup boiling water
1 tablespoon margarine
1/4 cup molasses
1 egg, beaten
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups frozen blueberries, dry pack

Directions:
Stir cornmeal into boiling water. Stir in butter, molasses, and egg.
Dissolve yeast in warm water (110 degrees F).
When cornmeal mixture is lukewarm, stir in dissolved yeast. Beat in flour until a stiff dough is formed. Knead dough on a heavily floured board until smooth and elastic. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk.
Punch down and roll dough into a 10" square. Sprinkle blueberries over dough, pressing them into the dough. Roll up like a jelly roll. Tuck ends of roll under to seal ends and place seam-side down into a well-greased 9x5x3 inch loaf pan. Let rise in a warm place until double in bulk.
Bake in a preheated oven at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45-50 minutes. Turn out and cool on a rack. Cool thoroughly before cutting.
