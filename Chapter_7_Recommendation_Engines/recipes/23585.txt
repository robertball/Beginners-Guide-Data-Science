Ingredients:
4 cups apple cider
4 pounds cooking apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
2 cups white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar

Directions:
In a 5 quart saucepan, bring apple cider and apples to a boil. Reduce heat. Cover and, stirring often, simmer 10 minutes, or until the apples are very tender.
Sieve the mixture through a strainer or food mill, then return to simmer in the saucepan.
Stir sugar and brown sugar into the mixture. Simmer uncovered 2 hours, stirring often, until the mixture reaches a spreadable consistency.
Transfer to sterile containers and refrigerate or freeze until serving.

This is a tasty recipe that I got from my mom.  As a child, I used to eat it on hot buttered toast. It's so easy to make, and it tastes great!
