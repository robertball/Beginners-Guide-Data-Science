Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups orange juice
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup chopped fresh chives
3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (2.5 pound) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix the orange juice, olive oil, chives, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Place the chicken in the mixture. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator at least 4 hours.
Preheat the oven broiler.
Remove the chicken from the marinade, and shake off excess. Pour the marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 10 minutes; set aside.
Arrange the chicken on a baking sheet. Broil 30 minutes in the preheated oven, 6 to 8 inches from heat. Turn and brush frequently with the remaining marinade mixture, until no longer pink and juices run clear.

Description: 
It's fabulous hot or cold. I make a big batch so there are leftovers (which make tasty quesadillas). I move my oven rack to a lower setting to keep the chicken moist, and even then it barely takes 30 minutes.
