Ingredients:
3 whole wheat pocket pitas
12 oz shredded mozzarella cheese
1 can chickpeas
3 stalks celery
60 leaves baby spinach
olive oil
6 toothpicks
to taste:
dried basil
ground mustard
salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Chop the celery into roughly 1/4" square pieces.
Place the celery in a frying pan.  Pour just enough olive oil into the frying pan to coat its bottom and the celery but not to leave excess.
Saute on medium heat until the celery is cooked; it should be somewhat soft.
Drain the liquid from the chickpeas, then dump them into a large mixing bowl.  Mash them until about half of them are broken down.
Add the cheese, celery, and seasonings.  Add enough olive oil to coat everything but to leave no excess.
Stir thoroughly.
Cut the pocket pitas in half.
Place a piece of parchment paper on a cookie sheet.
Place 5 leaves of spinach on the bottom of each pita pocket half so that they cover their entire bottoms.
Spoon equal amounts of the cheese mixture into each pita pocket half.
Place 5 leaves of spinach on the top of each pita pocket half.
Place a toothpick through each pita pocket half.
Place the pita pockets on the cookie sheet, and drizzle olive oil over them.
Put the cookie sheet in the oven for 5 to 8 minutes.
After removing the cookie sheet, let it cool for a few minutes.
Using a spatula, push the cheese that fell out of the pita pockets back in.

Description: 
This dinner is great all year round; in the summer, use the grill to heat instead of the oven.  It has a rich, nearly tuna-like flavor, and a Mediterranean inspiration.
