Ingredients:
4 seedless cucumbers
1/2 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
2 teaspoons water
3/4 cup nonfat sour cream
2 ounces smoked salmon, chopped
1 tablespoon jarred horseradish, drained
1 teaspoon Tabasco
1/4 cup fresh dill leaves, chopped fine
1/4 cup black sesame seeds
1/4 cup white sesame seeds

Directions:
Stir gelatin into warm water in a saucepan over low heat until dissolved. Add 1/4 cup of the sour cream and whisk until smooth. In a food processor, puree the salmon until very smooth, then add to the gelatin mixture along with the horseradish, Tabasco, remaining sour cream and salt and white pepper to taste.
Chill the mousse, covered, for 1 hour or until it stiffens.
Toast sesame seeds and toss to combine. Peel cucumbers and slice lengthwise into planks 1/4-inch thick, discarding the softest part of the center. Cut planks into squares and sprinkle one side only with sesame seeds. Arrange on platters.
Scoop about 1-2 teaspoons of mousse onto each cucumber square, sesame seed side down, and sprinkle with dill leaves. Top with another cucumber square with sesame seed side up. Serve.
