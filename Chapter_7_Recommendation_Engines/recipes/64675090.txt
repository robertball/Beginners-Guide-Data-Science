Ingredients:
6 salmon fillets (about 4 ounces each)
1/3 cup sour cream
2/3 cup dry bread crumbs (Panko works well)
2/3 cup chopped pistachios (other nuts work, too)
1 shallot, minced (about 1/2 cup)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 to 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish--or more, if you like more bite
1 tablespoon snipped fresh dill or 1 teaspoon dill weed
1/2 teaspoon grated lemon or orange zest
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 garlic clove, minced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°.
Place salmon skin side down in an ungreased 15x10x1-in. baking pan that's been lined with tin foil.
Spread sour cream over each fillet.
Combine remaining ingredients.
Pat crumb-nut mixture onto tops and sides of salmon fillets, pressing to help coating stick to fish.
Bake until fish just begins to flake easily with a fork, 12-15 minutes.
