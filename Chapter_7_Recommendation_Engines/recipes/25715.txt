1 pound seedless green grapes, skinned

Description: 
This is a cold garlicky soup. In fact it is never cooked at all! In Spain they use fresh almonds, just out of their shells, so the taste will be different than the soup you had in Spain unless, of course, you have access to fresh almonds. You can also substitute melon for the green grapes.
