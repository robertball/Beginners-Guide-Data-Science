Ingredients:
1 (17.3 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 1/3 cups chopped onions
1 cup sliced carrots
1 cup chopped celery
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 1/2 cups vegetable broth, divided
1 cup fresh or frozen peas
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 (8 ounce) package Morningstar Farms® Meal Starters™ Chik'n Strips
1 cup sliced zucchini
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Measure dimensions of six 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-cup casseroles or custard cups. On lightly floured surface roll each sheet of pastry into a 16 x 12-inch rectangle. Cut pastry into 6 pieces, each piece should measure 1 inch larger than the dimensions of the casseroles. Stack pastry pieces on plate, layering wax paper between each piece. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate.
In large saucepan cook onions, carrots and celery in butter until onion is tender. Stir in 2 cups of the broth, peas and thyme. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, for 3 to 4 minutes or until peas are tender. Add Morningstar Farms(R) Meal Starters(TM) Chik'n Strips, zucchini and pepper. Cook, covered, over medium-high heat about 3 minutes or until heated through, stirring occasionally.
In small bowl whisk together remaining broth and flour. Stir into vegetable mixture. Bring to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil for 1 minute. Spoon into casseroles.
Place one pastry piece on top of each casserole. Press overhanging pastry firmly against side of each casserole. Cut a few slits in top of pastry to allow steam to escape. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until pastry is puffed and golden brown.
