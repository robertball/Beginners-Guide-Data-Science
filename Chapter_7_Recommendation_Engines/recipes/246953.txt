Ingredients:
2 cups milk
3 eggs
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 dash salt
1 dash ground nutmeg (optional)

Directions:
Combine milk, eggs, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour, sugar, salt, and nutmeg in a blender; blend until batter is smooth.
Heat a seasoned griddle over medium-high heat. Ladle 1/4 to 1/2 cup of batter onto the griddle and spread thinly. Cook until top looks barely dry, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Slide a long, thin spatula under pancake to loosen edges; flip. Continue cooking until just browned on the second side, about 1 minute more.
Roll up pancakes and serve a few at a time.

Description: 
I grew up in Little Sweden, USA, and my great-grandparents on my Mom's side were all from Sweden. This is the recipe I grew up with (I added the nutmeg as I like nutmeg). I love these and make them for family brunches all the time. They even taste good as leftovers, as pancakes again, or with peanut butter instead. 

We serve these with just syrup and butter, but many use lingonberries, or other fruit or jams.
