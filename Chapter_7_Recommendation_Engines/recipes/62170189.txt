Description: 
I was first served a blueberry version of this pudding at a friends house, the pie was delicious even though I am not a fan of blueberries, so I changed the recipe a little so that I could use apples and if I have to say so myself, its very good!!  Perfect served hot with a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream.
