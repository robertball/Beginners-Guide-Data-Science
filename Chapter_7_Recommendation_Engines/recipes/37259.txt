Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup shortening
1 1/4 cups ice water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, thinly sliced
4 cloves garlic
2 carrots, thinly sliced
1 turnip, peeled and diced
2 potatoes, peeled and diced
1/2 pound mushrooms, chopped
2 tablespoons water
1 cube vegetable bouillon
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
salt and pepper to taste
1 eggs, beaten

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water until mixture forms a ball. Divide dough into 8 pieces, and shape into balls. Cover, and set aside.
Heat olive oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in carrot, turnip, potatoes and mushrooms. Add water, bouillon cube, tarragon, salt and pepper. Cook for 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Roll each pastry ball into a circle, 6 to 8 inches in diameter. Place about 1 cup of filling on one half of each circle. Fold pastry over filling, and pinch edges to seal. Place on baking sheet, and brush with egg.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until golden brown.
