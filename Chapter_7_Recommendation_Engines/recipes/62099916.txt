Directions:
For those who are going to market and not too sure on what to ask for-Aji is pronounced ah-hee.
Cut aji caballeros and aji dulce in half (keep seeds for a hotter sauce). Sautee aji caballeros, aji dulce, 1/4 of the onion and garlic in olive oil 2 minutes .  Let cool.
Add chile, garlic, onion, cilantro, recao, salt, pepper, cacao, cumino, oregano, lime juice, vinegar, alcohol, sugar and pineapple juice to blender until smooth. For a thinner consistency add more lime juice or pineapple juice.
Let sit at least a week before using to blend flavors.
Store in glass bottle in fridge. Will keep for several weeks.

Description: 
This recipe is for HOT sauce! Hot but flavorful. The consistence isn't liquidy like Tabasco. It's a little on the thick side so it doesn't disappear when you put it on your food. Great with everything on your plate....that is if you love it hot & spicy!
