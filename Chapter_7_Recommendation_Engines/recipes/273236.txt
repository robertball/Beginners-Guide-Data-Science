Ingredients:
4 slices bacon, chopped
3 cloves garlic
1/4 onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped carrots
1/4 cup peas
2 cups cooked white rice, cooled
1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste
2 eggs

Directions:
Cook and stir bacon in a medium-sized pot over medium heat until cooked through and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in garlic, onion, carrots, and peas; cook until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add rice and drizzle with soy sauce. Cook and stir until rice is golden brown, about 5 minutes more.
Push rice and veggie mixture to one side of the pot. Crack eggs and scramble on opposite side, 2 to 3 minutes. Combine with rice mixture. Serve.
