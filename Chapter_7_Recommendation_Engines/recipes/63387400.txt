Ingredients:
1/2 cup ground coffee beans
2 cups cold water
3 tablespoons Kahlua
5 ounces marscapone cheese
2 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 egg yolks
1/3 cup sugar
7 ounces heavy whipping cream
1 envelope Whippit (optional)
2 tablespoons Kahlua
24 lady fingers
3 tablespoons cocoa

Directions:
Brew coffee and allow to cool completely. Stir in 3 tablespoons Kahlua and set aside.
In mixing bowl beat egg yolks and sugar on high until light and fluffy. Turn speed to medium and gradually add cream cheese beating well after each addition. Add marscapone cheese and mix just until blended. Add 2 tablespoons Kahlua and blend well. In separate mixing bowl beat whipping cream (add the Whippit if using) until stiff peaks form. Gently fold whipped cream into cheese mixture. Using half the lady fingers quickly dip each into the coffee Kahlua mixture and lay in bottom on 8 x 8 pan to completely cover bottom of pan. Spoon 1/2 the cheese mixture over lady fingers in pan and smooth evenly. Sprinkle surface with 1/2 the cocoa using sieve. Repeat layer using rest of lady fingers dipped in coffee mixture, cheese mixture and sprinkle top with rest of cocoa. Cover and chill at least 4 hours before serving.
