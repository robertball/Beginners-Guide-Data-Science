Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cut rolled oats
3 T butter
3 3/4 to 4 3/4 cups flour
1/4 cup sugar
2 t. salt
2 packages active dry yeast
1 egg
1 T grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 t. basil
1/4 t. oregano
1/4 t. garlic powder
6 T butter, melted

Directions:
Grease 13x9 inch baking pan.
Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan; stir in rolled oats.  Remove from heat; stir in 3 T butter.  Cool to 120 to 130.
In a large bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast; blend well.  Add rolled oats mixture and egg.  Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed.  By hand, stir in 1 3/4 to 2 1/2 cups flour to form stiff dough.
On floured surface, knead in 1/2 to 3/4 cup flour until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Shape dough into ball; cover with large bowl. Let rest 15 minutes.
Punch down dough to remove all air bubbles.  Press into greased pan.  Using a very sharp knife, cut diagonal lines 1 1/2 inches apart, cutting completely through dough.  Repeat in opposite direction creating diamond pattern.  Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap and towel.  Let rise in warm place until light and doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
Heat oven to 375.
Uncover dough.  Redefine cuts by poking tip of knife into cuts until knife hits bottom of pan; do not pull knife through dough.
In small bowl, combine cheese, basil, oregano and garlic; set aside.
Spoon 4 tablespoons of melted butter over cut dough. Bake for 15 minutes.  Brush remaining 2 tablespoons of butter over partially-baked bread.  Sprinkle with cheese-herb mixture.  Bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.
