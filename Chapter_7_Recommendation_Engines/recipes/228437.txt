Ingredients:
1 tablespoon instant coffee granules (such as NescafeÂ®)
1/4 cup hot water
1 cup cottage cheese
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 (5.3 ounce) package ladyfinger cookies
1/2 (16 ounce) package fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced
4 whole fresh strawberries

Directions:
Stir instant coffee granules and water together in a bowl until dissolved. Let cool.
Beat cottage cheese, cream, and confectioners' sugar together in a separate bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes.
Brush each ladyfinger cookie with coffee. Arrange a few ladyfingers in the bottom of 4 serving glasses. Spread a layer of cream filling atop the ladyfingers. Layer a few strawberry slices atop cream filling. Repeat with remaining ladyfingers, cream filling, and sliced strawberries, ending with a layer of cream filling. Garnish each glass with a whole strawberry.
