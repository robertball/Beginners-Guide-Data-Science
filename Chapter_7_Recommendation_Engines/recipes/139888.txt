Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon cumin seed
1  onion, finely chopped
¼ cup tomato paste
¼ cup water
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
½ (14 ounce) can coconut milk
½ teaspoon brown sugar
½ teaspoon hot chile paste (optional)
1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
¾ teaspoon ground turmeric
salt and pepper to taste
½ cup chopped cilantro

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds, and fry for a few minutes until they become fragrant and begin to pop. Stir in chopped onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.
Stir together tomato paste and water, and pour into skillet. Stir in chicken, and cook until it has firmed and turned white, about 5 minutes. Add coconut milk, brown sugar, chile paste, cayenne pepper, turmeric, salt, and pepper.
Bring mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and continue to simmer until the chicken is tender and no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro before serving.
