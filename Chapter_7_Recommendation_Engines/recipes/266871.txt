1 1/3 cups semolina flour
1 cup warm water
2 tablespoons vital wheat gluten

Directions:
Load bread flour, semolina flour, water, wheat gluten, sugar, olive oil, yeast, and salt into a bread maker according to manufacturer's directions and set on dough cycle.
Let dough rest for a few minutes after cycle is completed. Divide dough into 6 equal portions and roll into circles no more than 1/4-inch thick.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Lightly oil dough circles on both sides.
Put dough on the grill and cook until set, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip dough and cook about 1 minute more.
