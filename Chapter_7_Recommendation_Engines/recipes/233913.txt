Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds chopped cooked turkey
2/3 cup creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle WhipÂ®)
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
2 jalapeno peppers, chopped
2 tablespoons minced onion
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (15 ounce) package flour tortillas
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend
4 ounces shredded lettuce

Directions:
Mix turkey, salad dressing, tomatoes with green chile peppers, jalapeno peppers, onion, chili powder, and black pepper together in a bowl until turkey salad is evenly combined.
Stack tortillas on a microwave-safe plate and cover with a paper towel. Microwave until tortillas are warmed, 20 to 30 seconds.
Spread about 2 tablespoons turkey salad onto 1 side of each tortilla; top with Mexican cheese blend and lettuce. Fold opposing edges of the tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling in a burrito-style.

Description: 
I was looking for an easy turkey salad recipe to go with the ingredients I had on hand, but couldn't find one I liked. So quite naturally, I came up with my own. These have just a touch of spice to them. I found them both, easy and good.
