Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground red pepper
1 (1-pound) pork tenderloin, trimmed
2 center-cut bacon slices
1 pound quartered new potatoes
6 green onions, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375°.
2. Combine salt, black pepper, paprika, sugar, and red pepper in a bowl. Rub spice mixture evenly over pork tenderloin.
3. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add bacon to pan; cook 4 minutes or until crisp. Remove bacon from pan; crumble. Add potatoes and onions to drippings in pan; cook 4 minutes or until lightly browned, turning once. Remove potato mixture from pan. Add pork to pan; cook 3 minutes. Turn pork over; return potato mixture to pan with pork. Sprinkle garlic over potato mixture. Bake at 375° for 12 minutes or until a thermometer inserted in pork registers 145°. Remove pork from pan; let stand 5 minutes. Cut across the grain into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Sprinkle bacon and parsley over potato mixture; serve with pork.
