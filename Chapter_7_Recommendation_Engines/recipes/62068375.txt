Ingredients:
2 C. all-purpose baking mix
3/4 c. sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded
1/4 c. sun dried tomatoes, thinly sliced
1/4 c. chopped pepperoni
2 T. cornmeal
1/2 t. onion powder
1/2 t. Italian seasoning
3 T. Parmesan cheese, divided
3/4 c. buttermilk or sour milk
1 1/2 t. olive oil
1/4 t. black pepper

Directions:
Combine the first 8 ingredients along with 2 T. of the Parmesan cheese. Next, add the buttermilk. Stir until a soft dough forms. Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface and pat into an 8-inch circle. Place on a greased baking sheet. Brush with olive oil, then sprinkle evenly with the black pepper and the remaining Parmesan. Cut the dough into 12 wedges, but do not separate them.
Bake at 400F. for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Separate the wedges and serve with warm pizza sauce, if desired.
