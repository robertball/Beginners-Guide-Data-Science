Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 envelope Italian salad dressing mix
1/4 c. water
4 oz. can of mushroom pieces and stems, drained
8 oz. cream cheese, softened
1 can cream of chicken soup
hot cooked noodles or rice

Directions:
Place chicken in crockpot. Combine salad dressing and water--mix, and pour over chicken. Cook on low for 3 hours. (if leaving it in all day while at work, I just make sure the chicken is frozen when I put it in, and add a little extra water so it doesn't get too dry!) In a small bowl, beat cream cheese and soup until well blended. Stir in mushrooms and pour over chicken. Cook one hour longer OR until chicken juices run clear. Serve over rice or noodles--Enjoy! :)
