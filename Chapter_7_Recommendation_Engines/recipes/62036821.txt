Add sliced water chestnuts and shrimp.
Chill.  (Can be heated before serving if desired)
Cut top from round (or oblong) loaf.  Remove bread from the inside leaving shell about 1 inch thick.  (Reserve removed bread for dipping).  Fill with dip.  You may need to double the recipe if the loaf is large.
As an alternative,bread bowl and dip can be wrapped in foil and in 300 deg. over heated for 2 hours.  Remove from oven and turn foil back.  Use reserved bread cut into pieces for dipping.  After dip is finished break off pieces of shell and enjoy the best part of all.
An assortment of crackers can also be used for dipping.
