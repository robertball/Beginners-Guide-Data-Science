1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup coconut oil, melted

Pour batter into the prepared pan; smooth top with a rubber spatula.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 25 minutes.
