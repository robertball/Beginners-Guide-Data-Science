Ingredients:
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, divided
1/8 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
1 1/2 pounds pork chops
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoons lime juice
2 teaspoons garlic powder

Directions:
Mix salt, Italian seasoning, black pepper, chili powder, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, paprika, and onion powder together in a bowl. Sprinkle spice mixture generously on both sides of pork chops.
Heat butter and olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook pork until no longer pink in the center and golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer pork chops to a serving plate, reserving juices in the skillet.
Add lime juice and garlic powder to the same skillet and mix into leftover juices. Stir to combine and pour over the pork chops.
