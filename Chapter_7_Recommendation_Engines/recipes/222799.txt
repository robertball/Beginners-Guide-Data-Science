Ingredients:
1/4 cup Carapelli Premium 100% Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil
2 tablespoons Champagne vinegar or sherry vinegar
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon coarse sea salt or kosher salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound uncooked large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/2 fresh pineapple, peeled and cored, cut lengthwise into 4 slabs
8 cups mixed field greens or baby greens
3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil or tarragon leaves

Directions:
Heat a grill to medium-high heat or have a ridged grill pan ready. For vinaigrette, whisk together oil, vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Transfer 3 tablespoons of the mixture to a pie plate or shallow plate. Stir pepper flakes and garlic into oil mixture on plate.
(Sneak a quick dip of artisan bread into the mixture - so good!)
Add shrimp to plate; toss with oil mixture. Thread shrimp onto metal skewers or soaked bamboo skewers. Brush oil mixture from plate over skewers. Transfer skewers to grill; discard marinade on plate. Add pineapple to grill. Grill shrimp and pineapple (or cook shrimp in a heated ridged grill pan over medium heat and grill pineapple in pan after shrimp is removed) 4 minutes. Turn skewers and pineapple over; continue grilling 4 to 5 minutes or until shrimp are opaque.
Meanwhile, toss mixed greens with remaining vinaigrette; arrange on four large serving plates. Carve pineapple crosswise into 1/2 inch thick slices; arrange over salads. Remove shrimp from skewers; arrange over salads. Top with basil.
