Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 cup butter, softened
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup quick cooking oats
1 cup shredded zucchini
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets.
Stir together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and cloves in a bowl; set aside. Beat the butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Add the egg and the vanilla extract.  Mix in the flour mixture and oats until just incorporated.
Wring the zucchini in a clean towel to remove any excess moisture. Stir the zucchini and raisins into the dough; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop batter by rounded teaspoonfuls 2-inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 14 to 16 minutes or until the bottom edges turn golden brown.

Description: 
In my efforts to use the abundance of zucchini in my garden I concocted this little cookie.  I prefer my oatmeal cookies to have a little jazz, so if you are not a fan of ground cloves, they can be omitted.  It's a not too sweet cake-like cookie that is perfect with your cup of coffee or tea.
