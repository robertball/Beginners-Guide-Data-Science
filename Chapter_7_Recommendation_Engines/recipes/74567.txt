Ingredients:
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 dried red chile pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon whole grain mustard
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
sea salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper
2 (6 ounce) fillets salmon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a medium baking dish with aluminum foil. Lightly grease foil.
With a mortar and pestle, grind together the garlic, chile pepper, and olive oil. Mix into a thick paste with the mustard, lime juice, salt, and pepper. Place the salmon fillets in the prepared baking dish, and coat with the paste mixture.
Bake salmon 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork.

Description: 
This is an unbelievably delicious and quick salmon recipe. You can play around with the ingredients: add fresh basil leaves instead of the chili or balsamic instead of the lemon juice. The wholegrain mustard is essential. You are guaranteed to love this one! Serve with a green salad, and enjoy!
