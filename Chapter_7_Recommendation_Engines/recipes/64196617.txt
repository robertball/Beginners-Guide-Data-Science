Ingredients:
1 red onion, cut into 8 wedges
300g carrots, cut into 2cm chunks
300g parsnips, cut into 2cm chunks
300g peeled butternut squash, cut into 2cm chunks
1 small potato, cut into 2cm chunks
2 garlic cloves
1 tbsp ras el hanout
1½ tbsp olive oil
1.3l hot vegetable stock
6 tbsp Greek-style yogurt and 1 tbsp finely chopped mint, to serve (optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Tip all the vegetables and the garlic into a roasting tin. Sprinkle over the ras el hanout and some seasoning, drizzle over the oil and give everything a good stir. Roast for 30-35 mins, turning the vegetables over halfway, until they’re tender and starting to caramelise a little.
Transfer the roasted veg to a large saucepan, pour over the hot stock and simmer for 5 mins. Pure´e the soup in a food processor, or in the pan with a hand blender, until smooth, then ladle into a flask for work. If eating at home, serve with a dollop of yogurt, a scattering of mint and a grinding of black pepper.
