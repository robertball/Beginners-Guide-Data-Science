Ingredients:
7 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
7 egg yolks, beaten
1 tablespoon granulated Splenda
1 pinch salt
7 egg white
1 1/4 cups heavy cream

Directions:
Place chocolate in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally until mostly melted, then remove from heat, and stir until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly.
In a separate bowl, whip heavy cream to medium stiff peaks, but do not allow it to become grainy. Set aside.
In a separate bowl, whip egg whites with salt until soft peaks form. Sprinkle in the sugar, and continue whipping to medium stiff peaks. Fold in egg yolks.
Fold in the melted chocolate until completely incorporated, then fold in whipped cream until evenly blended. Spoon into dessert cups, and chill until firm, about 1 hour.
