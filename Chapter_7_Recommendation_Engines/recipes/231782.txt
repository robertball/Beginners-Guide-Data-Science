Ingredients:
2 large eggs
1/3 cup fat-free plain yogurt
1/4 cup soy flour
4 (1 gram) packets stevia sugar substitute (such as TruviaÂ®)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon ground flaxseed
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.
Whisk eggs, yogurt, soy flour, sugar substitute, olive oil, flaxseed, vanilla, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl until smooth.
Ladle batter onto griddle by 1/4 cupful; spread lightly with the back of the ladle.
Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip carefully and cook until browned on the other side, another 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
A good-for-you, tasty recipe for those of us who are cutting down on wheat. High in protein and tasty. These are floppier than a traditional pancake, so use care to flip them. Smaller, thinner cakes are helpful.
