Ingredients:
2 slices sourdough bread
1/4 cup Caesar salad dressing
1 cooked chicken breast, diced
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon bacon bits
1 1/2 teaspoons chipotle chile powder, or to taste
2 tablespoons softened butter

Directions:
Preheat a panini press for medium-high heat.
Spread one side of each piece of bread with the Caesar dressing. Place the chicken on top of the bottom slice, sprinkle with Cheddar cheese, bacon bits, and chipotle chile powder. Place the top piece of bread onto the sandwich, and butter the outsides with the softened butter.
Cook on the preheated grill until the bread is crispy and golden brown, and the inside of the sandwich is hot, about 5 minutes.
