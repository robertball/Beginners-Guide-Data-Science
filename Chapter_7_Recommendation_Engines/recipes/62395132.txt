Ingredients:
1 (8 oz.) pkg. cream cheese, room temperature
1 small can chopped ripe olives (chopped black olives)
4 tablespoons chopped green onions
6 tablespoons mayonnaise
4 teaspoons mustard
1 teaspoon Worcestershire Sauce
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
*cooked bacon slices, one slice for each sandwich (or you can use cut/chopped cooked bacon)
*tomato slices 2 per sandwich (or equivalent of chopped tomato)
Hoagie rolls or French bread

Directions:
In a bowl mix together;  cream cheese, olives, green onions, mayonnaise, mustard and Worcestershire sauce and shredded cheese. Cover and let set overnight in refrigerator.
Before making sandwiches take the bowl out of refrigerator and let it come to room temperature to spread easily.
Preheat oven to 350. Place foil on cookie sheet.  Cut bread lengthwise so that each sandwich will have 1/2 of a hoagie roll (top or bottom).  Place the hoagie halves on the foiled cookie sheet.
Spread the cream cheese mixture evenly on each hoagie halves.  Top with tomato and cooked bacon.
Place in oven for 20 minutes.
Remove and serve warm.  (be careful, sandwich will be very hot when it first comes out of the oven; let sandwich cool off just a little before biting into it)
