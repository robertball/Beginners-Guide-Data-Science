Description: 
Over time I have changed and  marinated this compound butter.  Initially started as a copycat recipe from Salt Grass Steakhouse Restaurants but evolved into something else. Great with most cuts of beef and I use also on baked potatoes and asparagus.  Prep on friends and just create to your taste!
