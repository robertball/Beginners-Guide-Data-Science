Want breakfast tomorrow without lifting a finger? 

An easy healthy breakfast for busy mornings with little to no effort. Always a crowd pleaser.

This is better than store bought oatmeal - you can control the sugar you add - for a healthier version reduce the brown sugar and skim milk. I sometimes switch out the fruit I have used raisins and also peaches in place of the apples.
