Ingredients:
1/2 a package (6 cups) of fresh spinach
1 container of creme cheese
1 container of cottage cheese
1 tbs of olive oil or pam spray
1\2 a large spanish red onion (if you like onion you can put in the entire onion
Salt and pepper to taste
1 cup of kraft nacho shredded cheddar cheese
1 round loaf of pumpernickle bread

Directions:
First place the spinach in a dish with a few table spoons of water and microwave for 5 minutes until cooked. At the same time chop onions and sautee for 2-3 minutes until they are translucient. (If you prefer the taste of raw onions there is no need to sautee them they will be slightly cooked later on) Drain the spinach of the excess water and place in a mixing bowl. Add cottage cheese and onions and mix throughly. Place cream cheese in the microwave for 45-60 secondes to soften and add to the rest of the mixture. Add salt and pepper to taste (for those who like a bit of garlic taste feel free to add 1\4 tsp of garlic powder or fresh garlic to the onions while they are cooking)
when you are readdy to serve cut the loaf of bread around the top and remove excess leaving the crust as a bowl. Heat the spinach mixture till fairly warm in the microwave fore approximately 2 minutes. Place in the bread bowl and add the shredded cheese to the top and put back in the microwave for another minute to melt the cheese. Place on a plate this can be eaten with the remaining bread (cut into bite sized pieces) or it can be served with nacho tortilla chips.
Guarenteed there will be nothing left at the end of the party.
