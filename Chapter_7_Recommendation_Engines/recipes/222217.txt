Ingredients:
1/2 cup canola oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
6 tablespoons white sugar
1 (8 ounce) package shredded cabbage
3 green onions, thinly sliced
1/3 cup slivered almonds
1/3 cup sunflower seed kernels (optional)

Directions:
Mix canola oil, red wine vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar in a large bowl, mixing until sugar has dissolved. Toss cabbage, green onions, almonds, and sunflower seed kernels into the dressing. Cover bowl and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving; slaw tastes better when chilled overnight.

Description: 
This is a different twist on coleslaw that goes over really well. It is based on a recipe I found in a cookbook but I found it was much simpler to make this way and people seemed to like it better as well.
