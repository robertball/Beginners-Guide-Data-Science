Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups flour
2 cups sugar
3/4 cup cocoa powder
2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
2 eggs
1 cup espresso
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Set oven to 350
Grease and flour two 9 inch round pans or 4 of the super thin 9 inch pans
Combine and stir all the dry ingredients together
1 3/4 cup flour + 2 cups sugar + 3/4 cup cocoa powder + 2 tsp baking soda +
1 tsp salt
Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients (not sure why) then add the
2 eggs + 1 cup espresso + 1 cup buttermilk + 1/2 cup veggie oil + 1 tsp vanilla
Beat for 2 minutes. Be sure to scrape the sides after about a minute to make sure all dry ingredients are getting mixed in.
Bake
Cool then frost with frosting of your choice.
Note to make buttermilk you can put 1 TBSP lemon juice in a measuring cup then top up to the 1 cup mark with whole milk. Let it rest about 5 to 10 minutes and voila you'll have buttermilk = curdled milk.
