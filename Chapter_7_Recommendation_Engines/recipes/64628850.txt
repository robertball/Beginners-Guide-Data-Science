Ingredients:
2 pcs chicken thighs (about 500 grams)
100 mL plain yoghurt
1 tsp grated garlic
1 tsp grated ginger
2 Tbsp tomato ketchup
1 Tbsp honey
1/2 Tbsp olive oil
2 tsp curry powder
1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
1. Wash the chicken then dry it with a kitchen paper. Cut it into bite sized pieces.
2. Combine the yoghurt, garlic, ginger, tomato ketchup and honey then mix well.
3. Pour the seasoning mixture onto the chicken then mix well with your hands.
4. Divide the chicken into two then place each half in an air tight freezer bag. Close the freezer bag then give the chicken a gentle massage by carefully squeezing the outside of the freezer bag so the chicken will absorb the marinade more.
5. Keep in the fridge for 2-3 days or if not using immediately, keep in the freezer for up to a month.
6. You can cook the chicken as desired, you can simply stir-fry in a pan or heat in a microwave until the chicken are cooked.
