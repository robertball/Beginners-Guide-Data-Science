Description: 
Another inspiration from a local Mexican restaurant! They have the best nachos that I couldn't find anywhere else... until now! Now, I can make them right in the comfort of my own kitchen. Grilling the chicken takes the longest... the rest is done within minutes. Totally unhealthy? Yes. Totally worth it? Heck yes. :-)
