Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
2 large eggs
1/2 teaspoon orange oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup white chocolate chips
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 cookie sheets.
Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
Blend sugar and butter together using an electric mixer in another bowl. Beat in eggs, orange oil, and vanilla extract until smooth. Sift in flour mixture and beat until completely incorporated. Fold in white chocolate chips, cranberries, and pecans. Divide dough in half and form into rectangles on the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes; slice into biscotti as desired. Return to the oven and bake until toasted, about 15 minutes per side.
