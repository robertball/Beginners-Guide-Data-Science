Ingredients:
Cupcakes
1 Yellow Cake Mix
3 Eggs
1/3 Cup of Canola Oil
3/4 Cup of Water
1(16oz)Can of Pumpkin
Cream Cheese Frosting
1(8oz) Pkg of Cream Cheese
1/4 Cup of Butter (No Substitutions)
1 1/4 Cup of Powdered Sugar
1 1/2 tsp of Vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large mixing bowl combine cake mix, eggs, oil and water. Beat for 2 minutes on medium speed. Add pumpkin and beat until smooth. Pour evenly into 24 lined cupcake tins. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until inserted toothpick comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack completely before frosting. Refridgerate 1 hour before serving and store remaining cupcakes in the refridgerator.
While cupcakes are baking, prepare your frosting by first beating the cream cheese and butter together and then add vanilla. Last, add the powdered sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, until frosting is smooth and creamy. Refridgerate until you frost your cupcakes.(At least 30 minutes) This will stiffen the frosting, allowing for easier decorating.

Description: 
These delicious cupcakes are a nice alternative to traditional Pumpkin Spice Muffins and have a much sweeter, lighter pumpkin flavor . They are made with a yellow cake mix and have a nice fluffy texture. Topped with cream cheese frosting and served cold, they are a wonderful Fall treat!
