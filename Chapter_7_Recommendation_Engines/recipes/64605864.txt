Ingredients:
1 cup - 1st class (harina) flour.
1tsp - baking powder.
1tsp - yeast.
1tsp - white sugar.
1/4+ tsp salt.
1/2 tbl - coconut oil.
dash - sage.
dash - ground pepper.

Directions:
1) Dissolve salt in 1/2 cup warm water, then add yeast.
2) In a bowl, mix together the remaining ingredients, then add the water solution and water as needed to make the dough ball. Let sit for about 45 minutes to get a partial rise.
3) After the time, kneed dough for at least 8 minutes, then roll into a cylinder about 2" across.
4) Cut off 1 1/2 inch pieces, roll in your hands, then start folding in the sides until well rounded.
5) Press flat lightly with flat plate until you have a 3" disk.
6 Place disc in greased, or lined burger bun pan and repeat.
7) Let rise for at least 1 hour.
8) Bake at 350 for about 12-15 minutes. Remember, when you smell the aroma of fresh bread, it's probably done.
