Ingredients:
8 Slices of bacon, chopped
1 T. chopped Shallots
1 T. minced garlic
3 T. butter
1 splash of wine
1 lb. peeled jumbo shrimp
2 C. chopped spinach
1 C. chopped portabello mushrooms
1/4 C. sliced Scallions
2 C. Heavy Cream
hot sauce, salt and pepper to taste
3 C. cooked smoked Gouda cheese grits
For smoked Gouda cheese grits:
3/4 C. old fashioned grits (not quick grits)
3 1/2 C. chicken stock
1 C. shredded smoked Gouda cheese (or more to your liking)
1/4 to 1 C. Cream
1/2 stick butter

Directions:
Cook bacon in a large saucepan over medium heat for 3 minutes or until the drippings are rendered.  Add the shollots and garlic and saute until tender.  Add the butter and a splash of wine and cook until the butter begins to melt.  Add the shrimp and saute until they are cooked through, turning to cook evenly.  Stir in the spinach, mushrooms and scallions.  Saute for 2 minutes longer.  Remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon.  Add the cream and simmer until reduced by one third.  Season with hot sauce, salt and pepper to taste.  Return the shrimp to the pan and cook until heated through.  Serve over the grits.
For the grits:   Bring stock to a boil and slowly stir in the grits.  Reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or until thickened, stirring occasionally.  Add the cream to thin out the grits as they are cooking.  Add cheese and butter stirring until melted and smooth.
