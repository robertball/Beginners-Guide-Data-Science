Ingredients:
2 (15 ounce) cans pumpkin puree
3/4 cup white sugar
1 cup raisins
1 cup fine semolina
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 egg, slightly beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease a rimmed baking sheet.
Heat pumpkin puree in a skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated and puree is thick. Stir in sugar, raisins, semolina, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. Remove from heat.
Lay one puff pastry sheet into the prepared baking sheet. Spread the pumpkin mixture over the pastry and cover with the remaining pastry sheet. Brush the top of the puff pastry with beaten egg.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes.
