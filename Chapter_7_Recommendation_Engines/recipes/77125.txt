Ingredients:
6 (1/2 inch thick) boneless pork chops
6 medium red potatoes, thinly sliced
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
2 teaspoons dried thyme
1 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon beef bouillon
1 cup hot water
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and coat with nonstick cooking spray. Brown the pork chops on each side, about 2 minutes, then set aside.
Layer half of the potato slices, and half of the onion slices in the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Season with half of the thyme and half of the pepper. Dot with 2 tablespoons of the butter. Arrange pork chops on top of the potatoes, then cover with the remaining potatoes, onion, seasonings, and butter. Dissolve the bouillon cube in hot water, and pour evenly over the casserole. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Remove the pork and potatoes to a serving dish with a slotted spoon. Pour the drippings into a skillet. In a small bowl or cup, whisk together the flour and water using a fork. Whisk into the drippings, and cook over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Serve gravy with pork chops and potatoes.
