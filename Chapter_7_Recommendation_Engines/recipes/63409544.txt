Ingredients:
10 to 12 pounds fresh or thawed turkey
3/4 cup onions, chopped
3/4 cup butter
3 tablespoons marsala, sweet dry sherry, or chicken broth
3/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon paprika
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
6 cups soft bread cubes
1 1/2 cups sliced celery
1 cup dried tart red cherries
3/4 cup pecans, coarsely chopped and slightly toasted
1/4 cup chicken broth

Directions:
For stuffing, in a medium skillet, cook onion in butter till tender but not brown.  Stir in the Marsala, sherry, or broth; salt; paprika; thyme; and white pepper.
Transfer the ingredients to a large bowl.  Add bread cubes, celery, cherries, and toasted pecans;  toss to mix well.  Drizzle with the chicken broth.  Toss.
Rinse the turkey and pat dry.  Spoon some of the stuffing into the neck cavity; fasten the neck skin with a skewer.  Lightly spoon the prepared stuffing into the body cavity.  Tie the drumsticks to the tail.  Place the turkey, breast side up, on a rack in a shallow roasting pan.  Insert a meat thermometer into the thigh muscle.
Roast the turkey, uncovered, in a 325F oven for 3 to 3 3/4 hours or till the meat thermometer registers 180F to 185F (cut string between drumsticks when the bird is 2/3 done).  Let roasted turkey stand, covered, 15-20 minutes before carving.
