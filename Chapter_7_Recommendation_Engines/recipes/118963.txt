Ingredients:
8 cups shredded cabbage
3 medium potatoes, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
1 medium onion, chopped
1 3/4 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
2 pounds fully cooked kielbasa or Polish sausage, cut into serving size pieces

Directions:
In a 5-qt. slow cooker, combine the cabbage, potatoes, onion, salt and pepper. Pour broth over all. Place sausage on top (slow cooker will be full, but cabbage will cook down). Cover and cook on low for 8-9 hours or until vegetables are tender and sausage is heated through.
