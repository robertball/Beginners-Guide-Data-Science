Ingredients:
2 4-oz boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 clove garlic, sliced
1 1/2 tsp unsalted sesame seeds, divided
3 Tbsp unsalted roasted peanuts
1/2 cup quinoa
1 16-oz bag baby spinach, washed, drained and steamed
Tahini Sauce
1 1/2 Tbsp sesame tahini
1 Tbsp rice wine vinegar
1 tsp low sodium soy sauce
1 tsp stevia powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375
Place chicken on foil lined baking pan. With a sharp knife, make 3 slits 1/4 to 1/2 way through each chicken breast. Stuff thin slits with garlic, dividing evenly.
Sprinkle 1 tsp sesame seeds on top of chicken.
Bake 30-35 minutes, until juices run clear and no pink remains.
Rinse quinoa thoroughly with water in a fine mesh strainer until water runs clear. Combine quinoa and 1 cup water in a medium size saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook until grains become translucent, about 15 to 20 minutes. Add roasted peanuts to cooked quinoa.
Prepare Tahini Sauce: In s small bowl, whisk together tahini, vinegar, soy sauce, 1 tsp water and stevia until combined.
Divide spinach between 2 plates and top with Tahini Sauce. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 tsp sesame seeds on top of spinach. Plate chicken breasts and quinoa off to side of spinach. Chicken can be stored in refrigerator for four days.
