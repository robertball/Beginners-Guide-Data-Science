Description: 
Yet another of my mother's recipes I enjoyed as a kid! This is a tasty and flavorful soup that is easy to make and works as a great lunch or dinner meal. I can remember as a kid that I liked to pour the hot soup over the chips and cheese and play with the cheese as it melted (who says you can't play with your food?) I hope you enjoy this soup as much as I have and make good family memories with it.
