Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

STREUSEL TOPPING:

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons cold butter or margarine

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Gently fold in strawberries. Combine eggs, milk, sour cream and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill greased or paper-lined muffins cups about two-thirds full. For topping, combine flour, brown sugar and cinnamon; mix well. Cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle about 2-1/2 teaspoons over each muffin. Bake at 425 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until muffins test done. Cool in pan 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.

Description: 
Muffins have always been a favorite breakfast food for my family. My children have now 'left the nest', but I still find myself mixing a batch of these muffins using strawberries from my garden.
