Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) salmon fillets, 3/4-inch thick
Vegetable cooking spray
1 large red pepper, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 cups V8 V-Fusion® Peach Mango Juice
1 mango, peeled, seeded and chopped
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon lime juice
1/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper
4 cups fresh baby spinach
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves
2 cups cooked regular brown rice

Directions:
Season the salmon as desired.
Spray a 12-inch skillet with the cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Add the salmon, skin-side up and cook for about 5 minutes or until it's well browned. Turn the salmon over and cook for 4 minutes or until it flakes easily when tested with a fork. Remove the salmon from the skillet and keep it warm.
Add the red pepper and garlic to the skillet and cook over medium heat until the pepper is tender-crisp.
Stir the juice, mango, honey, cornstarch, lime juice and black pepper in a small bowl. Stir the juice mixture and the spinach into the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes or until the mixture boils and thickens. Stir in the cilantro. Serve over the salmon. Serve with the rice.
