Ingredients:
1 blueberry bagel, split
1 teaspoon butter
1 egg
salt and pepper to taste
1 slice American cheese

Directions:
Toast bagel to desired doneness. Spread with butter.
Meanwhile, cook egg to desired doneness on a hotplate or in a microwave; salt and pepper to taste.
To assemble, place the slice of American cheese onto the cut side of the bottom half of the bagel. Place the cooked egg on top of the cheese, and top with the remaining half of bagel.

Description: 
You may think that egg and cheese don't sound good atop a blueberry bagel. I didn't either, but if you'll be a good sport like I was and try it, you'll enjoy it as much as I do!
