Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups water
1 1/2 cups ketchup
3 (.7 ounce) packages Italian salad dressing mix
1 tablespoon prepared mustard
3/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 (3 pound) whole beef tenderloin
10 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Combine the first five ingredients in a large resealable plastic bag. Pierce tenderloin in several places; place in bag and turn to coat. Seal and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.
Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil; cook for 10-15 minutes or until crisp-tender; drain. Toss with butter, salt and pepper.
Place tenderloin on a rack in a roasting pan. Pour marinade into saucepan; bring to a rolling boil. Boil for 1 minute; pour over meat. Arrange the potatoes around meat.
Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 60-75 minutes, basting occasionally, or until beef reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Slice; serve with pan juices and potatoes.

Description: 
As an alternative to turkey or ham for the holidays one year, I decided to try this recipe. My family liked it so much, it's become a standard at our house. The meat is very tender and flavorful, and the potatoes get nicely browned. The marinade cooks into a terrific sauce. -Mrs. Clifford Davis, Fort Smith, Arkansas
