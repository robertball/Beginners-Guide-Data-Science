Description: 
Work that smoker magic on corn on cob. Be sure to get the corn before the produce person trims off some of the outer husks. The corn must be completely covered by the husk. Use peeled back husks for handles when eating. This recipe multiplies well, and can be used to make corn for a crowd. You will need bagged ice for this recipe to keep the corn cold.
