Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon dill seed
1/2 teaspoon tarragon leaves
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 cups chicken broth
3 cups chopped cabbage
2 cups finely chopped deli corned beef
2 cups half-and-half
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
Melt butter and olive oil together in a stockpot over medium heat; saute onion and garlic until onion is slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add flour, dill seed, tarragon leaves, and black pepper to onion mixture; cook and stir until flour is dissolved and fragrant, about 3 minutes.
Pour chicken broth over onion mixture and stir until blended, 2 to 3 minutes. Add cabbage and corned beef; cook, stirring frequently, until cabbage is tender, about 20 minutes. Add half-and-half and cook just until liquid is warm but not boiling, about 5 minutes.
Stir half-and-half into the pot; continue to cook just until liquid is warm but not boiling, about 5 minutes.
Melt cream cheese over low heat in a saucepan until creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk cornstarch and water together in a bowl; stir into cream cheese until smooth. Stir cream cheese mixture into soup; cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until cheese melts and soup is thickened, about 5 minutes.
