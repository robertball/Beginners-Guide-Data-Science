Ingredients:
2 1/2 c all purpose flour
2/3 c sugar
1/2 t salt
1 c unsalted butter, softened and cut up
1/2 c regular rolled oats
1/2 c chopped pecans
1/4 c packed brown sugar
2 T unsalted butter, softened
3/4 c raspberry preserves
3/4 c fresh raspberries
2 t lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line a 13x9x2" baking pane with a double thickness of foil.  Coat with nonstick cooking spray; set aside.  In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, granulated sugar and salt.  Using an electric mixer, beat in the 1 cup (sliced) butter, 1 piece at a time until mixture is well combined (will look dry).  Transfer 1 1/4 c of the flour mixture to a medium bowl.  Evenly press remaining flour mixture onto bottom of the prepared pan.  Bake 20 minutes or until top is lightly browned.  While that is baking, stir oats, pecans and brown sugar into reserved flour mixture.  Add 2 T softened butter; work mixture with your fingers (or use pastry blender) until mixture is combined and starts to cling together; set aside.  In a small bowl, combine preserves, fresh raspberries and lemon juice.  Mash lightly with a fork until combined, but some berry pieces remain.  Spread berry mixture evenly over hot crust.  Sprinkle with crumbled flour mixture (do not press flour mixture into berry mixture).  Return to oven and bake for 22-25 minutes or until top is golden and filling is ubbly.  Cool bars in pan on a wire rack.  Before cutting bars, remove entire mixture from pan by lifting up on foil.  Cur into 32 bars.
