Ingredients:
4 cups okra, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds

1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place the okra in a large, microwave-safe dish; cook in microwave on High for 6 minutes.
Heat the olive oil and cumin seeds together in a large skillet over medium heat until the cumin seeds swell and turn golden brown. Fry the onions in the heated oil for 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes to the mixture and cook another 3 minutes. Stir the okra into the mixture; season with the curry powder and salt. Cook and stir the mixture until hot, about 3 minutes more. Serve hot.
