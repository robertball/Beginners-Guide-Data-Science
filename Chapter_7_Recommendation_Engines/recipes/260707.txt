Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups California walnuts, toasted
4 cups Italian parsley leaves, packed
2 cups Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, freshly grated
4 cloves garlic
1 1/2 cups extra virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
4 pounds pappardelle pasta, fresh
Toppings:
1 1/2 cups California walnuts, toasted, chopped
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (optional)

Directions:
Place half of the walnuts, parsley, cheese and garlic in food processor; process until finely chopped.
With motor running, slowly pour in half of the oil; puree until smooth. Transfer to bowl and repeat with remaining ingredients, making a total of 2 batches. Season with salt and pepper; set aside. (Makes approximately 4 cups).
Cook pasta in boiling salted water until al dente, about 3 to 4 minutes. Drain, reserving some of the cooking water. For each serving, toss 2 cups cooked pasta with 1/4 cup walnut pesto, adding some of the reserved cooking water as required to thin the pesto; toss well to coat evenly.
Transfer to warm pasta bowl; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon chopped walnuts and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese as desired. Serve immediately.
