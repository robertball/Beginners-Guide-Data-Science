1 (5 pound) pork butt roast
2 cups white vinegar
1 cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons salt

Directions:
Trim the fat from the roast; place in slow cooker and cook on Low overnight, at least 8 hours.
To make the sauce, whisk together the vinegar, melted butter, salt, lemon juice, crushed red pepper, hot sauce, black pepper, and sugar in a bowl.
Carefully remove the roast to a cutting board. Pull the meat from the bone with a fork. Return the pork to the slow cooker. Pour the sauce over the pulled pork. Simmer for 1 hour more.
