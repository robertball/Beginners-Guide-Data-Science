Ingredients:
1 medium zucchini, halved and sliced
1/4 cup diced red onion
1/4 cup diced green bell pepper
2 (4 ounce) cans sliced black olives, drained
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
2 tablespoons Greek vinaigrette salad dressing
1/4 cup grape or cherry tomatoes, halved

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spray a large piece of aluminum foil with nonstick cooking spray. Layer the zucchini, onion, pepper, and olives onto the center. Sprinkle with feta cheese, and drizzle with vinaigrette. Fold into a packet and seal the edges.
Bake in preheated oven until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Open the foil packet, turn the oven onto Broil, and broil until the feta lightly browns. Add the grape tomatoes and serve.
