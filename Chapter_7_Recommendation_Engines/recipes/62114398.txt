Ingredients:
1 deep dish pie crust
3-4 Large, Ripe Tomatoes
1 medium sweet onion*
Salt & Pepper
Fresh Basil*
Pesto*
Topping:
2 Cups shredded cheddar Cheese
Mayonnaise (about 2-3 tablespoons)
Bacon, cooked and chopped*
*not necessary but just adds to the deliciousness

Directions:
Follow directions to on package to bake the empty pie crust
Slice Tomatoes (like slicing an apple, not like sandwich slices)
Remove seeds and the pulp around the seeds
Put tomato slices in a colander and allow to drain for at least 30 minutes
Sprinkle salt and pepper on slices to add taste
Slice onion into slivers (if you want onions)
Mix tomato and onion and again drain the juice created in this process
Put the mix into cooked pie crust
Put fresh basil on top of tomatoes (or mix in some pesto)
Topping:
Mix mayo and cheese until its at a workable consistency
For variety, add some bacon to the topping (not necessary but when does bacon make something worse?)
Take a small amount of mixture, roll it into a ball then mash it flat
Lay it over tomatoes (this is the tricky part, it just takes practice and the right consistency)
Continue until entire pie has a good covering
Bake @ 350 until crust is golden brown (about 30 minutes)

Description: 
I have seen several tomato pie recipes on this site but I feel that this one will be easiest to follow. I offer a few variations to try. This dish is always a hit, even with all the skeptics that have never heard of it. Its my favorite way to use up all my summer tomatoes.
