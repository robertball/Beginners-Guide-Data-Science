Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup light brown sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 pinch ground cloves
1 (15 ounce) can solid pack pumpkin puree
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
4 egg yolks
4 ounces bittersweet baking chocolate, finely minced
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (9 inch) prepared chocolate cookie crumb crust
2 tablespoons sweetened whipped cream (optional)

Directions:
Combine sugar, light brown sugar, cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and cloves in a large saucepan. Stir in the pumpkin, evaporated milk, and egg yolks until well combined.
Heat saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly, 8 to 9 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in chocolate pieces, butter, and vanilla extract until butter and chocolate have melted and are well incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour filling into prepared crust and chill in the refrigerator until firm, at least 4 hours.
Garnish with whipped cream.

Description: 
Either blind bake a 9-inch crust, or use a graham cracker or chocolate cookie crust, and create the rest of this luscious pie on top of the stove! No need to bake the filling, this pudding pie combines the flavors of dark chocolate and pumpkin in a rich and satisfying dessert. Add some pretty sliced almonds or toasted pecans to the top if you want to add some extra crunch. This recipe is easy to personalize!
