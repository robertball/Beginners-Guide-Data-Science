Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 (16 ounce) package fresh linguine pasta
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
2 teaspoons minced garlic
3 tablespoons butter, cut up
1/4 cup grated Asiago cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water and 1 tablespoon oil to a boil. Cook linguine in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Heat remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and saute until shrimp turns pink, 3 to 4 minutes. Add basil and garlic; cook for 2 to 3 minutes more.
Add butter and cooked linguine. Toss until butter melts, making sure to coat the linguine with the sauce. Remove from heat. Serve immediately.
