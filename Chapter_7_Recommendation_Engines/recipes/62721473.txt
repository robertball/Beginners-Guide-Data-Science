Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 onion, chopped
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
Red pepper flakes
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
Salt and pepper to taste
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
2 14.5 ounce cans diced tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (14 ounce)can clam broth
1 pinch paprika
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 cup white wine
18 manila clams, rinsed
25 mussels, cleaned and debearded
25 shrimp
10 ounces scallops
1 pound cod fillets, cubed

Directions:
In a large pot over medium heat, heat the olive oil, and saute the onion, garlic, bell peppers, and chile flakes until tender. Add parsley, salt and pepper, basil, oregano, thyme, tomatoes, tomato sauce, clam broth, paprika, cayenne pepper, and juice from the clams. Stir well, reduce heat, and simmer 1 to 2 hours, adding wine a little at a time.
About 10 minutes before serving, add clams, mussels, prawns, scallops, and cod. Turn the heat up slightly and stir. When the seafood is cooked through (the mussels will have opened, the prawns turned pink, and the cod will be flaky) serve your delicious cioppino.
