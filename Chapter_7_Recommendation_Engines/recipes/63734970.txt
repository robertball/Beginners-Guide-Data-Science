Ingredients:
Serves 8-10
4 TBSP olive oil
2 tsp minced garlic
2 lbs trimmed beef chuck, cut into 1-2-inch cubes, patted dry with paper towels
about 1/4 cup of flour {tossed with meat to coat}
10-15 small red potatoes {mine were pretty small, I used 14, cut into 1/8ths since I was serving it to small children}
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cups sliced carrots {about 3 good sized carrots}
2 cups sliced celery {about 2-3 stalks}
1 cup of red cooking wine**
1 cup beef stock or canned beef broth
1 can diced tomatoes, drained {14.5 oz}
1 bay leaf
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp dried parsley
1/2 tsp allspice
8-oz container of sliced mushrooms {optional}
meat tenderizer and about 2 tsp cornstarch
**If you don't have or don't like cooking with wine, you can use grape juice, apple juice or simply increase the beef broth to 2 cups instead. I use red cooking wine though- I think it adds a wonderful flavor!

Directions:
Put potatoes, tomatoes, carrots and celery in the crockpot. Have the beef broth and cooking wine measured out and ready.
Heat a frying pan up on high. Add in 2 TBSP oil. Add garlic. Once pan is hot, add beef. You're not trying to cook the meat all the way, you just want to sear it a bit. I let the meat cook for about 4-5 minutes, stirring about twice. You want the meat on the bottom of the pan to brown and even coat the pan lightly.  Move meat into the crockpot.
Do not wash the pan! The technical term here is deglazing- we're going to add liquid that will help loosen up and remove the flavorful meat remnants on the bottom of the pan. Return pan to hot stove top and add remaining 2 TBSP of oil. Once oil is hot, add in the onions. Wait about 3-4 minutes until the onions are beginning to be translucent and are sizzling. Add in cooking wine and beef broth. While the liquid is heating up, add in the spices, except the bay leaf. Once the liquid begins to boil, turn off the heat and pour entire mixture into the crockpot.
Add mushrooms and bay leaf. Stir lightly to combine and cook on low for 9-10 hours, medium 7-8 hours, high 6-7 hours.
