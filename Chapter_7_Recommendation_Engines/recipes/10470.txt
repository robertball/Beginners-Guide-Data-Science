Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon lemon zest
2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
3 cups confectioners' sugar
1/3 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 tablespoons milk
3 drops red food coloring
2 1/4 ounces colored candy sprinkles
60 long red vine licorice

Directions:
Cream 1 cup butter or margarine and 3/4 cup white sugar together.  Blend in egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and grated lemon peel.  Sift together 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour and baking powder.  Add to creamed mixture and blend well. Cover and refrigerate dough for approximately 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Roll dough to 1/4 inch thickness on a lightly floured surface.  Use a floured heart shaped 1 to 2 inch cookie cutter and cut dough into heart shapes.  Place the cut-out hearts on greased cookie sheets.
Using the drinking straw, make a hole at the top center of each heart before baking.  Bake for 5 to 7 minutes until very lightly browned.  Cool the cookies on a wire rack.
To Make Butter Frosting:  Mix 3 cups confectioners' sugar and 1/3 cup butter together.  Stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract and 2 tablespoons  milk.  Beat until smooth making sure frosting is of spreading consistency.  Stir in food coloring to create a pink or red colored frosting, if desired.
After cookies have cooled, frost and decorate them with nonpareils, sprinkles, dragees, or colored sugar.  Use a toothpick to dislodge the hole, if necessary.  Let the frosting dry.
To make a necklace, tie the ends off of two pieces of red colored licorice with a knot.  Thread it through the hole at the top center of the cookie.  Tie the other ends off with another knot to create a "chain."  Makes approximately 30 heart necklaces.
