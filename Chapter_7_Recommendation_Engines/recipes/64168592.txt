Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil
2 cloves garlic, sliced
1 1/2 cups chicken broth, or as needed, divided
1 cup shelled cranberry beans
1 cup freshly shucked corn kernels
2 tbsp dried currants
1/4 cup diced fresh ripe tomato
1 tbsp fresh lemon zest, plus more for garnish
salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste
2 tbsp chopped fresh oregano, divided

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook garlic slices in hot oil until lightly toasted, about 30 seconds. Pour chicken stock over the garlic; add corn, currants, tomato, lemon zest, salt, and black pepper, respectively, and stir. Sprinkle 1 pinch oregano over the beans mixture.
Bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the beans are completely tender, about 45 minutes.
Stir remaining oregano into the beans mixture; transfer to a plate and garnish with lemon zest.
