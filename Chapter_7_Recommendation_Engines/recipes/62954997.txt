Ingredients:
3 tbsp. butter or margarine
3 leeks, thinly sliced
1 medium or large spanish onion, chopped
6 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
4 cups chicken broth
salt and pepper to taste
parsley sprigs for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Cut tops off leeks and use white part and about 2 inches of the light green area before the darker area starts on the leek. Then cut down center and wash in between leaves. Chop onion and thinly slice leeks. In a large saucepan melt butter or margarine over medium heat and brown onions and leeks until onions are limp and lightly browned. Add potatoes and chicken broth. Cook for 30 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Remove from heat. Let cool for a few minutes and then puree in a blender about half of the soup before blending back into the soup pot with the remainder. Add salt and pepper to taste and reheat a few minutes more before serving. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.
