Ingredients:
2 cups muesli style cereal (no raisins)
1/3 cup butter
1 cup boiling water
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
1/2 cup milk
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 egg
2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
2 tsp garlic powder or granules

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a large bowl, stir together the cereal, butter and boiling water. Set aside for 10 minutes.
Combine the sugar, and bouillon, stir into the oat mixture along with the egg, milk and garlic until smooth. Fold in the shredded cheese. Gradually stir in the flour until a stiff but workable dough is formed. Knead the dough for a few turns. (Alternatively, put ingredients in the bread machine and process on the pizza dough cycle) On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut with a bone-shaped cookie cutter or cut into 1x3 inch rectangles. Place treats 1 inch apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Remove from the baking sheet to cool completely on wire racks.

These are chicken and Cheddar cheese flavored treats for man's best friend. I've ommitted cornmeal as it upsets many dogs' stomachs.Modified from: Doggie Treats II
