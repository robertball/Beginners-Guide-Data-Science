Ingredients:
2 tomatoes, diced
1 onion, chopped
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
1 tablespoon rice flour
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
2 (15 ounce) cans garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Combine the tomatoes, about half the onion, the ginger, and rice flour in a blender; blend into a paste.
Heat the oil and cumin seeds in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the cumin swells and turns golden brown. Cook the remaining onion in the hot oil for about 3 minutes. Stir the blended tomato mixture, garbanzo beans, curry powder, and salt into the onions; cover and cook until hot, about 5 minutes. Garnish with the cilantro to serve.

Fantastic Indian vegetarian curry recipe that I got from my mom. This is great with Indian bread (parathas, naan) or with rice. This is my husband's favorite!
