Ingredients:
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
juice of 1 lemon
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon dried tarragon leaves
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
4 skin on chicken thighs
1 small red onion, sliced into petals
8 baby bell peppers, halved lengthwise
1 pound baby potatoes, halved lengthwise
1 lemon, cut into slices
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
8 kalamata olives
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2. In a large mixing bowl whisk olive oil, juice of 1 lemon, vinegar, tarragon, oregano, paprika, salt, and pepper. Add chicken, onion, baby bell halves, and potato halves. Stir until everything is evenly coated.
3. Transfer to the baking sheet and spread in an even layer. Scatter lemon slices over the vegetables;  making sure to leave the chicken uncovered so that the skin will brown.
4. Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove from oven and top with feta, olives, and parsley.

Description: 
Bold flavors and colors combine on one sheet pan for a simple yet impressive dinner. Bonus is the minimal clean up! If you are not a fan of olives, try substituting capers or chopped artichoke hearts.
