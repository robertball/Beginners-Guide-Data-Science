Ingredients:
35 Soda Crackers
1 Cup Brown Sugar
1 Cup Butter
1 Teaspoon Vanilla
1 1/2 Cups Chocolate Chips
Optional:
Toasted Coconut, Almonds, Smarties, Etc.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.~
Line a cookie sheet with foil.  Spray lightly with cooking spray.  Place
crackers on foil, salt side up.  I usually use whole wheat crackers.
Makes me think that these are healthier then. (Ha,ha)~
Place next three ingredients in sauce pan and bring to boil, stirring
constantly.  Boil for 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and pour over
crackers.  Place in preheated oven and bake for 5 minutes.  Immediately
after removing pan from oven, sprinkle top with choc. chips and when
softened, spread over the whole pan.  Refrigerate and when hard, break
into pieces.
Yum, yum, yum!   If you want, you can sprinkle top of chocolate with
coconut, nuts or other candy bits and press lightly into chocolate
before you cool it.

Description: 
A quick homemade version of the popular chocolate bar of the same name.  Personally, I like it better and when we have it, our family can't leave it alone till it is all gone.
