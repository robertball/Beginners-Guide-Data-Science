Ingredients:
2 cups peeled and shredded potatoes
1 cup grated yellow onion
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 garlic & parsley granules, if you like
1/2 cup canola oil for frying

Directions:
Place the potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring, extracting as much moisture as possible.
In a medium bowl stir the potatoes, onion, eggs, flour and salt other seasonings together.
In a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until hot. Place large spoonfuls of the potato mixture into the hot oil, pressing down on them to form 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick patties. Brown on one side, turn and brown on the other. Let drain on paper towels. Serve hot and garnish with green onions, sour cream, or apple sauce.
