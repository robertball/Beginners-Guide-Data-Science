Ingredients:
Meatloaf:
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 cup oats
1/2 onion, chopped
3 tablespoons pear applesauce
3 tablespoons chili powder
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
Sauce:
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped onion
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup barbeque sauce (such as Sweet Baby Ray'sÂ®)
1 teaspoon chili powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix ground turkey, oats, 1/2 chopped onion, pear applesauce, 3 tablespoons chili powder, egg, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; press into an 8-inch square baking dish.
Heat olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir 2 tablespoons onion until softened and lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir brown sugar, barbeque sauce, and 1 teaspoon chili powder into onion; cook over low heat until sauce is warm, about 5 minutes.
Bake meatloaf in the preheated oven, occasionally brushing sauce over the top, until cooked through, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
After looking at many different turkey meatloaf recipes and not liking any one in particular, I decided to create my own! Add Dijon mustard to sauce for an added flavor.
