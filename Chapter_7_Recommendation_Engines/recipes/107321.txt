Ingredients:
2 (1 ounce) slices white bread
1 tablespoon butter, softened
3 tablespoons apple pie filling

Directions:
Spray a hobo pie toaster with nonstick cooking spray.  Evenly spread one side of each slice of bread with softened butter.  Lay a slice of bread, butter side down, into the toaster.  Spoon on pie filling, and top with second slice of bread, butter side up.
Close up toaster, and cook over a hot campfire, turning occasionally, until the pie is hot and golden brown, about 4 minutes.

Description: 
My family has gone camping every summer since I was very young, and one of the things we always make at least once is a hobo pie.  Made using bread and your choice of filling, hobo pies are quick, cheap, easy, fun, and very adaptable to everyone's needs!  Hobo Pie irons are available at camping or outdoors stores.
