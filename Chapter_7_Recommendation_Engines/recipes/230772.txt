Ingredients:
6 carrots, peeled and chopped
4 large parsnips, peeled and chopped
2 turnips, peeled and chopped
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pinch cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place carrots, parsnips, and turnips into a pot and cover with cold, lightly salted water. Bring to a boil and cook until a fork easily breaks apart the vegetables, about 25 minutes; drain. Return vegetables to the pot.
Mix butter, cream, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper into vegetables; roughly mash together with a potato masher until vegetables are broken down but individual colors are still visible.

Description: 
This fall and winter farm recipe was passed down from my Irish-Canadian grandmother Agnes Walsh (Donahoe). It's a simple mash that I updated with a dash of nutmeg and cayenne. An exciting (and affordable) side dish for all holiday menus.
