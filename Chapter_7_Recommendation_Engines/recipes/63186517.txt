Ingredients:
BREAD DOUGH
1 pkg. yeast
1/2 c. sugar
1/2 c. powdered milk
1/2 c. instant potato flakes
1/2 tsp. salt
6-7 c. AP flour, divided
2 c. warm water
1/2 c. oil
2 eggs
FILLING
3-4 lb. ground beef
2 pkg. cabbage slaw mix (or 1 small head cabbage, shredded)
1 med. onion, chopped
salt & pepper

Directions:
BREAD DOUGH: Mix yeast, sugar, powdered milk, potato flakes, 1/2 tsp. salt & 2 c. flour in large bowl. Stir in 2 c. warm water. Add 1/2 c. oil & 2 eggs & beat with a mixer for 2 min.  Add another 1 c. flour & beat for additional 2 min.  Stir in 3 to 4 c. flour & knead for 10-15 min. Cover & put dough in refrigerator until ready to assemble & bake.
FILLING: In a large pot, crumble & saute hamburger until browned. Drain off grease. Stir in shredded cabbage & chopped onion; cover pot & cook until vegetables are tender. (Add 1/4 c. water, if needed, to help steam cabbage.) Remove from heat; drain off any additional moisture, and add salt & pepper to taste. Put meat filling in refrigerator until cool.
TO ASSEMBLE: Divide dough into 16 equal pieces; cover lightly with plastic wrap to keep them from drying out as you assemble sandwiches. Lightly flour work surface & rolling pin. Roll out one piece of dough to about a 7-8 inch round. Place a (scant) 1 c. of filling in center of the circle. Gently pull up & pinch the edges of the dough together over the top, forming a round filled loaf. (A little water around the edge of dough will help it stick.)  Place it seam-side down on cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough & filling, leaving 2-3 inch space between sandwiches. Lightly cover with cloth towel to rest 20-30 min.
Heat oven to 375 degrees. Bake sandwiches 35-40 min., rotating cookie sheets half-way through, until nicely browned. Cool slightly before serving.

Description: 
A sandwich of ground beef/cabbage filling wrapped and baked in bread dough.  My mother, Margaret Sauter Cross, used to make these when I was a kid. She called them kraut brot. Her recipe was lost, but I recreated it in the 1980's when my kids were young, using an easy potato bread dough.  We like them with a little yellow mustard.
