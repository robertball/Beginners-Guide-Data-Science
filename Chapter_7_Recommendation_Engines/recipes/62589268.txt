Ingredients:
Crust:
9 chocolate graham crackers, finely ground (1 cup)
5 tbsp. butter, melted
1/4 cup sugar
Filling:
1 1/4 cups heavy cream
9 oz. bittersweet chocolate, chopped
2 large eggs
1 tsp. vanilla
1/4 tsp. salt
Glaze:
2 tbsp. heavy cream
1 3/4 oz. bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
1 tsp. light corn syrup
1 tbsp. warm water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  For crust, combine all ingredients and press into bottom and 3/4 up sides of fluted tart pan (with removable bottom).  Bake until firm, about 10 minutes.  Cool about 15-20 minutes.
For filling, bring cream to a boil then pour over chocolate in a bowl and let stand 5 minutes.  Gently stir until smooth.  Whisk together eggs, vanilla and salt in a bowl then stir into melted chocolate.  Pour into cooled crust.  Bake until filling is set about 3 inches from the edge - about 20-25 minutes.  Center will continue to set while cooling.  Cool completely in pan on rack, about 1 hour.
For glaze:
Bring cream to a boil and remove from heat.  Stir in chocolate until smooth.  Stir in corn syrup then water.  Pour glaze onto tart and let stand until glaze is set - about 1 hour.
Tart is best served the day it is made, but it can be made 1 day ahead without glaze.  Bring to room temperature before glazing.
