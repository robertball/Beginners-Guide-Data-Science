Ingredients:
Unsalted butter, 2 Tbsp.
Butternut squash, 4 cups peeled and diced (about 1 lb.)
Penne pasta, 31/2 cups (12 oz.) uncooked
Heavy cream, 2 cups
Ground nutmeg, 1/8 tsp.
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, 1/2 cup finely grated, ­divided
Ricotta cheese, 1/4 cup
Kosher salt, 1 tsp.
Freshly ground black pepper, 1/4 tsp.
Panko breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350°. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add squash, and cook, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes or until golden brown.  Add 2 cups water; cover and cook 5 minutes or until squash is tender. Drain.
2. Prepare pasta according to package directions.
3. Meanwhile, stir together cream, nutmeg, and 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese in a large saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, 7 minutes or until mixture begins to thicken. Stir in squash. Process mixture with a handheld blender until smooth. (Or, let mixture cool 20 minutes, and process, in batches, in a food processor or blender until smooth.) Stir in ricotta, salt, and pepper.
4. Stir together hot cooked pasta and squash mixture. Pour into a buttered 11- x 7-inch baking dish. Sprinkle panko over pasta mixture. Top with remaining 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Cover tightly.
5. Bake at 350° for 20 minutes. Uncover and bake 7 minutes or until top is browned. Serve immediately.
