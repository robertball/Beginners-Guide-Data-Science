Ingredients:
2 cans (8 oz each)refrigerated crescent dinner rolls
3/4 cup canned sliced jalapeño chiles, drained
2 packages (3 oz each) cream cheese, softened
3 Tbsp butter, melted
1/3 cup cornmeal
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat oven to 350°F. Lightly spray 10-inch cast-iron skillet with cooking spray. Unroll each can of dough into 1 large rectangle; press perforations to seal. Cut each rectangle into 8 rows by 3 rows, to make 24 pieces per rectangle (48 pieces of dough total).
Place chile slice on center of dough piece; top with about 1/2 teaspoon cream cheese. Pull corners up, and pinch to seal; roll into a ball. Holding seam side down, brush top and sides with butter. Roll in cornmeal, and place seam side down in pan. Repeat with remaining dough. Drizzle remaining butter on top.
Bake 23 to 27 minutes or until golden brown and no longer doughy in center. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake 3 to 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Cool 1 minute. Serve warm.
