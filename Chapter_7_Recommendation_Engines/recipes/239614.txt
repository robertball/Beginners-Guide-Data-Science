Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups blanched almond flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted and cooled
2 large eggs at room temperature, beaten
1 tablespoon raw honey

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix almond flour, baking soda, and sea salt together in a bowl; stir in coconut oil until fully incorporated. Stir eggs and honey into almond flour mixture until a dough ball forms. Scoop dough using an ice cream scoop and arrange dough scoops in the parchment paper. Lightly press each piece of dough to create a biscuit shape.
Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are lightly browned, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
Here is the recipe and they are super yummy. I even cut them open and grilled while I was preparing my zucchini scrambled eggs! I made a yummy blueberry jam and decided to serve with paleo biscuits.
