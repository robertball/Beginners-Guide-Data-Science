Ingredients:
2 ½ cups Bisquick baking mix
¾ cup cold whole milk
4 tablespoons cold butter (1/2 stick)
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning
1 heaping cup grated cheddar cheese
Bush on Top:
2 tablespoons butter, melted
¼ teaspoon dried parsley flakes
1/4 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning
½ teaspoon garlic powder
pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Prepare the sheet pan with parchment paper.
Combine Bisquick with cold butter in a medium bowl using a pastry cutter or a large fork. You don't want to mix too thoroughly. There should be small chunks of butter in there that are about the size of peas. Add cheddar cheese, milk, garlic, and old bay seasoning. Mix by hand until combined, but don't over mix.
Drop approximately ¼-cup portions of the dough onto the sheet using an ice cream scoop.
Bake for 15 to 17 minutes or until the tops of the biscuits begin to turn light brown.
Few minutes before the biscuits are done, prepare the butter topping by mixing melted butter, and parsley, old bay seasoning, and  garlic powder in a small bowl.
When the biscuits are done, brush the biscuits with butter mixture.
