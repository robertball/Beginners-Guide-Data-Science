Ingredients:
1 lb peaches
1 cup brown rice
1 cup water
1 cup pecan halves
Honey
Canola oil (or a similarly flavored substitute)

Directions:
Pour rice and water into a saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then bring down to a simmer.  The rice is cooked when the water is absorbed.  This should take 35-45 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut the peaches into bite-sized chunks and cut the pecan halves in half longways.
Put the peaches and pecans into a frying pan with enough oil to coat its bottom.  Also add honey to taste.
Saute over medium-low heat, adding honey and oil as needed.  The mixture is done when the peaches are cooked all the way through and the pecans are succulent by absorbing honey.
Pour into the cooked rice.  Mix.
