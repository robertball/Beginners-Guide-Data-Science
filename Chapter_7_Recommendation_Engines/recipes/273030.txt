Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, diced
3 large russet potatoes, diced
2 cups diced cooked ham
2 cups diced carrots
1 cup diced celery
2 tablespoons dried parsley
2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
2 dried bay leaves
3 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
1 (15 ounce) can corn, drained
1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained
2 tablespoons butter
ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large stockpot. Add onion; cook and stir until softened and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.
Place potatoes, ham, carrots, celery, parsley, and Italian seasoning into pot. Cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add bay leaves, chicken broth, corn, and peas and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook until vegetables have cooked down and are tender, about 20 minutes.
Remove bay leaves; add butter and pepper to taste. Top with shredded Cheddar cheese.
