Ingredients:
2 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
3 cup frozen veggies carrots - green peas, etc
1 cup sliced celery
1 1/2 cup diced potatoes
1 cup butter
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon celery seed
5 1/4 cups chicken broth
2 cup milk
2 (9 inch)  unbaked pie crusts
2 deep dish pie plates (Marie Callendars)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)
In a saucepan, combine chicken, carrots, peas, potatoes and celery. Add water or chicken stock to cover and boil for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, drain and set aside.
In the saucepan over medium heat, cook onions in butter until soft and translucent. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed. Slowly stir in chicken broth(use what was in the saucepan above) and milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick. Remove from heat and set aside.
Mix the chicken, veggies and liquid mixture together and pour into pie plates. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Brush top with egg whites to give a nice browning.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
