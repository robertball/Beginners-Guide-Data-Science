Ingredients:
1 Lb Ground Beef
1 Lb Ground Turkey
1 Cup Guinness
1 full sleeve of crushed Wheat Saltine Crackers
1 Diced Onion
2 Tbsp Fresh Rosemary
2 Tbsp Fresh Thyme (cut fresh herbs in a glass measuring cup with kitchen shears)
Salt to taste
*Optional Variations*: (sometimes I add these ingredients as well)
2 Tbsp Worcestershire Sauce
Diced Bell Peppers (1/2 each of 2 different colors)
4 Diced Jalapeno Peppers
2 Tbsp Yellow Mustard

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 400*
In your LARGEST mixing bowl...
-Mix your 2 meats evenly. (hands work the best)
-Add the Guinness and mix evenly. Will be kinda mushy at this point.
-Next add the crushed Saltine Crackers (pre-made breadcrumbs have a ton of other things like cheese and milk curd and junk so I make my own). Plain Panko will do.
-Now add in the diced Onions (and diced peppers if desired) & Herbs to the mix. You have allot in your bowl so be patient and mix till all ingredients look evenly distributed throughout .
-Spoon out into balls 1 1/2"-2" in size and place in Cast Iron pan (or baking sheet covered with foil) and bake for 25-30 Minutes.
**low fat** The use of Crackers/Panko will absorb the fat during the baking process and the bottom of your pan will be dry. If you want your Meatballs be be less fatty (tasty) for health reasons you can exclude some or all of the crackers to the mix and you will have liquid fat in the bottom of your pan when the baking process is finished.

Description: 
An evolving recipe that I've been tinkering with for a few years.  I guess you could easily replace with your beer of choice. My choice is Guinness.
