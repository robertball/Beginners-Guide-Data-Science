Ingredients:
1 recipe for a 9" double pie crust
1 cup sugar (add up to 1/3 more if your berries are very tart)
2 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca
2 tablespoons cornstarch
5 cups fresh or frozen unsweetened raspberries, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
In a large bowl, combine the sugar, tapioca, cornstarch and raspberries; let stand for 15 minutes
Pour the mixture into the prepared pie shell. Then, in a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and cream.
Lightly brush the rim of the pastry shell with the egg wash, cover the pie with remaining crust (lattice, cutouts, etc) and brush it with the remaining egg wash.
Bake at 350Â° for 50-55 minutes or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool on a wire rack.
