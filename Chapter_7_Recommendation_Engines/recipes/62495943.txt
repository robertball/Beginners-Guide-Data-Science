Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup light corn syrup
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups heavy cream
1/2 cup butter at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large heavy saucepan, combine the white sugar, corn syrup, and salt. Bring to a boil and heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.
Stir in the butter and heavy cream carefully - the mixture will bubble up. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. After stirring in the butter and cream, put the mixture back on the heat until the mixture reaches 234 degrees again. Bubbling will be vigorous at first and gradually die down. Watch carefully when the temperature goes past 220 again, as most of the water is cooked out at this point and the temperature rises quickly. Cool the mixture slightly, Dipping apples at around 200 degrees worked well. Pour leftover caramel onto parchment paper and cool in the refrigerator. Allow to return to room temperature and cut into pieces for delicious caramel candy.
