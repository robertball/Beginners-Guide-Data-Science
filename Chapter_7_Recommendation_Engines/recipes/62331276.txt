Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 sticks (8oz.) butter
3 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons real vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
3 cups all purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
a dash of cardamom (optional)
1 cup sliced or slivered almonds, toasted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Beat together sugar and butter until creamy, then beat in eggs, vanilla extract, and almond extract.
Sift dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Mix wet and dry ingredients thoroughly, adding the almonds as you go.
Roll the dough into several logs no larger than 2 inches in diameter and 12 inches long, depending on how large your cookie sheet is. Bake up to four logs on one cookie sheet for about 20 minutes, or until firm to the touch.
Pull logs out of the oven and slice lengthwise into 1/2 inch wide pieces with a sharp knife, being careful of the hot cookie sheet.
Return slices to the oven on their side for 8-10 minutes, or until toasted and flip to toast the other side. Cut to desired length, or leave long for dipping in coffee or hot cocoa. Feel free to dip in melted chocolate or drizzle chocolate on top for a snazzy treat when cooled. Enjoy!

Description: 
This traditional almond biscotti is amazing when baked fresh and keeps well in the freezer, too. Perfect when dipped or drizzled in chocolate, and tastes great with a cup of coffee, cocoa, or milk.
