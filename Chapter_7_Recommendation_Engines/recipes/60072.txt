Ingredients:
1 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 shallots, finely chopped
2 1/2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/3 cup olive oil
1/3 cup sour cream
salt to taste
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
5 cups spring lettuce mix
2 roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
1 avocado
1 tablespoon pine nuts
4 English daisy blossoms

Directions:
In the container of a food processor or blender, combine the lemon juice, Dijon mustard, shallots, vinegar, and parsley. Process until shallots are no longer visible. Slowly pour in the oil while continuing to blend. Blend in sour cream, and season with salt and pepper.
Cut the avocado into quarters and remove the pit. Cut each quarter into 3 slices. Fan each quarter of the avocado towards the side of each salad plate. In a large bowl, toss the lettuce mix with tomatoes. Pour dressing over the lettuce and tomato, and toss to coat. Portion the salad onto the plates so that the ends of the avocado fan are showing. Sprinkle each plate with pine nuts, and garnish with a daisy bud.
