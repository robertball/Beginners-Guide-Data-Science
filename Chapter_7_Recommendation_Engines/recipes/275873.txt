Ingredients:
2 cups whole-wheat elbow pasta
1/2 bell pepper, diced
1/3 cup corn
1 stalk celery, diced
2 tablespoons diced red onion
1/2 cup vegan mayonnaise
3 teaspoons white vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon white sugar (optional)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Strain pasta and rinse under cold water. Drain.
Combine bell pepper, corn, celery, and red onion in a bowl. Mix together vegan mayo, vinegar, Dijon mustard, sugar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl; pour over vegetables. Mix in cold pasta and toss to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
Cover pasta salad and let cool in fridge for at least 90 minutes before serving, stirring occasionally to mix sauce into pasta evenly.
