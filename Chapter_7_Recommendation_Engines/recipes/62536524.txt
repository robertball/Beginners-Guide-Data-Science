Ingredients:
4 oz. (4 squares) unsweetened baking chocolate
1/2 cup (1 stick, 4 oz.) unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups all-purpose unbleached flour
1 1/2 cups granulated white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 tablespoons coffee powder
1 cup hot water
1/2 cup Sour Cream
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Prepare 2 12-well cupcake pans by inserting a paper cupcake liner into
each well.
Melt the unsweetened baking chocolate and the butter in the top of a
double boiler. Set aside and allow to cool somewhat while you mix the
remaining ingredients.
In a large bowl, combine the flour, white sugar, brown sugar, salt,
baking soda and baking powder.
In another bowl, dissolve the coffee powder in the hot water. Add the
sour cream, eggs and vanilla. Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry
ingredients and mix well.
Pour the melted chocolate and butter into the batter and mix well. Divide
the batter evenly between the wells in each of the cupcake pans
(about 1/4 cup batter works well).
Bake 25 to 35 minutes or until fork inserted into middle of one of the
cupcakes comes out clean.
Remove cupcakes to cooling racks and let cool completely before frosting.
