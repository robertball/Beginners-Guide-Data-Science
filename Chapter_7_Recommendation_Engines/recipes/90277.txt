Ingredients:
2 large potatoes, peeled and chopped
2 large eggs
Flour
1/4 pound bacon, chopped
1/2 large onion, chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil.
Place potatoes in food processor, and pulse until finely chopped. Add eggs, and pulse a few times to combine. Pour mixture into a large bowl. Mix in enough flour to make a very thick dough.
Place dough by spoonfuls into boiling water. Boil until done, about 20 minutes (depending on size). Drain, and set dumplings aside.
Place chopped bacon and onion in a skillet over medium heat. Cook a few minutes until bacon releases fat. Place hot dumplings into pan; cook until bacon is crisp and onions and dumplings are browned.
