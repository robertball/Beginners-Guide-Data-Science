Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 onions, chopped
2 tablespoons paprika
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 cup water, or as needed
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 tablespoons beef base (such as Better than BouillonÂ®)
1 bay leaf
ground black pepper to taste
1 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
1 tablespoon instant-dissolving flour, or as needed
1 cup sour cream, or as needed
1/4 cup snipped fresh dill, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in paprika and garlic. Cook and stir for 1 minute.  Add meat, and stir to coat. Add water to cover. Stir in tomato paste, beef base, bay leaf, and black pepper.
Cover the Dutch oven and place in the preheated oven. Bake for 90 minutes. Add more water to cover meat, if needed. Return to the oven and bake 1 hour more. Add mushrooms to the Dutch oven and bake an additional 30 minutes.
Remove Dutch oven and whisk in flour until goulash has thickened.

Description: 
This keto-friendly goulash recipe starts on the stove and finishes in the oven for tender meat and an easy dinner. Serve over egg noodles. I usually serve sour cream-cucumber salad on the side.
