Ingredients:
1 cup whipping cream
3 tablespoons white sugar
4 ounces mascarpone cheese
2 tablespoons apricot nectar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch ground cardamom (optional)
3 tablespoons apricot preserves
1/4 cup honey
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
8 fresh apricots, pitted and halved

Directions:
Beat the cream in a chilled bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Beat in the sugar and set aside. In another bowl, whip the mascarpone cheese with an electric mixer until very soft; beat in the apricot nectar, vanilla extract, and cardamom. Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the whipped cream.
Place the apricot preserves and honey into a microwave-safe bowl and heat in microwave oven until warm but not hot, about 30 seconds. Mix well and stir the balsamic vinegar into the honey mixture.
Stuff each apricot half with a dollop of the mascarpone cream and place the filled apricot halves on a serving dish. Drizzle the fruit and plate with balsamic sauce and serve.
