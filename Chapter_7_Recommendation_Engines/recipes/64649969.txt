Ingredients:
Yield: 2 pint jars
1.5 LB pickling cucumbers
4 cloves garlic, minced (2 cloves p/jar)
1 tsp dill seed (1/2 tsp p/jar)  (If no dill seed, sub with celery seed)
1 tsp dried dill weed (1/2 tsp p/jar) -- NOTE: needs more dried dill..maybe 1 tsp per jar; fresh dill weed is ideal
14 black peppercorns (7 p/jar)
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper (1/4 tsp p/jar)
1.5 cups white vinegar - needs to be lessened. Batch made in Sept. 2018 too much vinegar
1.5 cups water
2 tbsp pickling/canning salt (or kosher salt...if kosher the only ingredient should be Salt, no anti-caking stuff)

Directions:
If processing jars: sterilize jars, lids, and rings/bands if storing long term. If storing in refrigerator: simply washing the jars and lids is fine.
Add garlic, dill seed, dill weed, black peppercorns, and crushed red pepper to the jars.
Wash and slice the pickling cucumbers into spears. Spear size needs to fit the jars so liquid will cover the tops.
Pack pickles into the jars as tight as you can without smashing them. Trim any ends standing more than 1/2 inch below top of jar.
In a sauce pan (use stainless steel), over high heat, bring vinegar, water, and salt to rolling boil. Pour brine over pickles, leaving 1/2" head space.
Tap jars gently to remove air bubbles. Wipe jar rims.
Place lid and ring/band on jar. Rings should be fingertip tight.
REFRIGERATOR PICKLES: Let jars cool to room temp. Place jar in fridge. Try to wait at least 48 hours before opening them. I wait 1-2 weeks before opening/testing. Refrigerator pickles can last 3 months, maybe longer.
PROCESSING JARS: Process jars in boiling water canner. See Table 1 for processing time: http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_06/quick_dill_pickles.html
NOTE 1: Shelf life of processed jars is 1 year, but the pickles may not be as crisp.
NOTE 2: If new to canning, see http://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/uga/using_bw_canners.html

Description: 
Family always asks for these pickles! Some kids think this has too much kick though. So, for the kids, I omit the crushed red pepper and reduce amount of peppercorns to 4-5 p/jar (better reviews from the little ones by doing this).
