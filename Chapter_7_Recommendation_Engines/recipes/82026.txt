Ingredients:
2 large baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces
1 large onion, coarsely chopped
1 cube chicken bouillon
1 tablespoon margarine
3 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Place the potatoes, onion, margarine and bouillon cube into a soup pot, and fill with enough water to cover the potatoes by 1 to 2 inches. Bring to a boil, and cook for 30 minutes, until potatoes are falling apart. You can smash them up a little if you prefer the texture. Drizzle the beaten eggs into the pot, while stirring constantly. Continue to cook and stir for about 2 minutes, until the eggs are completely cooked in long strands.
