Ingredients:
1 recipe Creamy Macaroni and Cheese
1 pound Italian sausage, removed from casings
1 medium-large onion, thinly sliced
1 bell pepper, thinly sliced
1/4 cup fresh basil, torn in pieces

Directions:
Follow the recipe for Creamy Macaroni and Cheese.
Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Cook sausage, breaking it up as it fries, until it loses its raw color, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion and pepper slices, and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add basil, then stir mixture into macaroni. Serve hot.

Description: 
Macaroni and cheese is perfect supper food. It's a kids' favorite, and adults like it too. My recipe is simple and almost as quick as the boxed variety. Try this variation with Italian sausage and bell peppers.
