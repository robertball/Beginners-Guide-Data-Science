Description: 
A yummy curry learned from the women in my village when I was living in Sri Lanka. It is a basic recipe meaning that you can add more or less of items to suit your taste. Every batch of parripu is personalized to whoever cooks it. Careful! It tends to be very spicy so if you are sensitive reduce the chile amounts.
