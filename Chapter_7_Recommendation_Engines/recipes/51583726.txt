Ingredients:
tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, chopped
2 medium zucchini, trimmed, halved lengthwise, sliced 1/4- to 1/3-inch thick
4 1/2â€“5 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth
1 pound medium asparagus, ends trimmed
1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons thinly sliced basil
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups short-grain rice (Arborio or Carnaroli)
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons chopped mint, for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Combine the oil and onion in a large saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Add the zucchini; turn the heat to medium-low, and cook until softened and lightly browned, 18 to 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring the 5 cups stock to a simmer in a saucepan wide enough to hold the asparagus. Add the asparagus and simmer until barely tender, about 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon or tongs. Cut off the tips in nice-sized pieces (about 1 1/2 inches), and cut the stalks into smaller, bite-sized pieces; transfer to a bowl. Add the peas, 1/4 cup of the cheese and 1 tablespoon of the basil; set aside. Put a lid over the stock, and reduce the heat to very low so that the stock barely simmers.
When the zucchini is cooked, stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1 tablespoon of the basil. Add the butter and the rice, increase the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the rice is translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup simmering stock and cook, stirring frequently, until most of the liquid has been absorbed, about 2 minutes. Continue adding the broth, about 1/2 cup at a time, and cooking, stirring frequently, until the rice is just tender and the mixture is creamy and has the texture of loose porridge, 17 to 20 minutes. The rice mixture should bubble away at a good clip. (You may not use all of the stock.) Stir in the reserved contents of the bowl and season with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and the pepper.
