Ingredients:
2 qts good chicken stock
salt and Knorr to taste
2 chicken breasts
2 tbsp oil
1 med onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped/minced
1 large tomato, chopped
2 ribs of celery, sliced
1-3 dried or canned chipotle chilies
2 carrots, cut in coins; sliced zuchinni; cubed potatoes; 1 cup of canned chickpeas, drained
Avocado
Shredded asadero cheese; Finely chopped cilantro; Lime wedges
Corn tortillas, rice

Directions:
Boil the chicken stock. Add salt to taste, add the chicken breasts and boil until fully cooked. Remove the breasts and set aside to cool. Leave the stockpot in the stove in low heat while you continue with the recipe.
Fry the onions and the garlic in the oil until translucent, then add the tomatoes and celery and fry some more. Add the mixture to the main pot.
If using dried chilies, rehydrate desired amount in a stockpan with a cup of broth from main pot and cut in strips and step aside. Same with canned.
Set the pot to high heat, add vegetables, boil gently until tender.
In the meantime, shred the cooled chicken breasts and set aside.
Add chickpeas to the pot or serve as a choice. Simmer at low heat for 5 minutes more or until completely heated through. Adjust salt if necesary.
To serve, put some chicken, avocadoes, and chese (or your choice) in the bowl and pour the hot soup over it.
Top with cilantro; serve with warm corn tortillas or rice.
Another option would be to serve the hot soup in bowls and put everything else in the table for each person to add what they want.
