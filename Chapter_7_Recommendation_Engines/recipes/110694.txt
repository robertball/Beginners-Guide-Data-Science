Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups unsweetened applesauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups cake flour
1/4 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries, chopped
2 tablespoons finely chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a muffin pan, or use paper liners.
In a small bowl, mix together applesauce, oil, and eggs. In a large bowl, combine cake flour, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Make a well in the center, and pour in egg mixture. Stir until just moistened, and then fold in cranberries. Spoon batter into muffin cups, 2/3 full. Sprinkle nuts over the top of batter.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in pan for 2 minutes before removing.
