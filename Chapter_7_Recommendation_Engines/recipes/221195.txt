Ingredients:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup sweet pickle relish
1 tablespoon milk, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow-tie) pasta
8 ounces cooked ham, cut into 1-inch cubes
8 ounces Cheddar cheese, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 cup frozen peas, thawed
1/2 cup minced onion
1 stalk celery, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons diced pimento

Directions:
Whisk mayonnaise, pickle relish, and milk in a bowl until combined; season with salt and black pepper. Chill in refrigerator while preparing remaining ingredients.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and transfer to a large bowl.
Gently stir ham, Cheddar cheese, peas, onion, celery, and pimento into pasta. Pour mayonnaise mixture over pasta mixture and toss to evenly coat.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours to overnight.

Description: 
When I make this pasta salad, I usually pair it with hot dogs, fried chicken, or sandwiches. I also make it whenever I have leftover ham. This is a recipe with ingredients that can be easily changed to suit your own taste.
