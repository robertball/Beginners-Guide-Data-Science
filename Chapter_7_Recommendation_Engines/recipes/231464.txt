Ingredients:
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 teaspoon diced shallot
1 tablespoon diced red onion
1 clove garlic, finely diced
5 baby portobello mushrooms, sliced - or more to taste
1/2 (12 fluid ounce) bottle lager beer (such as Sam AdamsÂ® Winter)
3 sprigs fresh rosemary
1 pinch Cajun seasoning
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Melt unsalted butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add shallot, red onion, garlic, and mushrooms; cook and stir until mushrooms begin to give up their liquid, about 10 minutes.
Pour beer into skillet; simmer until liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add rosemary sprigs and stir in Cajun seasoning. Simmer another 5 minutes. Stir in honey. Turn heat off and allow sauce to cool slightly before using.

Description: 
This sauce has a delicate flavor of mushrooms that have been bathed in beer with a kiss of honey. Romantic hints of rosemary truly bring together this unique sauce that my husband and I invented for a chicken recipe. This will definitely compliment chicken or beef. Use local honey if possible.
