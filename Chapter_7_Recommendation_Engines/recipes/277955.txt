Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
4 ounces lump crab meat
2 tablespoons chopped scallions
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
nonstick cooking spray
24 wonton wrappers
2 tablespoons Asian sweet chili sauce, for dipping (optional)

Directions:
Combine cream cheese, crab meat, scallions, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce in a bowl; stir until evenly combined.
Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray the basket of the air fryer with cooking spray. Fill a small bowl with warm water.
Place 12 wonton wrappers on a clean work surface. Spoon 1 teaspoon of cream cheese mixture into the center of each wonton wrapper. Dip index finger into the warm water and wet around the sides of each wonton wrapper. Crimp wrapper corners upwards to meet in the center to form dumplings.
Place dumplings in the prepared basket and spray the tops with cooking spray.
Cook dumplings until desired crispness, about 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
While first batch is cooking, assemble remaining dumplings with the remaining wrappers and filling.
Serve with sweet chili sauce for dipping.
