2 cups flour
½ cup sugar
1 tsp baking powder
¼ tsp baking soda
¼ tsp salt
1 stick unsalted butter
2/3 cup butter milk
½ cup Raisins or seasonal fruit of choice

Directions:
Cut up cold butter into small pieces* & add to the flour and form into crumbs using fork or fingers.
Add all other dry ingredients and mix
Add buttermilk & fruit and LIGHTLY mix ingredients to form dough.  Do not overwork!
Either roll on a floured board to 1 ½ “ thickness & cut our with a glass or scone cutter OR form into balls with a tablespoon.
Place on a greased sheet.**
Serve with homemade Jam and either sour or fresh cream
Chef Louis’ tips:
*Put butter in freezer for 20 minutes and grate with cheese grater.
**Put in freezer for 20-30 minutes just before baking for a really light scone.
Freeze raw balls of dough (made with ice cream scooper) – take out of freezer & bake them a little longer.
