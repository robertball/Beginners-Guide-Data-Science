Ingredients:
1 cup mashed, cooked sweet potato
2 large egg whites
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon orange zest
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup cranberry sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
Mix sweet potato, egg whites, sugar, water, applesauce, canola oil, vanilla extract, and orange zest together in a bowl.
Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Mix flour mixture into sweet potato mixture until just combined. Gently stir cranberry sauce into batter. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin tin.
Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are browned and tops spring back when pressed lightly in the middle, about 30 minutes. Cool in the muffin tin for 5 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

This is easy and quite healthy. Add some toasted nuts and flax seed for a bit more protein.
