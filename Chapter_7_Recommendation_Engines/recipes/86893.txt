Ingredients:
3 pounds ground ham
1 1/2 pounds ground pork
1/2 pound ground beef
1 1/2 cups cracker crumbs
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 cup chopped onion (optional)
1/2 cup all-purpose flour for coating
1 3/4 cups brown sugar
1 1/2 cups water
2/3 cup vinegar
2 tablespoons dry mustard

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the ground ham, pork and beef, cracker crumbs, eggs, milk, and onion. Form 1/2 cupfuls of the meat into balls, and roll in flour. Place in a baking dish, and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a saucepan, combine the brown sugar, water, vinegar and mustard. Mix well, and bring to a boil. Pour over the ham balls before baking.
Bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes in the preheated oven, basting occasionally with the drippings.
