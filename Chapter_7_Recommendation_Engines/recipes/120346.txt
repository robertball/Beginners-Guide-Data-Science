Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 (4 ounce) packages feta or blue cheese
1 (4.5 ounce) can chopped ripe olives, drained
2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 tablespoons dry white wine or chicken broth
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
1 garlic clove, minced
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1 medium onion, sliced

Directions:
Flatten Chicken breasts to 1/8-in. thickness; set aside. In a food processor or blender, combine the cheese, olives, 1 tablespoon oil and oregano; cover and process until mixture reaches a thick chunky paste consistency. Spread over chicken breasts; roll up and tuck in ends. Secure with a wooden toothpick.
In a bowl, combine wine or broth, sugar, vinegar, garlic, thyme and remaining oil. Pour into an ungreased 2-qt. baking dish. Top with onion. Place chicken over onion. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Uncover and baste with pan juices. Bake 15-20 minutes longer or until chicken juices run clear.

Description: 
This recipe earned me first place in a local cooking contest a few years ago. For special occasions, I add four to six sun-dried tomatoes (soaked and drained according to package directions) to the cheese mixture before blending.                              --Nina Ivanoff, Prince George, British Columbia
