Ingredients:
Pino:
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon paprika
ground black pepper to taste
1 pound ground beef
1/2 broiled chicken, chopped
2 tablespoons raisins, or to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped Kalamata olives, or to taste
Paste:
3 (15.25 ounce) cans sweet corn, drained
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup milk
2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, a pinch of salt, 1/4 teaspoon paprika, and some pepper. Cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add beef; add remaining salt, paprika, and more pepper. Cook and stir until mostly browned, about 5 minutes. Add chicken, raisins, and olives.
Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel. Roughly chop and add to the beef mixture. Keep pino mixture warm.
Puree corn with basil in a blender or food processor. Pour into a saucepan over medium heat. Add butter; cook and stir until thickened, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in milk, sugar, and salt. Continue cooking until thickened to a paste, about 15 minutes more.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread pino into a baking dish. Cover with the corn paste. Sprinkle a little sugar on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Choclo is the quechua word for â€œtender corn, or the new corn of the season. This is a typical Chilean dish, but is also eaten in Argentina and Peru with some variations in the recipe, sometimes using cornmeal instead of freshly mashed sweet corn. Serve with Chilean salad and/or pebre.
