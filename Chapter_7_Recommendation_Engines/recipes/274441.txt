Ingredients:
1 medium apple
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 cup pumpkin seeds, rinsed and dried
1/2 cup raw almonds
1 (6 ounce) container vanilla yogurt
3/4 cup ricotta cheese
1/2 cup pureed pumpkin
1/4 cup applesauce
1 large egg
1 cup white sugar
2 cups white whole wheat flour
1/4 cup wheat germ
1/4 cup wheat bran
1 tablespoon cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Core, peel, and dice apple. Place in a small bowl and sprinkle with cinnamon and 1 teaspoon sugar as if making apple pie. Set 'pie apples' aside until juice begins to run, 15 to 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, place pumpkin seeds in a coffee bean grinder and grind to a fine pulp. Place almonds in a resealable plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin to desired size, making chunks as large or small as you wish.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 17 muffin tin cups with paper wrappers.
Mix together yogurt, ricotta cheese, pureed pumpkin, 1/2 cup of pie apples, applesauce, and egg in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in 1 cup sugar.
Mix together flour, wheat germ, wheat bran, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Mix dry ingredients into wet ingredients. Stir in ground pumpkin seeds and smashed almonds; the batter will be very thick and stiff. Fill cupcake wrappers just to the top with batter; do not mound.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
