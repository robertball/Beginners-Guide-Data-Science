Ingredients:
1/2 lb bulk sausage
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 16-oz can sauerkraut
2 Tbsp fine dry bread crumbs
1/2 of an 8-oz pkg cream cheese, softened
2 Tbsp finely snipped parsley
1 Tbsp sweet-hot mustard
Dash garlic salt
Dash pepper
1/3 to 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1 Tbsp water
1/3 to 1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs
Cooking oil for deep-fat frying

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook sausage and onion until sausage is brown, breaking sausage into small pieces.  Drain.
Drain sauerkraut, pressing out as much liquid as possible.  In a large mixing bowl, combine sauerkraut, sausage mixture, the 2 Tbsp of bread crumbs, cream cheese, parsley, mustard, garlic salt, and pepper.  Cover and chill for several hours or overnight.
Put flour in shallow container.  In another shallow containter, beat eggs and water until combined.  Put bread crumbs in a third shallow container.
Using about 2 Tbsp for each, shape sauerkraut mixture into balls.  Roll balls in flour, then in egg mixture, then in bread crumbs.  Fry a few at a time in deep, hot fat (365 degrees) for about 2 minutes or until brown.  Remove from fat with a slotted spoon;  drain on paper towels.  Transfer to a baking sheet with sides; keep warm in a 275 degree oven.  Makes 24-30 balls.

Description: 
This appetizer comes from the Hey Hey Bar and Grill in German Village in Columbus, OH (German Village is the site of this city's Octoberfest).  Even if you don't like sauerkraut, try these tasty morsels.  You'll love the sweet-sour tang of the mustard and kraut, inside cristy desp-fried shells.
