Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped sweet red pepper
1/4 cup chopped green pepper

1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese
6 eggs
2 cups milk
1/3 cup crumbled cooked bacon
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

Directions:
In a skillet, saute the onion and peppers in butter until crisp-tender. Remove from the heat. Add spinach and cereal; mix well. Spoon into a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with cheese. In a bowl, combine the eggs, milk, bacon, mustard, salt and pepper. Pour over cheese. Bake at 325 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
