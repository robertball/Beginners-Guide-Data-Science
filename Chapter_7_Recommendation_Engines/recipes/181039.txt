Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package fusilli pasta
1 cup fresh basil leaves
1/4 cup grated Parmesan or Romano cheese
1/4 cup pine nuts, toasted (optional)
2 cloves garlic
1/4 cup olive oil
1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into strips
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the fusilli, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Place basil, 1/4 cup  Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, and garlic into a blender or food processor; cover and chop to a coarse paste. Add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream. Continue processing until a soft paste has formed. Set pesto aside.
Combine the cooked pasta, tomatoes, 3 tablespoons Parmesan, mozzarella, and pesto in a large bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover bowl, refrigerate to chill for 45 minutes, and serve.
