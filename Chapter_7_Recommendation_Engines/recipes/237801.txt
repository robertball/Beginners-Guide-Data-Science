Description: 
Pretty much an amazing summer drink. All the perfection of a great gin and tonic, but with a little twist. Plus, it looks pretty! I like this drink sitting in the backyard while grilling anything! I think it also makes a good winter drink when you need a quick 'get-away,' as long as you can find the watermelon!
