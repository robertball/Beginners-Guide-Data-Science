Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups roasted unsalted peanuts

Directions:
Combine peanuts and honey in a food processor; process until peanuts are coarsely chopped, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape down sides of the food processor bowl with a spatula. Continue processing until very smooth, 2 to 3 minutes more.

Description: 
I decided to start making my own peanut butter when I read the ingredient list on a peanut butter jar label. While peanuts are good for you, the unhealthy additives and hydrogenated oils are not. This is all natural with no preservatives and has a much better flavor than store-bought peanut butter. Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator.
