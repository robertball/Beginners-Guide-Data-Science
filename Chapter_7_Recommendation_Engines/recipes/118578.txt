1 small onion, chopped
1/4 cup butter, cubed

In a skillet, saute eggplant pulp and onion in butter until tender. Add the bread crumbs, mushrooms, parsley and pepper. Spoon into eggplant shells.

Description: 
We had an abundance of eggplant in our garden one year, so I was happy to find this recipe, especially since it was such a hit with my family. It's not hard to make, and the best part is it's perfect for two people. -Joyce Towles, Houston, Texas
