2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 clove garlic, crushed
3 black Italian olives, pitted and chopped, or more to taste

1 anchovy fillet in oil, drained
7 ounces passata (crushed tomatoes)
1/2 cup water
1 sprig chopped fresh parsley
salt to taste
2 eggs

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over low heat. Add garlic, olives, capers, and anchovy; cook for 1-2 minutes. Add tomato passata and water, bring to a boil, and simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Add parsley and season with salt.
Gently add eggs directly into tomato sauce without breaking the yolks. Cook until eggs are just cooked, 3 to 5 minutes.
