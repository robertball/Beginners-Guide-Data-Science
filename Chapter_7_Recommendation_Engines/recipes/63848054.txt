Ingredients:
1 cup Mayo
1 can Cream of Broccoli Soup
2 Eggs
1/2 tsp Garlic Powder
1/2 tsp Paprika
2 cups shredded Sharp Cheddar Cheese
2 cans Chunk Chicken
1 can Sliced White Potatoes
You will need:
1 large mixing bowl
1 13x9 baking dish (I use glass)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Grease 13x9 dish. (I use olive oil)
Mix Mayo, Cream of Broccoli Soup and Eggs in a large bowl. Once mixed completely add Garlic Powder and Paprika, mix. Add Chunk Chicken. While stirring break chicken into smaller pieces (will look shredded). Add cheese, stir. Add Sliced White Potatoes, stir gently as to not break them into small pieces.
Pour mixture into your greased 13x9 dish.
Cover with tin foil and bake for 45 minutes.
After 45 minutes take off tin foil and place back in oven for the remaining 15 minutes. May need an additional 10 minutes.
