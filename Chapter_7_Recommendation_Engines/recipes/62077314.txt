Ingredients:
6 Tablespoons butter or margarine
1/4 Cup flour
2 Cups milk
1 Cup (4 oz) shredded "Italian Blend" cheese
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir until smooth and bubbly. Remove from heat and add 2 Cups of milk. Bring sauce to a boil, and boil one minute, stirring constantly. Add salt and pepper. Add cheese, and stir until melted.
To reach a thicker consistency, add more cheese. To thin it out a bit, add some milk. Enjoy!

Submitter: 
Dorese
Description: 
After experimenting for some time to come up with an alfredo sauce that uses ingredients I'm more likely to have on hand, I came up with this and decided it's a keeper. This is one of few I've found that don't call for cream. Enjoy!
