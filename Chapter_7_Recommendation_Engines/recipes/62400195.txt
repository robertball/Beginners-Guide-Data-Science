Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive oil, plus more for greasing the pan
2 large eggs
1 cup sugar, plus 1/3 cup for the topping
1/2 cup orange juice (or dry white wine)
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup finely ground yellow cornmeal
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
Zest of 1 large orange

Directions:
1 Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Brush the bottom and sides of an 8-inch round cake pan with oil (can use butter for this too); line the bottom of the pan with wax paper or parchment paper, and brush the top of the paper with oil.
2 In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, oil, 1 cup of the sugar, and orange juice until smooth. Add flour, cornmeal, salt, baking powder, and orange zest; whisk lightly to combine.
3 Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan; sprinkle the top evenly with the remaining 1/3 cup sugar. Bake until cake begins to pull away from sides of pan and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 25-35 minutes.
4 Cool the cake in the pan 20 minutes. Run a knife around edge of cake to separate it from the edge of the pan. Invert the cake gently onto a plate, and remove the parchment paper. Re-invert the cake onto a rack to cool completely before serving.

Description: 
Not your average cake but delicious none-the-less! The texture of the cornmeal and the uncommon flavor of the oil and the orange make this cake a wonderfully flavorful 'lighter side' option to the cakes usually enjoyed by Americans.
