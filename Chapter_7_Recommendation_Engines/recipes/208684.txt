Description: 
Whether you call it Chop Salad or Chopped Salad, this full meal favorite stars on many restaurant menus, and is a great make-ahead salad for entertaining or everyday. Almost any ingredient that can be chopped into cubes works here, so keep the recipe in mind for leftovers: roast beef, or pork, or poultry, any cooked vegetable, and any bits of cheese you might have in the fridge. And consider rolling the chop salad up in a large tortilla for a great, and portable, wrap meal. Avocado adds its wonderful texture and nutty flavor.
