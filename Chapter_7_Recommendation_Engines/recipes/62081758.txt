Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 lbs lean ground round
1 large onion
1 bottle Heinz Chili Sauce
2 cans tomato soup

Directions:
Brown ground meat with onions 'til done. Add chili sauce and tomato soup. You can just heat & serve but I always make this ahead & leave in the CrocPot on low all day. Leftovers are easily reheated in the microwave.

Description: 
When we had an accident a neighbor brought these sloppy joes to us as an easy to reheat meal. They were the best we've ever had. When I asked her for the recipe, the simplicity of it blew me away! Then I asked another friend who's a gourmet cook how she makes hers and she uses the same ingredients (well she DOES make her own chili sauce!)  Don't let the ease of it make you think they're not FABULOUS!
