Ingredients:
6 cups granola
1 1/2 cups rice crispie cereal (could be replaced with more granola or mix-ins of choice)
3/4 toasted coconut (unsweetened)
3/4 seeds or nuts of choice (roasted pumpkin & sunflower seeds)
3/4 cup dried berries (cranberries and cherries)
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips
1/2 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup rice syrup (or brown sugar)
1/2 cup honey

Directions:
Line a cookie sheet silpat.
Combine oil, honey and syrup in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the oil is melted. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat to medium-low and simmer until the sugar is dissolved, 2 minutes.
Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the granola, rice cereal, nuts, coconut, & dried berries into the saucepan and fold them into the sauce until evenly coated.
Spread the mixture into the prepared pans and press firmly with a spatula to evenly fill. Sprinkle the chocolate chips onto the top of the granola and gently press them down with the spatula (mixing them into the mixture will melt them).
Let sit for 15-20 minutes or until mostly cooled and set. Lift out of the pan and cut into bars.
