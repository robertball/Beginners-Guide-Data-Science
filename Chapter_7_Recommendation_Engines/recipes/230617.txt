Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 small onion, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 (8 ounce) bottles clam juice
2 cups water
4 potatoes, cut into cubes
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 pound cod fillets, cut into chunks
1 cup whole milk
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a 5-quart saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, celery, and garlic in melted butter until onion is tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir flour into the vegetable mixture until the vegetables are evenly coated. Pour clam juice and water into the saucepan; whisk until smooth. Add potatoes, bay leaf, and thyme to the mixture. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
Gently stir cod into the soup. Place a cover on the saucepan and cook until the cod is flaky, about 8 minutes.
Pour milk into the soup; stir. Simmer soup until hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Remove bay leaf to serve.

Something warm on those cold winter days! I've used this recipe to also make oyster stew. It turned out better than expected.
