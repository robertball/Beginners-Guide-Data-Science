Ingredients:
4 ounces ground pork
2 tablespoons dry sherry
1 teaspoon cornstarch
½ tablespoon fermented black beans, rinsed and mashed
½ tablespoon chili paste with garlic
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons soy sauce
3 cloves garlic, crushed
½ teaspoon minced fresh ginger
1 (14 ounce) package tofu, drained and cut into cubes
1 cup frozen green peas
½ cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon cornstarch, mixed with equal parts water

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine ground pork, sherry and 1 teaspoon cornstarch; set aside.
In a separate small bowl, combine black beans, chile paste, cayenne pepper, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger; set aside.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. If pork is lean, add 1 tablespoon oil. Cook pork until evenly browned. Stir in black bean mixture, tofu, and peas. Pour in chicken broth, and bring to a boil. Stir in dissolved cornstarch, and cook until thickened.

Description: 
This is a great Chinese recipe. I love this dish - you can control the spice by varying the cayenne. I hope you like it as much as I do.
