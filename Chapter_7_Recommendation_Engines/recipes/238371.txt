Ingredients:
3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup finely chopped pecans
1 1/2 pounds chocolate almond bark (chocolate confectioners' coating)

Directions:
Line baking sheets with waxed paper.
Beat brown sugar and butter together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add vanilla extract and beat until smooth. Gradually beat flour into creamed butter mixture until smooth; add sweetened condensed milk and beat until smooth. Fold chocolate chips and pecans into cookie dough mixture; shape into 1-inch balls and place on prepared baking sheets. Refrigerate cookie dough balls until chilled, about 2 hours.
Melt chocolate bark in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Dip each cookie dough ball into melted chocolate using 2 forks to hold the ball. Place dipped ball onto the waxed paper and repeat with remaining balls and chocolate. Chill in refrigerator until set, at least 1 hour.
