Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
6 Tbsps butter-flavored shortening
1-2/3 cups packed brown sugar

1-1/4 tsps salt
3/4 cup butterscotch chips

Directions:
1. In a very large bowl, cream the butter, shortening and sugars until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in buttermilk and vanilla.
2. Combine the oats, flour, baking soda and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well. Stir in chips and pecans.
3. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls 3-in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375* for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks.
