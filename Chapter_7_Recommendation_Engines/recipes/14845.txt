Ingredients:
1 cup vegetable oil
1 pound chicken wings
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground white pepper
½ cup butter
½ teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1 cup mayonnaise
4 tablespoons minced onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley
½ cup sour cream
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
½ cup blue cheese, crumbled
⅛ teaspoon salt
⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large frying pan or deep fryer, heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry wings for approximately 8 minutes. Transfer wings to a paper towel and let drain. Season with salt and white pepper.  After the wings have drained, place them in a large mixing bowl.
In a small saucepan, melt butter or margarine. Stir in hot pepper sauce. Pour mixture over chicken wings, toss to coat the wings. Place wings in a baking dish.
Bake 15 to 20 minutes.
While the chicken wings are baking, make the blue cheese dressing: In a medium size mixing bowl, combine mayonnaise, onion, garlic, parsley, sour cream, lemon juice, vinegar and blue cheese. Blend the mixture well. Arrange the baked chicken wings on a serving platter. Serve with blue cheese dressing.
