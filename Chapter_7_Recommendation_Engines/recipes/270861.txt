Description: 
I created this recipe many years ago for my hubby who does not like the traditional sour cream sauce on his chicken enchiladas. It's been a hit with family and friends ever since.  Now with our Instant Pot® it's been improved and made better than ever! For a different take on chicken enchiladas that will make everyone happy, give this one a try!
