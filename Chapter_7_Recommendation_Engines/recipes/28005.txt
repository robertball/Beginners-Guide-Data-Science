Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/4 inch thickness
garlic salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
Â½ pound thinly sliced ham
4 slices Swiss cheese
8 slices bacon
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Sprinkle each  flattened breast with garlic salt and pepper to taste on both sides. Lay a slice of ham onto each breast, then a slice of Swiss cheese. Roll each breast up like a cinnamon  roll. Secure with a toothpick if necessary. Wrap a piece of bacon loosely around each roll. Place the rolled breasts in a 2 quart glass baking dish and pour in chicken broth.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the juices run clear.  Broil for a few minutes before serving to crisp up the bacon.
