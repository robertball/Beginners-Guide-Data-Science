Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a mini muffin tin with cooking spray.
Combine chickpeas and egg whites in a food processor; blend until well mixed.
Pour chickpea mixture into a bowl. Add apple, oats, puffed wheat, applesauce, chocolate chips, honey, almond butter, cranberries, almonds, and cinnamon; stir until batter is evenly mixed.

Description: 
Great homemade soft granola bars. I also make these with mashed banana instead of the applesauce and apple and peanuts instead of almonds.
