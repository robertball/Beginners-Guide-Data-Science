Ingredients:
2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup shortening
7 to 8 tablespoons ice cold water

Directions:
Measure flour and salt into bowl.
Using pastry cutter or fork, cut in shortening until it's broken up and no larger than the size of peas.
Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing with a fork after each addition.
Continue adding water until all flour is moistened and dough almost cleans side of bowl (an additional 1-2 teaspoons water can be added if needed).
Gather dough into 2 equal size balls; shape each into a flattened round on lightly floured board or stone.
With floured rolling pin, roll dough two inches larger than the pie pan.
Fold one pastry into quarters and ease into pan.
For a baked pie shell only, prick bottom and sides thoroughly with fork, line with foil and place dried beans or weights on top. Bake at 475 F for 8-10 minutes.
