Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
6 eggs
4 teaspoons baking powder
5 cups all-purpose flour
1 (1.75 ounce) package multicolored sprinkles (jimmies)
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Cream the butter or margarine with the white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla and eggs and mix well. Stir in the baking powder and flour. Drop dough by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets. In a small bowl beat milk into the confectioners' sugar a tablespoon at a time until it is of a drizzling consistency.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 10 minutes. Let cookies cool then drizzle with confectioners' sugar and milk glaze then sprinkle with candy sprinkles.

Description: 
This recipe is from my Italian mother-in-law. She refers to them as spoon cookies because most Italian cookies are shaped and these are just dropped from a spoon. They're usually seen at Christmas.
