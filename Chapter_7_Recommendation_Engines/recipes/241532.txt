Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package Hillshire Farm® Smoked Sausage, diagonally cut into 1/4-inch slices
2 teaspoons olive oil
6 ounces bow tie pasta, cooked and drained
1 (15 ounce) can white beans, rinsed and drained
1 medium zucchini, sliced into thin rounds
1/2 cup vegetable broth
1/2 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
1 (6 ounce) package fresh spinach
1/4 cup toasted pine nuts

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and set aside.
Heat a dry large skillet over medium-low heat and toast pine nuts, stirring frequently, until pine nuts are golden in spots, about 3 minutes. Remove and set aside.
Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in the same skillet on medium-high heat. Saute the smoked sausage for 5 minutes, or until golden brown, stirring occasionally. Remove smoked sausage and set aside.
Add the zucchini and vegetable broth to the skillet and simmer until zucchini are soft, about 5 minutes. Add spinach, white beans and cherry tomatoes; continue to simmer for 2 minutes until spinach is wilted and tomatoes are soft.
Turn the heat to low; add the pasta and smoked sausage to the vegetables mixing well to combine and cook for 30 seconds until heated through.
Garnish with toasted pine nuts and serve warm.
