Ingredients:
3 pounds bone-in goat meat, cubed
1/2 cup white vinegar
1 large onion, chopped
1/2 cup Jamaican curry powder, divided
2 Scotch bonnet peppers, seeded and chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
6 allspice berries (pimento seeds)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 large potatoes, diced (optional)
2 carrots, diced (optional)
water to cover

Directions:
Combine goat meat and vinegar in a large bowl; cover with water. Let stand, about 5 minutes. Drain, massaging the meat.
Mix onion, 6 tablespoons curry powder, Scotch bonnet peppers, garlic, allspice berries, salt, pepper, and thyme together in a bowl to make a spice rub. Rub into goat meat until coated. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
Scrape spice rub off the goat meat, reserving it in a bowl.
Heat oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add remaining 2 tablespoons curry powder; stir until dark and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add goat meat; cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
Stir reserved spice rub, potatoes, and carrots into the saucepan. Pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, adding more water as needed, until goat meat is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Discard allspice berries. Season with salt and pepper.
