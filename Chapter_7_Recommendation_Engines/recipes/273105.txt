Ingredients:
4 sweet potatoes, or more to taste
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/3 cup olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cut each sweet potato in half crosswise. Quarter each half lengthwise. Cut each quarter evenly into 2 to 4 pieces. Repeat with remaining sweet potatoes.
Place sweet potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet. Add salt. Drizzle olive oil on top. Stir up potatoes to coat with oil; spread out evenly on the baking sheet. Season with pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 minutes, until browned, 20 to 30 minutes.
