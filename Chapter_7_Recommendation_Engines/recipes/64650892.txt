Ingredients:
1/4 cup of sugar
1/8 Tsp cream of tartar
1/8 cup of water
1/2 Tsp citric acid
1/4 t. lemon extract
Blue food coloring
Powdered sugar
Candy Thermometer
Blue candy foil wrap

Directions:
In a sauce pan combine sugar, water, and cream of tartar. Stir. Insert candy thermometer and heat until it reaches 300 degrees F (hard crack). Pour mixture into a greased baking pan or Silpat. Add food coloring, citric acid, and lemon extract. Your choice of flavorings is entirely up to you here, as is color!
Mix the ingredients together. Mix thoroughly until it begins to cool. Then using your hands, carefully pull small globs from the mixture and ball it up between your palms. The faster you work the easier it will be- and you won't burn yourself! When you've formed each rare candy, drop it in a bowl of powdered sugar to coat all the edges. Work through the rest of your melted mixture. You'll be able to reform each of the rare candy's a little bit when you're all finished.
