Ingredients:
2 cups Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Gluten Free Flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar(optional, will add lift)
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 cup mashed potato flakes
1/2 cup plus 2 Tablespoons milk
1/3 cup mayonnaise(the light will not work)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400. Mix dry ingredients in large bowl.  Add milk and mayo just until blended.  Drop by tablespoon fulls onto a lightly sprayed baking sheet.  Bake for 12-15 min.  Remove from oven and enjoy while still warm.
Again if making for a breakfast, replace the garlic powder with ground cinnimon.  Great with jam!

Description: 
Light and flaky biscuits that mix up in minutes.  Great with soups, stews and chilli.  Because they are quick to make they are also great for breakfast.  Just omit the garlic powder and add cinnamon.  We make these a couple of times a week.
