Description: 
This is now a favorite in my husband's family in Canada after my aunt sent it with me when I moved up from California. We make this with whatever broth is abundant. Garnish with Mexican cheese blend, sour cream, salsa, and sliced avocado. This soup is an especially tasty way to use up the turkey after holidays! It freezes well, too!
