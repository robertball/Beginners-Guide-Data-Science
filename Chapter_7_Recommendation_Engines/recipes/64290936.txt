1/2 tsp. salt
1 Tbsp. chopped parsley
1 tsp. vegetable oil
a pinch of ground black pepper

Directions:
Cut chicken into 1" strips. Combine remaining ingredients in a nonreactive bowl. Add chicken pieces; stir until pieces are evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours.
Meanwhile, make hummus: puree all ingredients in a blender. Chill until ready to serve.
Heat oil in large saute pan. Add chicken and red onion. Cook over medium-high heat until chicken is done, approximately 5 minutes. Add tomato and parsley during the last minute of cooking. Place chicken in the middle of a large serving platter. Surround with a ring of hummus. Serve with remaining ingredients as desired.
