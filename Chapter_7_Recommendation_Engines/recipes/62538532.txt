Ingredients:
6 cups cubed whole-wheat cinnamon raisin bread
2 cups whole milk
3 eggs
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin pie filling
1/4 cup brown sugar, loosely packed
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Toss the bread cubes with the milk in a large bowl until the liquid has been absorbed; set aside.
Beat the eggs in a separate bowl; whisk in the pumpkin pie filling, brown sugar, vanilla, and salt.  Mix in the walnuts.
Pour the pumpkin mixture over the bread cubes. Toss gently until evenly combined.
Refrigerate 30 to 60 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spoon mixture into a 9x13" pan (or two square pans). Bake in preheated oven until the pudding has firmed and the top has turned golden brown, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to stand 30 minutes before serving.
Enjoy!
