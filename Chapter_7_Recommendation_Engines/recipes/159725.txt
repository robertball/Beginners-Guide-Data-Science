Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups milk
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons seasoned salt
3/4 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 1/2 cups flour
4 cups oil for deep frying
3 pounds beef tenderloin, cut into 2 1/2x3/4-inch strips

Directions:
Mix together the milk, thyme, marjoram, salt, seasoned salt, and Worcestershire sauce in a bowl. Stir in the flour gradually until the mixture reaches a thick, batter-like consistency. Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.
Preheat the oil in a large pot to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Completely coat each piece of beef in the batter and gently place into the hot oil.  Lie them into the oil individually to keep them from sticking together. Cook in small batches of 4 to 8 pieces until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Allow the oil to return to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C) between batches.

Description: 
This recipe was given to me many years ago and is alleged to be the original recipe from a cafe in Boise, Idaho: the purported home of the finger steak. I ate there many times in the 70's and this recipe seems authentic. I always omit the salt as it seems way too salty for me and everyone to whom I passed it along agrees with me, but I included it as that's the way it was given to me. Try dipping in cocktail or fry sauce.
