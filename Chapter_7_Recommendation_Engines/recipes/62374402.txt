Ingredients:
1 cup arborio rice
3 cups reduced sodium chicken stock- simmering
2 Tbs butter
1 Tbs minced garlic
1 Tbs dried onion flakes
1/4 cup chopped chives
1/2 cup roasted diced yellow squash
1/2 cup roasted diced zucchini
1/2 cup halved cherry tomatoes
1/2 cup sliced pepperoncinis
1 cup grated Asiago cheese
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1 Tbs fresh ground pepper
1/4 cup chopped italian parsley

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan, then add garlic, chives, and dried onion.  Add the rice and stir for a minute until coated.
Add the chicken stock, 1 ladle at a time, stirring almost constantly and waiting for the stock to be absorbed before adding more. This process should take about 20 minutes.
When the risotto has been cooking for 15 minutes, add the vegetables. Continue cooking and adding stock, stirring gently, until the rice is tender.
Add the cheese, pepper, and parsley and stir until the cheese is melted and ingredients are combined.
