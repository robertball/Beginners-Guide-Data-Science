3 T flavored liquour (optional)

Directions:
1) place choclate pieces in large bowl
2) Heat heavy cream on medium high until it comes to a boil.
3) Remove from heat and immediately pour cream over chocolate and stir until completely mixed and glossy.
Allow ganache to cool before pouring over cakes as a glaze.  The longer you allow the ganache to cool, the thicker it will set.

Description: 
This is the base recipe for ganache frosting.  May simply pour or dip if wanting smooth finished look.  Otherwise, if wanting to pipe into cakes or cupcakes, chill until it holds it's texture in a spoon and then whip for added volumn (chill in fridge, not freezer).  From Savorysweetlife.com
