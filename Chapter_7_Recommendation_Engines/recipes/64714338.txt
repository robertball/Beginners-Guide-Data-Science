Ingredients:
¼ cup butter
¼ cup honey
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon oregano plus fresh sprigs
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon dried orange peel
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
½ teaspoon salt
¼ cup dried cranberries
¼ cup chopped pistachios

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Peel a large butternut squash (a Y-shaped peeler works best) and cut in half lengthwise.
Scoop seeds and stringy flesh from hollow.
Oil and salt squash and place on a rimmed baking sheet with about 3 tablespoons water.
Roast 20 minutes to soften.
Remove from oven and allow to cool five minutes and reduce oven to 400 degrees.
Slice the squash partway through horizontally, leaving the bottom portion attached.*
Drizzle with ? of sauce mixture.
Bake for 10 minutes, uncovered.
If possible, gently press on squash to slightly separate the slices, and drizzle ½ of remaining mixture over butternut and return to oven.
Bake for 10 minutes, uncovered.
Tuck fresh oregano into slices or lay on top, sprinkle with pistachios and cranberries and drizzle with remaining glaze.
Bake for an additional ten minutes, uncovered.
Enjoy!
*A tip I learned from the internet: place a wooden spoon beside the squash and carefully hold your knife level while slicing, using the spoon as a guide to keep from going through.

Description: 
The glaze creates a smoky caramelized topping, and the cranberries and pistachios add tartness and crunch.  My ten year old walked in as I pulled this from the oven for the first time and announced, “That’s BEAUTIFUL!”  It’s just as amazing in flavor, and makes a gorgeous, elegant side.
