Ingredients:
Cooking spray
4 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced
1/4 cup chopped onion
6 ounces lean ground pork or turkey sausage
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
4 egg whites, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons shredded low fat sharp cheddar cheese
1/4 cup skim milk
salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Coat a non-stick skillet with cooking spray over medium-high heat.  Saute mushrooms and onion for 8 minutes or until onion is tender.   Remove from skillet and transfer to a large bowl.
Add sausage to the skillet.   Cook for about 8 minutes or until no longer pink, breaking the sausage into crumbles with a spatula.   Drain well on paper towels.
Add sausage and all remaining ingredients to mushroom/onion mixture.   Pour into a 10-inch quiche dish or a deep-dish pie plate coated with cooking spray.   Bake for 30 minutes or until set in the center.   Let quiche stand for 5 minutes before slicing.
