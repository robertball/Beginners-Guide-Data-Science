Ingredients:
4 ounces blueberries
3 ounces red ribes (gooseberries)
3 tbsp fresh mint, chopped
3 tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped
1 tbsp fresh marjoram, stems removed
1 habanero, seeded and minced
2 tbsp olive oil
2 limes
2 tbsp agave syrup
1/2 cup raw cashews
8 ounces halloumi, sliced into one ounce slabs

Directions:
1. Put the blueberries and ribes in a mixing bowl. Add 2 tbsp mint, 2 tbsp cilantro, 1 tbsp marjoram, minced habanero, olive oil, juice of one lime, and the agave syrup. Mix and set aside.
2. Heat a non-stick griddle. Cook the cashews until browned, stirring often to keep them from burning. Set aside. Now, cook the halloumi slices by browning each side. Place the halloumi on a plate, top with the salsa and remaining mint and cilantro. Chop the cashews and spread on top of the halloumi. Garnish with lime wedges from the remaining lime. Serve immediately.
