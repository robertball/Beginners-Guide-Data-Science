Description: 
Nutella is a big deal in my house...thought I would try to put together a cookie recipe using this chocolate-hazelnut spread.  This is a basic Peanut Butter Cookie recipe, revamped to omit the PB and add Nutella.  I also add hazelnuts and chocolate chips to really bring out the flavor.
