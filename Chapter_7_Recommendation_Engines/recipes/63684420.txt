Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
6 quarts sliced fresh apples (firm crisp apples are best)(about 30 apples)
5 cups sugar
1 1/2 cups Clear Jel
1 Tablespoon cinnamon
2 1/2 cups water
5 cups apple juice
3/4 cup bottled lemon juice
Combine sugar, Clear Jel, cinnamon, water and apple juice in a large pot. Stir and cook on medium high heat until the mixture thickens and begins to bubble. Add lemon juice and boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add drained apple slices to sauce.
Fill jars with mixture, leaving 1 -inch head space. I packed the jars with the apples and then divided sauce among the jars.
Wipe jar rims clean, tighten lids and process immediately. Place jars in pot of water with water 1 inch above top of jar lids and boil for 25 minutes (For 0-1,000 ft altitude. See download for other times). Remove from water and let jars cool 12 to 24 hours. Lids should be indented if properly sealed. Now they are ready to be saved for later or wrapped for gifts.
I felt the apples were a little soft for pie, but they made the most delicious Apple Crisp.
