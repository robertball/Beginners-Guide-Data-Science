Ingredients:
8 Cups of water
2 Cups Dry Steel Cut Oats
1 tbsp butter
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 cup whole milk
1 cup dried cranberries
1 tsp Cinnamon
Dash of salt

Directions:
Bring 8 cups of water to a boil.
Stir in 2 cups of oats.
Boil oats for 5 minutes or until mix starts to thicken.
Throw in a dash of salt and mix well
Place on low heat and let simmer for 20 minutes.
In a separate container, melt the butter.(I microwave it)
Mix the melted butter with brown sugar and 1 cup of whole milk.
Stir this mixture vigorously or the sugar will stay on the bottom of your container.
Pour mixture into simmering oatmeal and stir.
Toss in the cinnamon and stir.
Leave on low heat for 10-15 minutes stirring occasionally.
When the oatmeal looks to almost be ready, add dried cranberries and stir well so the cranberries do not stay on the bottom.

Description: 
I love instant oatmeal raisins and spice flavor, but I wanted better oats, so this is my own twist. 

This recipe is not quick, but if you make this large amount, you can refrigerate in small tupperwares for a quick and easy snack or meal. It tastes good cold!
