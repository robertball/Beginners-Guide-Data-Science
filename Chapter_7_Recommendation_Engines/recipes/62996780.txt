Ingredients:
3 eggs room temperature
3/4 cup of sugar
1/2 cup of melted butter cooled
1 T. orange extract
2 tsp. triple sec (orange liqueur)
8 drops yellow food coloring
4 drops of red food coloring
1 3/4 cups of flour
1 tsp. baking powder
2 tsp. orange peel grated fine

Directions:
In a separate bowl, sift flour and baking powder together.
In a large bowl beat the eggs and add sugar a little at a time until it thickens.
Add the melted butter gradually.
Add orange extract, triple sec, and food coloring.
Gradually add sifted flour, stir until smooth.
Fold in orange zest.
Brush oil on the pizzelle maker. Heat the pizzelle iron.
The dough should be stiff enough to drop by using a small ice cream scoop (holds about a heaping Tbsp.) on the pizzelle baker. Using the scoop makes it easier to drop the batter on the pizzelle iron. Bake for 30-40 seconds.
Cool completely on cooling rack. Store in an airtight container.
