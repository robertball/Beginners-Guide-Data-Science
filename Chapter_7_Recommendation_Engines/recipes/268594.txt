Description: 
There's nothing like a big, steaming bowl of comfort food to make everything seem all right, and this dark but delightful black lentil stew with sausage and kale is no exception. Sausage and lentils is a marriage made in heaven, and so good together, that not even kale can ruin it. I'm kidding, and actually love kale, but if you're not the biggest fan in the world, maybe try it one more time in this.
