Ingredients:
5 thick slices bacon
1/2 large white onion, diced
1 small can diced green chilis, OR 2 roasted, peeled, seeded green chili peppers, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.5-oz.) can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
4 tsp. sugar (more or less, to taste)
water for thinning the beans

Directions:
In a large skillet or cooking pot, cook the bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove the bacon to paper towels. Use the remaining bacon grease to saute the onions until translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the green chile and garlic; saute for another minute or two (try not to burn the garlic). Add the beans, cooking and stirring until heated through. Use a potato masher or handheld mixer to mash the beans, stirring in sugar and water to taste. Crumble the bacon slices and add them to the beans.

Description: 
A little sweet, a little spicy, and generally tasty. The antithesis of the canned stuff we avoided in lunchrooms.
