Ingredients:
20 oz 93% lean ground turkey
1 small onion, minced
2 cloves garlic. minced
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
2 tbsp bread crumbs
1/4 tsp allspice
1/4 tsp coriander
1/4 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp chili powder
salt and fresh pepper (to taste)

Directions:
In a large bowl combine the ground turkey, onion, garlic, parsley, breadcrumbs, spices, salt and pepper until evenly blended. Divide into a heaping 1/4 cup portions so you get 12; roll into log shaped ovals. Place on a cookie sheet and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. If using wooden skewers, soak in water at least 30 minutes before grilling.
When ready to eat, preheat grill to high heat. Carefully insert the skewer through the formed meat.
Grill for 10 to 15 minutes on indirect heat turning occasionally, until meat is no longer pink.

Description: 
For best results prepare the meat ahead and refrigerate to allow the flavors to blend, this also helps the meat stay together when you grill it. I chopped my onions, garlic and parsley in my mini food processor for quick prep.
