Ingredients:
2 oz thinly sliced pancetta, chopped
1 tbsp olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 to 3 cups zucchini chunks (about 1 10" zucchini)
1/3 cup chicken stock
1 Tbsp butter
1/2 cup grated parmesan
1 tbsp chopped fresh basil
Salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat skillet over medium heat; add pancetta and cook until almost crisp (if thinly sliced, it will only take minute or so).  Remove pancetta and set aside.
Add olive oil to pan, then add onions; saute 2 or 3 minutes, then add garlic and saute another minute or two until onion is tender.
Add zucchini and cook five minutes or until tender crisp.
Add chicken stock and butter, stirring to coat. Add basil and parmesan and cook a few minutes.  Season to taste with salt & pepper.
Sprinkle with reserved pancetta and serve.

Description: 
I had some pancetta and zucchini to use up so I incorporated them into this easy side dish. I loved the slight bacon-y flavor the pancetta gives this dish! This would also be excellent tossed with some pasta for a main dish.
