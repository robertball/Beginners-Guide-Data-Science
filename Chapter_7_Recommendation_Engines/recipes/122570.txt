Description: 
'I tried this recipe when I was a 4-H leader,' jots Louise Gangwish of Shelton, Nebraska. 'Before morning chores, the young members would grab a glass of milk or juice and a handful of these crisp cookies.' Chock-full of bacon, cornflakes and raisins, they're a handy breakfast on the go.
