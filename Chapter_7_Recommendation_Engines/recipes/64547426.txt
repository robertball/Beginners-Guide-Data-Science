Ingredients:
3/4 pound ground turkey
1/2 pound chicken sausage, casings removed
2/3 cup gluten free bread crumbs
2 teaspoons minced garlic (2 cloves) or garlic powder
3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves (you can use dried basil)
1/4 cup grated Parmesan
3 tablespoons milk
1 egg, lightly beaten
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
For the meatballs, place the ground chicken, sausage, bread crumbs, garlic, basil, Parmesan, milk, egg, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl and combine gently with a fork.
With a teaspoon, drop 1 to 1 1/4-inch meatballs onto a sheet pan greased or lined with parchment paper. (You should have about 40 meatballs. They don't have to be perfectly round.)
Bake for 30 minutes, or until cooked through and lightly browned. Set aside.
(You can use 1 and 1/4 lbs. of whatever ground meat you prefer rather than the ground chicken mixed with sausage. You could also try different spices.)
