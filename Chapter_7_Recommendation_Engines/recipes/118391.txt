Description: 
This homey lasagna-style casserole from Dorothy Bateman of Carver, Massachusetts will appeal to the whole family. There's plenty of spaghetti sauce to keep the layers of tender pasta and spinach-cheese mixture moist. 'It's a hearty main dish that can be made early in the day, refrigerated and baked at dinnertime,' Dorothy notes.
