2 to 2-1/2 cups chicken broth
680 ml can tomato sauce (plain) (about 2-3/4 cups)
1 cup sour cream
1 tbsp chili powder

1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp ancho chili powder
1/2 tsp white pepper
1-1/2 cups grated aged cheddar cheese

Directions:
Pre-heat over to 350 degrees.

Spray 4 L casserole dish with non-stick spray.
Stir together cubed chicken, rice, corn and black beans in casserole dish - set aside.
In large bowl mix together 2 cups chicken broth, tomato sauce, sour cream and spices.  Pour into casserole dish and mix well. (contents should be fairly soupy)
