Ingredients:
2 cups fresh corn kernels
2 (15 ounce) cans black-eyed peas, rinsed and drained
1 cup cubed fully cooked ham
3 stalks celery, finely chopped
2 tablespoons chopped red onion
2/3 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 tablespoon dried cilantro
1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
2 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Place the corn into a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until the corn is fully cooked, about 2 minutes. Drain the corn in a colander set in the sink.
Mix together the warm corn, black-eyed peas, ham, celery, and onion in a salad bowl.
Whisk together the sour cream, ketchup, cilantro, Cajun seasoning, and hot pepper sauce in a bowl until smooth. Stir the dressing lightly into the black-eyed pea mixture until thoroughly mixed. Serve immediately.
