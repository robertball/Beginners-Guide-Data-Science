Ingredients:
1/2 cup flour
3 Tsp caraway seeds
1 cabbage, cored, chopped finely
Boiling water
1-1/2 tsp butter
3 Tsp sugar
3 Tsp vinegar

Directions:
Mix together flour and caraway seeds.
In the bottom of a large saucepan, lay one layer (1/2") of cabbage, sprinkle with flour mixture.  Pour a little boiling water just enough to start the flour soaking into the cabbage.
Continue layering cabbage and flour mix until you have nothing left.
Simmer for 1-1/2 - 2 hours.  (Stir occasionally and add a little water if needed so that the cabbage or flour does not burn on the bottom.)
When the cabbage is almost soft, add butter.
When finished cooking, the cabbage should be very soft (mushy).
When the cabbage is done, remove from the heat.
Mix the sugar and vinegar together to mix it evenly, and pour over the cabbage.

Description: 
This is a sweet-and-sour cabbage boiled-to-death recipe that has been in my family for over 100 years.  It is very similar to the Norwegian Christmas Cabbage recipe without the bacon.  This dish is usually served with pork, but goes with almost anything!
