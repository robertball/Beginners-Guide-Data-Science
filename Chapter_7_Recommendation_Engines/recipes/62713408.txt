Ingredients:
You Won't Believe it's Cauliflower Pizza Crust
1 cup cooked, riced cauliflower*
1 egg
1 cup mozzarella cheese
1/2 tsp fennel
1 tsp oregano
2 tsp parsley
(I love garlic, so I will probably add 2 teaspoons garlic when I make it)
- pizza or alfredo sauce
- toppings (make sure meats are cooked)
- mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees Farenheit.
Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick spray.
In a medium bowl, combine cauliflower, egg and mozzarella. Press evenly on the pan. Sprinkle evenly with fennel, oregano and parsley.
Bake at 450 degrees for 12-15 minutes (15-20 minutes if you double the recipe).
Remove the pan from the oven. To the crust, add sauce, then toppings and cheese.
Place under a broiler (grill for the Europeans) at high heat just until cheese is melted.
* Use frozen cauliflower prepared according to package directions. After cooked and slightly cooled, shred cauliflower with a cheese grater, and then measure for the recipe. (Don't pack down the cup with cauliflower. Just fill it with a spoon or the cup itself.)
Found at:
I used 1/2 cup of fat free mayo mixed with about 2 teaspoons of dry ranch mix for the sauce. I put it on after the crust baked and cooled. Then I put on shredded lettuce, 4 strips of cooked, crumbled turkey bacon, and sliced tomatoes. Oh, and some shredded cheddar too. SOOOOO yummy, and I think it worked out to like 210 cals per slice of pizza. (I tripled the dough recipe and cut into 8 pieces)
