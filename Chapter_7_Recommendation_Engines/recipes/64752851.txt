Ingredients:
Cupcakes:
1 cup fresh raspberries
1 1/2 tsp flour
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup sugar
2 eggs, room temperature
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tbsp lemon zest
1/3 cup sour cream, room temperature
2 tbsps lemon juice
Frosting:
1 cup fresh raspberries
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
4 cups powdered sugar
Pinch of salt
1/4 tsp lemon zest
1 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsps heavy cream

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350, and line a 12-cup muffin pan with liners.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs 1 at a time, making sure to thoroughly combine after each addition. Mix in vanilla and lemon zest. Stir in half of the flour mixture until just combined. Add in the sour cream and lemon juice, stirring until just combined. Add in the remaining flour mixture and stir to combine.
4. Place raspberries in a small bowl. Sprinkle with 1 1/2 tsps flour, and toss to coat. Gently fold raspberries into the batter.
5. Pour batter into prepared muffin pan, filling each cup 3/4 of the way full. Bake at 350 for 20-23 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the cupcakes comes out clean. Cool completely.
6. Prepare frosting. Place raspberries in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until raspberries burst and release their juices, about 5-10 minutes. Pour raspberries into a fine mesh sieve set over a medium bowl, and use the back of a wooden spoon to press and extract approximately 1/3 cup juice from the berries. Discard seeds. Allow juice to cool completely.
7. In a large bowl, beat butter until light and fluffy. Beat in powdered sugar 1 cup at a time until incorporated. Mix in 1/3 cup raspberry juice, salt, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Beat until combined. Pour in heavy cream and beat until frosting is light a fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add in additional powdered sugar if frosting is too thin, or additional heavy cream if frosting is too thick, until the desired consistency is reached.
8.Frost cooled cupcakes and top with additional raspberries, if desired.

Description: 
Fresh raspberries, paired with plenty of lemony flavor, make for an awesome summertime cupcake! This recipe makes a lot of frosting---plenty to generously frost 15 cupcakes and then some--but it freezes well, and would make a great sugar cookie topping too!
