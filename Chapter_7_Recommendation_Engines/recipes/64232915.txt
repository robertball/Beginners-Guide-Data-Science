Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups chickpea/garbanzo bean flour
3 cups cold filtered water
3 Tbls tofu
2 tsp black salt

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 500°, and line a muffin tin with silicone or other liners. In a big bowl, whisk the chickpea flour, cold water, tofu, and salt. Whisk it really well – make sure there are no lumps when you’re done.
Pour the quiche mix into a liquid measuring cup (for an easy pour) and then into your muffin tins.
This is where you can either leave them plain (which will still taste great) or add some flavor! I strongly encourage you to do this. Just chop up whatever you want to use and add to the tins. (onion, roasted pepper, basil pesto, olive)
Bake for 14 minutes, then slightly open the oven door and bake for another 11 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven. Let them cool on a cooling rack for 10 minutes before serving. They should be smooth and creamy on the inside.
Freezing – this is the best part.  This recipe will make 12 mini quiches. If you want to freeze them, take them out of the tins after 10 minutes, and let them cool completely. Once cool, wrap each one in plastic wrap and then put in a freezer Ziploc bag. Make sure to get all the air out of the Ziploc (I use a straw to suck all the air out, but that’s just me :)). Once you’re ready to eat, take out of the freezer and microwave for 2-3 minutes.
