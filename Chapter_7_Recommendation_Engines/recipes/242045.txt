Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
3 cloves garlic, minced
8 sprigs fresh parsley, chopped
8 leaves fresh basil, chopped
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon pink salt
water to cover
2 tablespoons rice flour, or more as needed
2 tablespoons avocado oil, or more as needed
2 beets, sliced

Directions:
Combine cauliflower, pumpkin puree, garlic, parsley, basil, pumpkin pie spice, black pepper, and pink salt in a large pot; add enough water to almost cover cauliflower. Cover pot and bring liquid to a boil; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until cauliflower is tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Mash mixture with a potato masher and continue heating until most of liquid is evaporated, about 5 minutes more.
Stir rice flour into mixture, adding more if needed to thicken mixture.
Heat avocado oil in a skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Form cauliflower mixture into patties and carefully place in hot avocado oil; fry until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
Serve patties topped with beet slices.

I created this recipe when I decided to go more vegetarian in my diet. I just happened to have all this lying around and boy did it turn out well!
