Ingredients:
2 6-inch flour tortillas
1/4 cup grated Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup shredded Mozzarella cheese
2 (1 ounce) slices cooked deli turkey breast
1 tablespoon pizza sauce
1 tablespoon chopped tomato (optional)
1 tablespoon sliced black olives (optional)
1 tablespoon chopped green bell pepper (optional)

Directions:
Place one tortilla on a sheet of waxed paper sized to fit in your microwave. Spoon 2 tablespoons each of Cheddar and Mozzarella cheeses over the tortilla. Cover the cheese with turkey slices. Spread 1 tablespoon of pizza sauce over the turkey, and top with 1 tablespoon each tomatoes, black olives, and green peppers. Sprinkle with remaining Cheddar and Mozzarella cheeses, and place second tortilla on top. Place on a microwave-safe plate, and cover with a sheet of waxed paper.
Cook on High in microwave until the cheese melts, about 1 1/2 minutes. Allow to cool 2 minutes before cutting into wedges.
