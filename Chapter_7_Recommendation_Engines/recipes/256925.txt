Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
1/4 cup oat milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup honey
1 egg, beaten
1 1/4 cups diced strawberries
Frosting:
1 tablespoon shredded coconut
2/3 cup cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.
Mix Greek yogurt, coconut oil, oat milk, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract in a bowl until smooth. Add 1/2 cup honey and egg; stir thoroughly.
Stir Greek yogurt mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Fold in strawberries until evenly distributed in the batter.
Divide batter among lined muffin cups, filling each 1/2 to 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 16 to 22 minutes. Transfer muffins to a cooling rack; let cool completely, 20 to 30 minutes.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread coconut on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Toast coconut in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Whisk cream cheese with a fork in a small bowl until light and fluffy. Stir in 1 tablespoon honey and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Spread frosting over muffins; sprinkle toasted coconut on top.
