Description: 
This recipe is my favorite for a good healthy bread. Especially because it is so quick and there is no need to let it rise.
 
I love to make it for breakfast or brunch or as a present. It takes 10 minutes and 1 hour in the oven, so you can prepare breakfast and take a shower while you wait.
