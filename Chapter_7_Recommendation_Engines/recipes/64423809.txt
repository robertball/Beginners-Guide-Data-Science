Ingredients:
1 bag of tater tots
4 ounces of bacon, cut into 1" pieces and crumbled
1lb boneless skinless chicken breast
1 1/2 cups grated Colby cheese
1 1/2 cups grated Monterey jack cheese
3/4 cup milk
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut up bacon pieces and fry over medium heat until crispy, set aside and crumble when cool
Grease the bottom of your crock pot, or a liner bag if using one.
Layer 1/2 of the tater tots on the bottom, then sprinkle 1/2 of the bacon bits on top.  Combine both of the cheeses and sprinkle 1/3 of the cheese on top.
Cut up the chicken breasts into bite size pieces and layer on top of the cheese.
Layer another 1/3 of the cheese and remaining bacon bits.  Top with remaining tater tots.
Use remaining cheese on top of the tater tots and pour milk over all.
Set crock pot to high and cook for 3-5 hours (depending on your crock pot)

Our family enjoys this any time of year, but mostly during the summer when you don't want an oven heating up your house, but want a hot home-cooked meal.
