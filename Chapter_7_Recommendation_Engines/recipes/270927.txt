Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
3/4 cup rolled oats
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons kosher salt
2 cups buttermilk
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (191 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
Mix flours, rolled oats, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Mix buttermilk and melted butter together in a small bowl.
Make a small well in the flour mixture and pour in the buttermilk-butter mixture. Stir together with a wooden spoon until well combined.
Turn the dough out on a generously floured surface and knead into a smooth, round loaf. Place on the cookie sheet and cut a shallow X into the top of the dough.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 1 hour. Carefully tap the bottom of the loaf; it should sound hollow. Cool on a baking rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
There's no excuse not to whip up a crusty loaf of Irish soda bread this St. Patrick's Day, especially when it's part-whole wheat and packed with oats! One of the best quick breads out there, soda bread is so easy that the hardest part is waiting for it to cool before serving it with salted Irish butter. I've also included a few variations you can try out!
