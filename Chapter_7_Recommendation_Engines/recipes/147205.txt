Ingredients:
1  rotisserie chicken, skinned and boned, meat pulled into large chunks
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1 (12 ounce) package coleslaw mix with carrots
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
2 tablespoons white sugar
black pepper to taste
½ cup hoisin sauce
¼ cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 head green leaf lettuce, leaves separated, rinsed, and patted dry
1 cup Thai-style peanut sauce

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, garlic, ginger, coleslaw mix, basil, sugar, and pepper. Pour in hoisin sauce, soy sauce, and vinegar. Bring to a simmer, and cook and stir until the chicken is hot, and the liquid has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.
To serve, line a platter with lettuce leaves, and pour the chicken mixture into the center of the platter. Each diner assembles their own wraps by placing some of the chicken mixture onto a lettuce leaf, adding a little peanut sauce, then rolling into a cylinder.
