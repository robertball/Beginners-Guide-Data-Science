Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) containers fat-free cream cheese, softened
2 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon green tea powder
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker pie crust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, beat together the cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the green tea powder, eggs, and vanilla extract until lightly and creamy; pour into the prepared crust.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until the center jiggles evenly when the cake is shaken lightly. Refrigerate 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
This is a creamy and simple cheesecake with the addition of green tea powder to give it a taste of the Orient! Green tea powder can be found at Asian grocery stores and online. I like to add fresh blackberries and raspberries on top of it!
