Ingredients:
4 slices bacon, sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (15 ounce) jar butter beans, drained and rinsed
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups arugula, coarsely chopped
Â½  lemon, juiced

Directions:
Cook bacon in olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 8 minutes. Pour butter beans into bacon and drippings; toss lightly. Season with salt and black pepper; cook 3 more minutes to blend flavors.
Stir garlic into beans and cook just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Toss arugula into mixture and cook until wilted; remove from heat. Stir in lemon juice.

Description: 
Rocket is another name for arugula. I love to use it as an herb, but don't buy it in the herb section of the supermarket; buy it in the lettuce section. This is an incredibly fast, incredibly simple, but satisfying rustic bean side dish.
