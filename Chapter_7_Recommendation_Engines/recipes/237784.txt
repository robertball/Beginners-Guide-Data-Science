Ingredients:
1 tablespoon sweet paprika
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon onion powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons lemon pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
4 (4 ounce) fillets red snapper, patted dry

Directions:
Mix paprika, salt, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, lemon pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.
Combine olive oil and butter in a small, microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until butter is melted, about 1 minute. Stir to blend butter into the oil.
Brush some of the olive oil and butter mixture over both sides of each red snapper fillet. Sprinkle paprika mixture over both sides of each fillet.
Heat leftover oil and butter mixture in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry red snapper until flesh flakes easily with a fork, 4 to 5 minutes per side.

Description: 
This is a recipe that I came up with one night after finding some red snapper in the freezer. It can also be done with catfish, flounder, perch, or pretty much any white fish. Remember that the thinner the fillet, the shorter the cook time.
