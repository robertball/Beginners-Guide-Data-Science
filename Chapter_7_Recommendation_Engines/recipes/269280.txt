Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable shortening, chilled
1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons pistachios (optional)

Directions:
Combine vegetable shortening and confectioners' sugar in a large bowl. Use the kneading hooks of an electric mixer to mix until smooth, creamy, and pale in color. Slowly mix in flour and vanilla extract using the kneading hooks. Cover dough and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with shortening.
Scoop tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Press a pistachio on top and slightly pat each cookie to flatten.
Bake in the preheated oven until very lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely, about 15 minutes more, before removing from baking sheet.
