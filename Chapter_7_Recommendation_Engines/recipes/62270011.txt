Ingredients:
8 chicken thighs
1 quart chicken broth, plus 2 cups water
1 sweet potato, peeled and cut into tiny cubes
8 stalks of celery - diced
2 onions - diced
4 carrots - diced or coarsely chopped
1 cup fresh parsely - chopped
1 very small clove of garlic - leave whole
black pepper
1/2 teaspoon leaf thyme
1 pound Farfalle (bowtie pasta)
2 cups water (additional)

Directions:
In 6-quart stockpot, boil chicken thighs (skin on) in the broth and water.  While chicken is boiling -prepare vegetables. When chicken is tender (about 30-40 minutes), remove thighs to cool.  Add all vegetables, parsley, thyme, pepper and garlic clove to the broth and simmer until tender.  The sweet potato cubes should eventually disolve into the broth (adds body and sweetness to the broth).  Remove garlic clove.
Debone and chop the chicken - add to the broth, along with 2 cups of water.   Add the bowtie pasta and simmer until noodles are done.

Description: 
The sweet potato adds an entirely new dimension.  The bowtie pasta holds its shape in the soup and doesn't seem to absorb as much of the broth.  If the left over soup seems thick - add a little more water to reheat.
