Ingredients:
1 apple, peeled, cored and grated
1 Tb sugar
2 cups water
2/3 cup quick oats
3/4 tsp salt
2 Tb brown sugar
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1 Tb butter or margarine
1/4 tsp vanilla ext.

Directions:
Grate the apple into a small bowl or plastic container and mix with 1 Tb sugar; cover and let sit in frig overnight - the longer the better (up to a week, at least 30 minutes).  The apples will become soft, juicy and brown.  DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP - it is very important for the color and flavor of the oatmeal.
Place the brown/juiced-up apples in a small saucepan.  Add the water and bring to a boil.
Blend together the oats, salt, brown sugar, and cinnamon.  Add the dry oat mixture to the apples/water in the saucepan.  Cook at a low boil for seven minutes, stirring frequently.  When thick and done, turn off heat and stir in the butter/margarine and vanilla.  Serve hot and enjoy!

Description: 
Had leftover grated apples in the frig from making apple muffins, cooked them in my oatmeal and came up with the following recipe.  Yum!  When my husband tasted it, he wanted seconds, and he is a man who does not eat breakfast.  The secret is to make sure the grated apples get nice and brown.
