4 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary or 2 teaspoons dried
1 1/2 teaspoons Kosher salt*
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 2 1/2-pound boneless pork loin roast, well trimmed of visible fat

Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a 13 x 9 roasting pan with foil. Mix garlic, chopped rosemary salt and pepper in a bowl. Take the mixture and rub it the pork loin. Place pork, what was the fatty side down, into the prepared roasting pan. Roast pork 30 minutes. Turn roast fat side up. Roast until thermometer inserted into center of pork registers 155°F., about 25 minutes longer. Remove from oven; let stand 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
Pour any juices from roasting pan into small saucepan; set over low heat to keep warm. Skim any fat from top. Cut pork crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Arrange pork slices on platter. Pour pan juices over. Garnish with rosemary sprigs, if desired.
