Ingredients:
6 ounces bacon, diced
1/2 pound asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces
4 ounces baby bella (cremini) mushrooms, sliced
4 ounces shredded Swiss cheese
1 can evaporated milk
6 large eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tube crescent rolls

Directions:
Position oven rack to center position. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line square casserole dish with crescent rolls.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bacon in the hot skillet until crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove bacon and drain all but 2 tablespoons grease from skillet. Cook and stir asparagus and mushrooms in the remaining bacon grease until asparagus is tender, about 5 minutes.
Remove skillet from heat and toss bacon into asparagus mixture. Spread asparagus-bacon mixture into the prepared pie pan. Sprinkle Swiss cheese over mixture.
Whisk cream, eggs, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Pour egg mixture over asparagus-cheese mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until quiche is set and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.
