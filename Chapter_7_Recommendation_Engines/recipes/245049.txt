Ingredients:
1/4 cup dried sage
2 tablespoons garlic powder
1 (16 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed
2 (12 ounce) packages bacon
2 cups water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Sprinkle sage and garlic powder over the entire turkey. Wrap turkey completely with bacon. Place turkey on a roasting rack and place roasting rack in a large baking dish. Pour water into the base of the dish.
Bake turkey in the preheated oven, basting every 45 minutes with juices in baking dish, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
