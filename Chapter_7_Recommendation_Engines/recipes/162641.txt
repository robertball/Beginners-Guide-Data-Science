Ingredients:
2 cups bite-size wheat square cereal (such as Wheat Chex®)
2 cups bite-size corn square cereal (such as Corn Chex®)
2 cups bite-size rice square cereal (such as Rice Chex®)
2 cups toasted oat cereal rings (such as Cheerios®)
2 cups cheese-flavored crackers (such as Cheez-It®)
2 cups pretzels
2 cups mixed nuts
1 cup butter
2 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Combine the wheat cereal, corn cereal, rice cereal, oat cereal, cheese-flavored crackers, pretzels, and mixed nuts in a large bowl; set aside.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce until evenly blended. Pour over the cereal mixture, and gently stir until the cereal is evenly coated with the seasoned butter. Spread the cereal mixture onto baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature before storing in an airtight container.

Description: 
My Grandma Jensen used to make this spicy snack at Christmas every year, and she always made several batches so she could give plenty away and still serve it in her home.  Kinda spicy, kinda garlicy, and completely addictive.
