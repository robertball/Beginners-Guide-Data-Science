Ingredients:
1  large egg white, lightly beaten
3 cups old-fashioned oats
1½ cups chopped nuts (such as almonds, pecans, pistachios, or walnuts)
1½ cups coconut shavings
½ cup agave syrup (or honey)
¼ cup olive oil or warmed coconut oil
¼ cup sesame seed
¼ cup flax seed
2 Tbsp (packed) light brown sugar
1½ tsp kosher salt
½ tsp ground cinnamon
1 cup dried cherries or cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300°. Toss egg white, oats, nuts, coconut shavings, agave syrup, oil, seeds, brown sugar, salt, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Spread out on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake granola, stirring every 10 minutes, until golden brown and dry, 40–45 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet (it will crisp as it cools). Mix in cherries.
Do Ahead: Granola can be made 2 weeks ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
An other great thing about this is you can customize it!
Swap maple syrup or honey for the agave to get a subtle flavor shift.
If chocolate chips mean your kid will love it, throw 'em in at the end.
This granola's great out of hand, but for added protein, serve over low-fat yogurt. Or layer it in a glass with yogurt and fresh fruit.

Description: 
Granola is a great addition to yogurt but if you read the ingredients in most, it's not so healthy.  What to do?? Make your own!
