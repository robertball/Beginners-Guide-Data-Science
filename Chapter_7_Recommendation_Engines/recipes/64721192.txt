Ingredients:
For the doughnuts:
1 17-ounce box frozen puff pastry (2 sheets), thawed
1 large egg, lightly beaten
3 tablespoons peach preserves
For the glaze:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 to 2 tablespoons peach nectar
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
Crushed freeze-dried strawberries, for topping (optional)

Directions:
Make the doughnuts: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Unfold one puff pastry sheet on a work surface and brush off the excess flour. Brush all over with the beaten egg. Unfold the second puff pastry sheet on top of the first one and press to seal. Cut out eight rounds using a 3-inch cookie cutter. Cut out the middles with a 1-inch cookie cutter. Cut out more 1-inch rounds from the scraps, if desired. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet and bake until browned and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes.
Make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners' sugar, 1 tablespoon peach nectar, the lemon juice and vanilla in a small bowl until smooth; add up to 1 more tablespoon peach nectar if needed.
