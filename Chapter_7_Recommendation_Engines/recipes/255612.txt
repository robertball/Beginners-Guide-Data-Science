Ingredients:
2 white potatoes, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
3 cloves garlic, smashed
1 pinch dried thyme, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 pound bacon
4 russet potatoes, peeled and quartered
1 quart chicken broth
1 cup butter
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup milk
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place white potato slices on a baking sheet and drizzle olive oil over each; season with garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper.
Roast in the preheated oven until tender, about 30 minutes.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and crumble.
Place russet potatoes into a large pot and cover with chicken broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Mash boiled russet potatoes with butter in a bowl until evenly mixed; mix in crumbled bacon, Cheddar cheese, and milk. Transfer mashed potato mixture to a piping bag with a large star tip or plastic bag with a corner snipped. Pipe mashed potato mixture onto each roasted potato slice and top with chives.
