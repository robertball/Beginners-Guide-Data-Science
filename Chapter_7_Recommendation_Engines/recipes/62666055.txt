Ingredients:
1 lb lean ground turkey
1/2 onion, finely diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/3 cup bread crumbs
3 tablespoons parmesan cheese
1 egg
4 to 5 shakes of onion powder
1/4 cup ketchup
For the marinara (or use your own recipe):
28 oz can tomato sauce
2 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes with garlic and oregano
1 6 oz can of tomato paste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350.
In a dutch oven, combine the marinara ingredients over medium heat.
Combine the remaining ingredients in a large bowl. Once the sauce is hot and bubbling, roll the mixture into 1 inch balls and drop into the sauce.  There should be enough sauce for all of the meatballs to be submerged.
Place the dutch oven, covered, in the preheated oven and bake for 20 to 30 minutes.
Remove and serve.
