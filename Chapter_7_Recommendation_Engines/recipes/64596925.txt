Ingredients:
1 and 1/2 cups water
1/4 tsp vegetable oil
2 Tbsp black sesame seeds
1/2 cup fonio

Directions:
In a small skillet, heat the oil and toast the sesame seeds. (about 6 minutes)
While the seeds are toasting, put the water into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.
Add the salt, fonio, and toasted sesame seeds to the boiling water. Wait for the fonio to begin to boil again and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook, covered, for another 5 minutes or until the water has been absorbed. Fluff with a fork and serve.

Description: 
Fonio is boiled with toasted black sesame seeds for a side dish or a gluten free substitute for couscous. I was given this recipe by a Senegalese grocer after I complained about not liking the millet version of couscous and the high cost of quinoa. This tiny African grain is bursting in nutrition and health benefits. So easy to cook, there are many ways to prepare fonio; but this is the recipe I prefer for ease and taste.
