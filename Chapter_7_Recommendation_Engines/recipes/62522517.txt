Ingredients:
For the dough:
3 c. flour
1/3 c. sugar
1 1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. baking powder
5 heaping Tablespoons Shortening
1 cup warm water
1 additional egg (beaten-to brush on top of empanada prior to baking)

ADJUST SPICES TO YOUR TASTE

Directions:
For dough:
In large bowl mix flour, salt and baking powder. Cut in the shortening. Add the warm water a little at a time, mixing continuously. Add more water if needed. Knead the dough briefly.  Form 12 round balls of dough-using flour if needed. Put the balls of dough in the mixing bowl and cover. Let dough rest about 5 minutes. Roll out dough to the size of a small tortilla-not too thin.
For filling:
In medium bowl combine pumpkin and eggs. In a small bowl combine the sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger and cloves. Then pour the dry ingredients into the medium bowl and mix well.
Assembling the empanadas:
Roll out a ball of dough into a small circle (about 6 inches wide/ 6 inches high)
Spoon desired amount of filling onto dough and seal the edges by pinching dough together.
With a pastry brush, apply egg wash on top of each empanada prior to baking.
Bake on baking sheets lined with parchment paper (for convenience) for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  You want them to be nice and brown on top, so adjust baking time if needed.
WHEW...hope this makes sense!!
