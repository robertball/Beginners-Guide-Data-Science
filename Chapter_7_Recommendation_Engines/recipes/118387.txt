Ingredients:
1 large red bell pepper, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small red onion, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
8 cups packed fresh spinach
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon sugar

Directions:
In a large nonstick skillet, saute red pepper in oil for 1 minute. Add onion and garlic; saute until tender, about 1-1/2 minutes longer. Stir in the spinach, salt, pepper and sugar; saute for 1-2 minutes or until spinach is wilted and tender. Serve with a slotted spoon.

Description: 
We often steam our fresh spinach and eat it plain. But this version dressed up with red pepper, onion and garlic is a nice change. It is really quick and tasty--and pretty, too.
