Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 1/4 cups warm water
2 tablespoons shortening
3 teaspoons dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon margarine, melted

Directions:
Combine 2 cups flour, salt, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl. Stir in the water, shortening, parsley, rosemary, and thyme. Use an electric mixer to beat on low speed for 1 minute, scraping bowl frequently. Turn mixer to medium, and beat for an additional 1 minute, scraping bowl frequently. Stir in remaining 1 cup flour; mix until smooth.  Scrape batter from sides of bowl. Cover, and let rise in warm place for 35 to 40 minutes.
Grease a 9x5 loaf pan. Stir down batter by beating about 25 strokes. Scrape batter into greased pan; pat down with floured hands. Cover pan. Let dough rise in warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Do not allow dough to over-rise.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom, 40 to 45 minutes. Brush top with margarine. Remove from pan, and cool on wire rack.
