Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
3 large eggs
2 green onions, chopped
3 medium tomatoes, cut into 1-inch wedges
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon white sugar

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add eggs and green onions. Cook and stir until eggs are nearly set, about 10 seconds. Immediately scrape eggs into a bowl.
Add tomatoes to the skillet. Saute, stirring occasionally, until juices are released and tomatoes are slightly wilted, about 5 minutes. Add salt and sugar; stir to mix well. Return eggs to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until eggs are set, 2 to 3 minutes.
