Image:

Ingredients:
Barbecue Sauce
3 bottles Heinz Chili Sauce
1/2 cup Heinz 57 Sauce
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 cup liquid smoke (Pecan or Oak)
1 1/2 Heinz apple cider vinegar
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons molasses
2 tablespoons honey
1 1/2 cups dark strong brewed coffee (preferably French Roast)
1/2 cup Heinz Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
Start pouring the chili sauce in a pot. Add all the other fluid ingredients. Then add the dry ones and stir. Slowly heat the sauce until it simmers. Let it simmer without a lid for an hour (or longer). Cool it down on the stove. Refrigerate. One batch like this lasts for months. I have even used the sauce after a year in the fridge. Still good.

Description: 
I've tweaked this one for years. Some store bought sauces are very good and hard to beat. This one does though if you take the time to get the right ingredients together and use good quality stuff (mostly Heinz products in my case).
