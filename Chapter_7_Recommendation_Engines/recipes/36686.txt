Ingredients:
1 pound ground round
1 (26 ounce) jar low-fat spaghetti sauce
1 (16 ounce) package fat-free cottage cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
cooking spray
1 (8 ounce) package precooked lasagna noodles
1 cup (4 ounces) preshredded reduced-fat mild Cheddar cheese
Chopped fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Cook meat in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until browned, stirring to crumble. Drain well, and return meat to pan. Add sauce; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 5 minutes.
Combine cottage and Parmesan cheeses in a bowl; set aside.   Spread 1/2 cup meat mixture in bottom of a 13 x 9-inch baking dish coated with cooking spray. Arrange 4 noodles over meat mixture; top with half of cottage cheese mixture, 1 cup meat mixture, and 1/3 cup cheddar cheese. Repeat layers, ending with noodles. Spread remaining meat mixture over noodles.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Uncover; sprinkle with 1/3 cup cheddar cheese, and bake 5 more minutes or until cheese melts. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with parsley, if desired.
