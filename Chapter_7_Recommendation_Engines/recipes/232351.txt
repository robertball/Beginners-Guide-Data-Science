Ingredients:
2 prepared 9-inch pie crusts
1 1/2 cups dark chocolate chips
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
6 eggs
1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 cup sliced pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Press pie crusts into two 9-inch pie pans.
Melt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.
Mix sugar, flour, and salt together in a bowl.
Whisk buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl; stir buttermilk mixture into sugar mixture. Slowly pour melted chocolate into mixture, while beating with an electric mixer, until filling is smooth. Pour half the filling into each prepared pie crust. Sprinkle pecans over each pie.
Bake pies in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 1 hour. Cool for at least 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
Since the first time I put this together four years ago, it now is a must for all our family gatherings. When I pull it out of the oven, I sprinkle a handful of leftover dark chocolate chips on top.
