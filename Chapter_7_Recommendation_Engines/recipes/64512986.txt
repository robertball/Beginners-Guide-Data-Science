Ingredients:
8  large tomatoes (choose firm tomatoes ~ cored and peeled (see NOTE below)
1  teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1  cup light brown sugar (packed)
4  tablespoons butter (1/2 stick ~ cut into 1/4-inch pieces)

Directions:
Note: To peel tomatoes, score an X at each tomato's base. Plunge in boiling water for 30 to 60 seconds. Cool in ice water for 1 minute. Use a knife to remove peel, starting at the X on base.
Adjust oven rack to the upper-middle position and preheat oven to 400Â°F.
Arrange tomatoes in a large ovenproof skillet, cored side up.
Season with salt and peppers, then sprinkle with brown sugar.
Dot tomatoes evenly with butter.
Bake until tender and lightly browned, about 1 hour, basting every 15 minutes.
Remove skillet from the oven and transfer to the stove top. Cook over medium-low heat, basting every 5 minutes and adjusting the heat as needed to maintain a rapid simmer, until the sauce is thick and syrupy, 25 to 30 minutes.
