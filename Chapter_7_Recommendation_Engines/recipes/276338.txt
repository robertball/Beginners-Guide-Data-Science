Ingredients:
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3 tablespoons butter
1/2 large white onion, chopped
3 teaspoons garlic, minced
1 1/2 cups uncooked long-grain rice
2 1/2 cups chicken broth
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 (7 ounce) can fully cooked luncheon meat (such as SPAM®), cubed
1 (8.5 ounce) package coleslaw mix

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and golden, 6 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Stir in rice until coated and lightly fry for 2 minutes. Pour in broth and season with pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to a gentle simmer and cover. Cook until rice is tender, about 18 minutes.
Heat remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry luncheon meat, stirring constantly, until crispy and golden on the edges, about 5 minutes. Add coleslaw and cook until wilted, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat.
Transfer cooked rice into the skillet and stir until well mixed.

Description: 
I was never a believer in SPAM® until my mother-in-law passed down a rice recipe that changed my world. This is an easy, budget-friendly, kid-friendly weeknight meal. We make it every so often when we're low on groceries, or just need a nice, not-too-healthy, but delicious dinner! I use my own homemade broth for a slightly healthier, cheaper alternative, but boxed broth is just as delicious! Great with your favorite hot sauce, or served with fried eggs.
