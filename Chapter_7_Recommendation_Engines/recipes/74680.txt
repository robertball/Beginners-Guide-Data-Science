Ingredients:
1 (32 ounce) package frozen potato rounds
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup with herbs
8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons sour cream
1 (15 ounce) can green beans, drained
8 slices ham, chopped
salt and pepper to taste (optional)

Directions:
Pour the potato rounds into a 9x13 inch glass baking dish. Heat in the microwave for about 2 minutes to thaw. The potato rounds should be cold, but not frozen.
In a medium bowl, stir together the cream of chicken soup, Cheddar cheese, and sour cream. Stir in the green beans and ham. Stir this mixture into the potato rounds until evenly blended.
Return to the microwave, and cook on high power for 5 minutes, or until heated all of the way through. If you have a high powered microwave, you may want to check on your casserole every two minutes or so. Season with salt and pepper, and serve.

Description: 
Tater-tot casserole in ten minutes!  Great for those of us who need dinner in a pinch. And whose children dislike balanced meals! Use any flavor of condensed soup you have on hand, as long as it is cream of something.
