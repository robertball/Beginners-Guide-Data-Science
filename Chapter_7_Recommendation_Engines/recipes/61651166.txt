Ingredients:
12 ounces milk chocolate chips
2 tablespoons shortening
1 pound fresh strawberries with leaves
4 ounces white chocolate
1/4 cup chocolate sprinkles

Directions:
Insert toothpicks into the tops of the strawberries.
In a double boiler, melt the chocolate and shortening, stirring occasionally until smooth. Holding them by the toothpicks, dip the strawberries into the chocolate mixture.
Turn the strawberries upside down and insert the toothpick into styrofoam for the chocolate to cool (or simply place them on a sheet of wax paper). Once milk chocolate is set, melt white chocolate in small bowl or double boiler. Drizzle over milk chocolate. Lightly scatter sprinkles on white chocolate. Insert strawberries back into styrofoam to cool.
