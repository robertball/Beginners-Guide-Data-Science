Description: 
I told my daughter's friends that this green non-alcoholic Halloween punch was 'insect juice' and added a whole bunch of plastic insects. It turned out to be a big hit. I had an extra-big spider that wouldn't swim, so I placed a bowl upside-down into the punch container and sat the insect on top.
