Ingredients:
I’ve had way too much fun with the commentary on this post.
Peanut Butter Cookie Dough Cookies
Inspired by these
(gluten-free and sugar-free too!)
¦1/4 cup peanut butter
¦1/4 cup plus 3T raisins
¦salt to taste (I used a little over 1/4 tsp, but I like salty pb cookies!)
¦2 T roasted, unsalted peanuts (If you can only find salted, reduce or omit added salt)
¦1/8 tsp pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Throw everything into your food processor (I used an Osterizer) and combine until very smooth. Roll into balls, cookies, bars, or simply eat shovel the dough into your mouth, straight from the machine.
Dough can be stored on the counter, in the fridge, or in the freezer. Or in your belly.
