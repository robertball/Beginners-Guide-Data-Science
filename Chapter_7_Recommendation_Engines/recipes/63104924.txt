Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds Cooked Perfect brand angus beef meatballs
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 (15 ounce) can pineapple chunks, juice reserved
1/3 cup vinegar
1/3 cup chopped green bell pepper

Directions:
Place meatballs in bottom of slow cooker.
Stir the cornstarch and brown sugar together in the bottom of a saucepan and place over low heat. Add the reserved pineapple juice and vinegar; stir until smooth. Bring the mixture to a boil for 1 full minute before removing from heat; pour over the meatballs in the slow cooker.
Add the pineapple chunks and green bell pepper to the slow cooker.
Cook the mixture in the slow cooker on Low until the flavors are thoroughly combined, 3 to 4 hours.
In a pinch can also skip the slow cooker and just add thawed/pre-heated meatballs to the saucepan to coat with glaze and serve when warmed through and green peppers have softened.
