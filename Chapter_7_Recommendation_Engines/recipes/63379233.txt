Ingredients:
¼ c. soft butter or margarine
1 c. granulated sugar
3 eggs, plus one yolk
1 ½ tsp flavouring (vanilla/almond extract, anise flavoring) your pick.
2 ½ c. all purpose flour
2 tsp. baking powder

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350 deg.
Mix together the flour and baking powder and set aside.
In a large mixing bowl,cream together butter/marg and sugar.  Add eggs plus yolk and flavouring, mix until thoroughly blended.  Add the flour mixture and stir until well incorporated. The dough will be somewhat sticky. Wet hands and form two loaves on a parchment lined cookie sheet.  The loaves should be no higher than an inch in the center. Bake at 350 deg. For 20-25 mins.   Cool on a wire rack. Adjust oven temp to 450 deg.  When the loaves are cool enough to handle, make ½ inch slices with a serated knife.  Place cookie slices, cut side down back onto cookie sheet and bake for another 3-4 mins. Per side or until golden brown.  Keep an  eye on them, they tend to brown  quickly depending on your oven! Happy baking?

Description: 
This was given to me by my very best friend.  It’s her mother’s recipe.  This is a wonderful basic biscotti recipe.   Very rarely do I make them the same way twice.  You can add dried cherries, cranberries, walnuts, toasted almonds, chocolate, white chocolate or cinnamon chips, whatever you like really. Or nothing at all. It's good enough to stand on its own.  I also change the flavourings and use almond or vanilla extracts.  These will keep for a couple of weeks (if you’re lucky) in your cookie jar!
