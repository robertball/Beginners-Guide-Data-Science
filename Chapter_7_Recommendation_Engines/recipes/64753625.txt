Ingredients:
4 lb Chicken thighs or breasts
14 cup Brown sugar
14 cup Soy sauce
14 cup Balsamic vinegar
14 cup Olive oil
2 tsp salt
1 tbs lemon juice
2 tsp Garlic powder
1tsp Black pepper

Directions:
If using breasts, lightly pound them to a even thickness.
Combine all ingredients in a large zip lock bag. Press as much of the air out as possible. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least one hour or overnight.
Remove from refrigerator and let rest for no longer than 30 minutes.
Preheat grill to 450 degrees ( a little over medium).
Grill skin side UP for 5-6 minutes. Flip and grill about 4 minutes. Continue to flip alternating sides of the grill to an internal temperature of 180-185 (about 25 minutes).

Description: 
Surprisingly Delicious. We prefer using thighs for this recipe but it's good with breasts too.
The soy sauce does not overwhelm; a lovely melody of flavors!
