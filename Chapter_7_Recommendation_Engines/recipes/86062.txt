Description: 
Galatoire's Restaurant in New Orleans, La. in the French Quarter shared this recipe. It is the best we have ever tasted and I know you will enjoy it too. Decorate the edge of plate with hard-boiled eggs sliced thin or quartered, and a few green and black olives. Then stand back and let your guests give you applause for serving them such a wonderful treat.
