Ingredients:
1/2 cup malt vinegar
2 tsp cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp turmeric
1 lb boneless beef (chuck or stew meat) cut into 1" cubes
2 tbs canola
4 oz pearl onions, peeled and cut in half (I'm not a fan--I used shallots, probably normal onion would be fine)
5 medium cloves garlic, finely chopped
6 dried red Thai chilis
1 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp ground cumin
salt
chopped fresh cilantro.

Directions:
Combine the vinegar, cayenne, and turmeric in a bowl and then add the meat.  Let it marinate for at least an hour or as long as overnight.
Heat the oil in a medium skillet over med-high.  Add the onions, garlic, and chilies and cook until the onions have begun to brown, about 5 mins.
Add the beef and marinade.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until th beef has absorbed the spiced vinegar and seared, and the oil is starting to separate from the meat, 12 to 15 mins.  Sprinkle in the coriander and cumin and cook for another 1-2 mins.
Pour in 1 cup water, bring to a boil. Reduce heat to med-low, cover the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is fork tender and the sauce is reddish brown and thick, 40-45 mins.
Remove chilis if you like.  Sprinkle with cilantro.  Serve.

Description: 
Pretty easy and nice and spicy.  Cook book says Serves 4 but I made 1.5x and got three good-size servings out of it.  Maybe that says more about how much I love Indian food than anything else.
 
Excellent with a very simple basmati rice, maybe with a few cardamom pods cooked with the rice.
