Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
1 (27 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained
2 cups tomato juice
1 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, and stir in the ground beef and onion. Cook until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain, and discard any excess grease.
Pour the beef mixture into a 3-quart casserole dish.  Layer the sauerkraut over the ground beef, pour the tomato juice over the sauerkraut, then sprinkle with brown sugar.  Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbly, about 60 minutes.

Description: 
My mom used to bring this to our church potlucks 20 years ago. The sour taste from the sauerkraut bakes out of the dish, to give it a more sweet BBQ flavor.  Serve over smashed boiled potatoes.
