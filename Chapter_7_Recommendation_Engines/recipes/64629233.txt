Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 egg whites
2 teaspoons seasoned salt
1 1/2 lbs small sweet potatoes, cut into 1-inch thick wedges (about 6-8 wedges per potato)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Heat oil in large shallow baking pan in oven until very hot, but not smoking, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, beat egg whites in large bowl with electric mixer on medium-high until stiff peaks form. Gently stir in seasoned salt until combined. Add sweet potatoes; toss to coat well.
Remove baking pan from oven, being careful not to spill hot oil. Arrange the sweet potatoes in a single layer, flat side down, on baking pan.
Roast 25 to 30 minutes or until sweet potatoes are tender and lightly browned, turning halfway through cooking. Sprinkle with additional seasoned salt, if desired.
