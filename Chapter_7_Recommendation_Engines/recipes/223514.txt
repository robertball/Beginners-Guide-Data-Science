Ingredients:
3 cups shredded zucchini
2 ears fresh corn, kernels cut from cob
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 large egg, beaten
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3/4 cup olive oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Squeeze excess moisture from shredded zucchini and combine with corn kernels, onion, flour, and curry powder in a bowl. Stir in egg until thoroughly combined and season with salt and black pepper.
Heat olive oil to a depth of about 1/8 inch in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Drop batter, 1/4 cup at a time, into hot oil and flatten fritters gently with a spatula. Cook until golden brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
