Ingredients:
Sauce:
2/3 cup diced cucumber
2/3 cup plain low-fat yogurt
1/4 teaspoon dried dill weed
2 cloves garlic, crushed
Salmon Cakes:
1 (14.75 ounce) can red salmon, drained
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained
1 cup fresh bread crumbs
1/4 cup sliced ripe olives
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 teaspoon hot sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 egg whites
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, divided

Directions:
To prepare sauce, combine cucumber, yogurt, dill, and garlic in a small bowl.
To prepare salmon cakes, remove bones and skin from salmon. Place chickpeas in a medium bowl; partially mash chickpeas with a fork. Stir in salmon, breadcrumbs, and olives. Combine parsley and next 5 ingredients (parsley through egg whites) in a small bowl; stir into salmon mixture. Divide mixture into 12 equal portions, shaping each into a 3/4-inch-thick patty.
Heat 1-1/2 teaspoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 6 patties; cook 4 minutes. Carefully turn patties over, and cook 4 minutes or until golden. Repeat procedure with 1-1/2 teaspoons oil and remaining patties. Serve with sauce.

Description: 
Although clearly Mediterranean in influence, this dish isn't too far removed from an American coastal favorite: crab cakes. Serve with herb-seasoned rice.
