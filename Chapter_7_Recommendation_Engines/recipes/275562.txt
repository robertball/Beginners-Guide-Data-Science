Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
12 Italian plums, halved and pitted
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven.
Cream butter and 1/2 cup sugar together using an electric mixer in a mixing bowl. Add eggs and mix well. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into the batter; beat to mix well. Pour into an ungreased 9-inch springform pan.
Cover the batter with plums, skin-side down. Mix 1 tablespoon sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl and sprinkle over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature, or serve warm.

Description: 
So easy to make and it's delicious! Take advantage of plum season to make this torte. The torte base will complement many types of fruit. I've used regular plums and quartered them and it was super tasty too. Next time, I'll try it with apricots. 
I use just a little less than 1/2 cup of sugar because I'm not a fan of sweet desserts. Serve plain or with vanilla ice cream.
