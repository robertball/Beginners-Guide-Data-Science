Ingredients:
2 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 oven-safe ramekins, about 4 inches in diameter
Aluminum foil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Brush both sides of tortilla with oil.
Invert ramekin on a work surface; center tortilla on the bottom of the ramekin. Gently shape the tortilla down around the sides. Place a double layer of aluminum foil over the tortilla and press to form the bowl around the ramekin. Place right side up on a baking sheet and leave about 1/2 inch of the edge of the tortilla above the foil so it gets browned and crispy when you bake it. Repeat with the second tortilla.
Place baking sheet in preheated oven for 5 minutes. Remove sheet from oven and use tongs to carefully remove the ramekins from inside the shells. Transfer sheet back to the oven. Bake shells until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove baking sheet from oven.
Carefully remove foil from around the shells; reserve the foil. Flatten foil sheets and invert shells on them. Bring foil up just around the bottom of the shells to protect the top edge.
Transfer sheet back to the oven. Bake until browned and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove sheet from oven and invert the shells once again so they are right side up. Place on foil and transfer sheet back to oven for the final crisping, 3 to 5 minutes. Watch them carefully so they don't burn.
Remove sheet from oven; transfer basket burritos to a rack to cool completely.

Description: 
These tortilla bowls are baked, not fried. They're crispy and not as greasy as the deep-fried ones. Just be careful not to burn them trying to get the inside bottom crispy.
