Ingredients:
4 pounds boneless pork loin roast
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom

Directions:
Rinse meat well and pat dry. Place in a glass dish large enough to hold it. In a separate small bowl, combine the sugar, salt, cumin and cardamom. Mix well and rub liberally over the entire roast. Cover and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for indirect heat and lightly oil grate.
Remove roast from the refrigerator and discard any juices in the dish. Rinse meat well and pat dry.
Grill over indirect low heat for about 1 hour, or until internal pork temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
This is a delicious, easy to prepare main dish that is a little different. The meat is cured overnight in a dry rub of sugar, salt, cumin and cardamom. Be sure not to over cook or the meat will be dry.
