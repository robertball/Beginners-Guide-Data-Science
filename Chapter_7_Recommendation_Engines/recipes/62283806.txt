Ingredients:
1 Package if regular Oreo cookies, crushed
1 (8 ounce) package of cream cheese, softened
1 Package of white almond bark
1 Package of dark almond bark

Directions:
Blend Oreo's and cream cheese together using a   mixer.
Roll into walnut size balls.
Chill for an hour.
Melt 3/4 package of the white chocolate almond bark. (follow melting instructions on back of package)
Stick a toothpick in an Oreo ball and dip in the melted bark.
Allow to harden on wax paper (aprox. 15 min.)
While waiting melt 3/4 of the chocolate almond bark.
When Oreo balls are no longer sticky to the touch, drizzle the chocolate almond bark on the balls to garnish.
I use a tiny Zip Lock and cut a tiny hole in the corner for the drizzle part.
