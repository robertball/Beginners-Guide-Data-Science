Description: 
This is a traditional Turkish dish that is mainly ate in the winter. I instantly fell in love with the warm savory flavors of this dish. Although I've used ravioli in this recipe, it is traditionally done with a similar pasta called Manti that you can buy from any online Turkish store.
