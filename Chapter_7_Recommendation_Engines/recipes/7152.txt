Ingredients:
6 tablespoons margarine
1 cup milk
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup white sugar
5 cups all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
3 1/2 tablespoons margarine
2 egg yolks
2 tablespoons cocoa powder (optional)
1 egg
2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
In a small pan, combine 6 tablespoons butter or margarine and 1 cup milk; heat to 110 degrees.
In a large mixing bowl, combine yeast, salt, 1/3 cup sugar, and 2 cups of the flour.  Pour in warmed milk mix.  Beat, scraping often, with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes.  Blend in 2 whole eggs and 1 cup flour; beat on high for 2 minutes.  With a spoon , beat in enough of the remaining flour to form a stiff dough.
Knead on a floured board till smooth, about 5 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turn to grease top, cover, and let rise until doubled.
While dough is rising make streusel.  Stir together 1/2 cup sugar and 2/3 cup flour.  Mix in 3 1/2 tablespoons cold butter or margarine.  Mix to get fine crumbs.  Blend in 2 egg yolks with a fork.  For chocolate streusel, mix 2 tablespoons cocoa powder with flour.
Punch dough down, turn onto floured board.  Divide into 14 pieces.  Shape each into a ball.  Shape 7 into seashells.  Squeeze 1/4 cup of streusel into a firm ball; and press over the top of each round.  Score with slightly curved parallel lines to resemble a scallop shell. Roll remaining dough into 4 by 8 inch ovals.  Top each with 3 tablespoons streusel.  To make horns, roll oval from short end; stop half way, fold in sides, and finish rolling.  Curl ends in to form a crescent.  Place buns about 2 inches apart on a greased baking sheet.  Cover lightly, and allow to rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. In a small bowl, beat together 1 egg and 2 tablespoons milk.
Brush buns with egg mixture.  Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) until lightly browned, about 15 to 17 minutes.
