Ingredients:
Cake:
2 cups sugar
1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
¾ cup cocoa powder
1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1-1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon sea salt
2 eggs
½ cup vegetable oil
1 cup almond milk
3 Tablespoons Maraschino Cherry syrup
1 cup boiled cola
Glaze:
3 Tablespoons Maraschino Cherry syrup
2 Tablespoons Cola
1 ¼ cup sugar
Teaspoon butter
Optional: sprinkles

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 375.
Mix sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, sea salt.
Next, mix in eggs, milk, oil, and Maraschino Cherry syrup.
Now stir in the boiled cola.  The batter will be very thin, but do not panic, that is how it should be.
Pour batter into Bundt pan.
Bake in the oven for about 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.
Remove from oven and cool.  I like to put them into the freezer for a while so they will cool quicker, and it seems to help them hold in the moisture better.
Glaze: Combine Maraschino Cherry syrup and cola in a small sauce pot
After it is heated stir in the sugar.
Simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring often.
Stir in butter until melted
Cool.
Drizzle over cake.
Top with sprinkles.
Enjoy!
