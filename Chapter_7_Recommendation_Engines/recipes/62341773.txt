Ingredients:
- 3 Tablespoons Olive Oil
- 3 pounds (1.4 kg) Chicken thighs and legs, cut into large chunks, bones and all
- 4 or 5 heads of garlic (garlic bulbs), cloves separated and peeled (see footnotes)
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 Tablespoon dried tarragon
- 8 Tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- Salt
- Freshly milled black pepper
- 250 ml (1 cup) dry white wine
- 460 gms (1 pound) egg noodles
- 30gms (1 ounce) buttered breadcrumbs

Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 375°F (190°C)
In a heavy skillet, heat the oil then add the chicken, all the garlic, bay leaves, tarragon, parsley, cinnamon, salt, pepper and finally the wine.
Cover tightly and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. If the liquid reduces too much, top off with a little water.
20 minutes or so before the hour is up, cook the noodles in boiling salted water (you could use chicken bouillon cubes rather than salt for an extra flavour).
When the noodles are cooked, drain then mix thoroughly with the cooked chicken pieces.
Turn the mixture into a buttered casserole, top off with the breadcrumbs and bake for 30 minutes.

Description: 
Cooked garlic becomes wonderfully nutty in flavour. Hence what seems to be a HUGE quantity in this recipe. Just a wonderful dish, this, when the stew is mixed with the noodles and baked!
