Delicious Deep Fried Pickles Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable oil for frying
3 cups Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1 egg
1 cup milk
4 dill pickles, quartered lengthwise

Directions:
Combine bread crumbs, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl; set aside. Whisk egg and milk together in a separate bowl. Dip dill pickle spears into the egg mixture, then into the bread crumb mixture until well-coated. Dip the pickles in the egg and bread crumb mixtures a second time so each spear is double coated. Arrange pickles in a single layer on a baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the freezer until the breading is set, about 30 minutes.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fry the pickles in the preheated oil until light golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.

Description: 
I have made these for a few years now, and have converted many people into huge fans using this recipe! Great as an appy for those willing to try new things! (It is slightly messy!) Serve with ranch dip or dip of your choice.
