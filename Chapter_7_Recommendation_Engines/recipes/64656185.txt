Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds pork shoulder, trimmed and cut into 1 inch cubes
1 medium onion, sliced and separated into rings
4 oranges, juiced
1 14.5 oz. can chicken broth, low sodium
1 teaspoon dried oregano
3 dried ancho chiles (dried poblanos), stemmed and torn into small pieces
2 cups boiling water
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
1 jalapeno, stemmed, seeds removed and chopped
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 garlic cloves
1/4 teaspoon cumin
1/2 cup chile soaking water

Directions:
Add pork, chicken broth, onion, orange juice and dried oregano to the pot.
Seal pressure cooker and bring to high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; cook until pork is fork-tender, about 20 minutes. When done use the quick-release method to release pressure according to manufacturer's instructions.
Remove pork from the pot and drain.
While pork is cooking, place the ancho chiles in a heat-proof bowl.
Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Pour over the chiles and soak for 15 minutes.
Drain the ancho chiles, reserving the water.
In a blender, add 1/2 cup of soaking water, apple cider vinegar, ancho chiles, jalapeno, cilantro, oregano, garlic and cumin. Blend to form a thick sauce.
Pour sauce over pork and mix well.
