Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups fresh yellow or pink rose petals
1 cup clover honey
2 tablespoons white sugar (splenda works too)
1 medium pitcher water

Directions:
Put water on the stove to boil.
When water just beings to show bubbles on the bottom of the pot, add rose petals. (Petals MUST be fresh!)
When water comes to a rolling boil, add sugar and honey. Stir until dissolved.
Remove from heat. Take a slotted spoon and remove rose peatals.
Serve hot or cold, it's good either way. Garnish with a little fresh mint and rose petals.
*Options*
You could add a little peach or strawberry juice to the finished product if you would like a little more flavor.
