Ingredients:
12 cups lightly packed torn curly kale - about 1 bunch
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1/3-1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
In a very big bowl, drizzle olive oil on the kale, then sprinkle on the nutritional yeast and salt. Stir up the kale and coat the leaves with the dressing with your hands. Lay out (not overlapping) on baking sheets and bake at 200F until they get crispy. Rotate racks and flip the chips once they start to get a bit crispy. Make sure to keep an eye on them to make sure they don`t burn, and if you notice certain chips ready much sooner than others, take them out in advance. Baking the chips will take about 45-60 minutes - It will be quicker at a higher temperature, but then you run the chance of burning them, and more nutrients are lost during the cooking.
The best way to bake these is by using a food dehydrator, where you just lay them on the sheets and wait until they are nice and crispy, and they are raw, meaning that none of the nutrients are lost. This method will take several hours for them to be ready, but the taste will be superior.
