Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (~2.5 lb)
1 bottle of buffalo wing sauce (about 14-17.5oz)
1 oz package dry ranch salad dressing mix
4 tablespoons butter
6 hoagie rolls, split lengthwise (or use hamburger buns)
3 sprigs green onions, diced
sliced pickles (optional)

Directions:
Strain chicken breasts and place into a slow cooker, and pour in 3/4 of the bottle of wing sauce and the ranch dressing mix. Dredge the chicken a bit and mix the sauce.
Cover, and cook on Low for 6 to 7 hours.
About 30 minutes before the chicken is done, preheat oven to 350(F). Use 2 TBSP of butter on the insides of the hoagies and set them face down on a baking pan. cook for 10-12 minutes. You might want to use additional butter/cooking spray to grease the baking pan.
Once the chicken has cooked, add the remaining 2 TBSP butter, remaining buffalo sauce, and green onions. Shred the meat finely using two forks (it'll split effortlessly). Mix well.
Pile the meat onto the hoagie rolls/buns. Add pickles if that's your thing.

Description: 
While deployed in Iraq, I became fond of Wednesday DFAC dinners composed of Buffalo Shredded Chicken.  They're also available as an MRE.  I sought to figure this recipe out (and hopefully, improve upon it).
