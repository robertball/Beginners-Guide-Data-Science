Ingredients:
3 cups heavy cream
3/4 cup ground dark roast coffee
1/3 cup granulated Splenda
1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract

Directions:
Heat heavy cream to a low simmer.
Put in the coffee grounds and keep it warm.  Do not let it come to a boil.
Let coffee steep in the cream until the desired intensity of flavor is obtained.  This is easily judged by the color.  About 15-20 minutes for a strong flavor.
Strain the cream mixture through cheese cloth to remove the coffee grounds.  Chill cream until cold and original cream consistency.
Add Vanilla to cream and beat to soft peaks.
Add in Splenda and beat to desired consistency.
