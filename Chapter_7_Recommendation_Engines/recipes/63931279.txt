Ingredients:
1/2 cup natural peanut butter
1/2 cup honey
1 cup whole raw almonds, chopped fine
1/8 cup extra virgin coconut oil
1/8 tsp. sea salt

Directions:
Melt the coconut oil in a small sauce pan over low heat.
Add the peanut butter, honey, chopped almonds and sea salt and thoroughly combine.
Transfer the mixture to a cookie sheet lined with wax paper.  Place another large piece of wax paper over the top of the mixture and roll it to 1/4" thickness.
Place in the freezer for 45 minutes.
Place frozen mixture over a cutting board and cut to desired size (I recommend a Chef's knife for the job).
