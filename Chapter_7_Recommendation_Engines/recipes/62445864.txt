Ingredients:
1 loaf (day-old) french bread, cut into 1 inch cubes
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup sugar
1 egg
1-1/2 tsp. lemon juice
2 cups fresh blueberries
10 eggs, beaten
1-3/4 cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup Domino Washed Raw Cane Sugar (or something comparable)
1-1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1-1/2 cup water
1-1/2 cup fresh blueberries
1-1/2 tablespoon butter
nutmeg
cinnamon

Directions:
Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cream the cream cheese and sugar together. Beat in one egg and lemon juice.
Arrange half the bread cubes in the dish, and top with cream cheese mixture. Sprinkle 2 cups of blueberries over the cream cheese, and top with remaining bread cubes.
In a large bowl, mix the 10 eggs, milk, vanilla extract, and syrup. Pour over the bread cubes. Press the bread down into the egg mixture. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.
Remove the bread cube mixture from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before baking. If it has been well refrigerated, it will need extra time on the counter "warming up" to room temperature before you cook it. You'll have a more difficult time cooking it all the way through if it's too cold.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Just before baking, sprinkle the top of the casserole with the sugar. Cover, and bake 30 minutes. Uncover, and continue baking 25 to 30 minutes, until center is firm and surface is lightly browned.
In a medium saucepan, mix the sugar, cornstarch, and water. Bring to a boil. Stirring constantly, cook 3 to 4 minutes. Mix in the remaining 1-1/2 cups blueberries, nutmeg and cinnamon. Reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes, until the blueberries burst. Stir in the butter. Serve with the baked French Toast.
