Ingredients:
2 pounds imitation crabmeat, flaked
2 (8 ounce) packages reduced-fat cream cheese
1 onion, diced
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish, or to taste
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 (12 ounce) jar cocktail sauce

Directions:
Pulse crabmeat in a food processor several times until minced. Transfer crabmeat to a large bowl. Blend cream cheese in food processor until creamy. Add onion, horseradish, and Worcestershire sauce to cream cheese; blend until smooth.
Stir cream cheese mixture into crab mixture until well-combined. For crab mixture into 2 to 3 balls, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm and chilled, at least 1 hour. Place crab balls on a platter and top with cocktail sauce.

Description: 
Tasty and quick imitation crabmeat appetizer sure to please a crowd. Prepare with enough time to chill! This tastes best with the addition of Tiger Sauce. If you cannot find it (usually in the ketchup/condiment section) and use cocktail sauce instead, remember cocktail sauce contains horseradish and adjust your ingredients accordingly!
