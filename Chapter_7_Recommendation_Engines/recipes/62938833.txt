Ingredients:
FILLING :
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
3 tablespoons cinnamon
2 cups halved pecans OR walnuts OR raisins (OPTIONAL)
PROOF YEAST :
2 packets of active dry yeast OR 4 1/2 teaspoons
1 cup of very warm(110 degrees) water
1 teaspoon granulted sugar
ROLLS :
1 cup of warm milk (or microwaved for 1 minute)
2/3 cup granulated sugar
2/3 cup melted butter or margarine
2 teaspoons salt
2 eggs
8 cups of flour - split in half
1/2 cup melted butter or margarine
1/2 cup melted butter or margarine
1/3 cup granulated sugar
GLAZE :
4 cups (or 1 standard store box) powdered sugar
2/3 cup melted butter or margarine
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon maple extract (not required-but definitely encouraged)

Directions:
Mix together 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar and 3 tablespoons cinnamon and optional nuts or raisins. Put aside as this will later be your filling.
In another small bowl whisk together 2 packets of active dry yeast (OR 4 1/2 teaspoons)and 1 cup of very warm(110 degrees) water. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon granulted sugar over the and continue whisking until very well mixed and sit aside to proof, 10-20 minutes, until it gets a nice foamy head on top.
In a mixer,add 1 cup of warm milk, 2/3 cup sugar, 2/3 cup butter or margarine, 2 tsp salt,2 eggs, and proofed yeast and mix well for a few minutes. Add in 4 cups of flour. Mix on medium until completely smooth. Remove from mixer and transfer to large bowl. Add other 4 cups of flour and mix/knead with hands an additional 10 minutes until completely mixed and you have a slightly stiff, kinda sticky dough. Place in large greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to rise in warm place until doubled in size-about an hour and a half.
Once risen,uncover and punch down dough. Allow to rest for 5 minutes.
Roll dough out onto well floured surface and form large rectangle, about 15x20. Brush entire surface with 1/2 cup melted butter or margarine and cover with cinnamon sugar filling mix made earlier.Tightly roll up dough and pinch edges to seal. Cut the roll using dental floss into 15-20 slices.
Coat the bottom of a 13x9x2 (or larger) baking pan with 1/2 cup melted butter and sprinkle with 1/3 cup sugar. Place cut rolls close together and allow to rise in warm place for 45 minutes. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.
Mix together to 4 cups powdered sugar,2/3 cup melted butter,2 teaspoons vanilla extract,and 1 teaspoon maple extract to make glaze. Drizzle over still warm cinnamon rolls.
