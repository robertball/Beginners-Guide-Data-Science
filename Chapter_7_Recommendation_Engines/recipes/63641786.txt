Ingredients:
1 cup cold, unsalted butter
2 cups white granulated sugar
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons heavy cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 cups all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder

Directions:
Pre heat oven to 350 degrees one hour before baking.
Cream butter and sugar until light and lemon colored.  About 5 minutes.
Add in eggs one at a time and beat well after each one.
Add in vanilla and heavy cream.  Mix until combined.
Add in flour, salt and baking powder.  Mix until a soft dough forms.  Do not over mix.
Divide dough into 4 portions.  Wrap somewhat flattened out in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate at least one hour.
Flour work surface and roll one portion of the dough out slowly to 1/4 inch thickness. (Keep remaining dough in the refrigerator until ready to use.) If dough cracks then wait 5 minutes and try again.  Flour the top surface of the dough to prevent rolling pin from pulling or tearing dough. Use more flour when necessary.
Cut into desired shapes. Save scraps from each portion and roll out again.
Bake 350 degrees for approximately 10 to 12 minutes.  Bake until cookies are set and only slightly beginning to brown.  Be careful not to over bake.
Cool on baking sheet for 3 minutes and remove to wire rack to finish cooling.
Decorate with your choice of frosting, Royal Icing or other items.
Store in an air tight container.
