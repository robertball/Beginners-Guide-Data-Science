Ingredients:
3 pound spaghetti squash
1 cup water
2 cups chili, warmed; divided use
1/2 cup shredded cheese, Mexican blend; divided use.

Directions:
Cut the spaghetti squash in half crossways (You’ll get longer strands of spaghetti squash if you cut it in half crosswise instead of lengthwise.) Scoop out the seeds and discard.
Place the trivet in the inner liner of the pot, add the water and place the squash halves on the trivet.
Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 8 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
When the time is up release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions. Unlock,remove the lid and the squash.
When cool enough to handle pour out any liquid that collected in the squash halves and shred with a fork  to create spaghetti.
Evenly divide the chili and cheese among the servings.
