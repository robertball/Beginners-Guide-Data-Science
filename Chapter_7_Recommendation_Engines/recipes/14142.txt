Ingredients:
1 3/4 teaspoons salt
1 large eggplant, peeled and cubed
1/4 cup chopped onion
3/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 1/2 cups bread crumbs
2 eggs
1/2 ounce shredded Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 quart vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
In a medium-size pot, place one inch of water, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and eggplant. Cover pot and cook 15 minutes, or until eggplant is tender. Drain well.
Chop the cooked eggplant. In a large bowl, combine eggplant, onion, green pepper, 3/4 cup bread crumbs, 1 egg, cheese, paprika, pepper and remaining salt. Cool and chill 2 to 3 hours or overnight.
Place flour in a bowl. Beat the remaining egg in a separate small bowl. Drop mixture by heaping teaspoonfuls into the flour and coat completely. Then dip the eggplant balls into the beaten egg; finally, coat the balls with the remaining bread crumbs.
In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil and fry eggplant balls until they are heated through.
