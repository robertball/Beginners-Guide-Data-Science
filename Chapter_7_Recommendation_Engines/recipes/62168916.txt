Ingredients:
4 large chicken breasts, poached and cubed
1/2 c. butter
4 c. noodles
4 c. chicken broth
1 c. rice
chopped parsley

Directions:
In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat.
When butter is melted, add the dry noodles, stirring to coat them with the butter.
Keep stirring the noodles frequently until they start to brown and smell nutty (about 6 to 8 minutes).
Add the chicken broth and the rice to the pot, stir well to combine.
Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer.
Reduce the heat to low, cover pot.
Stirring occasionally, cook until rice is tender and noodles are soft, about 15-20 minutes (add a little water if liquid cooks down too much).
Salt and pepper to taste.
Garnish with fresh chopped parsley.

Description: 
My brother learned how to make this dish in his seventh grade home economics class back in the early 1980s. He brought it home, made it for our family, and we've been making it ever since! Adults and kids love this dish, it's like a chicken noodle/rice soup but without the soup. Great comfort food. Feel free to throw in any leftover cooked veggies you may have in the fridge - carrots, peas, broccoli and mushrooms make great additions.
