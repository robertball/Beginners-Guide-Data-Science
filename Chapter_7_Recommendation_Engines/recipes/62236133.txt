Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 cup diced onion
2 cloves garlic (or powder/granules added later)
3/4 cup diced carrots
About 1 1/2 lbs cooked acorn/butternut squash or about 2 lbs raw cubed acorn/butternut squash
6 cups vegetable stock
salt and ground black pepper to taste
ground nutmeg to taste
garlic powder/granules to taste (if not using fresh)
small pinch cayenne
1/2 cup half & half cream
Crumbled Gorgonzola or other blue cheese (optional)

Directions:
Heat a large pot with cooking spray over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion and garlic (if using) until tender.
Add the carrots and vegetable stock, and season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, cayenne and garlic powder/granules (if using). Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until vegetables are tender.
In a blender or food processor, or with an immersion blender, puree the soup mixture until smooth. Return to the pot, heat through until hot. Remove from heat and immediately stir in the heavy cream. Serve warm with a dash of nutmeg or garnish with crumbled Gorgonzola.
