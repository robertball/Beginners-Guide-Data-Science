Ingredients:
Sandwich:
4 slices Farmland® Sliced Ham, warmed
8 slices Farmland® Thick Cut Bacon, cooked
4 waffles
4 (8 ounce) lean ground beef patties, cooked
4 (8 ounce) burgers, cooked
Beer, Sausage, Cheese Sauce (recipe to follow)
4 sunny side up eggs
Smoked paprika, for garnish
Beer, Sausage, Cheese Sauce:
1 pound Farmland® Original Pork Sausage
4 cups Cheddar cheese, shredded (tossed in cornstarch just until lightly coated)
1 tablespoon dry mustard
Crushed dried red pepper flakes, to taste
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 tablespoons butter
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Warm waffles in oven.
To serve, lay one waffle on each plate. Top with burger, sliced ham, 2 slices thick cut bacon, cheese sauce and egg. Sprinkle with smoked paprika.
To make Beer, Sausage, Cheese Sauce, cook breakfast sausage and garlic in pot.
When cooked through, add butter, mustard, red pepper flakes and cheese. Stir until melted.
Once mixed together, add Worcestershire sauce. Let cook for 5 minutes (make sure to keep stirring, so cheese does not stick to bottom of pan). Add some more heavy cream if sauce is too thick.  Set aside.
