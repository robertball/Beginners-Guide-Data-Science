Ingredients:
1 C butter, softened
3 1/4 C flour
2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp cinnamon
2 tsp ground ginger
1 1/2 tsp ground cloves
1 tsp ground nutmeg
1 tsp allspice
1 to 2 tsp cayenne pepper
3/4 C granulated sugar
3/4 C brown sugar
1 egg
2 TBSP maple syrup
1 TBSP water

Directions:
In a medium bowl, sift the dry ingredients together
In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugars together, then and egg, maple syrup, and water. Beat until fluffy.
Mix in dry ingredients about 1/2 C at a time slowly, so the dough doesn't get too stiff
Remove from the bowl and form a big ball. Separate into quarters and refrigerate covered, for 2 to 6 hours
When you're ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350
Working with 1/4 of dough at a time, roll out the dough (between plastic, or on floured surface) until it is about 1/8in thick. Use your favorite cookie cutter to cut out shapes and place them on parchment-lined cookie sheets
Bake for 7-10 minutes, but watch the first batch carefully. Cookies should be toasted and golden but not too dark
