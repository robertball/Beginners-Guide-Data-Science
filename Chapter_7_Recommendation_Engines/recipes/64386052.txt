Ingredients:
8 or 10 chicken thighs (skinned and extra fat removed)
2 large or three medium onions
4 to 8 cloves garlic (mashed or minced into small pieces)
2 cups dry white wine
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 small cans tomato sauce
1 juice of a lemon
1 dash of tabasco sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
1 pinch of cinnamon

Directions:
Use a Dutch oven (or large pot).
Dice onions to about 1/2 inch squares.
Mince or crush garlic.
Spray the interior with PAM (to help with cleanup).
Cover the bottom with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil heat over medium heat.
Simmer onions and garlic until the onions are sweating.  Remove from pot and set aside.
Again, cover the bottom of the pot with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil.
Add the chicken and simmer for 5 minutes (turning a few times).
Add 2 cups of wine and simmer (covered) for 15 minutes.
Return the onions and garlic to the pot and add remaining ingredients.
Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer (covered) for 1 hour.

Description: 
I'm not sure how Greek this is.  However, my father made this, his parents came from Cephalonia and he called it Greek stew.
As with many such recipes, the leftovers are even better a day or two later.
