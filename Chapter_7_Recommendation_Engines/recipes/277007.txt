Ingredients:
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling
1 (18.25 ounce) package dark chocolate cake mix
2 eggs
1 teaspoon almond extract (optional)
1 (15.75 ounce) can prepared chocolate frosting

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place cherry pie filling, cake mix, eggs, and almond extract in a large bowl and mix by hand. Pour into a greased and floured 9-inch square pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.
Cool cake on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely, at least 30 minutes. Frost with chocolate frosting.
