Ingredients:
3/4 Cup organic plain soy milk
2 Tablespoons white vinegar
1 Cup buckwheat flour
2 Tablespoons white sugar
1 Teaspoon baking soda
1 Teaspoon baking powder
1 Teaspoon milled flax seed (optional)
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 Egg whites (whisked until foamy)
2 Tablespoons healthy butter substitute, melted (I use Earth Balance)
Pam cooking spray

Directions:
In medium bowl, combine soy milk and vinegar.  Allow to sour for 5-7 minutes.
In another bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, milled flax seed, and salt.
Add whisked egg whites to soured milk.  Slowly stir the melted butter substitute into the soured milk mixture.
Combine the dry and wet ingredients, folding gently  just until incorporated (do not overmix).
Heat a griddle to 375 degrees.  Spray griddle with Pam cooking spray.  Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle and cook until pancakes are lightly browned on bottom.  Flip and cook until done.
