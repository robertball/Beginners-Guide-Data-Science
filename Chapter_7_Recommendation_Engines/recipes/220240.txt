Ingredients:
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
2/3 cup thin-sliced green onion
2 tablespoons minced prosciutto (optional)
1/2 cup diced celery
1 pound large scallops, quartered
2 pints oysters with liquid
1 cup frozen corn, thawed
1/3 cup peeled, seeded, and diced tomato
1 cup half-and-half
1 teaspoon minced jalapeno pepper
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat.
Stir in the green onion, celery, and prosciutto; cover the pot and cook the mixture, stirring once, for 2 minutes.
Increase heat to medium-high. Stir the scallops and oysters with liquid into the green onion mixture; cook uncovered, stirring frequently, until the scallops are cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Stir the corn, tomato, half-and-half, jalapeno pepper, sesame oil, and cilantro into the oyster mixture.
Remove the pot from heat, cover, and allow the stew to sit until uniformly heated, about 10 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper to serve.
