Ingredients:
½ head cabbage, cut into thick shreds
½ cup soy sauce
¼ cup butter
freshly ground pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.
Evenly divide the cabbage among 4 squares of aluminum foil. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of soy sauce over each pile of cabbage, and place a tablespoon of butter on top. Season with pepper to taste, and fold the sides of the foil over the cabbage, sealing to form a packet.
Place packets onto preheated grill, and cook until the cabbage is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
