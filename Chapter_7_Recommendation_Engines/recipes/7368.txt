Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter
3/4 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1 cup cake flour
2 tablespoons dry milk powder
1 tablespoon corn syrup
1/2 lemon, juiced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon ground mace (optional)

Directions:
Allow butter to reach room temperature. Cream sugar and butter together until light and fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time and mix well.  Add in flour, powdered milk, and corn syrup.  Beat each in well.  Add juice of half a lemon, salt, vanilla, nutmeg and mace.  Make sure everything is well blended, and pour into a greased loaf pan.
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 45 minutes, checking for doneness by inserting a toothpick and seeing if it comes out clean.  You almost want to underbake this.
