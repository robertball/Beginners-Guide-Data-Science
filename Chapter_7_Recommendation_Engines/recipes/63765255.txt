Ingredients:
1 large spaghetti squash
2 boneless/skinless chicken breasts
1/2 small broccoli stalk
1 pint of pastured heavy cream
1.5 C of grated Parmesan or Romano cheese
1/3C real butter
1 tbs garlic powder or fresh chopped garlic
pinch of salt and pepper
1 tsp olive oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven for 375.
Take your spaghetti squash, carefully slice down the middle (length wise) remove center seeds
Rub a little olive oil, salt and pepper on the rim and inside of your spaghetti squash and place on in a serving dish and bake in the oven for 1 hour.
While your squash is cooking (and has about 30 minutes left) its time to start making the sauce: . Melt the butter in your sauce pan, once butter is melted add the cream and stir til cream is heated. Add your Parmesan or Romano cheese and garlic and on medium/low heat stir and then cover til it thickens some. be careful not to allow the Alfredo to stick/burn. Once your sauce is thickening take your broccoli and chop into small florets and toss in the sauce, you don't need to cook them to death. just enough to warm them up and to leave a slight crunch!
While that is cooking on another eye, cook/brown your chicken breast until juices run clear then dice up and set to the side.
Grab your Spag Squash from the oven and fill the inside with your diced chicken, pour the Alfredo on top and ENJOY
