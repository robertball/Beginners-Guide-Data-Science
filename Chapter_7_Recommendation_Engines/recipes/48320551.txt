Ingredients:
2 cups brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Butter an 8x8 inch square dish.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine brown sugar, white sugar, cream, corn syrup and salt.  Stir until sugar is dissolved.  Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.  Remove from heat and let cool without stirring until bottom of pan is lukewarm.  Pour in vanilla and beat until creamy.  Stir in nuts.
1. Cook to no more than 234 degrees - if if cooks at higher temperatures, it will be very stiff and somewhat grainy.
2. It is very important to let the fudge cool in the pan to no more than 120 degrees, 110 is better. Just leave the candy thermometer in to check this. This cooling process takes at least an hour, so allow extra time.
3. For an even smoother fudge, add 2-4 Tbs of cream as you are beating the fudge. This will make the fudge easier to slice.
4. Beat for at least 3 minutes with a good quality hand mixer. It will not look like it has set up when you put it in the pan, but put the pan in the fridge and a few hours later, it will be set.
Let cool completely before cutting into squares.
