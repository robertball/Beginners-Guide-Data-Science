salt, pepper and hot sauce to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F
Place the chicken peices on a rack in a roasting pan. Season with salt and pepper.
In a medium bowl, stir together the mayonaise, mustard, ketchup, preserves, diced onion and salt, pepper and hot sauce and stir.
Heat in the microwave on high for 30 seconds, stir again.  Pour this over the chicken pieces.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes then turn down to 350 for another 30. Chicken will be glazed and sticky.
Use pan drippings to make a WONDERFUL gravy for rice.
