Ingredients:
4 to 5 pound brisket
1 t. onion salt
1 t. celery salt
1 t. garlic salt
1 bottle liquid smoke
salt and pepper
3 T. Worcestershire
1 c. BBQ sauce (any kind)

Directions:
Place brisket in pan (I usually use a 13x9 cake type pan).  Sprinkle with seasonings (you can use more - I don't even measure, just shake them on both sides of the meat).  Put meat in fat side up.  Pour liquid smoke over the meat.  Cover tightly with foil; marinate overnight in refrigerator.  Before roasting, sprinkle with salt and paper and Worcestershire.  Cover tightly with heavy duty foil and bake in 275 degree oven for 5 hours.  One half hour before end of baking time, remove foil and pour BBQ sauce over meat.  Cool, slice thin, against grain of meat.  If you don't serve right away, can reheat with a little more sauce.

Description: 
Awesome BBQ Brisket from my Stepmom - can be made in oven or in crockpot.  Marinating overnight is good - but not necessary
