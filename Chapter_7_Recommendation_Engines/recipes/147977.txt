Ingredients:
1 Reynolds® Handi-Vac™ Vacuum Sealer
1 Reynolds® Handi-Vac™ Vacuum Freezer Bag, Gallon Size
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon Greek seasoning
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (12 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained
1 large fresh tomato, cut into 1-inch cubes
1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives, drained and halved
1/2 cup feta cheese (optional)

Directions:
Place chicken in an even layer in Reynolds Handi-Vac Vacuum Freezer Bag.  Mix seasoning and olive oil in a small bowl.  Pour mixture over chicken; squeeze freezer bag to coat both sides of chicken.  Arrange chicken in an even layer with food touching the textured layer inside the bag. Seal bag.
Vacuum bag with Vacuum Sealer until bag tightens around chicken.  Freeze immediately.  When ready to cook, defrost completely in refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Line a 13x9x2-inch pan with Reynolds Wrap(R) Release(R) Non-Stick Foil with non-stick (dull) side toward food.
Place defrosted chicken in foil-lined pan.  Top with artichokes hearts, tomato and olives.
Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until chicken is done. If desired, top with feta cheese before serving.
