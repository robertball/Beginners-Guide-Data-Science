Ingredients:
2 cups creamy peanut butter
3/4 cup butter
3 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
3 cups crispy rice cereal
1 (12 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons shortening

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine peanut butter and butter.  Stir in confectioners' sugar and crisp rice cereal until a dough is formed.  Place this mixture in the refrigerator for about an hour to allow it to cool until it is easier to work with. Shape mixture into egg shapes and freeze for 20 minutes.
Melt chocolate chips and shortening in a double boiler over low heat.  When melted, dip egg shapes in chocolate. Place on waxed paper and allow to cool.
