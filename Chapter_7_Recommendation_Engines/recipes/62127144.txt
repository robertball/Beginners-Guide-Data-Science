3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tbsp. olive oil

Broil the sausage on low heat until the outside is crispy and the inside is no longer pink.
Meanwhile, boil the pasta for 10 minutes. Add frozen spinach, bring back to a boil, and let boil for 2 more minutes.  Drain the pasta and spinach.
When the sausage is fully cooked, remove it from the oven and cut into bite-size slices.
