Description: 
I work in a corporate office, and our cafe has a 'wrap station' every Friday and these are a huge hit with everyone. I got hooked so I watched closely and finally made my own version at home; they are so delicious! If desired, place wrap in a panini maker for 1 to 2 minutes, or until wrap has grill marks and cheese is slightly melted.
