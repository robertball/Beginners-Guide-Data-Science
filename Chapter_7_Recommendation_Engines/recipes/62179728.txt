Description: 
This is a rich, sweet & savory breakfast, or brunch dish. The tangy sweetness of the peaches compliment the creamy textures offered by the cream cheese and eggs. Using a fullbodied and eggy bread like  Brioche would add even more flavor to this meal. But anything nice and thick is recommended.
