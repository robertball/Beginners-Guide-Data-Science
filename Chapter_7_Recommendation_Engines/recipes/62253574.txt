Ingredients:
1 cup Egg Beaters
2 T. canola oil
1 t. vanilla
1 t. orange extract
3/4 cup sugar
3 cups flour
3/4 t. baking soda
1 t. cinnamon
1/2 t. salt
1/2 cup slivered almonds or chopped pecans
1/2 to 1 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix the first 5 ingredients with a mixer until smooth and creamy.
Sift together the next 4 ingredients in a seperate bowl and add slowly to the mixer bowl while beating.  Dough will be very stiff.
Turn off mixer and fold in the nuts and cranberries.
Spray a large baking sheet with cooking spray and shape the dough into a log using well wetted hands to shape into a log about 15 inches long by 3 inches wide and about 1 inch tall.  Using the wet hands smooth the top and sides into a long rectangle.
Bake for 30 minutes at 350 and then remove from oven and place the loaf on a cooling rack for 10 minutes.  In the meantime, reduce the oven to 325.
After 10 minute rest, move the loaf to a cutting board and cut into 1/2 to 1 inch slices and place on the same baking sheet, cut side down.
Bake for 10 minutes, remove from oven and turn each piece and bake for 11 more minutes.
Remove from oven and cool on cooling rack.  Store in an airtight container.
