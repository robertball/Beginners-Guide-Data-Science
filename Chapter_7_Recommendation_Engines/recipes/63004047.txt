Ingredients:
2 cups leftover stuffing (packed)
1 egg
1 Tbs. spices (rosemary, thyme, sage: I used Pampered Chef blend)
Kosher salt (to taste)

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees.
Mix all ingredients.
Grease 9x15 pyrex with cooking spray.
Scoop balls of stuffing (walnut size; I used Pampered Chef cookie scoop).
Bake 10 minutes. Flip. Bake 5 more minutes. (You want them to be lightly golden-brown and slightly crispy on the outside).
Serve in Turkey soup.

Description: 
Great way to use up leftover stuffing, especially if you make soup with your turkey carcass. Our stuffing was made with Canyon Bakehouse Gluten Free Rosemary Thyme Foccacia bread, but you could use any leftover stuffing.
