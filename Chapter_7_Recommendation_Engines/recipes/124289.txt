Ingredients:
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup soy sauce
4 garlic cloves, minced
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 cups shredded red cabbage
Sliced green onion tops

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the first eight ingredients; cook and stir over medium-high heat for 5 minutes or until smooth. Reserve half of sauce. Slice chicken lengthwise into 1-in. strips; thread onto skewers (if using bamboo skewers, soak them in water for at least 20 minutes). Grill, uncovered, over medium-hot heat for 2 minutes; turn and brush with peanut butter sauce. Continue turning and basting for 4-6 minutes or until chicken juices run clear. Place cabbage on a serving plate; top with chicken. Sprinkle with onion tops. Serve with reserved sauce.
