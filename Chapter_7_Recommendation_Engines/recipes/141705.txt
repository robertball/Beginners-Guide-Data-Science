Ingredients:
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 pounds boneless pork, cut into 1 inch cubes
1 tablespoon bacon drippings, or vegetable oil
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 (4 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and black pepper to taste
3 cups water

Directions:
Place 3 tablespoons flour in a plastic bag. Add pork and shake to lightly coat with flour. Set aside.
Heat bacon drippings and vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium high heat. Add pork and cook until meat is evenly browned, about 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon flour, and cook 3 minutes. Stir in the onion, tomato sauce, chile powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium low and simmer until pork is just falling apart, about 1-1/2 to 2 hours.

Description: 
This is a rich, mild chili and pork stew. It is one of my favorite things, which I like to eat from a bowl with plenty of saltine crackers and a salad on the side. It's also good served over rice or chili beans.
