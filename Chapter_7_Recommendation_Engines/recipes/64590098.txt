Ingredients:
1 head of cauliflower,  cut into small florets and stem removed
1 large egg
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1 tsp Italian herb seasoning
2 thick slices of white cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450F. Place cauliflower into food processor and pulse until crumbs about half the size of a grain of rice.
Place cauliflower into large microwave safe bowl and microwave for 2 minutes. Cauliflower should be soft and tender (and hot!), stir. Place back into the microwave and cook for another 3 minutes. Remove and stir again so that all the cauliflower cooks evenly. Place back into microwave and cook for 5 minutes.
At this point, you should see the cauliflower is starting to become more dry. Microwave for another 5 minutes. Cauliflower should still be slightly moist to the touch, but should look dry and clumped up.
Add in egg, parmesan and seasoning. Stir to combine until smooth paste forms.
Divide dough into 8 equal parts. Place onto large baking sheet lined with parchment paper or silpat mat.
Using your knuckles and fingers, shape into square bread slices about 1/2 inch thick. Bake cauliflower bread for about 15-18 minutes or until golden brown.
Remove from oven and let cool a few minutes.
Using a good spatula, carefully slide cauliflower bread off of parchment paper.
Place a slice of cheese on 4 of your cauliflower bites, top carefully with the other 4.
Place sandwiches into toaster oven and broil for several minutes (5-10) until cheese is completely melted and bread is toasty. If you don't own a toaster oven, you can also do this in the oven.
