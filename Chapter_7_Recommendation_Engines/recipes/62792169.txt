Ingredients:
1 medium onion, diced
2 T butter
3 large bone in chicken breasts with skin
32 ounces canned chicken broth
Water
10.75 oz cream of chicken soup
2 cups water
1/2 tsp salt or to taste
1/4 tsp black pepper or to taste
3 cups flour
3 tsp baking powder
1 1/2 tsp salt
1/3 c plus 2 T  cold shortening
3/4 c milk

Directions:
Melt butter in large stock pot.  Add onion and cook until translucent.
Add chicken breasts, breast side down, broth and just enough water to cover the chicken.  Boil for about 1 hour until chicken begins to fall off the bone.
Remove chicken including bones from pot.  Remove chicken from bone in large chunks.  Discard bone and skin.  Pour in cream of chicken soup, 2 cups water, salt and pepper into broth.  Add chicken back to stock and bring to a boil.
Combine flour, salt and baking powder.  Add margarine and cut in or use fingers to make flour mixture resemble course cornmeal.  Make a well in the middle and add milk.  Stir to combine to make a stiff dough.  On a floured surface knead dough until all is combined.  Roll dough out to 1/8" and cut into squares using a pizza cutter.
Add dumplings to the boiling stock one at a time to keep them from sticking together.  Cover tightly with lid and boil gently for 10 minutes.
Serve immediately.
