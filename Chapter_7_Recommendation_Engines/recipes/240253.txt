Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, minced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 pounds Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
1/2 cup crumbled cooked bacon
2 tablespoons powdered chicken bouillon
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup Chardonnay wine

Directions:
Melt butter with olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in butter mixture until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes; add Brussels sprouts and saute until slightly browned on edges, 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle bacon, chicken bouillon, red pepper flakes, and black pepper over the sprouts mixture; stir and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Pour wine over the sprouts mixture, reduce heat to low, place a lid on the pot, and simmer until the sprouts are desired tenderness, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great side dish to serve with any grilled meat item or other vegetable dishes. I get many requests for this when catering. People who normally don't like Brussels sprouts love these!
