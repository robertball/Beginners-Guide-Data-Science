Ingredients:
SOUP:
1 turkey carcass  (I leave quite a bit of meat on it.)
6 quarts water
3 cups chopped celery
10 carrots
2 onions, quartered
4 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
2 cubes chicken bouillon
2 bay leaves
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
DUMPLINGS:
2 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 egg, well beaten
2 tablespoons melted butter
2/3 c. milk

Directions:
Combine turkey carcass, water, 2 cups celery, 4 carrots, onions, 4 teaspoons salt, thyme, bouillon, and bay leaves in large stockpot.  Bring to boiling.  Lower heat, and cover.  Simmer for 1 1/2 hours.
Strain stock, and discard solids.  Skim off fat using ladle or fat separator.  Pick meat off bones when cooled.  Reserve meat.
Combine ingredients for dumplings, set aside.
Combine 3/4 cup tablespoons flour and 1 cup milk in a jar with a tight fitting lid.  Shake to combine.
Pour stock into pot.  Bring to simmering.  Strain flour mixture through sieve into stock, stirring.
Slice remaining 6 carrots.  Add ground pepper, remaining cup of celery, and sliced carrots.  Return to simmering.
Add dumpling mixture to pot by teaspoons until all mixture is added.  Cover and simmer 18-20 min, or until dumplings are done.
