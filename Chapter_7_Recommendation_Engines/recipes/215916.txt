Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into cubes
2 bay leaves
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon caraway seeds
1 cup chopped red onion
1 large clove garlic, minced
1 stalk celery, sliced
4 potatoes, cut into cubes
4 carrots, sliced 1/4-inch thick
2 parsnips, sliced 1/4-inch thick
3 Macintosh apples - peeled, cored and chopped
3 cups chicken stock, or more if needed
2 cups apple cider
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook the chicken in the hot oil until it has begun to brown. Add the bay leaves, salt, thyme, black pepper, caraway seeds, red onion, garlic, celery, potatoes, carrots, parsnips, apples, chicken stock, apple cider, and cider vinegar to the pot. There should be enough liquid to just cover the vegetables. If not, add more chicken stock to cover the vegetables.
Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are tender, about 30 minutes. Remove the bay leaves and garnish with the parsley to serve.
