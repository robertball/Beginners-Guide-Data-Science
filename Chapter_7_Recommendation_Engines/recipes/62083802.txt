Ingredients:
1 (12 0z) can whole tomatoes, 1-2 jalepenos, 1-2 limes, 3 roma(or any) fresh tomatoes, 2t oregano, 2t salt, 1 red onion, 1 bunch cilantro, 1 can chopped green chiles (if desired)1-2 cloves garlic

Directions:
Roast jalepenos til skin is blackened. (roast over gas flame on stove or on indoor grill or using oven broiler.)  Put garlic in blender and pulse til chopped.  Add jalepenos (whole, in their entirety) to blender and throw in the can of tomatoes, undrained.  Pulse a few times, then pour into a bowl.  Add chopped onion, cilantro (canned chiles if desired) and tomatoes.  Season with salt and oregano, and squeeze fresh lime juice over all.  Your salsa should be a nice mix of chunky and smooth, and all the veggies, with the tomatoes dominating the mix.  Feel free to add more canned or fresh tomatoes, as desired to even out the mixture.  Stir well and let flavors meld as long as you can wait!
