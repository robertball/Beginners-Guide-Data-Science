Description: 
I can't really take credit for this drink -- a bartender in New York created it, on a whim, based on my request for something different. So I guess you could say I inspired it. I've asked for it at many places and no one has heard of it, and I have to describe it each time, much to my dismay. It is a great drink and one that packs a punch, so be careful!
