Ingredients:
1/2 lb ground beef (I use the 80%/20%)
1/2 cup Onion
1/4 cup Pimento
1/2 cup Black Olives
8 ozs Tomato Sauce
Salt & Pepper to taste
8 Ozs Grated Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese
1/2 tblsp Chili powder
8 ozs Mushrooms (Optional)

Directions:
Brown, drain, and cool the ground beef.  Chop the Olives, Onion, Pimento & Mushrooms.  Mix all ingredients in a bowl.
Use a fork to place on the rolls, making sure the rolls are covered to the edges with about 1/2" thick in the center.  Bake in a 400 degree oven until the edges start to bubble.  Switch to Broil and continue baking until hot in the center.

Description: 
This is a delicious filling that is put onto hamburger (or hot dog) rolls and baked in the oven.  Fantastic for a cold weekend day when the kids need a good lunch.

This recipe came from my mother.  It has been one of my favorite recipes for over 30 years.
