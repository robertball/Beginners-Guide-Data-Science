Ingredients:
1 9 inch deep pie crust
4 eggs
1 1/2 cups half and half
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1 onion, chopped -or- 1 cup of frozen chopped onion
1/2 cup bacon pieces
3/4 tsp salt
1 tsp black ground pepper
1 tsp dry ground mustard
1 tbsp butter, to saute onions

Directions:
1. Thaw pie crust if frozen. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Prick crust randomly with fork to prevent bubbling and cracking, bake for 10 minutes. Let rest for at least 5 minutes before filling. After removing pie crust, reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.
Meanwhile:
2. Saute onions in butter until tender.
3. Beat eggs, add remaining ingredients (excluding butter) and onions, mix well.
4. Pour into pre-baked pie shell, bake for 60 minutes at 350 degres or until done.

Description: 
This is my family's favorite quiche recipe that I have developed over the years. If you care to add a vegetable (spinach, broccoli, etc.) reduce cheese by 1/2 cup so as to not overflow your pie crust. Ham and swiss can be easily interchanged for the bacon and cheddar. Adjust seasonings to your taste. I hope that you will enjoy this recipe as much as we do and take it and personalize it to suit your taste.
