Ingredients:
1 1/4 Cup water.  100 - 110 degrees
2 teas. sugar
1 1/2 tsp active dry yeast
3 1/2 cups Bread Flour
1 T Kosher Salt or 1 1/2 tsp regular salt
2 T Olive Oil

Directions:
In the bowl of your mixer add the warm water, sugar and yeast.  Let sit to proof about 5-10 minutes.  The yeast will start to grow and get foamy.
Add 2 cups of flour and mix on low until the flour is incorporated.
Add the salt and continue to mix adding another cup of flour.
Add the olive oil and mix on medium speed for 2 - 3 minutes.  Measure the last 1/2 cup of flour.  Turn the mixer to low and add a little more flour.  Return to speed 2.  The dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl and cling to the dough hook. If it isn't pulling away from the sides of the bowl add a bit more flour.
Stop mixer scrape dough off hook.  Resume mixing at speed 2 for about 6 - 8 minutes.  The dough should be smooth and silky but still a bit sticky.
Spray a glass or stainless steel bowl with cooking spray.  Turn the dough into the greased bowl.  Turn the dough and using your hands shape into a ball.  Let rise in a warm, draft free place until doubled in size.
Once double, dump the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and let rest 10 mins.
If making two loaves, cut the dough in half and stretch the dough into a rectangle and roll up like a jelly roll.  Tuck the ends under and place on a parchment lined baking sheet.  Using a sharp knife and a smooth one stroke cut, score the top of the bread about 1/4 - 1/2" deep.
Pre heat oven to 375.
Cover the loaves with plastic wrap that has been sprayed with cooking spray.  Let rise until doubled in size.
Loaves may be brushed with an egg wash if desired.
Once loaves are risen to double place baking sheet in preheated oven and throw a couple of ice cubes in the bottom of the oven to create some steam.  This will develop a good crust.
