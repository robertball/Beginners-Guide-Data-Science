Description: 
This recipe came from Telora, my Mom's friend and fellow teacher.  She has no idea why these are called Hawaiian beans (not a pineapple chunk in sight!), but they sure are good - she even won her category at their school's Chili Cook-off! These are unique and extremely quick & easy. They're hearty enough to be served as a main dish (like chili) but sweet like baked beans (for a side dish).  They even freeze well - good thing, since this makes a LOT of beans.  Enjoy!
