Ingredients:
14 green bell peppers
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup fresh lemon juice
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Seed peppers and cut into strips. Place peppers in a large baking pan. Add garlic cloves. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and half of the lemon juice. Toss slightly to distribute the seasonings.
Broil on the top rack (closest to the heat source) stirring occasionally until all peppers are soft and some are slightly charred, about 20 min. Place peppers and any accumulated liquid into a bowl or container. Add remaining lemon juice and toss well.
Serve this salad warm or after it has been refrigerated for at least a few hours. Toss before serving.
