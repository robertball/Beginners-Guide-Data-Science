Ingredients:
1 whole chicken
1 medium onion, chopped
4 stalks celery, chopped
5 medium carrots, chopped
2-3 c. cabbage, chopped
2 cloves minced garlic
1 T. dried thyme leaves

Directions:
Fill a large pot with 4 quarts of water. Add whole chicken after removing bag-o-giblets. Boil for approximately 45 minutes, or until chicken starts coming apart when poked with a fork.  Remove pot from stove. Remove chicken from pot. Allow both the broth and the chicken to cool in the refrigerator, (or freezer), until chicken is cool enough to handle, usually less than an hour.
Meanwhile…
Chop your onion, carrots, and celery.  When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove from the refrigerator and tear all the meat off the bones. Then skim the excess fat off the top of the cooled liquid.
With that done, add the last 2 quarts of water, the chicken meat, vegetables, garlic, wine, butter, pepper, bullion and herbs to the stock and cook for 30 minutes or until the vegetables have softened.
Enjoy with freshly baked bisquits.
