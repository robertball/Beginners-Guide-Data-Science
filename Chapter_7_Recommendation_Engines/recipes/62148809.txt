Ingredients:
Favorite pizza dough recipe
Favorite Marinara  Sauce
1 small can pitted black olives, drained
1 cup fresh mushrooms
Fresh basil leaves
1 package Wilson's Pepperoni
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 stick melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400
Roll out dough into a rectangle
In a food processor, puree olives, mushrooms and basil
Spread puree over half the surface of dough
Add a layer of pepperoni, followed by a layer of cheese
Fold the other half of the dough over to cover cheese
With a pizza cutter, cut into 1 inch strips
Hold strips by the end and quickly twist them, placing them on a pizza stone (you may need to pinch the ends to keep them from untwisting
Bake in preheated oven for 10-12 minutes
Mix together minced garlic and melted butter
Baste the twists with garlic butter and bake for another 2 minutes
On busy days I wrap these in foil squares when they come out of the oven and put them back in the oven to stay warm until the kids come home from school.  If we are staying home to eat, they can dip their twists into marinara sauce or they can just eat them as they are in the car.  By using the food processor, you can hide all kinds of veggies in these and they never know they are there.
Great meal for soccer practice night - enjoy!
