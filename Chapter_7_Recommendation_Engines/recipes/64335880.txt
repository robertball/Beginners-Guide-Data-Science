Ingredients:
7-3/8 oz. (1-3/4 cups plus 2 Tbs.) confectioners’ sugar
4-3/8 oz. (1-1/4 cups plus 2 Tbs.) almond flour
4 large egg whites, at room temperature
1/4 cup granulated sugar
Macaron filling of your choice: Lemon Curd, Vanilla Buttercream, and/or Chocolate Ganache

Directions:
Make the Batter
1. Line 3 completely flat baking sheets with parchment.
2. Whisk the confectioners’ sugar and almond flour into a large bowl
3. In a clean stand mixer fitted with the  whisk attachment, whip the egg  whites on medium speed until foamy and the wires of the beater(s) leave a  trail, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1 Tbs. of the granulated sugar and continue to whip for another 30 to 45 seconds. Repeat 3 times with the remaining granulated sugar. Once all of the sugar is mixed in, continue whipping the whites until they turn glossy and stiff (when you lift the beater(s) from the bowl, the whites should hold a straight peak that doesn’t curl at the tip, 4 to 8 minutes more.
4. With a large rubber spatula, fold in half of the confectioners’ sugar mixture. Once most of it has been incorporated, fold in the remaining  mixture until just combined.
Pipe the Cookies
1. Pipe the batter onto the prepared sheets in rounds that are about 1  inch in diameter and 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.  Use circle end (half in)
2. Let rest until the meringues no longer feel tacky, 20 to 30 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, position racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and heat the oven to 325°F.
Bake the Cookies
1. Put cookie sheets in the oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 300°F
2. Bake, rotating the sheets and swapping their positions after 8 minutes, until the meringues are very pale golden, 15 to 20 minutes total.
3. Cool completely on  the baking sheets on racks. Meanwhile, return the oven temperature to 325°F  bake next sheet.
4. Remove the meringues from the parchment and pair them by size
Filling:
1. Make filling and pipe into cookies.  Use same end and pipe into small mounds.  Mounds will flatten when assembling cookies.
