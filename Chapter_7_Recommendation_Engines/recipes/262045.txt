Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package Korean sweet potato noodles (dangmyun)
5 teaspoons sesame oil, divided
1/4 cup soy sauce
4 teaspoons white sugar
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 carrots, cut into matchsticks
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 cup shiitake mushrooms, sliced
6 green onions, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (16 ounce) bag fresh spinach
1 tablespoon sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
Toss noodles with 2 teaspoons sesame oil. Cut into shorter pieces using kitchen shears.
Combine soy sauce and sugar in a bowl.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute carrots and onion until soft, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms, green onions, and garlic. Saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the noodles, soy sauce mixture, and spinach. Cook and stir until noodles are heated through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from heat. Toss in remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil and sesame seeds.
