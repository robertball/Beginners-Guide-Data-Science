Ingredients:
1 egg
1 tablespoon coconut butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup white sugar
1/3 cup gluten-free all purpose baking flour
1/3 cup trail mix
2 tablespoons tapioca starch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch ground ginger, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch ground cloves, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil and lightly oil the paper.
Whisk egg, coconut butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; add sugar and whisk until light and fluffy. Stir flour, trail mix, tapioca starch, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves into egg mixture until evenly-mixed. Drop dough by the teaspoonful 2-inches apart onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned around the edges, 7 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet until crisped, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe was born out of necessity to use up the leftover nuts and dried fruits in my pantry. The crisp of the cookie is satisfying and goes well with a nice cup of tea at the end of a long day. I have used the end of a bag of trail mix to make them before and it worked out perfectly. Experiment and add whatever you like!
