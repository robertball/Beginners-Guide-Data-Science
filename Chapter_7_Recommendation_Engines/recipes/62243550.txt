Ingredients:
4 racks of Baby Back Ribs cut into 2 or 3 rib pieces
Your favorite BBQ sauce

Directions:
Place ribs in shallow baking pan (I use my broiler pan with out the top rack. Cover with WAX PAPER. Bake in preheated 500 degree oven for 20 minutes, don't open the door reduce heat to 300 degrees continue to bake another 20 minutes. remove wax paper pour on sauce,continue to bake 1 1/2 hours or longer turning & basting frequently with pan liquor. Low and slow cooking does the trick but watch so they don't burn, but have them nice an brown and alittle crisp.
