Ingredients:
1 bunch asparagus
1-2 clove garlic, chopped
3 T olive oil
fresh ground black pepper
1 t sea salt
3 T water

Directions:
Wash asparagus and trim woody ends. Chop garlic.
Heat skillet pan to high heat and add olive oil and chopped garlic. Don't over cook garlic. Cook just until garlic softens and starts to change color. Reduce heat to medium high.
Add asparagus to pan turning stems to coat. Add ground black pepper. Continue to stir frequently until asparagus starts to brighten in color and stems start to soften in shape - about 3 minutes.
Add sea salt (or regular salt if sea salt not available) and then add water to pan. Continue to stir occasionally and cook until asparagus is desired tenderness - about 3 minutes.
Serve warm.
