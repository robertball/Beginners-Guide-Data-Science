Ingredients:
1 C Non-Alkalized Cocoa Powder
1/2 C cold purified water
1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
1 C raw, organic agave nectar
3/8 tsp unprocessed stevia (make sure you use the green, unprocessed stevia, or substitue a smaller amount of the white, refined stevia)

Directions:
Mix dry ingredients in a 4 cup pyrex type measuring cup. To avoid small clumps, slowly add water to dry ingredients while stirring.  Stir until consistency is evenly wet and thick and creamy like fudge.  Add vanilla and agave nectar; mix well.
Pour the chocolate syrup mixture into a recycled agave nectar bottle or similar squeeze bottle.
When I make this recipe, I typically double or triple the amount.  In doing so, I cut back on the water and add just enough to get the dry mixture to a fudge-like consistency.
