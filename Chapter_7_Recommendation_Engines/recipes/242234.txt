Ingredients:
2 cups water
2 cups raisins
1 cup light molasses
1 cup white sugar
2/3 cup shortening
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a round tube pan or two loaf pans.
Bring water, raisins, molasses, sugar, and shortening to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat to low and simmer until raisins are plump, about 5 minutes. Allow to cool.
Whisk flour, baking soda, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Stir flour mixture into raisin mixture until well combined; pour into prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This eggless cake was developed by resourceful cooks during the war when eggs, butter, and milk were rationed. It is a traditional Christmas cake here on the East Coast of Canada. Served with a nice big hunk of Cheddar cheese and a hot cup of tea, it is a real holiday treat!
