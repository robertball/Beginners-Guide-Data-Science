Ingredients:
10 slices bread, or as needed
14 slices bacon, cut into thirds
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 (16 ounce) package cocktail sausages

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with bread slices.
Toss bacon in a bowl with brown sugar and red pepper flakes until well-coated. Wrap each cocktail sausage in bacon and place, seam-side down, onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Flip each sausage and continue baking until bacon crisps, 5 to 15 minutes more.

Description: 
No matter how many of these I make, they all get eaten. Line the baking sheet with sliced bread for perfectly crisp bacon. Use any kind of sliced bread; it will be discarded after baking.
