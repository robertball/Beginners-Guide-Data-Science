Ingredients:
6-oz.) boneless skinless chicken breast halves, pound to 1/4 inch,       if necessary
2    teaspoons butter
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2    tablespoons white wine (or use white grape juice with a splash of       vinegar - higher carb count this way)
2    tablespoons fresh lime juice
1    teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1/8    teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2    cup low sodium chicken broth
1/2    cup half and half

Directions:
In a skillet, over medium-high heat, melt butter. Season chicken with salt and pepper and saute quickly, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove chicken from the pan and keep warm.
Add wine (or juice/vinegar) and lime juice to pan; deglaze the pan using a wire whisk and working quickly. Bring it to a boil; now add the chicken broth, half and half, ginger and cayenne. LOWER heat immediately (or sauce will break) and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes. When sauce has reduced and thickened, taste it and correct the seasoning, if necessary.
Serve chicken with sauce over the top.
