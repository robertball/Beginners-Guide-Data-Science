Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
1/4 cup quick oats
1/2 cup sugar or halved with brown sugar
3 tbsp ground flax seeds
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp salt
Wet Ingredients:
1 cup mashed very ripe bananas (about 3)
1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
3 tbsp chocolate chips (optional but recommended)

Directions:
In one bowl, sift together dry ingredients. In another bowl, mix wet ingredients together. Pour wet mixture into dry mixture and mix until just combined. Pour batter into 3 well-greased mini loaves or a muffin pan, and bake at 350F for 25-30 minutes. Let sit for a couple of minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.

Description: 
This recipe makes wonderful, vegan, whole wheat muffins or mini loaves. It`s oil-free too, but it`s more dense than your typical banana bread/ muffins.
