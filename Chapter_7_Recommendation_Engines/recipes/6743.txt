Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
6 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 cups milk
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons cornmeal

Directions:
In a small saucepan, heat the milk and water until very warm.
Combine 3 cups flour, yeast, sugar, salt, and soda in a large bowl.   Add  the warm milk and water, and beat well.  Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff batter.  Spoon into two 9 x 5 inch loaf pans that have been greased and dusted with the cornmeal.  Cover, and let rise in a warm place for 45 minutes.
Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 25 minutes.  Remove from pans immediately, and let cool.
