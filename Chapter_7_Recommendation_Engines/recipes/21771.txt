1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 1/2 cups cooked crabmeat

Melt margarine in 2-quart saucepan over low heat. Cook onions in margarine, stirring occasionally, until tender. Stir in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is bubbly; remove from heat.
Gradually stir in milk and whipping cream. Heat to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil and stir 1 minute. Stir in remaining ingredients; heat through.
