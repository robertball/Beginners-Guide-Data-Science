Ingredients:
2 apples - peeled, cored, and diced
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, divided
1 teaspoon salt
4 eggs
1/2 cup half-and-half
4 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
3 stale cinnamon bagels, cubed
1/4 cup chopped pecans, or more to taste (optional)

Directions:
Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
Place apples, butter, brown sugar, 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon, and salt into a skillet over medium heat. Saute until sugar bubbles, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
Place eggs, half-and-half, cream cheese, and remaining cinnamon into a blender and blend until smooth.
Scatter cubed bagels, cooked apples, and pecans in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Pour egg mixture on top, making sure to submerge bagel cubes. Let sit in the refrigerator 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until no liquid remains, 30 to 40 minutes. Serve hot.
