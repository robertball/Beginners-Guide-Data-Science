Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups butter
4 ounces Valrhona semisweet chocolate
1/2 cup sugar
3/4 cup flour
2 tablespoons baking cocoa
1 teaspoon baking powder
3 eggs
1 egg yok
6 wrapped caramels, cut into halves
Jar  Hot Fudge Sauce
Jar  Caramel Sauce

Directions:
Heat the butter in a saucepan until melted and bubbly.  Remove from the heat.  Add the chocolate and sugar.  Let stand for 5 minutes.  Pour into a mixing bowl.  Beat until smooth.
Combine the flour, baking cocoa and baking powder in a bowl and mix well.  Add to the chocolate mixture gradually, beating well after each addition.  Beat in the eggs one at a time.  Beat in egg yok.  Beat at high speed for 10 minutes.  Preheat the over to 350 degrees.  Fill ramekins coated with nonstick cooking spray halfway with the batter.  Place 2 caramel halves in the center of each and spoon the batter over to cover.  Place ramekins on a baking sheet.  Bake for 16 to 18 minutes or until set on the outer edge but liquid in the center.  Loosen the sides with a knife.  Drizzle the serving plates with the sauces.  Invert the cakes onto serving plates.
