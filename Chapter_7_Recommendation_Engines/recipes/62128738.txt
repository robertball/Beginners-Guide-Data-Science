Description: 
This drink is created for those who enjoy a Long Island Iced Tea, but would still like to recognize their friends and family after consuming it. It tastes great, and it'll still get you loopy...just not quite as quickly as the original. Hubby used to tend bar, and he helped get the mix just right. Sip this one, as it's still pretty potent.
