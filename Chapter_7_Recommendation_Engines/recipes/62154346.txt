2 tart apple, thinly sliced
1 onion, sliced
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
In heavy skillet, heat half of the oil over medium-high heat, and cook apples, onion and thyme for about 4 minutes or just until tender-crisp. Remove to bowl and set aside.
Heat remaining oil in skillet, cook chicken, turning once for 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown. Reduce heat to medium low.
Set 1 tablespoon apple juice aside, pour remaining apple in skillet along with vinegar. Cover and simmer 6-8 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink inside.
With slotted spoon, remove chicken to platter; keep warm.
Combine cornstarch with reserved apple juice; stir into skillet and cook over high heat, scraping up any browned bits for 2 minutes or until thickened. Return apple mixture to pan and heat through, season with salt and pepper. Spoon around cooked chicken.
