Description: 
Black beans are a staple in Cuban cooking, typically served with either yellow or white rice. Give them a good squeeze of fresh lime juice, garnish with some chopped cilantro (we also add some chopped onion and a drizzle of olive oil), and you're in for a treat. These beans freeze well and reheat beautifully in the microwave.
