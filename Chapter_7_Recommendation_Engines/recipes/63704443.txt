Ingredients:
1 Batch of Pizza Dough (store-bought will work)
1/2 cup Sweet Asian Chili Sauce
1 whole Zucchini, thinly sliced
2 cups Chicken, cooked and diced OR prepared shrimp
2 cups Mozzarella Cheese, shredded
1 small bottle of Thai Peanut Sauce

Directions:
Preheat the grill to medium high. You don't want it to be too hot or the crusts will burn before the cheese melts. Brush the grill to clean.
Prepare your dough to the pizza sizes you desire. (The smaller size the better!)
Oil the grill, using a rolled-up towel and tongs, then carefully add a few pieces of dough. Grill the dough until the top the bubbly and the bottom is marked, about 2 minutes. Remove dough from grill.
Lay the dough out with the cooked side UP.  Spread the asian chili sauce on the surface of the dough. Not too thick or too thin. Add the zucchini, then the chicken or shrimp. Top with the cheese.
Place the pizzas carefully on your grill (it is best to not grill directly over the flame). Grill until the cheese melts and the dough is marked from the grill.
Drizzle the peanut sauce onto the pizzas before serving.
Slice and serve.
