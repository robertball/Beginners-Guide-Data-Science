Then but a small spot of oil on your hot pan and pour the medium runny liquid onto the pan roll it around a bit quickly so it's 1/4 inch thick. Then take your flipper and push the edges closer and closer together all the way around until it is like a burger patty about 1/2-1 inch thick. Keep your pan on medium-high heat and flip when it is set, approx. 5 min, then do the other side. Make to your crispy liking!!!!!
