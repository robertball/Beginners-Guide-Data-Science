Ingredients:
4 bone-in chicken breast halves, with skin
1 medium onion, chopped
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 dash hot pepper sauce
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
Place chicken in a pressure cooker; top with onion. In a small bowl, combine flour and broth until smooth. Whisk in the tomato paste, garlic, paprika, salt, thyme and hot pepper sauce. Pour over the chicken.
Close cover securely; place pressure regulator on vent pipe.  Bring cooker to low pressure over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high; cook for 12 minutes. (Pressure regulator should maintain a slow steady rocking motion or release of steam; adjust heat if needed.)
Remove from the heat. Immediately cool according to manufacturer's directions until pressure is completely reduced. Remove chicken and keep warm. Stir sour cream into cooking juices; serve over chicken.
