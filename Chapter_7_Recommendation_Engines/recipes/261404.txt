Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons rapeseed oil
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 pound baby bok choy
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup water
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil (optional)

Directions:
Heat a wok over medium heat. Add oil and allow to get hot. Add garlic and stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add bok choy and cook for 30 seconds. Season with soy sauce, sugar, and salt and stir-fry for 1 minute.
Pour water into the wok, cover, and simmer until leaves are dark green and stems are tender, but still firm, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, drizzle with sesame oil, and season with pepper.

Description: 
I prefer to use baby bok choy for this recipe, but you can also use large bok choy. The cook time is really quick, so have all the ingredients ready before you start.
