Description: 
My fiance and I came up with this recipe one day when we were making enchiladas for dinner and wanted some homemade salsa to go with it. It's very light and refreshing! Serve it with your favorite Mexican dish or eat it with tortilla chips. It's a forgiving recipe that can be adjusted according to your personal tastes.
