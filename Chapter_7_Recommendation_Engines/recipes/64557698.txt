Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon powdered thyme or dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard powder

Directions:
Mix together. Store in an airtight container in a dry place. Enjoy! I like making a larger batch and storing it in a empty jam jar.
