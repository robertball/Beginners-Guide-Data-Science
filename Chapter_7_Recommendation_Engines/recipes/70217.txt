Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless veal medallions, pounded to 1/4 inch thickness
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/4 cup olive oil
1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded
1/2 cup sherry wine
1/2 cup butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons sherry wine
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix together the 1 cup flour, salt and white pepper in a shallow dish. Set aside. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Coat veal medallions with the flour mixture and shake off the excess. Fry for about 1 minute on each side, just to brown but not cook through.
Arrange the veal in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the top. Clean out the pan from the veal, and melt butter with 1/2 cup of sherry over low heat. In a small bowl, mix the 3 tablespoons flour with 3 tablespoons sherry, and whisk into the pan. Continue whisking over low heat until the mixture is thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour the sherry sauce over the veal and cheese.
Bake for 20 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is melted and gooey. Sauce will be runny. Soak it up with Italian bread!

Description: 
Wafer thin melt-in-your-mouth veal cutlets smothered in a decadent buttery sherry sauce.  Excellent for dinner parties.  I serve this with a salad tossed with raspberry vinaigrette and goat cheese crumbles, greens sauteed in garlic and olive oil, Italian bread, and plenty of  white wine!  Go all out - you can also serve this over angel hair pasta.
