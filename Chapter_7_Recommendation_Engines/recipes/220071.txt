Ingredients:
2 (19 ounce) packages JohnsonvilleÂ® Mild Italian Sausages
2 cups dried cannellini beans, sorted and rinsed
7 cups water
10 fresh sage leaves, divided
1 medium Roma tomato, cored and cut in half
1/4 cup olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup finely chopped onion
2/3 cup finely chopped carrots
2/3 cup finely chopped celery
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
1/3 cup Mascarpone cheese*

Directions:
In a large bowl, pour the beans, add water to a level of 3 inches above beans and soak for 6 hours or overnight. Drain. Place beans in a soup kettle or Dutch oven; add 7 cups of water, 5 sage leaves and tomato. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 1-1/2 hours or until beans are almost tender. Drain and reserve beans; discard liquid, sage and tomato.
In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Add garlic, remaining sage, onions, carrots, celery, red pepper flakes and saute until tender. Add beans, crushed tomatoes, stock, salt and pepper. Cover, reduce heat to low, continue to cook for 15-20 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet, prepared sausages according to package directions. Drain. Cut sausage links into thirds. Just before serving, gently stir mascarpone cheese into beans. Spoon prepared beans into individual bowls and top with sausage pieces. Garnish with additional fresh sage. Serve.
