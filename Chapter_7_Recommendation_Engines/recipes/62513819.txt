Ingredients:
4 large apples
1/3 cup raisins, craisins, or dried diced dates
1/3 cup walnuts or pecans, chopped
2 teaspoons cinnamon
2 Tablespoons brown sugar
2 Tablespoons butter
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees. Core each apple and peel the top half of skin from around each. In a bowl, combine raisins, walnuts, cinnamon, and brown sugar. Stuff each apple with equal amounts of raisin mixture. Dot each with 1/2 Tablespoon butter. Place the apples in a small baking dish. Pour the water around apples and bake for 45 minutes until tender. Baste the apples every 10-15 minutes to keep the tops nice and moist. Enjoy.
