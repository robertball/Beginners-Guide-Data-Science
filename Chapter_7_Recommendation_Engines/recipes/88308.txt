Ingredients:
vegetable oil for frying
1 egg, beaten
1/3 cup milk
4 (6 ounce) fillets cod
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour for coating
2 cups quick-cooking oats
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Warm oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
In a bowl, whisk together egg and milk. Coat cod fillets with flour; shake off excess. Dip cod in egg mixture; allow excess to drip off. Coat cod with oats.
Place fish one at a time in hot oil; fry about 2 1/2 minutes, then turn over, and fry about 2 1/2 minutes more. Remove to paper towels. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Another way to enjoy your deep-fried fish. I think it is traditionally Scottish. Try it for a change. Serve warm with chips and lemon or salad.
