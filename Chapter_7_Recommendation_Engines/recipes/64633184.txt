Ingredients:
5 oz. vegan (or regular) mozzarella
1/4 c flour
1/4 c plus 1 tbsp corn starch
1/2 c water
1 tbsp cornmeal
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp garlic powder
1 c breadcrumbs (I use panko)
½ tsp salt
½ tsp parsley flakes
½ tsp black pepper
½ tsp garlic powder
¼ tsp onion powder
¼ tsp oregano
¼ tsp basil

Directions:
In a wide, shallow bowl, combine ingredients for wet mix, flour through garlic powder. The consistency should be like pancake batter, so adjust if needed.
In another wide, shallow bowl, stir together breadcrumbs and remaining spices.
Slice vegan cheese into ½” strips.
Lightly coat each stick with flour.
Dredge each stick in the wet mix, then toss in bread crumbs until fully coated.
Place sticks untouching in a single layer on a cookie sheet. Freeze for 1+ hours.
Heat up your air fryer to 400 degrees.
Place a row of sticks on the frying basket. Spray with a light coat of cooking spray.
Cook sticks for 6 minutes. Open fryer to flip the sticks with tongs. Continue cooking for 7-9 minutes or until golden brown.
Season with garlic salt and serve with marinara sauce for dipping.

Description: 
This ooey, gooey mozzarella stick is sure to impress. The best part: because it is air fried, it's healthier than its fried cousin! The recipe is for vegan mozzarella sticks, but you can substitute regular mozzarella for the same effect.
