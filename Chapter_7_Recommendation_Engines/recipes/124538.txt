Description: 
THIS RECIPE was always one of my family's favorites, and it remains so for my husband and me.    When we plan a trip by car, I make the frittata the night before, stuff it into pita bread in the morning and microwave each one for a minute or two. Then I wrap them in a towel, and down the road an hour or so, we enjoy a still-warm breakfast! -Carol Blumenberg, Lehigh Acres, Florida
