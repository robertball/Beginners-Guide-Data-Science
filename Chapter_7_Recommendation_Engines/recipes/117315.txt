Description: 
I created this lighter version of a hot spinach dip after my husband and five kids raved about a similar appetizer at one of our favorite restaurants, says Debbie Marrone of Warner Robins, Georgia. TIP: It's great with tortilla chips, bagel chips or low-fat wheat crackers, Debbie suggests.
