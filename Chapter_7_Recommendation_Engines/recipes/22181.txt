Ingredients:
7 pounds whole smoked ham
whole cloves (optional)
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1/2 teaspoon ground mustard
5 maraschino cherries (optional)
5 slices orange (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place ham, fat side up, on rack in shallow roasting pan. Insert meat thermometer so tip is in thickest part of ham and does not touch bone or rest in fat. Cover loosely and bake 1 1/4 to 2 1/4 hours or until thermometer reads 135 degrees (13 to 17 minutes per pound).
About 20 minutes before ham is done, remove from oven. Pour drippings from pan. Remove any skin from ham. Cut uniform diamond shapes on fat surface of ham. Insert clove into each diamond. Stir together brown sugar, vinegar and mustard; pat or brush on ham. Bake uncovered 20 minutes longer.
Cover ham and let stand about 10 minutes or until thermometer reads 140 degrees. Garnish with orange slices and cherries.
