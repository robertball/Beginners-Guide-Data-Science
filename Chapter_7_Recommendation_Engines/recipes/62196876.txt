Ingredients:
6 med. sweet potatoes (I like the bright orange ones)
1/2 C. Brown sugar
1/3 C. Flour
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp. nutmeg
grated orange peel
3/4 C. fresh orange juice
4 TBSP. butter

Directions:
Boil the sweet potatoes til fork tender. Drain and peel. Cut into 1/2 slices or chunks, whichever you prefer. Arrange in a greased 3 qt. casserole dish and top with orange peel. Set aside.
Combine,brown sugar, flour, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Sprinkle on top of the sweet potatoes. Pour juice over all. Top with butter. Bake @ 350 for 20-25 min. If using marshmallows, top it after baking and return to oven for about 5 minutes til lightly browned. Watch carefully as they will burn otherwise.

Description: 
An old favorite that has been kicked around for about the last 25 years. It's not Thanksgiving unless we have these. Marshmallows are optional. Most of the time we do without, but some years, depending on who requests it, they are on.
