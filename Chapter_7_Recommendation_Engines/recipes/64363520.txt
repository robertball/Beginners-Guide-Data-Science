Ingredients:
1 can (or equivalent fresh) black beans, rinsed
2 heaping T chopped garlic (I use the stuff that comes in a jar, so I used the juice too)
2 T sambal oelek (chili sauce)
3 stalks of green onion, washed and sliced thin
1/3 cup veggie broth
1 T low sodium soy sauce

Directions:
Put the first 4 ingredients in a bowl. With a wire whisk, mash the beans a bit. I like some to stay whole. Add the liquids and stir well.
