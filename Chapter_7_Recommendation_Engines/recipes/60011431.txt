Ingredients:
2-4 teaspoons crushed garlic
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (~ 1 1/2 lbs)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Warm the garlic and butter to blend the flavors. In a separate dish, combine the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Dip the chicken breasts in the garlic mixture, then into the bread crumb mixture. Place in a shallow baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run clear.
