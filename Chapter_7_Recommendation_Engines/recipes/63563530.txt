Ingredients:
SALAD
1 7" head Cauliflower, chopped into bite size pieces
1 head Broccoli Crowns (12 oz edible)chopped into bite size pieces
3 large carrots, chopped into bite size pieces
2/3 cup scallions, thinly sliced
3 celery ribs, chopped into bite size pieces
TOPPING/GARNISH
1/2 lb Grape Tomatoes (halved or quartered depending on size)
1/2 cup roasted sunflower seeds (unsalted)
2 oz cheddar cheese, shredded (about 3/4 cup)
1/2 cup Orange Flavored Cranberries, dried (Trader Joes)
1/2 lb bacon (cooked and crumbled)or 8 oz rotisserie Chicken pieces
DRESSING
1/4 cup honey (up to 1/2 cup to taste)
1 cup Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
DRESSING II (nutritional info not included)
3 tablespoon Rice/Cider Vinegar (we prefer Rice)
3 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoon honey
(we genrally quadruple this recipe as it styores nicely.)

Directions:
Mix all the veggies together except the tomatoes together.
Make the dressing by combining all dressing ingredients.
Top the salad with the garnishes of your choice and the desired dressing.
If you are planning on having this eaten in one sitting, the salad can be made all at once with dressing and all toppings. To do this add your cheese, bacon, sunflower seeds, tomatoes, and dried cranberries just before you serve the dish or no more than an hour of serving it. Since I like to eat this salad all week for lunch, I keep the toppings and dressing off until I am ready to eat. Then I build it as I desire.
