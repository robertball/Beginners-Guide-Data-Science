Ingredients:
1/4 cup nutritional yeast flakes
1/4 cup almond meal
1 pinch sea salt (optional)

Directions:
Combine nutritional yeast, almond meal, and sea salt in a blender. Using short pulses, blend the ingredients just enough to come together.

Description: 
Almonds and nutritional yeast blend together to replace aged Italian cheese for those who don't want to eat real cheese. The taste is so similar when used in pesto or on top of pasta, it is hard to tell the difference. Try on top of popcorn too. This combination is chock-full-of nutrients too!
