Ingredients:
1 C. chopped walnuts
1 1/2 C. sugar
1 1 /2 C. packed light brown sugar
3/4 C. unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
2/3 C. evaporated milk
2/3 C. pureed pumpkin
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp. ground ginger
1/4 tsp. nutmeg
1/8 tsp. cloves
1/8 tsp. allspice
2 C. white chocolate chips
1 jar (7 oz) marshmallow creme
1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread the nuts onto a baking sheet and place in preheated oven 5-7 minutes until fragrant. Shake the baking sheet halfway through baking so the nuts will toast evenly. Remove nuts from oven and set aside to cool.
Line a 13 X 9 inch baking pan with foil letting the foil extend up the two short sides of the pan and overhang slightly on both ends.
In a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, brown sugar, evaporated milk, pumpkin, butter and spice.
Bring to a full rolling boil over medium heat, stirring constantly for 10-12 minutes or until candy thermometer reaches 234 to 240 degrees F.
Quickly stir in white chocolate chips, marshmallow creme, 3/4 C. walnuts and vanilla. Stir vigorously for 1 minute or until morsels are melted. Immediately pour into prepared pan and top with remaining walnuts.
Let stand on wire rack for 2 hours or until completely cooled. Refrigerate tightly covered. To cut, lift from pan, remove foil and cut into squares.
