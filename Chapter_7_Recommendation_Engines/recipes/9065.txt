Ingredients:
2 pounds baby carrots
2 pounds Brussels sprouts, trimmed and scored
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
6 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Blanch carrots in a large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.  Transfer carrots to bowl of ice water using slotted spoon.  Return water to boil.  Add sprouts and blanch until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.  Transfer to another bowl of ice water.  Drain vegetables, and refrigerate if making ahead.
Bring stock, butter or margarine, and brown sugar to a boil in a heavy large skillet.  Stir until sugar dissolves.  Boil until reduced by half, about 7 minutes.  Can be prepared 6 hours ahead; return to boil before continuing. Add carrots.  Cook until almost tender and sauce begins to coat, shaking pan occasionally, about 6 minutes.  Add Brussels sprouts and pepper.  Cook until heated through, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes.

Description: 
The vegetables can be prepared the day before, and the glaze can be prepared up to 6 hours in advance.  The dish can then be completed in a few minutes while the turkey is resting.  It all looks so effortless. Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com.
