Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup melted butter or oil*

Directions:
In a medium mixing bowl, beat the sugar, eggs and vanilla. Add butter/oil; mix well.
Combine the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt; fold into the batter and mix well.
Pour into ungreased 8-inch square dish. (I grease my glass one with cooking spray) and bake at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.
