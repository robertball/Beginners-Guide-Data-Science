Ingredients:
12 graham crackers
1 cup Parkay margarine
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cut graham crackers into 48 1/4 squares.  Place them close together on a cookie sheet.(It is very important that the crackers are placed very tightly together so they do not move around when the mixture is poured over them.  It may be necessary to put extra crakers around the edges to prevent them from sliding.)
Using a heavy pan, melt the margarine.  Add the brown sugar, stirring constantly, bring this mixture to a frothy, rolling boil (it will lighten in color).  When the mixture reaches this consistency, boil for two minutes, again stirring constsntly.
Remove from stove and add pecans. Pour over graham crackers and spread the mixture evenly over the grahams.
Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees for 8 - 10 minutes (no longer)
Remove from cookie sheet immediately and place on foil to cool.
