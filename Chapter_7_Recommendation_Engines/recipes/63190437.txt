Description: 
The dressing in this spinach and strawberry salad is fabulous. It begins with vinegar and olive oil and goes on from there with sugar, bits of onion, Worcestershire, sesame seeds, paprika, and poppy seeds. It 's chilled before serving so all of the flavors mingle nicely.Modified from: Strawberry Spinach Salad I
