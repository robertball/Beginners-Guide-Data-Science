Ingredients:
1 pound bacon
2 (8 ounce) cans water chestnuts
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup chili sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut each strip of bacon in half.  Wrap one strip around one water chestnut. Secure with a wooden toothpick.  Place in shallow baking dish.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes.
While the wraps are baking, in a small mixing bowl combine brown sugar, mayonnaise, and chili sauce  to make barbecue sauce.  After the wraps have finished baking, transfer them (removing them from the grease) to a second shallow baking dish. Pour the sauce over the wraps.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 15 additional minutes, or until bacon is crispy.  Serve hot out of dish with toothpicks.
