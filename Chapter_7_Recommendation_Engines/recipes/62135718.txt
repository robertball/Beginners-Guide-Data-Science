Ingredients:
1 stick butter, melted
3 cups confectioners’ sugar
2 cups (1 18-oz jar) peanut butter, creamy or crunchy
1 block Paraffin wax
1 bag chocolate chip morsels, semi-sweet
1 bag chocolate chip morsels, milk chocolate

Directions:
Mix together the melted butter, confectioners’ sugar and peanut butter until well blended.
Form into bite-size balls.
In a double boiler, over medium heat, melt both chocolates and a quarter of the paraffin wax.
Stick the peanut butter balls with a toothpick, just enough to hold the ball on and dip into the melted chocolate mixture.
Twist off onto wax paper placed on a cookie sheet.
If the chocolate mixture is too thin (you can see the peanut butter through the chocolate), add more chocolate. If the chocolate mixture is too thick, add more paraffin wax.
Stick the cookie sheet with peanut butter candies outside to cool off quickly. If warm out, put in the refrigerator to cool completely. Store candies in a cookie tin or air tight container between sheets of wax paper.

My sister-in-law's best friend makes these for Christmas. She gave me the recipe and I'm glad to pass it on. These candy balls just melt away in your mouth...they're soooo good!
