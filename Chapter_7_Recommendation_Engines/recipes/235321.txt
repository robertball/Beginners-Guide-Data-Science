Ingredients:
5 pounds whole chicken wings, cut into 3 sections and tips discarded
2 ½ cups hot and spicy ketchup
⅔ cup white vinegar
½ cup honey
2 tablespoons honey
½ cup molasses
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon chili powder
½ teaspoon liquid smoke, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two 15x10x1-inch baking pans.
Arrange chicken in the prepared baking pans.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; drain and turn wings. Continue baking until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain.
Combine ketchup, vinegar, 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons honey, molasses, salt, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, chili powder, and liquid smoke in a large saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce has thickened and flavors blended, 25 to 30 minutes.
Transfer 1/3 the chicken to a slow cooker and top with about 1 cup sauce. Repeat layering with remaining chicken and sauce.
Cook on Low, 3 to 4 hours. Stir before serving.
