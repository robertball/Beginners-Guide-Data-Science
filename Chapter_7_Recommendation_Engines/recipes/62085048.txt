7. While rice is resting, combine the ingredients for the sushi rice vinegar in a small saucepan and stir constantly over medium-high heat until all the sugar and salt is melted.  Do not allow the mixture to boil.
8. Place the cooked rice into a large bowl (wooden if possible) and spread out loosely.
