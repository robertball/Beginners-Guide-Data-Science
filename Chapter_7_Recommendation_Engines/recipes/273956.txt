Ingredients:
18 cherry tomatoes
1/2 cup creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip®)
1 (3 ounce) can bacon bits (such as Hormel®)
1/3 cup chopped green onions
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (such as Sargento®)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Cut off the top 1/4 of each tomato and a very small slice off of the bottoms, if needed, to sit upright. Scoop out pulp using a baby spoon or grapefruit spoon. Place tomatoes cut-side down on paper towels to drain.
Combine salad dressing, bacon bits, green onions, Parmesan cheese, and parsley in a bowl. Spoon evenly into tomatoes. Cover and chill in a refrigerator until ready to serve.

Description: 
Fresh, unbaked bites that remind you of a BLT. Quick, easy, and cheap, if you grow your own tomatoes. This can be made a day ahead if tomatoes were drained. Perfect for a picnic.
