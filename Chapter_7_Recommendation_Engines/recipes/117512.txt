Ingredients:
2 plum tomatoes
4 hard-cooked eggs, peeled
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1 (10 ounce) package fresh baby spinach

Cut tomatoes in half widthwise; scoop out and discard pulp. Invert onto paper towels to drain. Carefully push each tomato half onto the narrow end of an egg.
Cut a small hole in the corner of a small plastic bag; fill with mayonnaise. Pipe dots onto tomato tops. Place on a spinach-lined serving plate.

Description: 
Looking for an eye-catching appetizer to dress up a dinner party or fun fall gathering? They don't come much cuter than the fanciful hard-cooked egg 'toadstools' pictured here. Capped with cherry tomatoes, these tasty morsels always delight family and friends, says creator Sue Cravatta of Elmwood Park, Illinois. 'They couldn't be easier to make, and my kids get the biggest kick out of them. They gobble the toadstools up-and even eat the spinach 'grass' I display them on,' she relates. You could also add a trail of whimsical raisin 'ants' around the base for extra nutrition and fun!
