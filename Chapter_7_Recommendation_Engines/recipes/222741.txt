Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package extra firm tofu, sliced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 onion, chopped
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
salt to taste

Directions:
Place tofu slices between two clean towels; allow tofu to drain, about 10 minutes. Cut tofu into bite-size pieces and transfer to a bowl. Stir in tomatoes and balsamic vinegar; marinate for 20 minutes.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bell peppers and onion until just tender, about 5 minutes. Add tofu mixture, garlic powder, and salt. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes more.
