Ingredients:
1 pound groud beef
1 pound ground sausage
1 tsp garlic powder (give or take)
1 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 cup parmesan cheese
1 14 oz jar of pizza sauce
1 12 oz can of tomato paste
1 tsp white vinegar
water if necessary to thin
sugar to taste
12 buns, spilt
mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Brown the beef/sausage in a skillet, drain and return to pan.  Add in the garlic, onion powder, salt, pepper, parmesan cheese and mix well.  Dump in the jar of pizza sauce and the can of tomato paste and the vinegar.  Mix well and heat over medium, gently stirring. Preheat oven to 350.  Add water to thin meat mixture, if needed. Add in the sugar. I taste as I go and add more seasoning, sugar, water as needed.  When the meat mixture is to your desired taste and consistency let it sit over low heat.  Take a cookie sheet and put the buns on it open face.  Put a scoop of meat mixture on each bun.  Put the prepared buns into the oven for about 15 mintues.  Eyeballing it, when the buns start to get toasty on the side remove the pan and sprinkle mozzarella cheese onto the meat mixture.  Return pan to oven until cheese melts.

Description: 
The school I went to made these awesome pizza burgers. They were still serving them when my kids attended and the kids always begged me to make them.  Quick, easy and really good.
