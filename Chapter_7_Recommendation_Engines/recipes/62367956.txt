Ingredients:
1 1/2 lb. ground beef, mild / hot bulk Italian sausage, or a combination of the two
1 medium yellow or red onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 green bell pepper, chopped
HALF of a 1 lb. box of rigatoni, cooked al dente
7 oz. jar sliced mushrooms, drained (optional)
2 1/4 oz. can sliced black or green olives, drained (optional)
3 oz. sliced pepeproni
16 oz. jar pizza sauce
8 oz. package shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
8 oz. package shredded mild cheddar cheese
*NOTE: two 8 oz. packages of pizza-blend cheese (i.e. mozzarella / cheddar blend) can be substituted for the individual packages of mozzarella and cheddar cheese this recipe calls for.

Directions:
In a large skillet, brown meat and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Transfer to a well-greased, 5-quart slow cooker.
Layer half of each of the following in this order: meat, onions and garlic, green pepper, noodles, mushrooms, olives, pepperoni, pizza sauce and cheeses. Repeat layers.
Cover. Cook on LOW setting for 3-4 hours.
NOTE: Keep pasta covered with sauce to prevent from becoming dry and crunchy.

Description: 
I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe! It's like eating pizza, but in pasta form. I like to stop by the Hut for an order of their breadsticks to serve on the side. Add a bagged salad mix and you've got a warm dinner on the table with very little effort involved. Enjoy!
