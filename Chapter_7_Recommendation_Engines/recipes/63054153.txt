Nana's Swedish Meatballs Recipe

Ingredients:
1 lb. lean ground pork
1 lb. lean ground beef
1 or 2 eggs
2/3 cup cracker crumbs (I use saltines I put through the food processor)
1 small onion finely chopped
1 tsp. nutmeg
1 tsp. mace
1 tsp. allspice
1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
1 Tbs. salt (I don't use this much but she did)
1/4 tsp. sugar
1 cup half and half or light cream

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients well.
Form into small balls (about the size of a golf ball).
Brown well on all sides in butter or oil.
Place the cooked meatballs into a heavy skillet or pot.
Add a little beef boullion or just water and let steam for 15 min.
(You can use the left over juices to add to the cream gravy or just discard).
Rather than fry in all that fat, I've discovered that you can also bake the meatballs on a cookie sheet covered with parchement paper in 350 degree oven for about 30-45 min. You can also do away with the steaming if you bake them, shortening up the time you're standing over the stove waiting on them. You lose a bit of the fluffiness the meatballs acquire from the steaming process, but if you've got guests, this will help free up time in the kitchen.

Description: 
We've had these meatballs every Christmas Eve since I was a child.  Along with the meatballs goes mashed potatoes, (my Nana made boiled, but I like mashed better!), cream gravy, sugared peas and tomato aspic.  After dinner, we'd open presents & have dessert. Then we'd wait for Santa!!
