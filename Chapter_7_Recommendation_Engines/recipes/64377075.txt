Heavenly Carrot Cake Baked Oatmeal Recipe

Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups rolled oats, certified gluten-free if necessary
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon fine grain sea salt
1 1/2 cups lightly packed shredded carrots
2 1/2 cups unsweetened almond milk (or non-dairy milk of choice)
1/2 cup brown or white sugar
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger (or try Â½ tsp ground ginger)
1/4 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped walnut halves.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375F and line with parchment an 8" x 11" rectangular casserole dish.
In a large bowl, mix together the rolled oats, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients: shredded carrot, almond milk, maple syrup, vanilla, and fresh ginger.
Add the wet mixture to dry mixture and stir until combined.
Pour mixture into prepared dish and smooth out with a spoon. Press down on the oatmeal with a spoon (or your hands) so the oats sink into the milk. Sprinkle on the walnuts and raisins and press down lightly again.
Bake, uncovered, for 32-37 minutes (I baked for 35 mins.) until lightly golden along edge. The oatmeal will still look a bit soft or wet in some spots when it comes out of the oven, but it will firm up as it cools.
Let cool for about 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with a drizzle of maple syrup, or some non-dairy yogurt. When the baked oatmeal is fully cool, it will firm up enough to be sliced into squares.
