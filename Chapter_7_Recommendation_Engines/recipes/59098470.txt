Ingredients:
1/2  package active dry yeast
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 1/2 cups white sugar, divided
1 1/2 cups milk

Directions:
In a 2 quart container glass, plastic or ceramic container, combine 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup sugar. Mix thoroughly or flour will lump when milk is added. Slowly stir in 1/2 cup milk and dissolved yeast mixture. Cover loosely and let stand until bubbly. Consider this day 1 of the 7 day cycle. Leave loosely covered at room temperature.
On days 2 thru 3; stir starter with a spoon. Day 4; stir in 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar and 1 cup milk. Days 5 thru 6; stir only.
Day 7; stir in 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup milk. Remove 1 cup to make your bread.  Use two cups to make two loaves.  Store the remaining starter in a container in the refrigerator, or begin the 7 day process over again (beginning with step 2).

Description: 
If you know your yeast is fresh, skip the proofing and cut the developing time from 10 days to 7.  I have tried it both ways and my family could not tell the difference.  We enjoy making Amish Fridnship Bread 1 with lots of raisins and nuts.Modified from: Amish Friendship Bread Starter
