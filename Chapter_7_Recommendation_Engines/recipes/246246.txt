Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup rolled oats
1 tablespoon cooked real bacon bits
1 teaspoon butter
1/2 teaspoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Cachere'sÂ®)

Directions:
Place water and oats in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook at 50% power, stirring half way through cooking, until oats are softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in butter until melted. Stir in bacon bits and Creole seasoning until evenly distributed.

Submitter:

Description: 
Want something savory in the morning, but needs to be quick and simple? This is it. I'd compare it most readily to a deluxe cheese grits recipe, but this has no cheese--and grits (unless instant) are typically a bunch more work. This was an alternative for my 10-year-old who always wanted eggs and sausage for breakfast. Fruits and brown sugar in the oatmeal wasn't cutting it.
