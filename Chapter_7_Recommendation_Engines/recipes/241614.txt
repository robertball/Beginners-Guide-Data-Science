Ingredients:
6 ice cubes
2 fluid ounces bourbon
1 fluid ounce maple syrup
1 fluid ounce brandy-based orange liqueur (such as Grand MarnierÂ®)
1 clementine, juiced and peel cut into 1x1/4-inch strips
1/2 lemon, juiced

Directions:
Place ice cubes in a shaker. Pour bourbon, maple syrup, orange liqueur, clementine juice, and lemon juice over ice, cover the shaker, and shake until chilled, about 15 seconds. Strain into a chilled martini glass.
Light a match or lighter over the cocktail and squeeze 1 piece of clementine peel near the flame to flame the oil. Rub peel on the rim of the glass and drop peel into cocktail.

Description: 
I named this cocktail Autumn Sunshine because its flavor is bright, like the sun, but the maple syrup, for some reason, reminds me of burning leaves in the autumn. It is definitely the color of autumn! For a clearer, more pungent cocktail, stir instead of shaking.
