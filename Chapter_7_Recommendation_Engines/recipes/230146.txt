Ingredients:
3 cups honey-nut toasted oat cereal (such as Honey Nut Cheerios®)
1 cup confectioners' sugar, plus more for dusting
1/2 cup crushed cashews
1/2 cup crushed almonds
1/4 cup shredded coconut
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/3 cup dark rum, or more as needed
3 tablespoons light corn syrup

Directions:
Place oat cereal, confectioners' sugar, cashews, almonds, coconut, and cocoa powder in a food processor; blend to an even crumb texture.
Stir rum and corn syrup together in a bowl; add cereal mixture. Stir until dough holds together. Add more rum if dough is dry. Form into balls and place on a plate.
Chill rum balls in the refrigerator for flavors to blend, at least 1 hour. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar before serving.
