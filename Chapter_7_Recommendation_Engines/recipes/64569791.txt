Spur of the Moment 1 Recipe

Ingredients:
1 package Hillshire Farm Kielbasa
1 cup Bob's Red Mill Whole Grain Medley
2 cups water
1 cup Reduced Sodium Chicken Broth
1 can french cut green beans
1 can golden sweet corn
4 TB unsalted butter
Salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
put the grains, 2 cups water, 1 cup broth, and 2 TB butter in a pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cover pot. This will take 45-60 minutes to be cooked and soft texture.
When there is about 20 minutes left for the grains,  heat up a skillet big enough for the kielbasa and vegetables.  Cut up the kielbasa into the size pieces you like. When the skillet is hot,  pour in 3 TB canola oil and the other 2 TB butter. Put in the kielbasa in the skillet and get it some color.  Then add the vegetables and season to your liking.
The kielbasa should only take 10 minutes at the most to get some light "charring" on it.
The grains may not get soft like rice, but I am okay with a little chew.
