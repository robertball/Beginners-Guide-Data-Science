Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package grated sharp Cheddar cheese
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (4 ounce) package crumbled blue cheese
4 ounces butter (optional)
2 tablespoons finely grated onion
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup finely chopped filberts
1 cup chopped filberts
1 cherry, halved
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Mix Cheddar cheese, cream cheese, blue cheese, butter, onion, and Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl using an electric mixer or in a food processor until thoroughly blended. Stir in finely chopped filberts.
Divide mixture into 2 balls using wet hands. Wrap balls in waxed paper and refrigerate until cool and firm, about 1 hour. Smooth and shape; roll firmly in chopped filberts. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve, at least 1 hour. Garnish each cheese ball with 1 cherry half and parsley 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
When I set one of these appetizers out on a plate with knife and crackers, it draws a crowd! It disappears so fast, I keep a spare in the refrigerator, and a couple in the freezer for the holidays.
