Ingredients:
cooking spray
12 ounces skinless, boneless chicken breast, cubed
½ cup onion, diced
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 cup farro
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes
6 ounces baby spinach
½ teaspoon basil
½ teaspoon dried parsley
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium heat and grease with cooking spray. Cook chicken and onion until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove chicken.
Pour chicken broth into skillet and bring to a boil. Stir in farro. Cover, reduce heat, and cook until most of the liquid has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Return chicken to skillet. Stir in diced tomatoes with liquid, spinach, basil, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat. Let stand for 3 to 5 minutes, covered.
Serve topped with Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
I make a similar dish with rice and decided to substitute it with farro. We all loved it! I serve this with a side of crusty bread with butter and a salad.
