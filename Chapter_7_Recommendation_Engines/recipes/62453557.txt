The Best Pumpkin Bars Recipe

Ingredients:
3 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2/3 cup vegetable oil
29 ounce can pumpkin puree
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 8-oz package Neufchatel cheese, softened
1/2 cup (1 stick)butter, softened
2 teaspoons vanilla or fresh orange juice
4 cups confectioner's sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
In a medium bowl, mix the eggs, sugars, oil and pumpkin with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, spices and salt.  Stir dry ingredients into pumpkin mixture until thoroughly combined.
Spread the batter evenly into an ungreased 10x15 inch jellyroll pan.  (Can divide among a 9x13 and an 8x8 if you don’t have a jellyroll pan, or want to “share some and save some.”)
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven.  Cool completely before frosting.
To make the frosting, first put the softened butter in the mixer bowl & whip it up a bit.  Then add the softened cream cheese & whip it some more, until light & fluffy.  Stir in vanilla, or fresh orange juice.  Add in the confectioner’s sugar a little at a time, beating until mixture is smooth.  Spread evenly over cooled bars, slice into squares.  Should be stored in the refrigerator until serving time.
