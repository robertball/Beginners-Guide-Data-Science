Ingredients:
2 Tbsp Olive oil
2 medium onions, finely diced
1 tsp sea salt
5 to 7 cups vegetable broth
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 cup lightly packed fresh sage leaves, thinly sliced
2 lb butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into 1/2 cubes
2 1/2 cups brown rice, soaked overnight if possible

Directions:
Heat oven to 350.
Heat oil in large oven proof pot with tight fitting lid over medium heat.
Add onions ans salt  and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are translucent and slightly caramelized, about 10 minutes, adding a little broth if it gets too dry.
Stir in garlic and sage and cook until fragrant, 2 minutes.
Add squash, rice and 5 cups of broth.  Stir well, cover, transfer to oven  and bake for 20 minutes.
Remove from oven, stir once and check liquids.  If broth is not covering rice, add additional cup or 2, then cover and continue baking.  Check every 15 minutes or so until rice is tender and the risotto is creamy and loose but not runny.  If it seems too stiff, stir in a little more broth to loosen slightly.  The risotto should cook for about 60 minutes total if you soaked the rice, up to 90 minutes if you used dry rice.  Taste and add more salt as needed.  Serve hot, with a drizzle of olive oil
