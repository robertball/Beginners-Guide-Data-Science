Description: 
I made this up one day when I couldn't find a recipe anywhere with these ingredients. So I kind of threw it together on a whim. Sugar can be adjusted for sweetness, and if the sauce gets a bit thicker than desired I suggest adding a little chicken broth as it's thickening. Serve immediately over rice.
