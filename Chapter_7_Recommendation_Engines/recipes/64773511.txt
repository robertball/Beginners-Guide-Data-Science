Ingredients:
1/2 cup sugar
4 fresh eggs, separated
2 tbsp maple syrup
500 grams mascarpone

Directions:
In a stand mixer using the wire whip, whisk the egg whites until soft peaks form. Set aside in a bowl. Using the flat beater, cream the egg yolks and sugar until smooth and pale in color. Add the maple syrup and beat until fully incorporated. Slowly mix in the mascarpone. Fold in the egg whites. This will keep in the refrigerator for 48 hours, loosely covered with plastic wrap. It may begin to separate after 24 hours. Gently stir it before using.
Note:
If you prefer, you can pasteurize the eggs by cream all four eggs with half the sugar. Heat the other half of the sugar and an equal amount of water until it reaches 250° creating a syrup. Then, mix the syrup in a slow, steady stream into the creamed eggs until the syrup has been incorporated fully and has lowered in temperature. Then add the maple syrup and the mascarpone. This method doesn’t use the whipped egg whites, but it is delicious all the same.

Description: 
An Italian favorite to serve with pandoro or panettone, or even on crepes, or to dip your cantucci biscotti, this mascarpone cream is inspired by The Elf. Instead of rum or brandy, this uses maple syrup for an extra boost in flavor. Buddy might put it on spaghetti, but I wouldn’t advise it.
