Ingredients:
3 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
3 cups water, divided
2 cubes chicken bouillon
15 oz chicken broth
1 tbsp dried parsley
1 tsp dried basil
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1/4 tsp white pepper
1/4 tsp paprika
1 large onion, chopped
1/2 green pepper, chopped
15 oz can butter beans, undrained
1/2 cup celery, thinly sliced
1/4 cup carrots, thinly sliced
1 cup frozen chopped spinach (or 1 10 oz bag fresh spinach, torn)
1/3 cup grated fat free parmesan cheese
1/2 cup fat free mozarella cheese or 1/2 cup lite sour cream (for smoother textured broth)

Directions:
In large kettle, combine 2 cups water, broth, celery, onion, carrots, bouillon, bell pepper, garlic powder, crushed garlic cloves, onion powder, and pepper.  Bring to boil.  Add chicken.  Boil over medium heat for thirty minutes.
Remove chicken from pot, shred, return to kettle.  Add one cup water, undrained beans and spinach.  Continue cooking over medium heat for 15 minutes.  Add parmesan and mozzarella.  Reduce heat to low and simmer 15 more minutes to meld flavors.  Add salt to taste, if needed.  Garnish with more grated parmesan and serve with crusty garlic bread.

Description: 
A hearty, healthy chicken soup for those chilly evenings.  The addition of parmesan and mozarella cheeses makes this soup a great change from the ordinary.  Use low sodium bouillon and broth if you're watching your salt intake.  Also great without beans, or with any white bean.
