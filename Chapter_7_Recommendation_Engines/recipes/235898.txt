Description: 
What to do with some Christmas party leftovers. Cooking times are approximate, so keep an eye on it. This recipe was created after party leftovers yielded a pan of homemade rolls and over a gallon of leftover store-bought eggnog.  It made a lovely breakfast paired with a vegetarian sausage.
