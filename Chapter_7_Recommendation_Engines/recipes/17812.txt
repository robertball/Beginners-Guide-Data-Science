Ingredients:
2 cups soy sauce
3/4 cup brown sugar, divided
3/4 cup white sugar, divided
8 green onions, cut into 1 1/2 inch sections
4 slices fresh ginger root
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 cup honey

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, green onions, ginger and garlic in a 2 quart saucepan. Bring the mixture to a slight boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes.
Pour the remaining white and brown sugar and the honey into the saucepan. Bring to a boil. The mixture will rise and foam, when it does this and doubles in size remove the pan from heat and cool.
