Description: 
Discovered this variation on Hawaiian Huli Huli Chicken in a very old recipe book in a vacation house we rented in Hawaii.  Simpler and quicker then most recipes we've tried, and intended for cooking in the oven instead of on a grill.  This one is a favorite of the kids, and always brings back memories of preparing it while the fragrant ocean breeze blew through the vacation home while on Oahu.
