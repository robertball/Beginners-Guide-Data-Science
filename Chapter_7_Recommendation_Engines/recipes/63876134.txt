Ingredients:
Pinch of salt
1 10-oz bag baby spinach
1 15-oz can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 8-oz package Neufchatel cream cheese
1 clove garlic, smashed
1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
12-oz jar artichoke hearts, drained, squeezed dry and finely chopped
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, plus extra
3/4 cup shredded low-fat mozzarella cheese
Pinch of paprika
2 or 3 dashes Worcestershire sauce
Olive Oil
Baked chips, for serving

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 450. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and prepare a bowl of ice water. Stir the spinach and basil into the boiling water and cook until bright green, about 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and immediately plunge in the ice water. Drain and squeeze dry, then roughly chop.
2. Puree the beans, cream cheese, garlic and chicken broth in a food processor until smooth, scraping the sides as needed. Transfer to a medium bowl and fold in the spinach and artichokes, Parmesan and 1/2 cup mozzarella. Add the paprika, Worcestershire sauce, and salt to taste.
3.Coat 1-quart casserole dish with olive oil. Spread the dip mixture in the dish and top with the remaining 1/4 cup mozzarella. Bake until golden and bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm with baked chips.
