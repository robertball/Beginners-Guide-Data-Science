Ingredients:
1 (12 pound) whole turkey - thawed, neck and giblets removed
1/4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed
5 apples, cored and quartered
5 pounds whole unpeeled apples

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
If necessary, unbind legs of turkey. Rinse and dry turkey with paper towels. Place turkey into a roasting pan with a lid, and rub the oil all over the turkey, inside and out. Stuff the body and neck cavities of the turkey with the apple quarters; arrange whole apples around the turkey in the roasting pan. Scatter any extra apple quarters into the pan. Cover the roasting pan.
Roast in the preheated oven until the skin is browned and the meat is beginning to separate from the legs, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove lid in last 20 minutes of roasting if needed to brown skin. Use pan drippings for gravy, if desired.
