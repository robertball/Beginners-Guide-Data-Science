Ingredients:
2 cups milk
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup molasses
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
3 teaspoons baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter and flour two 9x5-inch bread pans.
In a small bowl, combine milk, sugar and molasses.
Mix together whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, salt, baking soda and baking powder. Add to milk mixture and mix well.
Pour mixture into bread pans. Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted in the centers comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let bread cool in pans for 10 minutes, then invert on wire rack and allow to cool completely.

Description: 
This is an old standby on my Thanksgiving table and on my mother's. It was her Aunt Jane who started it. I like to eat it plain, sliced thin, but I know others claim it's delicious with a little bit of butter or cream cheese on top.
