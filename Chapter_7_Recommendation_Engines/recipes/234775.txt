Ingredients:
8 cups water
1 cup large brown lentils, rinsed
4 cups thinly sliced Swiss chard
4 large potatoes, cut into cubes
1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
6 cloves garlic, crushed (or more to taste)
1 tablespoon salt, or to taste
1/2 cup olive oil

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Cook lentils in boiling water until beginning to soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Add chard; continue cooking until wilted, about 5 minutes.
Add potatoes to the boiling water, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and cook until the potatoes are completely cooked, about 12 minutes.
Mix lemon juice, crushed garlic, and salt together in a bowl; add to the pot. Continue to cook at a simmer another 5 minutes. Stir olive oil into the mixture. Increase heat to high and cook another 1 to 2 minutes.
