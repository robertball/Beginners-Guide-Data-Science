Ezekiel Bread I Recipe

Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups wheat berries
1 1/2 cups spelt flour
1/2 cup barley
1/2 cup millet
1/4 cup dry green lentils
2 tablespoons dry great Northern beans
2 tablespoons dry kidney beans
2 tablespoons dried pinto beans
4 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup olive oil
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
2 tablespoons salt

Directions:
Measure the water, honey, olive oil, and yeast into a large bowl.  Let sit for 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir all of the grains and beans together until well mixed. I soak the wheat berries first,cover with water,(2 days),change water once a day,then drain,and grind. Barley and beans I soak overnight then drain and grind. Millet and lentils I leave dry. Sometimes I decrease the water amount by half cup just depends on how the dough feels. I use chickpeas instead of beans too. You can even let the beans and wheat sprout then grind. I find you get the same benefits but no gas. Grind in a flour mill.(food processor.) Add fresh milled flour and salt to the yeast mixture; stir until well mixed, about 10 minutes. The dough will be like that of a batter bread.  Pour dough into two greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans.
Let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until dough has reached the top of the pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes, or until loaves are golden brown.
