Ingredients:
6 tablespoons almond flour
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons low-calorie natural sweetener (such as SwerveÂ®) (optional)
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted

Directions:
Mix together almond flour, cocoa powder, sweetener, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl.
Beat eggs in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Slowly add melted coconut oil and beaten eggs to the almond flour mixture, whisking everything together with a fork.
Lightly grease 2 microwave-safe mugs. Pour batter into mugs, leaving at least 1 inch of empty space at the top so the cakes can rise.
Microwave on high power for 1 minute. Test cakes for doneness. Continue cooking in 10 second-intervals, if necessary, until cakes are cooked through and not runny in the middle.
