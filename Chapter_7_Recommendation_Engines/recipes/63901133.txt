Ingredients:
1 package active dry yeast
1 cup milk
2 1/4 cups flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 egg
3/4 cup dried currants
3/4 cup raisins
1 Granny Smith apple - peeled, cored and finely chopped
1 quart canola oil for deep-frying
1 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Microwave milk for 30 seconds and add yeast, mix and set aside.
Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Stir the yeast mixture and egg into the flour and mix into a smooth batter. Stir in the currants, raisins and apple. Cover the bowl, and leave the batter in a warm place to rise until double in size. This will take about 1 hour.
Heat the oil in a deep-fryer, or heavy deep pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Use an ice cream scoop to form a ball, and drop them carefully into the hot oil.
Fry the balls until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes depending on size. Flip with metal tongs half way through cooking.
Drain finished doughnuts on paper towels and dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve warm.
