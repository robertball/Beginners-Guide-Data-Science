Ingredients:
12 ounces Italian turkey sausage links
4 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 (10.75 ounce) can reduced-fat, reduced-sodium condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted
1 (8 ounce) can mushroom stems and pieces, drained
1 small onion, chopped
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon salt-free garlic and herb seasoning
1/8 teaspoon caraway seed
1/8 teaspoon fennel seed, crushed
1 (15.5 ounce) can great northern beans, rinsed and drained
1 small leek, white part only, cut into 1 inch strips

Directions:
In a nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Let cool and slice. In a large saucepan, whisk together the broth, soup, mushrooms, onion, Italian seasoning, garlic and herb seasoning, caraway seeds and fennel seed. Add sausage. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Add beans and leek. Simmer 10 minutes longer or until vegetables are tender.

Description: 
'While trying to reproduce my favorite soup from an Italian restaurant's menu, I hit upon this tasty combination of turkey sausage, broth and mushrooms,' pens Thomas Licking of Green Lake, Wisconsin. Fennel, caraway seeds and herb seasoning give the quick-to-fix soup plenty of flavor without adding salt. Serve it steaming hot alongside a crisp salad and bread for a well-rounded meal.
