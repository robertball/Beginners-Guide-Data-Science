Ingredients:
1 package active dry yeast (2 1/4 tsp)
1/3 cup almond milk (can use soy milk)
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 ripe avocados, mashed
2 tbsp almond or soy milk
2 tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
2 1/4 cups bread flour

Directions:
Mix together in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer and let stand 5 minutes:
1 package active dry yeast (2 1/4 tsp)
1/3 cup almond milk (can use soy milk)
*Add:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 ripe avocados, mashed
2 tbsp almond or soy milk
2 tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
*Mix on low speed or by hand. Then add:
2 1/4 cups bread flour
*Mix well until ingredients have blended together. Then, knead by hand for about 15 minutes or on low-medium speed in a stand mixer for about 8-10 minutes. The dough will be smooth and elastic and although it will appear sticky, it won't stick to your fingers.
*Add 2 tbsp vegan "butter" like Smart Balance or Earth Balance.
*Knead on medium-high speed or by hand until the "butter" is incorporated into the dough.
*Place the dough in an oil-coated bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm place for about 1 1/2 hours or until doubled.
*Punch the dough down, then cover again and let rise for another 2 hours.
*To shape the dough, divide it into four equal portions. Shape each portion into a smooth ball.
*Spray oil on the inside of a standard 9 X 5-inch loaf pan.
*Place the four balls of dough touching each other inside the loaf pan. Brush with some olive oil mixed with salt.
*Cover loosely with oiled plastic wrap and let rise another hour or until the loaf fills the pan and mushrooms over it.
*Brush some more of the olive-oil-salt mixture over  the top.
*Bake in a 375-degree oven about 30 minutes. (The next time I plan to decrease the oven temperature to 350 degrees and bake a little longer, if needed, to prevent the top from heating too fast).
