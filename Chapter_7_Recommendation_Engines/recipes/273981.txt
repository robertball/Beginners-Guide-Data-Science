Ingredients:
1 pound dry black beans
4 cups chicken broth
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes in juice

1 teaspoon chopped jalapeno pepper, or more to taste (optional)
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste
1 cup canned corn, drained
1/4 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Sort black beans and place into a large container. Cover with several inches of cool water; let soak, 8 hours to overnight. Rinse and drain.
Combine black beans, chicken broth, tomatoes, carrots, onion, red bell pepper, garlic, cumin, salt, chili powder, jalapeno, and black pepper in a slow cooker.
Cover and cook on High until mixture has reduced and beans are tender, about 8 hours. Stir in corn and brown sugar 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
My mother-in-law whipped up these black beans one day without really paying attention to what she was putting in and served them as a side. I have since had to reverse-engineer them to come up with this slow cooker recipe and found they are extremely versatile. They are excellent in burritos, over rice as a side or main dish, or just as a soup on their own. You can even add cheese to the leftovers to make a great dip for chips!
