Ingredients:
1 pound bacon slices
1 pound ground chicken
1 tablespoon barbeque chicken seasoning
3 slices Havarti cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Measure out a 20-inch square piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet.
Lay out slices of bacon side-by-side, overlapping slightly, to create an even layer on the parchment paper.
Combine ground chicken with barbeque seasoning; spread evenly onto the bacon layer from edge to edge. Place Havarti cheese slices lengthwise on top. Lift the parchment paper to help you roll a log, starting with the edge of bacon closest to you.
Bake in the preheated oven, rotating baking sheet every 15 minutes, until bacon is crispy and chicken is cooked through; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour.
Remove from oven and cool until easily handled, about 15 minutes. Slice into bite-sized "sushi".

Description: 
I saw this bacon sushi idea online somewhere, but I did not save it, so I had to wing it from memory and kept it as simple as possible. I made it for the March Madness final and the whole family loved it! I made it in the toaster oven on convection at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and kept a close eye on it.
