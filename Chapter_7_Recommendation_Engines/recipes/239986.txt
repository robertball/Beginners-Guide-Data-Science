Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 jalapeno peppers, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces
2 habanero peppers, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces
2 serrano peppers, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces
2 cloves garlic, minced
6 tomatoes, stems removed
lemon, juiced
1 lime, juiced
1 1/2 fluid ounces whiskey (such as Jack Daniel'sÂ®)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over low heat. Cook and stir jalapeno peppers, habanero peppers, serrano peppers, and garlic in the hot oil until slightly tender and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Blend tomatoes in a blender until pureed and smooth.
Mix pureed tomatoes, lemon juice, and lime juice into pepper mixture; bring to a low simmer. Stir whiskey into tomato mixture and simmer for 15 minutes.
Strain sauce through a fine-mesh strainer, reserving the solids and transferred strained sauce back to the skillet. Blend the solids in a blender until smooth.
Transfer pureed solids to the sauce and simmer for 15 minutes. Cool sauce completely; pour into jars or bottles and store in the refrigerator.

Description: 
A spicy sauce that I use on eggs, tacos, nachos, or as a marinade for chicken. The spiciness of this recipe can be adjusted based on how you prepare your peppers. Always be careful when preparing hot peppers!
