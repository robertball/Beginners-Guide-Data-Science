Ingredients:
Cake:
1 1/2 sticks butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Glaze:
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons lemon juice, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Combine butter, sugar, and eggs in a mixing bowl. Beat using an electric mixer until batter is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in flour, baking powder, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Pour cake batter into the prepared dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cake cool thoroughly, about 30 minutes.
Combine confectioners' sugar and lemon juice for glaze in a bowl; mix until smooth. Carefully spread over cooled cake.
