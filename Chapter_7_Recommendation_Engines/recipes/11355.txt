Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup butter flavored shortening
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups quick cooking oats
2 cups crisp rice cereal
1 cup shredded coconut
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Cream the shortening, brown sugar and white sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla salt and eggs.
Sift the flour, baking soda and baking powder, add to the creamed mixture and stir to combine. Stir in the oats, rice cereal, coconut and nuts. Mix to combine.
Form dough into walnut sized balls and place on the prepared baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 minutes. These cookies should still be very soft when taken from the oven. Place on a cooling rack and let cool completely before storing in airtight containers.
