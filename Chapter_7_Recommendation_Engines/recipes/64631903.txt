Ingredients:
150 grams tofu
30 grams crab sticks
50 grams shimeji mushrooms
50 grams caulifloret
50 grams cheese
1/4 piece beets
1 tablespoon flour
200 mL milk
1 tablespoon melted butter
1/2 tsp oyster sauce
1/4 tsp dried thyme
pinch of salt
pinch of pepper

Directions:
Pat dry the tofu with the use of paper towel. Slice it into 4 pieces.
Cut the roots of the shimeji mushrooms then separate the pieces individually. Cut the cauliflorets into bite-sized pieces. Clean the beets then slice it thinly. For the crab sticks, shred it with your hands.
Make the white sauce by whisking flour and milk. Once it is well combined, add the melted butter, oyster sauce, dried thyme, salt and pepper. Mix well.
Cover the bowl with the white sauce then bring in a microwave and cook for 2 minutes using 600W. Take out the bowl then mix so that the flour will not settle at the bottom. Put back the cover and microwave cook for 2 more minutes using 600W.
Arrange the beets slices at the bottom of a microwave-safe dish. Add the tofu on top then spread the shredded crab sticks, shimeji, and caulifloret. Carefully pour the white sauce made earlier then spread the cheese on top.
Put the dish in a microwave, uncovered, then cook for 4 minutes using 600W. You can serve once done.
