Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups fresh corn kernels
2 cups water
1/2 cup raw cashews
6 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 small clove garlic
2 teaspoons kosher salt
cilantro, freshly ground black pepper, and minced jalapeno to garnish, or chives, optional

Directions:
Put corn kernels, water, cashews, olive oil, garlic, and salt in a food processor and blend until smooth. Garnish with chopped cilantro and black pepper. Next time I'll also add fresh, minced jalapeno to garnish. You can also microwave or warm it on stove top, for a warmer alternative in the winter.
