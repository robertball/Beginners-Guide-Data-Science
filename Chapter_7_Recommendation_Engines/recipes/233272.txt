Description: 
I used easy-to-find lamb shoulder chop steaks instead of Colorado lamb ribs, which were quite delicious but maybe a bit hard to track down. This will work with any rib: baby back, spareribs, beef ribs, you name it.

 As far as the root beer and toasted sesame glaze goes, as I sat eating the tender lamb with the sweet, aromatic, nutty sauce, I was a believer. The proper way to eat it is with your fingers.
