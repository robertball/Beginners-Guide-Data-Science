Ingredients:
1 fluid ounce chilled peach schnapps
1 teaspoon chilled Irish cream liqueur (such as Bailey'sÂ®)
1 splash chilled grenadine syrup

Directions:
Pour schnapps into a shot glass.
Very gently pour Irish cream liqueur over the schnapps. Wait until the Irish cream liqueur begins to clump and 'curdle' to look like a brain, just a few moments.
Gently pour a tiny amount of grenadine 'blood' over the brain.
Watch your guests gag over the look of one of the nastiest-looking Halloween drinks around. But they are yummy!

Description: 
This is the Halloween party shot for one of the funniest Halloween drinks you'll make this year! It looks so disgusting and creepy, you may just have a hard time getting your guests to try one. Try also with strawberry schnapps.
