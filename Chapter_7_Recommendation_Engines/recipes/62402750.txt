Add coriander and diced ginger as garnish.
Sprinkle lemon juice if you like a little acidity.
For a drier consistency, just boil away the liquid just before chickpeas start to stick to the bottom of the pan. You can add more chopped tomatoes and raw onion for colour and crunch.

Description: 
This recipe is delicious with white rice. It is easy to derive a drier version to eat with naan or flat bread. It doesn't require too many exotic spices either.
