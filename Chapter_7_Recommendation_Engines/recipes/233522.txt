Ingredients:
1 cup diced zucchini
2 eggs
1/2 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon gluten-free vanilla extract
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup white rice flour
1/2 cup sweet rice flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
2 tablespoons tapioca starch
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum
1/2 teaspoon salt
Glaze:
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a large loaf pan.
Combine zucchini, eggs, oil, and vanilla extract in a blender; pulse until mixture resembles a milkshake.
Whisk together white sugar, white rice flour, sweet rice flour, cornstarch, tapioca, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt in a large bowl. Stir zucchini mixture into flour mixture until batter is well blended; pour into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan for a few minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
Mix confectioners' sugar and lemon juice in a small bowl to form a thin glaze. Drizzle over top of loaf.
