Ingredients:
3 cups chicken broth, divided
1 small head cauliflower, finely chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 onion, finely chopped
1 (4 ounce) can diced jalapeno peppers
1 pound ground beef
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed
1 (26 ounce) container diced tomatoes
1 teaspoon ground paprika
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine 2 cups broth and cauliflower in a pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook until tender, about 20 minutes.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and jalapenos until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, about 6 minutes.
Transfer the cooked cauliflower to a blender and puree. Return to the pot; add cream cheese and remaining 1 cup broth. Cook and stir over medium heat until cream cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. Add the beef mixture, tomatoes, and paprika. Season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until flavors blend, about 5 minutes.
