Ingredients:
1 flank steak
2 tablespoons hot prepared horseradish
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine flank steak, horseradish, olive oil, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, garlic, balsamic vinegar, kosher salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal and let marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place steak on the hot grill. Sear until both sides are browned and center is firm and juicy, 5 to 6 minutes per side, making sure not to overcook. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare. Let rest 5 minutes; slice thinly at an angle.
