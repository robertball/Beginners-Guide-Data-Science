Ingredients:
1 tablespoon sesame oil
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced ginger
1  firm mango, peeled and sliced
3 tablespoons yellow curry powder
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
1 (14 ounce) can light coconut milk
1 (14 ounce) package extra firm tofu, cubed
Â¼ teaspoon salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the sesame oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.  Cook the garlic and ginger until fragrant and light brown, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the mango and cook for another minute to soften slightly.  Stir in the curry powder and cilantro; cook for another minute to release the flavor of the curry.
Pour in the coconut milk and bring to a simmer.  Stir in the tofu and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
