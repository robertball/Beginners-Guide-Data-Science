Ingredients:
1 c. basmati rice
2 c. water
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 c. fresh cilantro, finely chopped
2 tbsp. lime juice (fresh or bottled)
1 tbsp. olive oil
1 tsp. onion powder
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp. dried parsley flakes
1/2 tsp. cumin powder
1/4 tsp. crushed red chili powder
Optional: 1/2 of 11 oz. can mexicorn, drained

Directions:
Bring the 2 c. of water to a boil over high heat, add salt and rice - stir to ensure all rice is moistened.  Cover and reduce heat to low and allow to simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  While the rice is cooking, combine finely chopped cilantro, lime juice, olive oil, onion powder, dried parsley, cumin, and crushed red chili powder in a small bowl (I used a 1 c. glass measuring cup).  At the fifteen minute mark add the cilantro lime mixture and mexicorn and stir well.  Allow rice to simmer an additional five minutes, covered, on the lowest heat setting before serving.

Description: 
I was inspired to create this recipe after a major retailer stopped carrying a favorite boxed version of cilantro lime rice mix, leaving a hole in my rotation of meals.  My version is budget-friendly has a fresher taste and aroma than the boxed version, and I hope others enjoy it.
