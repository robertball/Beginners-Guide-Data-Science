Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup confectioners' sugar
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
4 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons vanilla sugar
1 pinch salt
9 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed
1/4 cup milk
1 egg
Decoration:
3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons lemon juice, or as needed
90 candy eyeballs

Directions:
Combine flour, 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, baking powder, vanilla sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Work in butter with your fingers until mixture resembles small crumbs. Add milk and egg and knead into a soft dough. Place in a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Roll dough into long, thin 8-inch ropes, pinching one end into a pointy tip. Arrange in the shape of a little poop-mound with the pointy tip on top and place onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between individual cookies.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly darkened on the bottom and dried, 10 to 12 minutes. Carefully remove from baking sheet and transfer onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 2 hours.
Mix 3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar with lemon juice to form a thin icing. Glue 2 candy eyeballs on each poop cookie and let dry.

Description: 
Since my daughter is obsessed with emojis and especially the poop emoji, for her birthday this year I made these poop emoji cookies as a treat to share for her class. Needless to say, they were a huge hit! They are based on a German cookie recipe and are different than American cookies - pretty dry and not very sweet as in Germany cookies are always eaten with tea or coffee. I'll be making them again as Halloween cookies.
