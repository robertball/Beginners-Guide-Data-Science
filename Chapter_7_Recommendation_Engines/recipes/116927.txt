Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) container nonfat ricotta cheese
2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese, divided
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1/2 cup reduced-fat sour cream
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
2 cups tomato juice
1 cup chunky salsa
1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
14 uncooked manicotti shells

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, 1-1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, spinach, sour cream, bread crumbs, Italian seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder. Combine the tomato juice, salsa and crushed tomatoes; spread 1 cup sauce in a ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Stuff uncooked manicotti with spinach mixture; arrange over sauce. Pour remaining sauce over manicotti.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 55 minutes. Uncover; sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese. Bake 15 minutes longer or until noodles are tender.

Description: 
Stuffed with ricotta cheese and spinach, this Italian-style entree is flavorful and filling. I particularly like this meatless dish because I don't have to cook the pasta before assembling.     --Mary Steiner of West Bend, Wisconsin
