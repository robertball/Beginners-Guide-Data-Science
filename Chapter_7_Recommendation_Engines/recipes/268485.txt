Ingredients:
7 tablespoons butter, divided
1 small onion, chopped
2 1/2 cups peeled, cubed pumpkin
3/4 cup peeled, cubed potatoes
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
3/4 cup milk
salt to taste
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon sugar, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
3/4 cup heavy cream
3 slices Italian bread, cubed

Directions:
Heat 4 tablespoons butter over medium-low heat in a pot and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add pumpkin and potatoes and stir to coat with butter. Add broth and milk. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, covered, until potatoes soften, 10 to 15 minutes.
Strain soup through a fine-mesh sieve. Season with salt, nutmeg, and sugar. Stir in lemon juice. Return to the pot and bring to a boil. Add cream and heat through but do not boil.
Meanwhile, heat remaining butter in a skillet and toast bread cubes in the hot butter until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve croutons with the soup.
