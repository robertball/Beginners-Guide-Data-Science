Ingredients:
1 red onion, thinly sliced and separated into rings
1 1/2 pounds fresh or frozen salmon fillet
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon herbes de Provence or dried salad herbs, crushed
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 cups plum tomatoes, cut into 1-inch slices
1 (6.5 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained
1/3 cup pitted kalamata olives, halved

Directions:
Thaw fish, if frozen. Open a large foil cooking bag. Place onion rings in bag; place salmon on top of onions. Sprinkle with garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of the herbes, the salt, and pepper. Top with tomatoes, artichoke hearts, and olives; sprinkle with remaining herbes. Seal bag. (Or fold a 48x18-inch piece of heavy foil in half to make a 24x18-inch rectangle. Layer fish, vegetables, and seasonings in center of the foil. Bring two sides of the foil together and seal with a double fold. Seal ends, leaving space for steam.)
In a grill with a cover, place foil bag or packet on grill rack directly over medium coals. Cover and grill for 20 to 25 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Carefully slit bag open with a knife to let steam escape.
