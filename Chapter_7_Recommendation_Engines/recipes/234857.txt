Ingredients:
oil for frying, or as needed
2 cups grated carrots
6 green onions, chopped
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3 eggs
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Pour about 1/2-inch depth of oil in a large saucepan or electric skillet and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix carrots, green onion, flour, and baking powder together in a bowl until carrots are evenly coated. Beat eggs, salt, and pepper together in a separate bowl; pour over carrot mixture. Stir mixture until combined and moistened.
Spoon small mounds of carrot mixture, working in batches, into the hot oil; cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer latkes using a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate.

Description: 
These are great as a side dish or make them a little smaller and top with a dollop of sour cream for an easy appetizer. They also freeze beautifully.
