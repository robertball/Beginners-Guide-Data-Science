Ingredients:
2 c. garlic cloves, peeled
2 c. chicken broth or homemade veggie broth
12 oz. fettuccine pasta
2 c. grated Pamesan plus extra to serve
salt and pepper

Directions:
In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the garlic and broth.  Bring to a boil and cook for 12 minutes, or until the broth is reduced by half and the garlic is very tender. Transfer the garlic and broth to a blender and puree until smooth.
Cook pasta till al dente. Reserve 1/4 c. of the pasta cooking water, then drain pasta and transfer to a large bowl. Pour the garlic puree over the pasta.  Using tongs, toss the pasta with the sauce, sprinkling in the cheese as you do it.  When the cheese is nearly melted, drizzle in enough of the reserved pasta water to form a smooth sauce.  Season with salt and pepper, then serve topped with additional Parmesan.
