Ingredients:
2 cups peanut oil, or as needed
Â¼ cup unsalted butter, melted
2 tablespoons lemon pepper seasoning
6  pearl onions
16  chicken wings

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk butter and lemon pepper seasoning together in a large bowl.
Place onions in the preheated oil and cook until just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove and discard onions.
Working in batches, cook wings in oil until crispy on the outside and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove wings to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
Toss wings with lemon pepper mixture until completely coated. Return to paper towel-lined plate to drain excess liquid.

Description: 
Yet another great variation on the ever-popular tailgating and sports-bar snack and very simple and easy to make. I have tried this with several brands of lemon pepper seasonings and found I actually liked the cheapest one the most. It was a tad twangier than the others and was more suited to my liking. I found it at my local food store in the seasoning section. I also tend to lean towards a lemon pepper seasoning that includes a white pepper and less black.
