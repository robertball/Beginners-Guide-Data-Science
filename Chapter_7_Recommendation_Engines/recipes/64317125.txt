Ingredients:
1 lb dry pasta
7 tbsp unsalted butter, divided
1 bunch scallions, trimmed and sliced
1/4 cup flour
1/2 tsp paprika
4 cups whole milk
12 oz Muenster, Monterrey Jack, and/or Gouda cheese, shredded
4 oz pepper jack cheese, shredded
4 tbsp Dijon mustard
2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1 large tomato, seeded and diced
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup panko bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.  Coat a 9x13 inch pan with nonstick cooking spray.
Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling water until slightly soft, about 5 minutes.  Drain and rinse.
Melt 4 tablespoons of butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Add scallions and saute one minute.
Whisk in flour and paprika and cook an additional 2 minutes.  Whisk in milk and bring to a boil.  Cook until thick, approximately 1 or 2 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium low.  Whisk in cheeses, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.  Simmer until cheeses melt.
Stir in tomato and season with salt and pepper.  Transfer sauce to a large bowl and stir in pasta.  Pour completed dish into prepared pan.
Melt remaining butter and combine with bread crumbs.  Sprinkle over pasta.
Bake until bubbly and topping is golden brown, about 30-35 minutes.  Let rest 5 minutes before serving.
