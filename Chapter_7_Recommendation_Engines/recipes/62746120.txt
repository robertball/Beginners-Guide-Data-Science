Ingredients:
- 3 medium bakers potatoes
- 2 T. Dill
- Salt & Pepper to taste
- Olive Oil Spray
- 2 T. butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Wash and chop potatoes into 1-1/2" cubes. Put them into a microwaveable safe bowl, filled with filtered water and a pinch of salt. Microwave potatoes until tender (not mashed!). Drain in colander. Put back into bowl, and toss with butter and dill. Potatoes should stick to the fork with poked.
Heat an oven safe pan (I use a dutch oven pan) on medium heat. Spray olive oil, then add potatoes. Cook for 5 minutes, don't stir too much; you want them to brown a little.
Turn off stove, put potatoes into oven for 10 minutes or until golden brown on top.
