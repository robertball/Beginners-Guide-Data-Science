1 cup mung beans
1/4 - 1/3 cup cooking oil
1 - 5 Thai chili pepper (optional)
1 green onion

Soak the hulled mung beans in cold water for 1 hour.   Slice green onion and fresh chili peppers.
Drain the beans and let them dry for 15 minutes. You can also use kitchen towel to dry the beans. Wet beans will splatter in hot oil.
Heat up a pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, pour the oil in. Wait until the oil is hot, add the beans into the pan. Stir to cover the bean in oil. Keep the beans moving to get an even brown.
When the beans are done, you will feel the difference in the beans through the spatula. The beans will move and feel like they are crunchy. It should take about 5 minutes or so. Remove the beans and drain.
In a mixing bowl, add the beans, sliced green onion and chili peppers.  Add a pinch of salt. Stir to mix well.
