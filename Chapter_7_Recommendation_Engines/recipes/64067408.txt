Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
2 cups packed brown sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup sugar
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 cans (13.4 ounces each) dulce de leche
12 ounces white baking chocolate, chopped
1/3 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon light corn syrup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°. Line a 13x9-in. baking pan with parchment paper, letting ends extend over sides by 1 inch.
In a large bowl, cream butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs and vanilla. In another bowl, whisk flour, baking powder and salt; gradually beat into creamed mixture. Spread onto bottom of prepared pan.
In a small bowl, mix sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle 2 tablespoons mixture over batter. Bake 25-30 minutes or until edges are light brown. Cool completely in pan on a wire rack.
Spread dulce de leche over crust. In a small saucepan, combine white baking chocolate, cream and corn syrup; cook and stir over low heat until smooth. Cool slightly. Spread over dulce de leche. Sprinkle with remaining cinnamon-sugar. Refrigerate, covered, at least 1 hour.
Lifting with parchment paper, remove from pan. Cut into bars. Refrigerate leftovers. Yield: 4 dozen.
Editor's Note: This recipe was tested with Nestle La Lechera dulce de leche; look for it in the international foods section. If using Eagle Brand dulce de leche (caramel flavored sauce), thicken according to package directions before using.
