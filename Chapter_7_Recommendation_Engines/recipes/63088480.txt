Ingredients:
Dry ingredients:
2 c. AP flour
1/2 c. granulated sugar
2 tsp. baking powder
1/4 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. grated lemon zest
Wet Ingredients:
1/2 c. whole milk
1/2 c. sour cream
8 Tbl. frozen butter, grated & put back into freezer
1 1/2 c. frozen blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven 425 degrees.
Grate butter & put in freezer to keep cold.
Mix all dry ingredients together, then mix all liquid ingredients together.
Toss frozen butter into dry ingredients until just coated. Quickly fold liquid ingredients into dry/butter mixture until just combined.
Heavily flour countertop/board. Dump dough onto board & quickly knead together until it comes together in a shaggy mass (only 6-7 turns).
Working quickly, roll out dough into a 12" square. Fold rolled dough into thirds with a bench scrapper, then into thirds the other direction, into a small square.
Dust a plate with flour & place folded dough onto plate. Put dough into freezer for 5 min. to chill butter again. Remove from freezer.
Flour board again. Roll out dough again into 12" square. Press frozen blueberries onto surface of dough. Quickly roll up dough & blueberries into a tight log with bench scrapper. Flatten log to about 4" wide. With a sharp knife, cut log into 4 equal pieces; then cut each piece diagonally to make 8 wedges.
Place scones on cookie sheet covered with parchment paper. Brush scones with melted butter & sprinkle with sugar.
Bake 425 degrees for 18-25 min.
