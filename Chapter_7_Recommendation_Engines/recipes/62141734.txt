2. Cut meat into large chunks.
3. Heat butter in saute pan until just starting to brown, then add lobster, garlic, and onion.  Cook until onions and garlic are soft, and meat is cooked but not coloured.  Stir regularly

Description: 
No, I am not making this up!  This is a very old irish recipe for lobster.  Somehow the idea of boiling your lawyer (lobster), then flambeeing him before dousing him in cream, is somehow a justice to the world!  Not only is the name fun, but it is an excellent recipe which is great when you have a few quid to spare!  If I don't want to go to the hassle of cleaning and boiling the shells, I will sometimes just serve this over toast points, or a past of some kind.  But the shells make a great presentation!
