Description: 
My husband came up with this unique combination and the family fell in love.  We use this as a filling for burritos.  You can pre-make and freeze the burritoes for an easy and instant meal.  To make a breakfast-style burrito, substitute scrambled eggs for 1/2 of the ground beef or pork.
