Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
3  egg whites
¾ cup seasoned bread crumbs
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (12 fluid ounce) can fat-free evaporated milk (divided)
1 tablespoon cornstarch
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
½ cup chopped fresh parsley
⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until the oil shimmers; meanwhile, beat the egg whites until frothy in a bowl, and place the bread crumbs in a separate flat bowl. Dip the chicken breasts into the egg white, dredge in crumbs, and brown on both sides in the hot oil until golden, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Place the chicken breasts into the baking dish.
In a small bowl, mix about 3 tablespoons of evaporated milk with the cornstarch until smooth. Pour the rest of the evaporated milk into a saucepan, and mix in Parmesan cheese, parsley, and black pepper. Over medium-low heat, bring the milk mixture just to a bare simmer, and whisk in the cornstarch mixture; let cook until thickened, about 1 minute. Pour the sauce over the chicken breasts; sprinkle top with mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbly and the cheese has melted, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chicken breast should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
