Ingredients:
1 cup butter (two sticks)
1 1-lb. bag of vanilla candy wafers (Can be purchased at a craft store or some grocery stores)
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 cup of flaked coconut

Directions:
With an electric hand mixer, mix together the butter, powdered sugar, water, salt, vanilla, mint, flour, and oatmeal. Add the flour and oatmeal a little at a time. Your dough will be very piecy and crumbly. Take a large teaspoon of dough and squish it into a ball, then roll between the palms of your hands to form into a small 1-inch ball. Place on a cookie sheet. Bake at 350Â°F for about 20 minutes. While the cookies are baking, put the vanilla candy wafers in a microwaveable dish and melt them in slow increments. It should be very smooth and creamy when melted. After the cookies have cooled a bit, you can dip them in the melted candy or spoon the melted candy over the cookies to cover them. Then, sprinkle the coconut onto the cookie so it sticks to it. You can also drizzle sprinkles over some of the cookies.
