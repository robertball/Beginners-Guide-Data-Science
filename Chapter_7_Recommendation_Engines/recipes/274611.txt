Ingredients:
Crushed ice
4 ripe Black Mission figs, halved
4 fluid ounces white rum
1 1/2 fluid ounces freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/2 fluid ounce honey
Club soda
2 sprigs fresh thyme

Directions:
Fill 2 highball glasses halfway with crushed ice.
Muddle 3 figs in a cocktail shaker. Add rum, lemon juice, and honey; stir until honey dissolves. Fill shaker halfway with ice. Cover and shake until well chilled.
Divide between glasses, without straining, and top with club soda. Slap thyme sprigs against a flat surface to bruise. Garnish each glass with a fig half and a thyme sprig.

Description: 
A hint of thyme adds an earthiness that balances the sweetness of the figs and the rum in this pretty, easy-sipping cocktail. To keep it from tasting medicinal, I use the thyme only as a fragrant garnish.
