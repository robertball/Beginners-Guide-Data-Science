Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package bacon, halved crosswise
1/4 cup maple syrup, divided, or to taste
1 cup crushed pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Pour 2 tablespoons maple syrup into a shallow bowl. Dip bacon slices in maple syrup and roll up. Arrange rolls seam-side down on the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 20 minutes.
Combine remaining 2 tablespoons maple syrup and pecans in a bowl. Drizzle over bacon rolls.
Continue baking until bacon is crisp and pecans are browned, about 30 minutes more.

Description: 
This is the first recipe I ever created on my own. I got my inspiration from a local brunch place and now everyone who has tasted it says it's way better than at the restaurant. It's the gem of any party! Enjoy hot or cold.
