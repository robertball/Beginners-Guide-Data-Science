Place potatoes in a large saucepan over medium heat, and cover with water. Bring to a boil, and cook 10 minutes, or until tender; drain.
Place cooked potatoes on an ungreased cookie sheet with the cut side up. Spread a spoonful of dressing on the top of each potato half. Sprinkle with cheese, and lightly dust with pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
