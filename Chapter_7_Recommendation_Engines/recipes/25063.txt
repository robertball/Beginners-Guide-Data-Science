Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups cake flour
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar for rolling

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, 1 cup confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Stir in the cake flour, then fold in the pecans. Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place them 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 15 to 19 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned. Cool cookies completely before rolling in  additional confectioners' sugar. If you are storing the cookies in a tin, add remaining sugar to the tin.

Description: 
My great grandma's recipe (duh). The combination of confectioners' sugar and cake flour makes them really melt in your mouth. Don't try to double unless you've got a really big mixer!
