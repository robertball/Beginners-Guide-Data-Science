Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 cup pumpkin puree
1 cup milk
1/2 cup canola oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/3 cup boiling water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners.
Combine sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer. Mix briefly until combined. Add pumpkin, milk, canola oil, and vanilla extract; mix on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add water and mix until just blended.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each almost all the way to the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let cool in trays for about 10 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
As I was craving a seasonal treat to use some leftover canned pumpkin, I created this modification of a widely available chocolate cake recipe. These delights are moist and delicious! You may frost with your favorite buttercream or cream cheese frosting and decorate, or leave plain. These babies are so moist, they don't demand frosting.
