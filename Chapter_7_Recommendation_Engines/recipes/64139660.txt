Ingredients:
1/2 cup unpopped popcorn kernels (organic preferred)
2 -3 Tbsp coconut oil for popping (I love Tropical Traditions oil)
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon garlic powder or granules
1 teaspoon onion powder or granules
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/8  1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Prepare popcorn using oil with preferred method.  My Basic Popcorn post has simple instructions and information about my favorite stovetop popcorn popper.  Air popped popcorn won’t work without additional oil since the seasoning needs moisture from the oil in order to adhere to the popcorn.
Combine all spices, and salt in a small bowl.
Blend seasonings in a spice or coffee grinder, or blend in blender to make a fine powder.
Sprinkle seasoning over popcorn and toss to coat.
