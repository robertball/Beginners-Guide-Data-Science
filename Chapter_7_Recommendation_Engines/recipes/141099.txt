Ingredients:
1 large skin-on, boneless duck breast half
1 small yellow onion, sliced
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons honey
1 (8 ounce) tub spreadable goat cheese
1 (10 ounce) package pre-baked pizza crust
salt and pepper to taste
10 ounces fontina cheese, shredded
1 tablespoon dried rosemary

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Cut several slits into the fatty skin of the duck breast.  In a skillet over medium heat, fry skin-side-down for 10 minutes. Flip and continue to cook in its own fat for 10 minutes more.  Remove from pan.  Carefully remove skin using a sharp knife, then slice, and set aside.
Meanwhile, in a separate skillet, cook onions in olive oil over medium heat until translucent and soft, about 5 minutes.  Mix in honey and continue to cook until brown and fragrant, 5 to 7 minutes more.
Spread goat cheese evenly over pizza crust and season with salt and pepper. Then layer with caramelized onions, fontina cheese, duck breast slices and rosemary.
Bake in preheated oven until cheese in center of pizza is completely melted, about 10 minutes.
