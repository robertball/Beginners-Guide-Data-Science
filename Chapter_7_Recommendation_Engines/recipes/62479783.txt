Description: 
Tabbouleh (originating from the Levantine Arabic word Tabbule literally meaning little spicy.) is a tasty  bulgur wheat salad that can be prepared many different ways depending on the variety of fresh herbs and vegetable used.Sometimes I like to stuff a whole wheat pita bread with this salad for a heart healthy sandwich!
