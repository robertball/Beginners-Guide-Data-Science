Ingredients:
2 pork shoulder (Boston butt) steaks
1 large onion, sliced
2 cups ketchup
2 cups water
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Season the pork steaks on both sides with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Place in the skillet and cook until browned on each side, about 4 minutes per side.
Place sliced onions on top of the steaks in the pan. Stir together the ketchup and water in a medium bowl; pour over the steaks. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and cook for about 2 hours. The longer you cook, the better the meat tastes.

Description: 
My mom used to make this and it is my favorite meal.  The pork butts come out so tender and juicy.  'Butts' are a favorite in my family. Serve with baked or mashed potatoes and a veggie.  If you like a lot of sauce then double the recipe, the sauce is fantastic.
