Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup grated carrots
1 cup raisins
1 cup chopped walnuts
3/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 pinch salt
1 1/4 cups hot water
3 1/2 teaspoons butter
3 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and 1 cup of sugar until light and fluffy. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended. The mixture will be dry. Stir in the carrots, raisins and chopped walnuts. Pour into a well-greased pudding mold or coffee can. Cover the top with aluminum foil.
Place the pudding mold into a large kettle or Dutch oven filled with 2 inches of water. Cover the pan, and bring to a simmer. Allow the pudding to steam for 4 to 4 1/2 hours over low heat. Remove from the mold. Serve with warm lemon sauce.
To make the lemon sauce, mix together 3/4 cup of sugar, cornstarch and salt in a saucepan. Stir in hot water, butter, lemon juice and vanilla. Cook over medium heat until thickened. Serve warm over the pudding.

Description: 
I received this recipe about 40 years ago from a friend who said it had been in her family for generations.  It comes out wonderfully moist and flavorful.  I have given it as Christmas gifts many times and it's always very well received.
