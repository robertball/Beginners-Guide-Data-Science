Ingredients:
6 corn tortillas (6" size), cut into 1" strips
1 medium onion, diced
1/2 lb. ground bison (you can used ground beef, but bison is lower in fat and calories)
1 14 oz. can diced tomatoes (with juice)
1 7 oz. can chopped green chilis
1 14 oz. can refried beans
1 7 oz. can chopped black olives
1/4 c. fat free sour cream
1 tbsp. ground cumin
1 tsp. ground coriander
1/4 c. chopped cilantro (optional)
1 tsp. ground red pepper (or to taste)
Tobasco to taste
2 c. low fat Mexican 4 Cheese Shredded mix

Directions:
Spray a large frying pan with Pam. Over medium heat, saute onions and meat until the onions are tender and the meet is fully browned.
Add the tomatoes, chilis, beans, olives, sour cream, cilantro, and seasonings. Stir well. Taste and adjust seasonings to your liking (some like it hot).
Spray an 8x8 glass baking dish with Pam. Cover the bottom of the dish with strips of tortilla (it should take 2 tortillas to do this). Pour 1/3 of the meat/bean mixture over the tortillas. Sprinkle 1/3 of the cheese on top, then make two more layers (tortillas, meat/bean mixture/cheese).
Cover and bake at 350F for 30 minutes. Remove from stove and let sit for 15 minutes before cutting. Garnish with a bit of cilantro.

I used my favorite taco ingredients and combined them into one dish. It's quick, it's tasty, and if you use low fat/low cal ingredients, it's diet friendly.
