Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups self-rising flour
1/4 - 1/2 tsp. salt
2 cups (1 pint) heavy whipping cream
1 lb. thick-sliced bacon, cooked until crispy and broken into pieces
1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 cup finely chopped sweet onion
1/2 stick of salted butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  In a large bowl whisk together flour and salt. Stir in bacon, cheese and onion.  Add cream and mix well.  Dough will be stiff.
Place on a floured surface and knead 30 seconds adding flour as needed if too sticky.
Pat out to 1 inch thickness and cut out with a 2 or 3 inch biscuit cutter dipping cutter in flour as needed.
Dip biscuits in melted butter coating all sides and place close together in a 9x13 baking dish.
Bake for 20 - 25 minutes or until nicely browned and slightly springy to the touch.

I found the cream biscuit recipe in a newspaper article ages ago and decided to see if it would work with bacon and cheese.  Boy, does it ever!
