Ingredients:
1 pound fresh lump crabmeat
3 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 (8 ounce) filet mignon steaks
coarse sea salt and coarsely ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Toss the crabmeat in the melted and cooled butter. Set aside until ready to serve.
Pat filets mignons dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in large heavy skillet over medium-high heat until hot, but not smoking. Brown filets on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer filets to an oiled baking pan and roast in the middle of the preheated oven until they start to firm, and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Top each filet with the crabmeat and butter mixture.
