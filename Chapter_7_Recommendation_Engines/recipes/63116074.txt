Ingredients:
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 cup evaporated milk
7 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup shortening/unslated butter
1/4 cup dark molasses
1 tbs pure vanilla extract
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add sugar, salt, eggs, evaporated milk, molasses, vanilla extract and blend well. Mix in 4 cups of the flour and beat until smooth. Add the shortening, and then the remaining 3 cups of flour. Cover and chill for up to 24 hours.
Roll out dough 1/8 inch thick. Cut into 2 1/2 inch squares. Fry in 360 degree F (180 degrees C) hot oil. If beignets do not pop up, oil is not hot enough. Drain onto paper towels.
Shake confectioners' sugar on hot beignets. Serve warm.
