Ingredients:
4 Cups of pecans
1/2 C. light corn syrup
1/4 C. sugar
2 tsp. kosher salt
1 1/2 tsp. cracked black pepper
1/2 -3/4 tsp cayenne pepper (depending on how hot you want it)
1 C. dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325. Spray 10 x 15 baking sheet w/ nonstick spray or butter it. (I spray lightly). Combine nuts and all remaining ingredients except the cranberries in a medium bowl, toss to coat well. Spread on a prepared baking sheet. (Some nuts may clump together). Bake until the nuts are a deep golden color and sugar mixture is bubbling. Stirring every 10-15 min. Bake for about 30 -45 min. Cool completely on  baking sheet. Break apart clumps and combine with the dried cranberries.

Description: 
One of my all time signature Christmas give aways. This however doesn't mean it's a seasonal snack. Goes well with a drink during happy hour, or tossed in a spinach salad. My entire family can't wait to get their hands on these when they know I've made them. Bonus! They are simple to make too!
