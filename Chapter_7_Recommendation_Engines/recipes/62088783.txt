Ingredients:
1 cup soft butter
1 cup sugar
1 egg
1 tsp. almond extract
2 tsp. baking powder
3  cups flour
4 cups powdered sugar
2 Tbl. soft butter
1 tsp. almond extract
a few drops of desired food coloring
1/8 cup boiling water

Directions:
Cream together butter and sugar
Beat in egg and almond extract
Mix together flour and baking powder.
Mix flour into butter mixture 1 cup at a time.  The dough should be kind of dry but still able to stick together. If too dry add water 1/2 tsp. at a time.
Divide dough in 1/2.
Roll each half out to about 1/2 inch thickness and cut with desired shapes.
Bake in preheated 375 degree oven for 7 minutes or until edges of cookie are just browning.
While cookies are baking:
In a large bowl pour in powdered sugar.  Add butter, almond extract and food coloring volcano style.
Pour in just enough of the hot water to make a frosting slightly thicker than spun honey.
Remove cookies to wire racks (over wax paper to avoid a big mess) and allow to cool for just 3 minutes before frosting.  Spoon frosting over center of cookie and smear to edge allowing frostng to run over the sides.  Cool completely before storing.
