Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package strawberry cake mix
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 large eggs
1/3 cup canola oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix together cake mix and baking powder in a large bowl and set aside.
Whisk together eggs, oil, and vanilla extract in a smaller bowl. Add egg mixture to cake mixture and stir vigorously to form a dough; be sure to incorporate all pockets of dry cake mix. Gently mix in chocolate chips.
Drop rounded balls of dough, about 2 1/2 tablespoons each, onto the prepared baking sheet; make balls taller than they are wide. Add 1 or 2 additional chocolate chips onto each cookie, if desired.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; do not let cookies brown.
Allow the soft cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 3 minutes. Cookies will sink as they cool; you can press down gently with your fingers if necessary. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
