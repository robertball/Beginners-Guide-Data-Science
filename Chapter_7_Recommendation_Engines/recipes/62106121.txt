Ingredients:
1 pkg (24 count) corn tortillas
6 cups shredded colby jack cheese
1 onion, medium chop
1 large can chopped mild green chiles
1 can each mild and hot enchilada sauce

Directions:
In a large bowl combine the cheese, onions and chiles and set aside.
Combine the cans of enchilada sauce in a shallow bowl, large enough to dip the tortillas, and set aside.
Prepare a 9x13 pan by coating the bottom of the pan with about 1/3 cup of enchilada sauce
Warm the tortillas-the easy way is to wrap them in a damp paper towel and microwave for 45 seconds to 1 minutes.  This method is much quicker but tends to make the tortillas soggy.  If I have time, I heat them on a hot griddle sprayed with Pam for 20 seconds on each side.
Dip warmed tortilla in enchilada sauce.
Scoop a handful of cheese mixture (about 1/3 cup) and spread on the near edge of the tortilla.
Firmly roll the enchilada and place seam side down in the baking dish.
Repeat until all the cheese has been used up.
Pour any remaining sauce over the enchiladas.
Cover dish with foil
Bake at 350' for 20 minutes or until the cheese is gooey and bubbling.
Remove from oven and let sit 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I make these for our Boy Scout dinners, and the pan always comes home clean. My daughter (Queen Picky) will eat 6 of these at a sitting. Good with a simple lettuce and tomato salad.
