Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 2 minutes.
Place pork chops in a 6-inch silicone cake pan and pour 1/2 of the brown sugar-soy sauce on top. Transfer the silicone pan to the air fryer basket.
Cook in the preheated air fryer for 9 minutes. Turn pork chops and cook for another 9 minutes. Pour remaining sauce on top of pork chops and serve immediately.
