Ingredients:
4 slices day old bread
2 tbsp butter
2 lbs cooked cold potatoes (use a starchy variety)
1 1/4 cup flour
2 eggs
1 tsp salt

Directions:
Make croutons by cutting bread into cubes.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
Add the bread cubes and fry, stirring frequently until nicely browned on all sides. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
Rice or mash the cold potatoes
Mix into potatoes: 1 cup flour, eggs and salt to make a dough that holds together when formed into dumplings. If the mixture is too moist, add a bit more flour.
Form dumplings, approx. 2 inches in diameter, adding a few croutons in the middle of each dumpling
Drop gently into pot of boiling, salted water.
Simmer gently, uncovered about 15-20 minutes

Description: 
These dumplings really taste best when they've got the bread croutons in the middle, so try not to miss that step, even if your're in a hurry!
