3. In another bowl, mix flour, oats, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.
4. Add the dry ingredients into the banana mixture. Mix well, scraping the sides of the bowl to make sure the wet ingredients are well incorporated.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe one day when I had some over-ripe bananas and no eggs or milk. Don't be scared because they are vegan. They are delicious! (and healthy too)
