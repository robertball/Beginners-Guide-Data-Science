Description: 
My daughter Tyler developed a peanut allergy at the age of fourteen and was heartbroken because peanut butter is one of her favorite foods. Just recently we discovered a brand of soy nut butter which tastes amazingly like the real thing. I'm always experimenting in the kitchen and came up with this for her. Obviously, real peanut butter in this recipe would be awesome!
