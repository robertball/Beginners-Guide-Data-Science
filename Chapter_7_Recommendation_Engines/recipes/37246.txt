Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup butter
1 egg, beaten
1/3 cup cream
4 large apple - peeled, cored and thinly sliced
Struesel Topping
2 tablespoons cold butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).  Lightly butter an 8 inch square baking dish.
Sift together 1 1/2 cups of flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder.  Cut in 1/2 cup of butter until the mixture is crumbly.  Stir together the egg with the cream and gently mix into the flour until a soft dough has formed.  Press into prepared baking dish.  Layer the apples into the dish overlapping, in neat rows.  Prepare streusel by mixing the brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, and cinnamon together in a small bowl.  Cut in 2 tablespoons butter until the mixture is crumbly.  Sprinkle over apples.
Bake in preheated oven until apples have softened, and topping has browned, about 25 minutes.
