Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked white rice
2 1/4 cups water
1 pound frozen Market Pantry™ Raw Shrimp, peeled
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
3 tablespoons Market Pantry™ Butter
1 (3.5 ounce) package A Taste of Thai® Peanut Sauce Mix
1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk
1 tablespoon Archer Farms™ Curry Powder
1 cup chopped tomatoes
1/4 cup chopped cilantro

Directions:
Cook rice as package directs.
Heat grill. In medium bowl combine shrimp, lime juice and butter; set aside (butter will harden). In medium saucepan combine sauce mix, coconut milk and curry powder; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low, add tomatoes and simmer 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Spray grill basket with nonstick cooking spray. When ready to grill, place shrimp in grill basket on gas grill over medium heat or on charcoal grill 4 to 6 inches from medium coals. Cook 4 to 6 minutes or until shrimp turn pink, turning once, discarding any remaining lime butter marinade.
To serve, spoon sauce over rice. Top with cooked shrimp, sprinkle with cilantro.
