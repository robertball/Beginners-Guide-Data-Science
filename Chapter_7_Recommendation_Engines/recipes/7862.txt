Ingredients:
1/3 cup sifted cake flour
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 cup white sugar
6 egg whites
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup white sugar
5 teaspoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup white sugar
1 cup milk
2 eggs
2 tablespoons amaretto liqueur

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Sift flour, cocoa, and 1/4 cup of the white sugar together.
Beat egg whites with cream of tartar and salt until soft peaks form, gradually add 1/2 cup sugar beating until stiff and shiny, add vanilla.  Sift dry mixture over beaten egg whites gradually and gently fold in.  Spoon batter into one 9x5 inch ungreased loaf pan.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 25 minutes or until done. Invert pan and cool completely. Remove cake and cut it into 3 layers. Spread almond filling between the layers and dust top with sifted confectioners' sugar. Makes about 10 servings.
To Make Almond Filling: Combine the remaining 1/4 cup white sugar, cornstarch and salt in a saucepan. Mix the beaten eggs and milk together and stir them into the sugar mixture. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until thick and bubbling. Cook for an additional 2 minutes. Remove from heat and add the almond liqueur and stir well. Cover the surface of the fill in with plastic wrap and chill completely before using.
