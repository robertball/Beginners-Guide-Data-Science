Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust
1 cup evaporated milk
1 cup canned pumpkin
3/4 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/4 teaspoon maple-flavored extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a 9-inch pie plate with pie crust.
Combine evaporated milk, pumpkin, sugar, eggs, maple syrup, maple extract, cinnamon, salt, vanilla extract, and nutmeg in a bowl. Mix until well blended using an electric mixer. Pour into the pie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue baking until a knife inserted into the pie comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
