Ingredients:
8 medium yellow, green or sweet red peppers
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 clove garlic, minced
1 medium onion, minced
1/2 cup finely chopped cabbage
1 medium carrot, shredded
1/2 cup shredded zucchini
1 (28 ounce) can tomatoes with liquid, cut up
1/2 cup uncooked long-grain rice
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut the tops off each pepper and reserve. Cook peppers in boiling water until crisp-tender, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from water and rinse with cold water. Remove stems from pepper tops and chop enough of the tops to make 1/3 cup. In a large skillet, brown ground beef over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, cabbage, carrot, zucchini and reserved chopped peppers. Saute until vegetables are tender. Add tomatoes, rice, sugar, basil and pepper. Cover and reduce heat to simmer. Cook until the rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Stuff hot meat mixture into peppers. Serve immediately.

Growing up and living in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, we've always had fresh vegetables from the garden, and this recipe allows me to use many of them. These stuffed peppers are equally perfect for lunch or dinner.
