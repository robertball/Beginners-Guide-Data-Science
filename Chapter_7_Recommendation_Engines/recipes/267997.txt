Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil, or more as needed
2 red onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (1 1/2 inch) piece chopped fresh ginger, or to taste
1 teaspoon raw sugar, or more to taste
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons curry paste, or more to taste
4 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 cup red lentils
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, chopped or pureed, juices reserved
1/2 teaspoon vegetable bouillon, or more to taste
1 teaspoon lemon juice, or more to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a pot over medium-low heat and cook onions, garlic, and ginger until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with sugar and cumin, and cook until sugar caramelizes, about 2 minutes, making sure cumin does not burn. Stir in curry paste; cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add potatoes, lentils, coconut milk, and tomatoes and their juice. Season with vegetable bouillon and bring to a boil.
Cover and simmer until potatoes and lentils are cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with lemon juice, salt, and pepper.

Description: 
This is a great one-pot dish that's tasty and filling. Careful when measuring out the curry paste - depending on its spiciness, 1 teaspoon can be enough sometimes. If you are using a mild one, you might need more. If you want to save calories, use reduced-fat coconut milk.
