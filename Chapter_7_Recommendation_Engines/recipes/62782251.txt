Ingredients:
1 dozen eggs
1 can regrigerator biscuits
1 lb. breakfast sausage
1-2 cans cream of chicken or mushroom soup
1 cup sharp cheddar cheese
1 cup mild cheddar cheese
8 strips of bacon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°.
Fry bacon. Drain & crumble. Set aside.
Scramble eggs.  Add bacon to eggs while cooking.  Set aside.
Place biscuits in bottom of casserole dish or 9 x 13 pan.  Flatten biscuits to cover most of the bottom of the dish.
Put cooked eggs on top of biscuits.  Put sausage on top of eggs.  Pour 1-2 cans of soup over sausage, depending on taste.  More soup makes it creamier, less soup makes it drier.
Sprinkles cheeses on top of soup.
Bake for 15 minutes at 400°, until biscuits are done (test with a fork down the side of the dish).
