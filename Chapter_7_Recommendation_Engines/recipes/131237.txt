Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked pearl barley
2 cups water
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup minced onion
1 teaspoon salt
2 bay leaves
2 carrots, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms, chopped
2 teaspoons dried dill weed
1 teaspoon soy sauce
8 cups turkey broth
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring the barley and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the barley is tender, about 30 minutes.
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, salt, and bay leaves. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the carrot and celery; cook for 5 more minutes. Pour in the wine and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the mushrooms, dill, soy sauce, turkey broth, and cooked barley; season to taste with pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 1 1/2 hours.

Description: 
You can cook up a chicken or turkey carcass, or add stock and leftover turkey. Great way to end the Thanksgiving or Christmas turkey. I lost this recipe and spent two months searching for it. When it fell out of an unexpected book, I was thrilled and made the soup right away. If you like barley and mushrooms, you will love this soup.
