Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package angel food cake mix
5 teaspoons confectioners' sugar
1 (8 ounce) container reduced fat strawberry yogurt
1 (1 ounce) package instant sugar-free vanilla pudding mix
3 drops red food coloring
2 cups reduced-fat whipped topping

Directions:
Line a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan with waxed paper. Prepare cake according to package directions. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool for 5 minutes. Turn cake onto a kitchen towel dusted with confectioners' sugar. Gently peel off waxed paper. Roll up jelly-roll style in the towel, starting with a short side. Cool on a wire rack.
In a bowl, whisk the yogurt, pudding mix and food coloring if desired. Fold in whipped topping. Unroll cake; spread filling evenly over cake to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up. Cover and freeze. Remove from freezer 30 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
There's always room for dessert-especially when it's this eye-catching frozen fare. 'We like strawberry yogurt in the filling, but different flavors work well, too,' suggests Joan Colbert. The make-ahead dessert is often requested at her Sigourney, Iowa home.Modified from: Angel Food Cake Roll
