Ingredients:
1 (8 inch) flour tortilla
2 ounces shredded Oaxaca cheese
1 tablespoon Buffalo sauce
1 tablespoon ranch dressing
2 ounces chopped cooked chicken breast

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Place tortilla onto skillet and top with Oaxaca cheese. Drizzle on Buffalo sauce and ranch dressing. Place chicken one half of the tortilla and cook until cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.
Fold the tortilla in half, enclosing the filling. Flip once in the pan, and cook until both sides are golden brown, about 3 minutes more.
Remove from skillet and cut quesadilla into 4 triangles.

Description: 
Quick-to-fix snack using just 5 ingredients. Crank up the heat if you wish by adding more Buffalo sauce. If you don't have Oaxaca cheese, use a mild cheese like mozzarella. Feel free to use a rotisserie chicken for even faster prep! Serve with additional ranch and Buffalo sauce if desired.
