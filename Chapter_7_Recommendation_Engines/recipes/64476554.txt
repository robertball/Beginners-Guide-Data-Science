Ingredients:
2 tsp. white vinegar
4 eggs

Directions:
Fill large saucepan a little over half full with water, add vinegar, and set over medium heat until almost simmering - the water will have tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the pan.
Use a spoon to stir the water to create a whirlpool effect (helps keep the egg intact).
Crack an egg and place it gently into the center of the whirlpool, opening the egg as close to the water as possible.
Turn off the heat, cover, and let cook without stirring for 2-3 minutes for a soft yolk and 3-4 minutes for a more solid yolk.
Remove egg with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel. You can cook eggs one at a time using this method or all at once without stirring.
