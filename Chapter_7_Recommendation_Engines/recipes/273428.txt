Ingredients:
Filling:
3 1/2 cups frozen blueberries
3 tablespoons chia seeds
2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste
1/2 lemon, zested and juiced
1/4 teaspoon salt
Topping:
2/3 cup medium-grind cornmeal (such as Bob's Red MillÂ®)
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 stick cold butter, cut into cubes
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 cup fresh corn kernels

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix blueberries, chia seeds, sugar, lemon zest, juice, and salt together in a 2-quart baking dish. Set aside.
Whisk cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture looks like small peas. Mix in buttermilk, then fold in corn kernels.
Drop golf ball-sized scoops of the cornmeal batter over the blueberries.
Bake in the preheated oven until blueberry juices are bubbling and the topping is golden brown, about 40 minutes. Cool for 15 to 30 minutes before serving.
