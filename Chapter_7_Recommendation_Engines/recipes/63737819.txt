Ingredients:
1-8 oz low fat cream cheese cut into 1 inch cubes
1 cup Parmesan cheese (use the best quality available)
1 stick butter
2 cups fat free milk (or what you have on hand)
1/2 tsp black pepper (or more to taste)
1/2 tsp salt (or more to taste)
1/2 tbsp onion powder
1 tbsp fresh basil chopped
1 tsp finely minced fresh garlic
2 pounds raw shrimp, cleaned and defrosted.  Drain well. (I use frozen in the small size 50-60 count)
1 lb cooked fettuccine
1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley
dash crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
1-2 pinches of nutmeg

Directions:
Cook the fettuccine according to package directions.
In a large sauce pan add butter and garlic.  Cook until butter is melted.  About 3 minutes.
Add the cleaned shrimp to the saucepan and cook another 5 to 10 minutes or until the shrimp cooks through and turns pink. Gently remove Shrimp with a slotted spoon, reserving liquid in the pan.
Add chopped parsley, basil, black pepper,salt, onion powder and nutmeg to the pan, stir to blend, cook another 3 minutes approximately.
Add the cream cheese to the saucepan and stir to melt. A whisk works best for this.
Add the Parmesan cheese and milk. Cook over low heat until smooth and creamy and sauce starts to thicken and bubble.
Add the shrimp back into the pan and stir to coat.
If you feel the sauce is too thick you can add a little of the pasta water until creaminess is just right for you.
Serve over immediately over linguini.
