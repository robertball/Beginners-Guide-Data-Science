Ingredients:
1 pint fresh blueberries
1 pint fresh strawberries, sliced
3 bananas, sliced
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup vital wheat gluten
1 double crust ready-to-use pie crust

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the blueberries, strawberries, and sliced bananas into a mixing bowl. Sprinkle with the sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, flour, and gluten; mix gently. Pour the fruit mixture into the pie shell, cover with the top crust, and pinch the seams shut. Cut slits in the top crust with a knife to create slots for the steam. Place the pie onto a baking sheet to catch drips.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 35 minutes.
