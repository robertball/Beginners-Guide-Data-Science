Ingredients:
3 (7 ounce) bars milk chocolate with almonds candy (such as Hershey'sÂ® Milk Chocolate with Almonds)
1 cup miniature marshmallows

Directions:
Place the candy bars in a microwave safe bowl, and cook in the microwave on Low until melted, approximately 5 minutes. Stir and allow to cool enough to prevent the marshmallows from melting when added to the chocolate. Once cool, stir in the marshmallows and pour into a 8x8 inch baking dish. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Break into pieces to serve.
