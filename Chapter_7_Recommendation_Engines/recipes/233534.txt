Ingredients:
2 tablespoons grapeseed oil
2 pita bread rounds, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 cups shredded romaine lettuce
1 green bell pepper, cut into bite-size pieces
1 large roma tomato, cut into bite-size pieces
1/2 red onion, sliced
1/2 English cucumber, cut into bite-size pieces
1/4 cup chopped feta cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint

Dressing:

1 lemon, juiced, or more to taste
1 clove garlic, grated
1/2 teaspoon Greek seasoning
1/2 teaspoon ground sumac (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat grapeseed oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir pita bread pieces in hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer bread pieces to a paper-towel lined plate.
Stir romaine lettuce, tomato, red onion, cucumber, feta cheese, mint, and parsley together in a large bowl.
Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, Greek seasoning, sumac, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until completely combined. Pour olive oil mixture and pita bread pieces into lettuce mixture; toss to coat.

Description: 
My personal take on Lebanese fattoush salad. A refreshing and healthy salad with lots of flavor. To make this salad into a hearty meal, add strips of grilled chicken or white fish. Makes a great side dish to any Middle Eastern or Mediterranean-style cuisine.
