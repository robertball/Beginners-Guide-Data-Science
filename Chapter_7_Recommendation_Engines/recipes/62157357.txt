Ingredients:
2 Large chicken breasts (thawed)
1/4 cup diced bacon
1/2 cup cream cheese (softened)
1 tbsp. chopped chives or green onions
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
salt
pepper

Directions:
Cut into the thick end of the chicken breast to create a pocket for stuffing.
Season the chicken breast with salt and pepper to taste
Cook the bacon until desired crunch
Mix with cream cheese and green onions (I put everything in a Ziplock bag and mix it through the bag with my fingers)
Use a decorating bag to stuff the mixture into the chicken (or cut the end of your Ziplock bag and use it the same way)
Grill on a non-stick pan until both sides are brown
Add cream, lower heat and cover
Cook until chicken looks ready, then flip to other side
Sprinkle each breast with cheddar cheese
Cover until cheese is melted and chicken juices run clear
