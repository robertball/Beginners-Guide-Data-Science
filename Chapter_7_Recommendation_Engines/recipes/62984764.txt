Ingredients:
3 (32oz) bags, Jars or cans saurkraute
2 (16oz) cans of turnip greens
salt & pepper
2 onions peeled (I cut mine in 1/4's or 1/8ths but if your kids hate onions you might want to mince them to hide them)
1 (12oz) can frozen apple juice take outta freezer and put in fridge in the morning of the day you want to make this(I get the darker colored juice)(have used grape, cranapple, crangrape, cranblueberry and pinapple juice in a pinch if outta my favorite apple juice but apple tastes best!)
1 juice can full of water (you can add more water if needed )
1 1/2 - 2 cups brown sugar (after tasting original recipe you can add more or less depending on your families likes. Personally I just add a couple handfuls)
3 Lb's Kilbasa cut in 3in chunks

Directions:
open all saurkraute and greens put all in strainer mix them all together and rinse lightly let set in sink few mins (you can cut up onions and kilbassa while you wait)
put strained kraute, greens and onions in large baking pan
add salt and pepper mix well and make even layer in pan
put juice, water and sugar in a bowl mix well and pour over kraute mix
add 3 inch chunks of kilbassa
Bake at 350 untill most of liquid is gone and kilbassa browned about 2 hrs(I stir about every 20 mins untill done)

Description: 
A New years family tradition. We eat it on New Years to help us remember to temper the bitter w/the sweet in the coming year! It is also kid friendly haven't met a kid yet that don't like it :>) If your kid hates saurkraute try this. Quick and easy to make but does have a longer cooking time to reduce the liquids and bring out the sweetness. You can use it as a meal or a side dish and some family members believe it or not get a bowl full for a late night snack!
