Ingredients:
6 C Whole Milk
¾ C Arborio Rice
¾ C Sugar
¼ tsp Salt
1 tsp Vanilla
1 C Heavy Whipping Cream
2 Whole Eggs
2 Egg Yolks
Cinnamon
Chopped Walnuts and Almonds

Directions:
Mix milk, rice, half of the sugar, salt, and vanilla in a pan. Bring to a boil. While the milk is heating up,
blend the rest of the sugar with the eggs into a creamy custard. Once the milk mixture has reached a
boil, reduce the heat and let simmer with cover off for 30-40mins. After the milk mixture has thickened,
fold in the custard and return to heat for 5mins or until thick again. In a cold mixing bowl, whip the
heavy cream until it makes a whipped cream. Remove the milk and custard mixture from the heat, let
cool for 10mins. Fold in the whipped cream. Put the whole mixture in a serving dish and refrigerate for
at least 2 hours. Garnish with chopped nuts, cinnamon and whipped cream.
