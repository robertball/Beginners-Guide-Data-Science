1/2 cup heavy cream
2 tbsp butter

Add shallot and saute until tender, add garlic and saute 1 minute.
Add white wine and lower heat to medium.  Reduce by half.
Add cream and combine.

Description: 
I've made several variations of this pasta dish, but this version is always everyone's favorite!  You can switch out for different veggies if you'd like (mushrooms go great as well), but always be sure to leave the wonderful sauce and proscuitto.  It also works great if you add chicken! Enjoy!
