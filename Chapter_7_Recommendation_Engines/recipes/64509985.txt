Ingredients:
3 large red bell peppers
8 ounces presliced cremini mushrooms
1 tbsp olive oil
1 cup chopped red onion
4 garlic cloves, minced
3/4 cup unsalted chickpeas, rinsed and drained
3/4 cup frozen green peas, thawed
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil, divided
5/8 tsp kosher salt, divided
1/2 cup chopped walnuts, toasted
1/4 cup uncooked bulgur
2 tbsp low-fat milk
2 tsp Dijon mustard
1/2 tsp black pepper
8 ounces lean ground beef
3 ounces grated Parmesan cheese (about 3/4 cup)
1 large egg, lightly beaten
cooking spray
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Preheat broiler to high.
Cut bell peppers in half lengthwise; discard seeds and membrane.   Place pepper halves, skin side up, on a foil-lined baking tray; flatten with hand.  Broil 10 minutes or until blackened.  Wrap peppers in foil, sealing edges.   Let stand 10 minutes.   Peel.   Finely chop 2 pepper halves; place in a large bowl.  Set aside remaining 4 pepper halves.
Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees.
Place mushrooms in a food processor; pulse 10 times or until finely chopped.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.   Add oil to pan; swirl to coat.   Add onion; saute 6 minutes or until tender.   Add garlic; saute 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Add mushrooms; saute 10 minutes or until liquid almost evaporates, stirring occasionally.   Cool 5 minutes.   Add mushroom mixture to chopped bell peppers.
Place chickpeas and peas in food processor (do not clean from mushrooms); pulse 10 times or until finely chopped.   Add pea mixture to mushroom mixture.   Add 2 tbsp basil, 1/2 tsp salt, walnuts and next 7 ingredients (through egg); gently mix well until combined.   Spoon mixture into a 9x5-inch loaf pan coated with cooking spray.   Bake at 375 degrees for 40 minutes or until a thermometer registers 155 degrees.   Let stand 10 minutes.  Cut loaf into 6 slices.  Sprinkle with remaining 2 tbsp basil.
Combine remaining 4 bell pepper halves, vinegar, and remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt in a blender or food processor; process until smooth.   Serve sauce with meat loaf.
