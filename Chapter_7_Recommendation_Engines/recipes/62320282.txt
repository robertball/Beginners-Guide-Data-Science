Description: 
The secret to this dish is the meat sauce (you need the coriander)- No one will ever guess it is made out of ground turkey and turkey pepperoni! It's creamy, rich and full of garlic.  Goes great with crusty Italian bread and a salad.
The substitution of turkey for ground beef and regular pepperoni along with the reduced fat cream cheese helps save a few calories.
