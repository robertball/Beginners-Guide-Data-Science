Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine (at room temperature)
1 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup Pillsbury BEST® All Purpose Flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup oats (quick-cooking or old-fashioned)
1/2 cup SMUCKER'S® Red Raspberry Preserves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Coat an 8 x 8-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
In a medium mixing bowl, beat butter and brown sugar until smooth and fluffy. Beat in almond extract.
Mix in flour, baking powder and oats until mixture is combined and crumbly. Reserve 1/4 cup of the mixture for topping; set aside. Pat remaining mixture into the bottom of prepared baking pan.
Spoon preserves on top of oat layer, spreading as much as possible without disturbing the bottom layer. Sprinkle reserved topping on the top of preserve layer.
Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack. When cooled, cut into squares.
