Ingredients:
5 lb beef brisket
1 Tbl liquid smoke
1/4 c lemon juice
3 Tbl Montreal Steak seasoning
1 Tbl red pepper flakes
1/4 c beef stock

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees.
Place the brisket in a glass baking dish, fat side down.
Combine Montreal steak seasoning and red pepper flakes in a small bowl.
Rub the seasoning mixture on the brisket, pressing it into the meat. Flip the brisket over (now it should be fat side up), and rub the remaining seasoning mixture in.
Combine the lemon juice, beef stock and liquid smoke. Pour slowly over the brisket.
Cover the meat baking dish tightly with aluminium foil.
Bake at 275 degrees for 5 hours.
