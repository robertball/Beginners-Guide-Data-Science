Ingredients:
Whole Grain Lasagna Noodles*
2 tbsp Oil
Bag of Spinach
1 Medium Zucchini
1 Large Onion
Half Bell Pepper
1 Cups Lentils**
1 Medium Carrot
Pkg Vegan Cheese***
2 Jars Marinara Sauce
fresh Basil & Oregano****
4 Garlic Cloves
Vegan Ricotta*****

Directions:
Medium dice the onion and bell pepper. Mince garlic cloves. Slice zucchini and carrots. Chiffonade a small handful of fresh basil and oregano.
Heat oil in medium to large pot over high heat and sauté vegetables for 2 minutes. Lower heat to medium and continue to sauté until vegetables are browned and caramelized.
Set aside a cup of marinara sauce mixed with two cups of water to the side for later.
Pour the rest of the marinara sauce and lentils in the pot and stir until fully incorporated. Salt to taste.
Add fresh basil and oregano to sauce and cover with pot. Cook on medium to low heat. If you are using vegan beef crumbles instead of lentils, don’t cover pot. cook until lentils are fully cooked, should take 15-20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 360 degrees.
In a large casserole or baking pan, cover bottom of pan with thin layer of cooked marinara mixture. On top of that, add layer of uncooked pasta sheet. Layer on another larger layer of marinara, then add a layer of spinach, then a layer of ricotta. Don’t worry about perfectly covering the spinach layer with ricotta, just be sure to cover equally throughout the pan layer. Top off the ricotta with vegan cheese, then cover with a pasta sheet. repeat this process until you reach top of pan. To finish off the layers, add a pasta sheet and sparsely layer on spinach, ricotta, and vegan cheese.
Take the marinara and water mixture you set aside and pour it into the lasagna pan until fully immersed. Tightly cover with foil and place in oven.
Leave it to bake for 45 minutes to an hour. You want the moisture in the pan to fully cook the pasta, so leave to cook for as long as you can. After 45 minutes, check to see that the water has evaporated and pasta is al dente. Remove foil and let pan sit in oven for another ten minutes or until the top of the lasagna is browned, although this is optional.
Let cool for a little and then serve.
*If using already cooked pasta sheets, don’t add the marinara and water mixture to pan.
**You can sub the lentils with two cups of vegan beef crumbles/vegan ground beef. Don’t cover pan while cooking, shouldn’t take longer than ten minutes.
***I recommend the Daiya brand mozzarella cheese.
****Fresh herbs are best, but if not using fresh herbs then use 2 tsp each of oregano and basil.
