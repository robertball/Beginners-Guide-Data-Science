Ingredients:
10 lbs. cucumbers (picked before they are too large to avoid seediness)
2 to 3 cups of pickling lime
Water (enough to cover)
8 cups sugar
8 cups apple cider vinegar
4 tablespoons pickling spice

Directions:
Wash cucumbers
Trim ends
Slice in 1/2 inch slices in a large plastic container with a lid
Add lime and water to pickles and stir to mix lime throughout the cucumbers (the lime will settle but is normal)
Allow the lime, water, and cucumber mixture to soak overnight
The following day rinse the cucumbers and place back in container and fill with water to cover the cucumbers for one hour
Repeat the step above two more times
After soaking the third time combine sugar, vinegar, and pickling spice, in large stock pot and stir to dissolve sugar (it may not dissolve completely)
Add cucumbers and cover
Allow the mixture to soak overnight
Boil the mixture for 30 minutes then transfer to clean and sterile canning jars and seal quickly
Listen for popping seals to confirm proper sealing
Refrigerate jars that do not seal properly (or eat)

Description: 
My mother was famous for these pickles.  Luckily she passed the recipe on to me and is a hit with everyone who tries them.  They are great in potato, chicken, and tuna salads or some just like to eat them out of the jar like candy.
