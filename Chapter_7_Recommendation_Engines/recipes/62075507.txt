Description: 
This red curry recipe is from a Thai friend whose mother is a cook in an upscale restaurant in Bangkok. The key ingredients in this dish are fresh kaffir lime and Thai basil leaves. Using either one of those leaves is good enough, even regular basil leaves. You can tone down the heat by adding more water or coconut cream.
