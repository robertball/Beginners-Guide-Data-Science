Ingredients:
Pico de Gallo
3 medium tomatoes, chopped
1/3 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 serrano chile pepper, seeded and minced
1 lime, juiced
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
salt and pepper to taste
Turkey Burgers
1 pound ground turkey
1 egg
1/2 onion, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
In a bowl, mix together the tomatoes, the 1/3 cup chopped onion, 2 of the 4 cloves of minced garlic, serrano chile pepper, lime juice, and cilantro. Stir in salt and pepper to taste, and set aside.
Place the ground turkey in a bowl. Add the egg, the 1/2 onion, minced, remaining 2 cloves minced garlic, coriander, celery salt, chili powder, cumin, and chopped parsley. Using your hands, work the mixture until all ingredients are evenly blended. Form mixture into 4 patties.
Heat a large, non-stick skillet for medium-high heat. Cook the turkey burgers for 5 minutes per side, or until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear. Reduce the heat as necessary during cooking. Serve with Pico de Gallo salsa.

Description: 
I serve this without the roll for a great low-carb meal. If you decide to use a roll, drain the Pico de Gallo before placing on top of the burger to prevent the bun from getting wet. Fresh cilantro is a must for the Pico de Gallo. While you may choose to use a little cooking spray, it is not necessary as the burgers, at first a little sticky, will firm up as they cook.
