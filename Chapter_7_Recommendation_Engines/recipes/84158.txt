Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 cup butter
2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
2 cups persimmon pulp

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and ginger in a bowl; set aside. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the persimmon pulp.  Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until slightly puffed and golden brown, about 12 minutes. Cool on the pan for 5 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
