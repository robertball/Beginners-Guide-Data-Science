Description: 
This colorful salad is tasty and healthy, a great way to get your kids or husband to eat their vegetables. You can substitute fresh, chopped basil leaves for the dried and balsamic for the red wine vinegar, if desired. Sometimes I add mango or papaya for a nice change. The possibilities are endless.
