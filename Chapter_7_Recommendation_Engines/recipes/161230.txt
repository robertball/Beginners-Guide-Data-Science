Description: 
I first had this colorful salad at a tailgate before a Jimmy Buffett concert, thus the name!  It's perfect for spring and summer get-togethers when the ingredients are fresh and ripe.  My supper club likes it even better with Buffett playing in the background! Serve with poppy seed dressing.
