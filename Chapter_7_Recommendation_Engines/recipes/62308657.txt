Ingredients:
2 Large Russet Potatoes (washed)
2 TBS Olive Oil
Cooking Spray
Kosher Salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees and place a foil lined baking sheet on the bottom rack.
Cut each potato into thin sticks. (I slice mine into four planks and slice each plank into 4 sticks).
Put the sliced potatoes on a microwave safe plate and microwave for 4 minutes.
Transfer potatoes to the hot baking sheet.
Spray with a little cooking spray and olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and toss to coat.
Bake on lower rack for 30-35 minutes until brown- turning once.
Sprinkle with additional salt while hot if needed.
