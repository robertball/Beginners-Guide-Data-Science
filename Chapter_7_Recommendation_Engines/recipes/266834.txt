Directions:
Combine ranch dressing and hot sauce in a small bowl. Divide dressing equally between 5 wide-mouthed, quart-sized glass canning jars, forming the first layer. Add equal amounts of celery and carrots, forming the next 2 layers.
Place 3 ounces of chicken in each jar. Top chicken with 2 cups of salad greens in each jar. Place 1/4 cup blue cheese on top of salad greens. Seal and refrigerate jars until ready to use.
Divide croutons evenly into 5 small lidded containers. When ready to eat, dump jar contents and croutons into a bowl and toss.
