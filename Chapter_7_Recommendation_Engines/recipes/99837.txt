Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed
1 eggplant with ends trimmed, cut lengthwise into 1/4 inch slices
8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped

Directions:
Heat enough of the oil to coat the bottom of a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry slices of eggplant until browned and slightly crispy. Place them on paper towels to drain.
Meanwhile, place the chocolate in a heat proof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat.
Arrange the eggplant slices on a large serving platter and drizzle the chocolate over them. Don't cover the eggplant completely. Serve immediately.

Great for parties easy to make .. unusual and yet so yummy! If you want the melted chocolate to be sweeter, stir in some sweetened condensed milk to suit your taste.
