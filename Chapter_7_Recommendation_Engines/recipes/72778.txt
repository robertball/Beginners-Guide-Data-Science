Ingredients:
6 lemons, juiced
1 1/2 cups soy sauce
1 1/2 cups white wine
4 teaspoons prepared mustard
2 teaspoons honey
salt and pepper to taste
4 (4 ounce) fillets salmon

Directions:
In a bowl, mix the lemon juice, soy sauce, white wine, mustard, and honey. Season with salt and pepper.
Place each salmon fillet on a large piece of aluminum foil. Fold the foil around the salmon on all sides, forming a basket shape. Pour equal amounts of the marinade mixture over each salmon fillet. Tightly seal the foil packets. Allow salmon fillets to marinate at least 1 hour in the refrigerator.
Preheat the grill for high heat.
Place foil packets on the grill, and cook 10 to 15 minutes, until salmon is easily flaked with a fork.
