Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) boneless pork loin roast
1 1/2 tablespoons Hawaiian sea salt
1 tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring

Directions:
Set roast in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Rub liberally with Hawaiian sea salt and pierce the meat all over with a large fork or narrow knife. Drizzle with liquid smoke. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 120 minutes. Allow 15 to 30 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 15 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Transfer roast to a plate.
Separate the fat off the meat (if you like) and shred the meat lightly into a serving bowl with 2 forks.
Remove the fat from the cooking liquid with a fat separator and drizzle the strained liquid over the meat.

Description: 
I wondered if kalua pig could be done in a fraction of the time using the Instant Pot® instead of a slow cooker, and what do you know? It yields succulent, fall-apart, flavorful meat every single time, with almost zero effort. Even with a drier cut like pork loin, which my family prefers as a lower-fat option, it comes out great. This is maybe the simplest recipe I've ever made, and the family raves continuously. Thanks again to Kikukat for the basic idea. Serve with traditional Hawaiian sides or your favorite barbecue sauce.
