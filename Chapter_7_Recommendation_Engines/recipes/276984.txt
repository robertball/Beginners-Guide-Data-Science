2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, finely chopped
1 green bell pepper, finely chopped

2 tablespoons chopped garlic
1 leftover turkey carcass
1/2 cup chicken broth
3 tablespoons chili powder

Place turkey carcass into a slow cooker with drained beans, sauteed vegetables, chicken broth, 3 tablespoons chili powder, and bay leaves. Cover and cook on Low for 8 hours.
