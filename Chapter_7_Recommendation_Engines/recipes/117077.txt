Ingredients:
2 cups vegetarian refried beans
1 cup 1% cottage cheese
1 1/2 cups shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese, divided
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups water
1 teaspoon cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon dried minced onion
12 (6 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the beans, cottage cheese and 1 cup cheddar cheese; set aside. For sauce, in a large nonstick skillet, whisk the oil, flour, chili powder, garlic powder and salt until smooth. Gradually stir in the water, vinegar and onion. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat.
Dip both sides of each tortilla into sauce. Place about 1/2 cup bean mixture down the center of each tortilla. Roll up and place seam side down in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Pour remaining sauce over top; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until heated through.
