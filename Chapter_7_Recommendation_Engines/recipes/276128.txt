Ingredients:
Marinade:
1/3 cup warm chicken broth
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
3 cloves garlic, finely minced, or more to taste
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil (optional)
3 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 green bell pepper, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
1 red bell pepper, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
1 medium zucchini, cut into 1/3-inch rounds
1 onion, cut into 2-inch pieces
15 medium mushrooms, halved
10 cloves garlic, peeled
1/2 pint grape tomatoes

Directions:
Mix broth, balsamic vinegar, minced garlic, olive oil, basil, oregano, and black pepper together in a medium bowl. Set marinade aside.
Combine bell peppers, zucchini, onion, mushrooms, whole garlic, and tomatoes in a large bowl and stir until well mixed. Pour into a large lidded container and pour marinade over the vegetables. Seal and marinate for at least 20 minutes; refrigerate if you are marinating longer.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Oil a grill basket.
Scoop veggie mixture into the grill basket, reserving excess marinade. Close the grill lid.
Cook on the preheated grill, stirring with a slotted spoon every 6 to 7 minutes, for about 20 minutes. Pour remaining marinade over veggies. Finish grilling with lid closed until somewhat charred, about 5 minutes more. Transfer to a large baking sheet and serve.
