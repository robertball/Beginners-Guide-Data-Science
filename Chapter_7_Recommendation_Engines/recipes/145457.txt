Ingredients:
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons brandy-based orange liqueur (such as Grand MarnierÂ®)
2 cups whipping cream
2 cups fresh strawberries, cleaned, hulled and sliced

Directions:
Combine the sour cream, sugar, yogurt, vanilla extract, and orange liqueur in a large bowl.
Pour the whipping cream into a saucepan, and heat over medium-high heat just below the boiling point. Slowly stir the heated cream into the sour cream mixture. To serve, pour the cream mixture into 1/2 cup Irish coffee glasses to 1 inch below the rim. Top each glass with sliced strawberries.

Description: 
This is an easy and elegant dessert. I get besieged with requests for the recipe every time I make it. Substitute any of your favorite fresh fruits for the strawberries, and it'll be still be just as delicious! You can also serve this in wine glasses because 1/2 cup servings are never enough.
