Ingredients:
2 cups vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance®)
1 cup confectioners' sugar
3 cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour (such as Robin Hood®)
1 cup cornstarch
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat margarine and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add flour, cornstarch, and salt; mix by hand until dough comes together in a ball.
Place dough on a flat work surface and roll out to a 1/2-inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters. Place cookies on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
A very nice vegan cookie that you would not know is not made with real butter. I didn't know if this would work with the changes I made, but they turned out very good. They didn't fall apart or crumble; they held their shape very nicely.
