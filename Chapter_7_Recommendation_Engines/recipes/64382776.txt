Ingredients:
1 pound ground lean beef
2 (14.5 ounce) cans Italian style diced tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
5 cubes beef bouillon
2 medium carrots, shredded
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup white vinegar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 cups water
1 head cabbage, cored and cut into 2-3" pieces

Directions:
Crumble the ground beef into a large pot. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, beef bouillon cubes, carrots, onion, garlic, vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper. Pour in 1 quart of water, and bring to a boil. Stir to break up the beef while heating. Once the soup comes to a boil, cover and simmer for 30 minutes over low heat.
Add cabbage. Simmer for 25 minutes, until cabbage is tender. Ladle into soup bowls to serve.
