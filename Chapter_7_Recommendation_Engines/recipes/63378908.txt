Ingredients:
2 gallons cut into shapes - Extra Large Cucumbers (ones left on the vine way too long that no one wants)
2 c. pickling lime
1 cup white vinegar
1 T alum
1 oz. whole bottle red food coloring
5 c. granulated sugar
38 oz. or 4 packs of RED Hot Candies (like you get at Valentine's Day)
8 cinnamon sticks cut in half (stick in jars at end)
canning jars/lids (I use pint jars for this recipe)

Directions:
Get the huge cucumbers that no one wants or had been left on vine too long.  Peel & slice into long strips about 1/2 thick, avoiding the seed area. I use very small cookie cutters in shapes of stars & hearts. After you have your shapes cut out. Begin the process.
1st Day - After you have cut your desired shapes, soak overnight in 2 c. pickling lime, 2 1/2 gallons water and the 2 gallons of cucumbers, maybe more.
2nd Day - Rinse & soak your cucumbers for 15 minutes, rinsing very well.
Mix:
1 cup white vinegar
1 T Alum
1 bottle red food coloring
enough water to cover cucumbers
Simmer for 3 hrs. DO NOT BOIL
Pour off liquid & discard liquid
Mix:
3 cups white vinegar
8 sticks cinnamin cut in half
5 cups granulated sugar
38 ozs Red Hots Candies
3 cups water
Bring mixture to boil. After sugar & candies have melted, don't forget to stir. *It will take a few minutes for these candies to melt. Don't burn. Once it is all melted, pour over cucumbers.
Let stand over night
3rd Day
Pour liquid back into the pot & bring liquid ONLY to boil again. Pour hot liquid over cucumbers again
Let Stand Overnight
4th Day
Pour liquid off into a pot & bring liquid ONLY to boil & pour hot liquid over cucumbers again
Let stand over night again
5th Day
Pour liquid off into the pot. Pack prepared canning jars with cucumbers. In another pot, fill with enough water to cover your jar lids & seals. Bring to boil.  Bring liquid back to boil & pour over cucumbers in jars. Take case knife & run down inside of each jar to release all air bubbles. Add more liquid if necessary leaving 1/2 inch at top. Wipe with wet rag rim of each jar before putting lid on, then seal tightly. I turn my jars upside down for 30 minutes so hot liquid helps get a good seal.

Canning Recipe that is truly wonderful.  

These take 5 Days to make but well worth the effort.  However, cutting out the shapes is the only time consuming part.  But, if you have help, it is fun.
