Ingredients:
2 tablespoons Wildtree Italian Salad Dressing Mix
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 cup Wildtree Roasted Garlic Grapeseed Oil
1 teaspoon dijon mustard
2 pound beef flank steak
1 medium red bell pepper, sliced into thin strips
1 medium green bell pepper, sliced into thin strips
1 large yellow onion, sliced into thin strips

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine Italian Dressing Mix, vinegar, Garlic Grapeseed Oil, and mustard.  Whisk until well blended. Place steak in a shallow dish or re-sealable plastic bag, add 1 cup of the dressing and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours, or overnight.
Preheat gas grill to high heat. Grill steaks 6 to 7 minutes per side. Using long tongs, remove steak from grill and let rest before slicing to preserve juices. Or broil on high 5 minutes each side.
Meanwhile, cook peppers and onions in remaining dressing in a large skillet until tender.
Thinly slice meat on an angle, cutting across the grain. Serve with sauteed peppers and onions.

Description: 
Excellent seasoned flank steak from Wildtree. I doubled the meat from the original recipe because it was not enough for a family of 5.
