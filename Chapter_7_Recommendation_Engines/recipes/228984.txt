Ingredients:
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 small onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup canned lentils, drained and rinsed
1 cup diced carrots
3/4 cup corn kernels
2 tablespoons dry white wine
2 tablespoons chicken broth
2 cups chicken broth
1/4 cup dry white wine
1 (10 ounce) box pearl (Israeli) couscous
2 tablespoons chicken broth
2 tablespoons dry white wine
2 cups baby spinach leaves, stems removed
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until it turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until garlic starts to brown, about 5 to 8 more minutes. Mix in the lentils and cook 3 to 4 minutes to blend flavors, stirring lightly. Stir carrots and corn kernels into the mixture. Reduce heat to low. Pour in 2 tablespoons white wine and 2 tablespoons chicken broth; let the mixture simmer, stirring occasionally.
Bring 2 cups chicken broth and 1/4 cup white wine to a boil in a saucepan; stir in couscous and reduce heat to low. Simmer couscous until the liquid has been absorbed and the couscous pearls are tender, about 8 minutes.
Stir 2 more tablespoons each of chicken broth and white wine into lentil mixture and lightly toss baby spinach leaves into the vegetables in the skillet until wilted, about 5 minutes.
Transfer cooked couscous to a serving bowl and gently stir the spinach-lentil mixture into couscous until thoroughly combined. Drizzle with lemon juice, sprinkle with black pepper, and lightly stir again.

Description: 
This is a recipe that is great as a side or even as a meal. It's so hearty! It's great served warm or cold. I sometimes substitute chickpeas for the lentils, but  be aware that they have a slightly stronger flavor. The white wine is used for flavor but can be left out if desired. Reduced-sodium chicken broth can be used. This recipe keeps well in the fridge and can be served warm or cold.
