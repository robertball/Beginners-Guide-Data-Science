Description: 
This is one of my favorite sauce recipes.  It is not an authentic sauce as it blends together many aspects from different regional sauces.  It goes well with beef, chicken and pork.  My family us it in place of ketchup and we have even like it on rice in place of Soya sauce.  It could make an old boot taste good.
