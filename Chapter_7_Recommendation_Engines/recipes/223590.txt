Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup milk
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup butter, melted
1 cup chopped pecans
1/3 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish.
Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and mash. Measure 3 cups mashed sweet potato and transfer to a large bowl.
Beat sweet potatoes, brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract together with an electric hand mixer in a bowl until smooth and creamy; pour into the prepared casserole dish.
Pour 1/3 cup melted butter over pecans in a bowl; stir to coat. Add flour; stir until combined. Sprinkle pecan mixture over sweet potato mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.

I make these sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving, and they were a big hit. The brown sugar gives it just the right amount of sweetness.
