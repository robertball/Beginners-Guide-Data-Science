Ingredients:
1 T olive oil
3 pork chops (1/2 pound)
salt & pepper
1 large onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1 bell pepper, any color, cored, seeded and chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, seeds removed, finely chopped
1 8-oz can pineapple chunks in juice
1/2 cup chicken broth
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.
Heat large skillet over medium-high heat, coat with cooking spray. Season the pork chops with salt & pepper. Place chops in the skillet and sear for about 2 minutes on each side to caramelize. Transfer the chops to a rimmed cookie sheet and place in oven to finish off, about 8 to 10 minutes depending on thickness until the meat is firm to the touch but not tough.
While chops are in the oven, return the skillet to medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, onion, garlic, peppers, jalapeno, salt & pepper and cook for 3-4 minutes until the vegetables wilt. Add the pineapple and it's juice and the chicken stock. Continue to cook the sauce for 3-4 minutes.
Remove the chops from the oven, add back to skillet with the vegetables and sauce. Warm together for a minute.
