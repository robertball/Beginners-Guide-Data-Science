Ingredients:
4 ounces goat cheese, softened
1 teaspoon dried basil
4 (1/2 inch thick) slices crusty bread
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup olive oil
1 (15 ounce) can sliced beets, drained and diced
1 (10 ounce) package mixed salad greens with arugula
2 avocados - peeled, pitted and diced
1/3 cup chopped toasted hazelnuts

Directions:
Preheat broiler for high heat. Line a baking sheet with foil.
Mix the goat cheese with the basil in a bowl. Spread cheese mixture evenly on four slices of bread. Place on prepared baking sheet.
Cook under preheated broiler until cheese has begun to turn golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove and set aside.
To make the vinaigrette, whisk together the mustard and vinegar in a small bowl until blended; season with salt and pepper to taste. Slowly pour in olive oil while continually whisking until dressing is smooth.
Place diced beets and mixed greens into a large bowl.  Drizzle vinaigrette over top; toss to coat.  Divide salad onto four chilled plates.  Top with avocado and hazelnuts.  Serve with goat-cheese tartines.
