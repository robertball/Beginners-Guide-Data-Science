Ingredients:
10# Egg Noodles
43 Eggs
5# Butter (melted)
20C Cottage Cheese
20C Sugar
20C Sour Cream
20C Raisins
6 T Vanilla
2C Brown Sugar
2 T Cinnamon

Directions:
1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 4 FULL hotel pans with nonstick cooking spray.
3. In a bowl, mix together the eggs with white sugar until thoroughly combined, then stir in the melted butter, whipped cottage cheese, and sour cream. Lightly mix in the noodles and raisins; spoon the kugel into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the top with brown sugar and Cinnamon.
4. Bake covered in the preheated oven about 40 minutes (or until the middle is almost set). Uncover and bake for 10-15 more minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
