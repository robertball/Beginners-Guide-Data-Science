Description: 
I wouldn't describe making homemade croissants as easy since there are multiple steps, and it does take at least half a day. But it's really not that hard either; and certainly simpler than flying to Paris, which is the only other way to enjoy these amazing pastries. This recipe was adapted from one by Bruno Albouze, from The Real Deal (which he is).
