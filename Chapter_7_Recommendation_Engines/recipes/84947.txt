Ingredients:
3 pounds lamb (leg OR shoulder), cut in 1-inch cubes
Salt and pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons ground cumin seed
2 tablespoons cracked coriander seed
2 tablespoons olive oil
10 cloves of garlic, smashed
1 medium onion, cut in large squares
2 medium carrots, diced
1 tablespoon curry powder
2 tomatoes, skin and seeds removed and chopped
1/4 cup tomato paste
3 tablespoons brown sugar
3 bay leaves
1 cinnamon stick
6 cups chicken stock
1/2 cup lamb stock
1/2 cup California raisins, re-hydrated

Directions:
Season lamb with salt and pepper, one-half the cumin and one-half the coriander. Meanwhile, heat large skillet with olive oil until smoking. Carefully add lamb and sear evenly until golden; drain and reserve.
To the pan, add garlic, onions, carrots, remaining cumin, coriander and curry. Cook until fragrant. Then add tomatoes, paste, brown sugar, bay leaves, cinnamon, chicken and lamb stock. Transfer everything into a large pot and bring to a simmer.
While simmering adjust the salt, pepper and brown sugar to taste. Add the lamb, cover tightly and place in preheated 300 degrees F oven.
Cook slowly until lamb is tender, about 2 hours. Serve hot with steamed couscous and California raisins.
