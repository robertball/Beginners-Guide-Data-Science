Ingredients:
3 pounds racked beef ribs
5 red onions, sliced
2 (14 ounce) cans beef broth
2 teaspoons salt
1 ounce soy based liquid seasoning
salt and pepper to taste
6 slices French bread
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons paprika
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Place beef ribs in a large stock pot over medium heat.  Brown on all sides.  Cover with water and bring to a boil, then cover, reduce heat and simmer 1 hour.
Remove meat and bones to a cutting board to cool.  Introduce onions, beef broth and salt to the rib water.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 1 hour.
When the bones are cool enough to handle, remove the meat with a knife.  Finely chop the meat and add to the soup.
After an hour of simmering, season the soup with the liquid seasoning and salt and pepper to taste.  Simmer 30 minutes more.
Preheat oven broiler.
Cut French bread in slices that will fit in your serving bowls.  Place slices on a baking sheet and brush with melted butter.  Sprinkle with garlic powder and paprika.  Place under preheated broiler until browned, 2 to 10 minutes.
Ladle soup into 6 ovenproof serving bowls.  Lay one crouton over each serving.  Top with mozzarella.  Place bowls on a sturdy baking sheet and place under broiler to melt cheese, 1 minutes.  Serve at once.
