Ingredients:
1 bunch ramps
1 pint extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Remove the white portion of each ramp, reserving for another use. Roughly chop the green portions and place in a pint jar; cover with olive oil and place the lid on tightly. Shake jar and refrigerate for at least 1 week.
Place oil and ramps in the blender and blend until pureed. For a more refined finish, strain oil through a cheesecloth.

Description: 
This super-easy recipe helps extend the short spring ramp season, capturing the unique flavor of the wild leeks for an oil that can be used in salad dressing, for sauteing or as a drizzle on top of a creamy soup. It was inspired by just that finishing touch on a cream of salsify soup at Le Pichet in Seattle. Store in the refrigerator for up to two months.
