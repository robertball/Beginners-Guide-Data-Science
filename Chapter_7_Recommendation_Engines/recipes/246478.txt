Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups gluten-free baking mix (such as Arrowhead Mills®)
1 scoop vanilla protein powder (optional)
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon cacao powder (optional)
1/2 teaspoon coarse salt
3 overripe bananas, mashed
1/2 cup turbinado sugar (such as Sugar in the Raw®)
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 1/2 egg
3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with liners.
Mix gluten-free flour, protein powder, baking soda, cacao powder, and salt in a large bowl.
Place mashed bananas, turbinado sugar, melted butter, and egg in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment; beat on medium speed until well-blended and airy. Add flour mixture; mix until batter is evenly moistened. Stir in chocolate chips and sliced almonds.
Scoop the batter into the muffin tin, filling each liner 2/3 of the way full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Let muffins cool on wire rack before serving, about 10 minutes.
