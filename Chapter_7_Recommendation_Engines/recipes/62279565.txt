Ingredients:
Dressing
1 small sweet onion (Vidalia or Walla Walla), chopped
3 tbsps Silk Plain
1 tbsps canola oil
¼ cup sugar
3 tablespoons vinegar
½ tsp dry mustard
½ tsp whole celery seed
¼ tsp garlic powder
½ tsp salt
½ tsp black pepper
Salad
2 heads Bibb lettuce
2 avocados, halved, peeled, thinly sliced
2 grapefruits, peel and pith removed, cut into sections
¼ cup sliced almonds, toasted, if desired
Salt & freshly ground pepper, to taste

Directions:
Prepare dressing. Boil 2 cups water in a small saucepan, add chopped onion and cook for 5 minutes. Remove onions from water with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl of ice water to quickly cool. Use slotted spoon to remove from ice water and place blanched onions in a blender. (Blanching the onions increases their sweetness.)
Add remaining dressing ingredients to the blender and blend until completely smooth, about 3 minutes. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Chill. Makes 1 cup dressing.
To prepare salad, arrange lettuce leaves on 4 chilled plates, drizzle with several tablespoons of dressing, and arrange avocado slices, grapefruit sections and toasted almonds on top of salad. Season with salt and serve with extra dressing on the side.
