Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package ground turkey
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles
1/8 cup Merlot wine
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
2 drops liquid smoke flavoring, or to taste (optional)
1 (10 ounce) can golden mushroom soup (such as Campbell'sÂ®)

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute turkey in the hot skillet until starting to brown, about 3 minutes. Add garlic powder and onion powder. Cook and stir until turkey is mostly browned and slightly pink, 3 to 5 minutes more.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes. Drain.
Pour Merlot into the skillet with the turkey. Let simmer until reduced to your liking, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and liquid smoke; mix thoroughly. Stir in mushroom gravy; let simmer until stroganoff is thickened, at least 5 minutes.
