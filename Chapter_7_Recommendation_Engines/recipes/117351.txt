Ingredients:
2 medium green bell peppers
1/2 pound ground beef or lean ground turkey
2 tablespoons chopped onion

1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
3 tablespoons taco seasoning mix

1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup chopped tomato

Directions:
Cut peppers in half lengthwise and remove seeds. Cook in boiling water for 5 minutes; drain and set aside. In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Add the beans, tomato sauce and taco seasoning; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes.
Place pepper halves in an ungreased 8-in. square baking dish. Fill with meat mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes or until peppers are tender. Top with sour cream, cheese and tomato.
