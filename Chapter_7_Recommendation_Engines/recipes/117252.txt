Ingredients:
1 cup water (70 degrees to 80 degrees)
4 teaspoons butter, softened
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon sugar
3 cups bread flour
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 pound bulk pork sausage, cooked and drained
3/4 cup shredded provolone cheese
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
pepper to taste
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
In bread machine pan, place the first six ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed). When cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 16-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Cover with plastic wrap; let rest 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine the sausage, cheeses, garlic powder and pepper. Spread evenly over dough to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up jelly-roll style; starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal and tuck ends under. Place seam side down on a greased baking sheet.
Cover and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Brush with egg; bake 15-20 minutes longer or until lightly browned. Remove to a wire rack. Serve warm.

Description: 
My bread machine is such a time-saver, particularly where this savory entree is concerned. Stuffed with pork sausage and cheese, it's a favorite with my teenage granddaughters. They even take the left-overs for lunch.
