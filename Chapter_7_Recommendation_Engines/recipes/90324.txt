Ingredients:
2 boneless pork chops
1/2 cup white wine
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
2 teaspoons dried parsley
Pepper, to taste
Hickory wood chips

Directions:
Mix wine, oil, lemon juice, garlic, sage, parsley, and pepper in a small bowl.  Place pork chops in a plastic bag or shallow dish and cover with marinade.  Refrigerate the pork, covered, for 2 to 4 hours.
Meanwhile, soak the hickory chips in a bowl of water for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.  Put the soaked hickory chips over the coals.
Cook the pork chops on the grill for 10 to 15 minutes, or until desired doneness is achieved.  For best results, cover the grill while cooking so that the meat is infused with the smoke flavor.

Description: 
The white wine marinade makes these pork chops tender, moist and juicy.  Adding hickory chips to your coals just before grilling will add a great hickory smoked flavor.
