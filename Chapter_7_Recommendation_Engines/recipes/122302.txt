Ingredients:
1 egg, beaten
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce, divided
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1/2 cup finely chopped green pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano, divided
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the egg, half of the tomato sauce, bread crumbs, onion and green pepper if desired, 1/2 teaspoon of oregano, salt and pepper. Add beef; mix well. On a large piece of heavy-duty foil, pat meat mixture into a 14-in. x 8-in. rectangle. Sprinkle cheeses to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up, jelly-roll style, starting with a short side and peeling foil away while rolling. Seal seam and ends. Transfer to a microwave-safe 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Microwave, uncovered, at 50% power for 12 minutes, rotating a half turn once; drain. Continue cooking on 50% power for 20 minutes or until meat is no longer pink, rotating a half turn once. In a bowl, combine the remaining tomato sauce and oregano. Pour over meat loaf. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 2 minutes. Cover loosely with foil; let stand 5 minutes before serving.
