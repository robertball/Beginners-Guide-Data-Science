Ingredients:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 1/2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
6 hard-boiled eggs
1 1/2 ounces grated sharp Cheddar cheese
3 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled

Directions:
Combine mayonnaise and Cajun seasoning in a medium bowl; go easy on the spice if you don't like a lot of heat. Add eggs and mash with a fork. Add Cheddar cheese and crumbled cooked bacon. Mix until thoroughly combined. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

Description: 
Twist up the traditional egg salad with a bit of bacon and cheese, and a hint of Cajun seasoning. I find bacon adds enough of a salty flavor, so I don't add salt to mine.
