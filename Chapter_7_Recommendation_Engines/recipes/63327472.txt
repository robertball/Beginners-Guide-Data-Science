Ingredients:
9 cups (2 lbs. 4 oz.) hard white wheat flour (can sub 3/4 to 1 cup wheat bran for equal amount of flour)
3/4 cup (3 oz.) bakers dry milk or nonfat dry milk
3 3/4 tsp. salt
1 tsp. instant yeast
3 tbsp. vital wheat gluten
9 tbsp. sweetener (coconut palm sugar, honey, molasses, Karo syrup, or sugar)
3/4 cup (6 oz.) orange juice
3 1/2 cups (28 oz.) lukewarm water
3/4 cup nut oil, melted butter(1 1/2 sticks), vegetable oil, or nut oil

Directions:
Mix dry ingredients well, add wet ingredients and mix until all dry ingredients are moistened using the paddle of an electric mixer.
Beat the mixture vigorously for about 3 minutes with an electric mixer set on high. The dough should be very sticky; not kneadable but not pourable either.
Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let ferment on the counter for 1-2 hours.
Place the bowl into the refrigerator for 18-24 hours (24 hours is best). The dough will continue to rise in the refrigerator, but will slow down as the dough cools.
At least once after the dough has cooled completely (any time after 5-6 hours), deflate the dough, fold it a couple of times, and turn it to release gases that can kill the yeast and to redistribute the food for the yeast.
After 18-24 hours in the refrigerator, let the bowl of dough warm on the counter for 1-2 hours.
Pour onto lightly floured surface. Divide into 2 parts.
For each part,deflate, flatten into a rectangle, fold over all 4 sides like an envelope and push each side into the dough.
Shape into loaves, place in a greased 9 x 5 bread pan, and cover with a non-towel. Let raise until they just crest the top of the pans, 1 to 1 1/2 hours depending on environmental temperature. Preheat oven to 375 degrees while dough is raising.
Uncover and bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes. Tent wit aluminum foil, and bake for an additional 55 minutes.
The internal temperature should be 195 to 200. degrees when done. Baking time can vary depending on the oven used.
Remove from pans and cool on baking rack until cool before cutting.

Description: 
This recipe is a modified version of King Arthurâ€™s recipe that produces amazingly light, tender and moist bread. The recipe has been converted to use long fermentation to activate the phytase enzyme in order to release the grain's nutrients. It freezes well and slices can be taken out of the freezer as needed. This recipe make 2 9 x 5 inch loaves.
