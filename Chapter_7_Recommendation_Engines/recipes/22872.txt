Ingredients:
2 (18.25 ounce) packages cherry chip flavored cake mix
2 eggs, beaten
1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar for rolling

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Empty the packages of cake mix into a large bowl. Add eggs and whipped topping, and mix until well blended.  Roll the dough into walnut sized balls and roll the balls in confectioners' sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto an ungreased baking sheet and flatten slightly to keep them from rolling off.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
