Description: 
I WAS creating recipes to teach pork cookery to high school classes when I discovered this pan-grill method of preparing meat. The results are tender and juicy.    This 15-minute entree is just right for a busy cook - it's delicious, and the portions are perfect for two people. -Katie Koziolek, Hartland, Minnesota
