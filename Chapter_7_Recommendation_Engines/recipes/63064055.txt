Ingredients:
1 cup red lentils
4 cans vegetable or chicken broth
1 can petit diced tomatoes, or 3 fresh tomatoes diced
1 onion diced
2-3 cloves garlic minced fine
2 tsp turmeric
1 tbs cumin seed
1 tsp ground cumin
½ tsp coriander
½ tsp white pepper
1 tsp kosher salt
1 table spoon olive oil

Directions:
Combine the turmeric, cumin seed, ground cumin and coriander in the bottom of a heavy 6-8 quart soup pot.  Cook over medium heat until fragrant.  Add the olive oil, onion and garlic and cook until the onion begins to soften and the garlic is fragrant.  Add the red lentils, salt, pepper, tomatoes and stock.  Bring to a boil then turn down to a simmer.  Cook about 30 minutes then taste and adjust the seasonings to your palate.  I don’t usually measure and fresh vs canned tomatoes can affect the taste.  Continue to simmer until lentils are cooked through
