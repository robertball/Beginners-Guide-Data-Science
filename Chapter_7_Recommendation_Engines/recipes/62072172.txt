4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves
4 kaiser rolls
4 slices of cheddar cheese
3 cups of tropical juice
the juice of one lemon

2. Preheat grill to medium heat.
3. Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken over indirect heat for 18 to 20 minutes, turning occasionally, or until juices run clear.  Place the cheddar cheese on top of each chicken breast until melted.  Remove from heat.

Description: 
This is my interpretation of a sandwich served at a local pub.  It's a really tasty sandwich perfect for a warm summer day.  Don't leave out the chipotle mayo, though, as it is really what makes this sandwich work so well!
