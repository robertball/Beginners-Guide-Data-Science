Description: 
Bruschetta is an antipasto from Italy consisting of grilled bread rubbed with garlic and topped with tomatoes, olive oil, salt, and pepper. I have many bruschetta recipes but due to my love of artichokes this one had to be shared! Serve with your favorite grilled vegetables or sliced cucumbers. Enjoy.
