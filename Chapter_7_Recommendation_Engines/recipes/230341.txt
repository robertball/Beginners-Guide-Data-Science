1 teaspoon soybean oil (often labeled "vegetable oil")
1 small onion, diced
3 cups frozen edamame (shelled)

1 cup baby arugula leaves, packed
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste

Heat soybean oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Add onions and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until soft. Add edamame and broth; simmer for 5 to 6 minutes, until just tender.
Place mixture in food processor; add soymilk and arugula. Process 1 minute, or until smooth.
Return to saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until soup begins to simmer. Ladle into bowls; top with yogurt, if desired.
