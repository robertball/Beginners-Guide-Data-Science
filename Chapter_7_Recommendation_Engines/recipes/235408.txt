Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup quinoa
1 (19 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), rinsed and drained
1 large carrot, peeled and roughly chopped
1 rib celery, roughly chopped
1/2 cup sunflower seeds
1/4 cup shredded cabbage
1/4 onion, chopped
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1/4 cup raisins
1/2 cup reduced-fat mayonnaise
2 tablespoons honey Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon dried kelp flakes
1 1/2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Fluff quinoa with a fork and refrigerate until cold.
Combine chickpeas, carrot, celery, sunflower seeds, cabbage, and onion in a food processor and pulse until everything is roughly equal in size; transfer to a large bowl.
Stir quinoa, almonds, and raisins into the chickpea mixture; add mayonnaise, mustard, kelp flakes, relish, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Stir the mixture until evenly seasoned.
