Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1 egg
3 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 pound vanilla-flavored candy coating, coarsely chopped
20 bite-size chocolate-covered peanut butter cups, unwrapped
mini-morsel chocolate chips for eyes
orange jimmies for noses

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a large mixing bowl beat shortening and peanut                  butter with an electric mixer on medium to high speed    for 30 seconds.
Beat in granulated sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda until combined, scraping sides of bowl occasionally.
Beat in egg, milk and vanilla until combined.
Beat in the cocoa powder and as much of the flour as you can with the mixer.
Stir in any remaining flour.
Shape dough into twenty 1 3/4 inch balls.
Place balls 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 9-11 minutes or until edges are just firm.
Cool on cookie sheet for 2 minutes then transfer to a wire rack and let cool.
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Place cooled cookies on prepared baking sheets.
In a medium microwave-safe bowl microwave candy coating on 50% power for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes or until melted and smooth, stirring every 30 seconds.
Spoon melted coating over each cookie to cover cookie and resemble melted snow.
While coating is still tacky, add a peanut butter cup for a top hat and decorate with sprinkles or other candies to resemble snowman faces.  (If using frosting to make snowman faces, add it when the candy coating is dry).  Let stand until set.
