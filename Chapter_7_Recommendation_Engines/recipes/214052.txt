Ingredients:
6 eggs
8 slices bacon
3/4 cup light mayonnaise
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
2 1/2 tablespoons mustard
paprika for garnish

Directions:
Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Drain. Cool the eggs under cold running water. Peel and chop the cooled eggs.
Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble once cool.
Combine the eggs, bacon, mayonnaise, mozzarella cheese, paprika, sugar, white wine vinegar, and mustard in a bowl to make a chunky dip. Garnish with paprika.

Description: 
This is a cool variation on deviled eggs, one I think is a great addition to Football Sundays -- and my husband agrees! Serve with crackers.
