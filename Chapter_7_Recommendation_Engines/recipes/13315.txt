Description: 
This is a wonderful recipe I learned while in college. Serve with a nice crusty bread.  You can make this on the stove or in a slow cooker, whichever one fits your lifestyle. Just make sure you have a 4 quart size slow cooker. Note: to make this soup less fattening omit the cream of chicken soup and one of the cans of water.
