Ingredients:
2 tbsps butter
4-6 oz. fresh chanterelles, cleaned and sliced 1/8-inch thick (or use another kind of fresh mushroom)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 cup (or more) heavy cream
8 oz. dry or 12 oz. fresh pappardelle, cooked just under al dente
Salt, to taste
Freshly ground pepper, to taste
Parmesan cheese, grated
2 slices bacon, cooked and chopped fine
2 tbsps parsley, chopped fine

Directions:
Melt the butter in a stainless steel sauté pan (just don’t use non-stick pans) over high heat.
Add the chanterelles when the butter is hot and sauté until lightly browned and cooked. [At this point you can reserve a few of the nicer looking slices for garnish if you plan to go that route.]
Add the garlic and sauté until fragrant (about a minute).
Pour in the white wine and simmer until the wine is nearly evaporated.
Add the cream and bring the sauce to a boil.
Turn off the heat.
Add the pasta.
Season with salt and pepper.
Gently toss the pasta with the sauce.
Place some pasta and sauce on a plate.
Garnish with Parmesan cheese, a sprinkle of bacon crumbs, parsley, and any additional salt and pepper.
Top with a slice or two of the sautéed chanterelles.

Description: 
If you forage chanterelles you can save a bundle.  However you can get them, they are wonderful.  You can use whichever pasta shape you like most. Home made fresh pappardelle has a great bite and texture cooked al dente.
