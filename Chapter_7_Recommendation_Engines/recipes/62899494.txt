Ingredients:
½ small head of red cabbage, shredded
2 stalks of celery, minced
½ red pepper
¼ red onion, minced
3 carrots, shredded finely
1 ½ pinches of black pepper
Salt
2 tablespoons of molasses
½ lime, juiced
¼ cup red wine vinegar
¼ cup rice wine vinegar
8 ounces roasted peanuts
2 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
In a small bowl add vinegars, lime juice, oil, black pepper, molasses, brown sugar and a pinch of salt to this mixture, then add the minced red onions and set aside.
In a large bowl, grate red cabbage using the larger holes of the box grater. Then, using the medium to small holes of the box grater, grate the carrots. Note: If you don’t have any different sides, just grate it all the same. You can also use a food processor with a grating attachment, in place of the box grater.
Add minced pepper and celery.
Add the dressing to the mixture of vegetables and mix together thoroughly. Add roasted peanuts. If necessary, season with a bit more salt to taste.
Let flavors meld together for at least 20 minutes; the longer it sits in the fridge the better.
