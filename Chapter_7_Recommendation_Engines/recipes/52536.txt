3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup oat bran
1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup raisins
1/2 cup nonfat plain yogurt

2 teaspoons egg whites
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 small ripe bananas, mashed
1/4 cup chopped pecans

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12 cup muffin tin.
In a large bowl, whisk together whole wheat flours, oat bran, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir in raisins. In another bowl, mix together yogurt, sour cream, applesauce, maple syrup, egg whites, vanilla, and bananas. Pour yogurt mixture into flour mixture, and mix just enough to combine.
