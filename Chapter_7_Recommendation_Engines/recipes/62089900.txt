Ingredients:
Hamburger patty or chicken breast(boneless/skinless)
sliced onions
sliced carrots
sliced potatoes
sliced celery (opt)
sliced mushrooms (opt)
sliced tomatoes (opt)
salt, pepper & garlic powder to taste

Directions:
Combine all of your ingredients into a large piece of aluminum foil sprinkling the seasonings on last.  Wrap tightly to seal in all juices from the meat and vegetables.  Place directly on top of hot coals in camp fire or cook on rack over fire.  Allow at least 25 minutes for cooking time.  Additional cooking time may be added if necessary - it will depend on how hot your fire is and could vary the cooking time as result of the temperature.  Give each person a pocket when it's done and enjoy.
