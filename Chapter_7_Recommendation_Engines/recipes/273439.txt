Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup white sugar
4 1/2 tablespoons butter, softened
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 (6 ounce) containers lemon-flavored yogurt
1 teaspoon lemon zest
2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch round cake pan with cooking spray.
Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium mixing bowl.
Combine sugar and butter in another bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth and well combined. Add eggs and vanilla extract; beat well. Add the flour mixture a little bit at a time, alternating with the lemon yogurt. Make sure to stir well after each addition. Stir in lemon zest.
Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared pan. Spread evenly; cover with 1 cup blueberries. Spread remaining batter over the blueberries. Place remaining blueberries on top of the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out dry, about 50 minutes.
