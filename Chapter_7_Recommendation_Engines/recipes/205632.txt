Ingredients:
6 sheets heavy duty aluminum foil (10x12-inch)
1 (12 ounce) package prepared sponge cake shells
cooking spray
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained, juice reserved
2 tablespoons brown sugar, divided
1/3 cup chopped pecans, divided
18 maraschino cherries

Directions:
Spray the aluminum sheets with cooking spray, and place a sponge cake shell in the center of each sheet. Spoon the crushed pineapple into the cakes, dividing it equally, and sprinkle each cake with about 1 teaspoon of brown sugar and about 2 teaspoons of nuts. Top each cake with 3 maraschino cherries, and drizzle 1 to 2 teaspoons of the pineapple juice over each cake.
Wrap the cakes in the foil, leaving some room at the top for air circulation. Place the foil packs onto the embers of a campfire until the cakes are hot and bubbling, about 10 minutes.
