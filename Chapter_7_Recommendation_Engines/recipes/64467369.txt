Ingredients:
2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
1 cup butter, softened, 2 Tbsp set aside
1 Tbsp baking soda
1 lb ground chicken
2 large eggs
¼ tsp salt
¼ tsp black pepper
½ tsp minced garlic
¼ cup water, plus 4 Tbsp

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the 2 Tbsp of butter, add the minced garlic, and brown the ground chicken. Set aside.
In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and baking soda. In a small bowl, whisk eggs and butter until well combined. Pour mixture into large bowl of dry ingredients. Mix until dough starts to form. If dough is too dry, add water 1 Tbsp at a time. If dough is too wet, add a little bit of flour.
Roll dough out to ¼-inch thickness. With a 2-inch biscuit cutter, cut 2-inch circles. Scoop approximately 1 Tsp of ground chicken filling into the center of each circle. Wrap ends loosely over filling. Place on an ungreased baking sheet (may be lined with foil for easy clean-up) at least 1-inch apart.
Place fluffy bites into the oven and bake for 12-18 minutes or until edges and top are a light golden brown. Remove from heat. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
