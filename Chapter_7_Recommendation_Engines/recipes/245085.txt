Ingredients:
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon rubbed sage
1 teaspoon light brown sugar
1 1/2 cups 1-inch cubes peeled, seeded butternut squash
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 cups quinoa, rinsed and drained
3 cups SwansonÂ® Chicken Broth
1/2 cup raw pumpkin seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Mix the warm melted butter, thyme, sage, and sugar together in a small bowl.
Place cubed butternut squash in prepared baking dish. Drizzle with seasoned butter. Roast uncovered in preheated oven until tender, about 20 minutes.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Toast quinoa in oil until light brown, about 5 minutes. Add Swanson(R) Chicken Broth to quinoa and bring to a boil. Cover and turn heat to low. Cook for 10 minutes without disturbing. Remove from heat and let sit covered until broth is absorbed, about 3 minutes.
Stir the quinoa and pumpkin seeds into the roasted squash.
