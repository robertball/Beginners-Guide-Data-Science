Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup butter
2 eggs
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/4 cup chopped walnuts, or to taste (optional)
1/4 cup raisins, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease baking sheets.
Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg together into a bowl.
Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition; blend in sour cream and lemon extract. Gradually stir flour mixture into creamed butter mixture until dough is combined.
Drop dough by rounded tablespoons, about 3 inches apart, onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown around the edges, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar over cookies; top with walnuts and raisins. Continue baking until bottoms of cookies begin to brown, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.

Tried for years to duplicate my nana's recipe. I was a bit skeptical about the lemon extract but it is what it needed!
