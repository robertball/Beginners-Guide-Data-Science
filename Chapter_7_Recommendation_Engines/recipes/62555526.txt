1/2 cup butter, room temperature
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 cup sour cream
3 tsp almond extract
1/2 cup almonds, chopped finely
1 1/2 cups flour
1 tsp baking soda

1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp ginger
1/4 tsp ground cloves
Optional, garnish of slivered almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
In a large mixing bowl, cream sugar into butter until smooth.  Add the eggs, the sour cream, and the almond extract and stir well.  Add the chopped almonds.
In a smaller mixing bowl, combine the flour,  baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves.
Pour the dry ingredients into the wet, and stir until just combined.
Pour mixture into a greased 9x5 loaf pan, and sprinkle some slivered almonds on top, if using.
Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.  Enjoy!
