Ingredients:
1 2 1/2 - 3 pound chicken, cut into parts
1 cup flour
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 teaspoons paprika
3/4 cup butter
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Melt 1/2 cup of the butter in the oven, in a shallow baking pan.  Reserve the remaining 1/4 cup butter for the honey coating.  Remove from the oven once the butter has melted.
Combine the flour, salt, pepper and paprika in a paper bag, then add the chicken pieces a few at a time, and shake them up to coat with the flour.
Remove the chicken pieces from the flour, and place them in the baking pan, turning the chicken pieces to coat with the butter.  Then lay the pieces skin-side down in a single layer.
Bake the chicken pieces at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.
While the chicken is baking, combine the remaining 1/4 cup butter (melted), with the honey and lemon juice.
After the chicken has baked for 30 minutes, turn each piece.  Pour the honey, butter and lemon mixture over the chicken.
Bake the chicken for another 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is tender.  Keep an eye on the chicken towards the end of the cooking time, and if it looks like it's browning too quickly, lower the ovem temperature.
Spoon some of the honey and lemon sauce from the cooking pan over the chicken, and serve.
