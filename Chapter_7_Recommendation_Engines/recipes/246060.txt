Description: 
Great and easy hollandaise sauce. I like my hollandaise sauce tangy and with a kick so I add extra lemon juice and cayenne pepper to my liking. It serves 2 to 4 depending on what you put it on. I use it on eggs Benedict. It's the best I have had - not bland like some hollandaise sauces!
