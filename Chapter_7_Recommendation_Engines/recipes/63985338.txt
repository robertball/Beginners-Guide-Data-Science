Ingredients:
2 TB Chili Powder
2 Tsp onion powder
1 tsp mexican oregano
1 tsp salt
6 TB oil
1/2 cup flour
4 cups water

Directions:
Mix dry spices and flour together in small bowl, set aside.
Measure out water and set aside.
Heat oil on low in large sauce pan.  Whisk in flour mixture.
As soon as flour mixture is incorporated, add water, 1 cup (or other small amounts) at a time.  Adding the water slowly helps to prevent thick chunks of flour from globbing together.
Simmer 5 minutes, remove from heat and let stand 10 minutes.
