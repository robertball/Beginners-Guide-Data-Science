Ingredients:
1 lb. catfish (skinless, boneless)
4 tbsp. Paul Prudhomme's Blackened Redfish Magic

Directions:
Place the fish on a broiler pan. Sprinkle with 2 tbsp. of the seasoning.
Broil for 5 minutes (about 3" from the heat source).
Flip the fish and sprinkle the remaining seasoning on top.
Broil for another 2-3 minutes or so, until the fish is cooked through (no pink).
Serve with lemon slices.

Description: 
Catfish is oily, so there's no need to add anything but seasoning. The heat from the broiler will bring out the natural fat.
