Ingredients:
3 Granny Smith apples, cut into 1/2-inch dice
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/3 cup butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread diced apples into the bottom of a 9-inch square baking dish.
Stir brown sugar, oats, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Mash softened butter into the sugar mixture with a fork until you get a crumbly consistency; spread over apples to cover.
Bake in preheated oven until the apples are tender, about 30 minutes.
