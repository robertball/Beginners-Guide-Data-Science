Ingredients:
1/4 pound goat cheese
1/4 cup minced fresh basil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
24 cherry tomatoes

Directions:
In a medium-sized bowl, combine the cheese, basil, salt and pepper. Mix with a fork until well blended.
Cut the top off each cherry tomato. Using a small spoon, carefully scoop out the pulp to make a hollow, yet sturdy, shell. Drain off any juice that may be in the tomato shells.
Using a small spoon, scoop about 1 teaspoon of the cheese mixture and carefully stuff into a tomato shell. Repeat until tomatoes or cheese mixture is used up. Arrange the filled tomatoes on a platter to serve.
