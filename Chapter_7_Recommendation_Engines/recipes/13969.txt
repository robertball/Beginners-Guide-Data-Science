Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups dry kidney beans
1 1/2 cups dried pinto beans
9 cups water
24 ounces textured vegetable protein
3 1/2 cups boiling water
1/4 cup vegetable oil
3 cups chopped onion
4 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 teaspoons salt
4 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon molasses
1 tablespoon honey
3 (10 ounce) cans chile sauce
1 (28 ounce) can tomato puree
3 (29 ounce) cans diced tomatoes

Directions:
Place beans in a large saucepan, and cover with water.  Soak overnight in the refrigerator.  Drain, and return to pan.  Add 9 cups water; cook for 1 1/2 hours, or until tender.
Meanwhile, mix textured vegetable protein and boiling water together in a large bowl.  Set aside.
In a large saute pan, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onions; cook and stir until soft and translucent.
In a large stock pot, combine beans, textured vegetable protein, onions, spices, salt, honey, molasses, chili sauce, tomato puree, and diced tomatoes.  Stir to mix well.  Simmer, stirring often for at least 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a wonderful vegetarian recipe from the Cornucopia Restaurant which was in South Bend, IN.  It makes a very large pot of chili.  Freeze leftovers for a future meal, or cut ingredients in half for a normal pot of chili.
