Ingredients:
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon canola oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (12 ounce) package frozen shelled edamame (green soybeans)
1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions
1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
28 wonton wrappers
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat the sesame and canola oils in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook for 10 seconds until fragrant. Add the frozen edamame, and cook until they are tender and beginning to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Once browned, remove from the heat and allow to cool for 10 minutes.
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Once the edamame have cooled slightly, place them into a blender along with the green onion, hoisin sauce, and soy sauce. Cover, and puree until smooth.
To make the wontons: Separate and place the wonton wrappers onto your work surface. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the edamame filling onto the center of each wrapper. Use your finger or a pastry brush to lightly moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with water. Fold one corner of the wrapper over the filling onto the opposite corner to form a triangle. Press the edges together to seal. Place onto the prepared baking sheet and lightly coat with cooking spray. Sprinkle evenly with the salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until the triangles are crisp and golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes.

Description: 
These delicious baked wontons are filled with an edamame (soy bean) stuffing and are sure to please! For a dipping sauce, I recommend spicy Chinese-style hot mustard, teriyaki sauce, or my personal favorite, Kraftâ„¢ Asian Toasted Sesame salad dressing.
