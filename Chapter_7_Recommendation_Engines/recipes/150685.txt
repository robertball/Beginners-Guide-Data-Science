Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) flat iron steak
2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh chives
1/4 cup Cabernet Sauvignon
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard powder

Directions:
Place the steak inside of a large resealable bag. In a small bowl, stir together the olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, Cabernet, salt, pepper and mustard powder. Pour over the steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or to your desired degree of doneness. Discard the marinade. These steaks taste best at medium rare. Allow them to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.
