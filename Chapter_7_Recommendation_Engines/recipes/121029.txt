Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups apricot nectar
1 1/2 cups chopped dates
1/2 cup chopped dried apricots
1 tablespoon grated orange peel
1 1/4 teaspoons dried rosemary, crushed
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup sugar
1 egg
1/3 cup evaporated milk
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda

Directions:
In a saucepan, bring the apricot nectar, dates and apricots to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat; add orange peel and rosemary. Cool for 10 minutes.
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg and milk. Combine flour and baking soda; add to creamed mixture alternately with date mixture. Pour into three greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.

My family and I were thrilled when this won 'best of show' for quick breads at the state fair a few years ago. I sometimes substitute peach nectar for the apricot nectar with terrific results.
