Ingredients:
* 4 cups chicken broth
* 1 1/2 cups orzo
* 1 (15-ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 1/2 cups red teardrop tomatoes or grape tomatoes, halved
* 3/4 cup dried cranberry's
* 1/2 cup pine nuts
* 3/4 cup finely chopped red onion
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves
* About 3/4 cup Red Wine Vinaigrette, use recipe below or your favorite brand!
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Red Wine Vinaigrette:
* 1/2 cup red wine vinegar
* 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
* 2 teaspoons honey
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Pour the broth into a heavy large saucepan. Cover the pan and bring the broth to a boil over high heat. Stir in the orzo. Cover partially and cook until the orzo is tender but still firm to the bite, stirring frequently, about 7 minutes. Drain the orzo through a strainer. Transfer the orzo to a large wide bowl and toss until the orzo cools slightly. Set aside to cool completely.
Toss the orzo with the beans, tomatoes, onion, basil, mint, cranberries, pine nuts and enough vinaigrette to coat. Season the salad to taste with salt and pepper, and serve at room temperature.
