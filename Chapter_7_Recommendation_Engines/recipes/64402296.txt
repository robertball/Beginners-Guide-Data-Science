4 oz. cream cheese, softened
4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves (4 oz. each)

1.  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Place pasta sauce in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave, covered, on high for 3-4 minutes or until hot, stirring halfway.
2.  Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add green pepper; cook and stir 3-4 minutes or until tender.  Transfer to a small bowl; stir in cream cheese.
3.  Arrange chicken in a greased 13x9-inch baking dish; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Spoon pepper mixture onto chicken.  Pour warmed sauce over top.  Place chees slices over sauce.  Bake, covered, 23 - 30 minutes or until a thermometer inserted in chicken reads 165 degrees.
