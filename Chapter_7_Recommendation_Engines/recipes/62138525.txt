Description: 
Fun to make for the Pumpkin Season. 
A very good friend gave me this recipe several years ago. After misplacing it a few times and bugging her for another copy, I decided to enter it in All Recipes.com to share with you and to keep it in a safe place.
It's easy, quick and always delicious.
