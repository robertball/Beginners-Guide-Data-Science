Ingredients:
3 cups home fry potatoes, cooked
1 package Al Fresco Natural Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage, cubed
8 eggs
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
Salt
Pepper
Butter
Olive oil
Flour tortillas

Directions:
Cook home fries (potatoes, cubed) in three tablespoons olive oil and pat of butter, until lightly browned.  Set aside.
Cut up sausage into cubes and cook in one tablespoon of olive oil until just browned.  Set aside.
Beat eggs with an electric mixer and cook, in butter, until almost firm.  Add cheddar cheese and fold into eggs (until cheese is melted).
Salt and pepper to taste.
In the microwave, heat the flour tortillas (stacked and covered with a damp paper towel) for about a minute.
Assemble burritos by spooning a bit of the egg, potatoes, and sausage in the center of the tortilla.  Slightly fold up top and bottom end, then "roll" the tortilla until you've formed a burrito.
Serve with salsa or hot sauce.
