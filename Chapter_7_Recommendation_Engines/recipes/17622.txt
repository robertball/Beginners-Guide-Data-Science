Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup hot brewed coffee
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Frosting:
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 cup cocoa powder
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup hot milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 or two 9 inch round pans. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside. In a small bowl, combine hot coffee with 1 cup cocoa and let cool to lukewarm.
In a large bowl, cream together the 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the 1 teaspoon vanilla. Add the flour mixture alternately with the coffee and cocoa mixture; beat well.
Pour batter into a 9x13 inch cake or two 9 inch round pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
To make the frosting:  In a medium bowl, combine confectioners sugar, 1 cup cocoa, 1/2 cup butter and 1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla. Mix until smooth. Add hot milk a teaspoon at a time to make a smooth, spreadable consistency. Spread onto cooled cake.
