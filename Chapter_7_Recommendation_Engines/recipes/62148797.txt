Ingredients:
3 5oz cans boneless skinless salmon (Drained)
4 tbs lemon juice
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
2 tbs onion powder or one finely chopped onion
1 tbs garlic salt
1 package saltine crackers (Crushed finely)
3 eggs
salt and pepper
1 Stick of butter

Directions:
Combine salmon, eggs, and crushed saltine crackers in medium sized bowl, mix in enough crackers to make mixture stick together slightly without falling apart.
Add spices and lemon juice, mix cheese in well.
Create small balls with mixture and then flatten to about 1/4 inch thick, smoothing the edges with your thumbs to make a flat, round shape like a cookie.
Make these shapes with all of the salmon mixture and place on plate to the side.
Heat frying pan to med and melt 2 tbs butter in pan.
Add patties to butter and fry until golden brown flip to other side and fry until golden brown.
Remove from heat and place on plate to the side.
Repeat for 2nd and 3rd batch as all patties may not fit in frying pan at once.
Tip: to keep first batch warm place plate with fryed patties on it in oven set at 200 degrees till 2nd batch is finished.
