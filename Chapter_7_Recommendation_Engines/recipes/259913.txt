Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup canola oil
2 eggs, at room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 pounds pears - peeled, cored, and coarsely chopped
1 cup chopped walnuts
Topping:
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons ground walnuts
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 14 muffin cups.
Whisk flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.
Whisk buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Pour in flour mixture; mix just until moistened. Fold pears and chopped walnuts into the batter with a few quick strokes.
Spoon batter into the muffin cups, filling them to the top.
Mix 3 tablespoons sugar, ground walnuts, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a small bowl to make topping. Sprinkle topping evenly over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Place muffin tins on a wire rack; cool for 5 minutes before removing muffins.

Description: 
Bartletts are excellent for this but others will do also. Pick pears that are slightly underripe.
