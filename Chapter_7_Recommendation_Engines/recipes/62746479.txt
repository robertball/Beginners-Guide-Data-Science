Ingredients:
1 cup dried chickpeas
8 oz. Greek sheep's milk feta cheese, cubed
4 oz. kalamata olives, pitted and halved
8 oz. cherry or grape tomatoes
large handful of parsley, coarsely chopped
5 tablespoons olive oil
juice of one lemon
1 clove garlic, crushed
2 teaspoons harissa, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Soak the chickpeas overnight in water with a little yogurt whey or lemon juice. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cover, cooking for one and a half hours or until soft. Drain and add to a large bowl.
If using cherry tomatoes, halve first and add to the chickpeas, along with the feta cheese, olives and parsley.
In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, harissa and salt to make the dressing. Pour over the salad and mix gently together. Serve at room temperature or cold.

Description: 
This is a delicious salad that combines all the great flavours of the Mediterranean â€” feta cheese and kalamata olives from Greece, chickpeas from southern Europe, and harissa hot sauce from North Africa to give it a spicy kick. It's a refreshing and simple dish for the hot summer months when a light meal is called for. Serve it on a bed of salad greens with rice or as part of a picnic with crusty bread.
