Ingredients:
1 zucchini, or more to taste
1 teaspoon salt, or as needed
1/4 cup olive oil
1 small onion, thinly sliced lengthwise
1/2 red bell pepper, cut into matchstick-sized pieces
1 cup yellow grape tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons milk, or more to taste
1/2 cup grated pecorino cheese
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
Cut zucchini into noodle shapes with a spiralizer; toss with salt until combined. Drain on a paper towel until moisture is drawn out; about 20 minutes. Squeeze zucchini noodles to remove remaining moisture.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and red bell pepper; cook and stir until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cook until soft, 3 to 4 minutes.
Stir zucchini into the onion mixture; cook and stir until tender and mixture looks dry, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with garlic powder. Stir in milk and cook, 1 to 2 minutes. Add pecorino cheese, pepper, and oregano; stir until combined.
