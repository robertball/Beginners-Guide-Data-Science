Ingredients:
3 cloves of garlic, minced
3 tbsp fresh Rosemary, finely chopped
2 sprigs of thyme, left whole
1 tsp dried oregano
3 15oz cans unseasoned tomato sauce, preferably Contandina
1 1/2 cups Cabernet Red Wine
1 lb lean ground beef
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and pepper

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium low heat. Add the garlic and cook for 5 minutes. Add the rosemary, thyme and oregano to the pot and let warm until the herbs are fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in all three cans of tomato sauce and stir until combined. Slowly pour in the red wine and gently stir for 30 seconds. Cover the pot and raise the heat slightly to medium-high and let simmer, stiring occasionally.
In the meantime brown the ground beef by heating a large skillet to medium-high and crumble the beef evenly over suface. Season with salt and a generous amount of pepper, cover and let cook 6-7 minutes undisturbed.  Carefully lift the lid and strain most of the rendered fat from the beef, leaving a small amount for additional cooking. Replace the skillet back on the heat and using a wooden spoon break up the beef until it is crumbled and evenly browned.  Add the beef to the sauce and stir until well combined.
Reduce the heat to low and let sauce simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Discard thyme stems before serving.
Serve over your favorite pasta.

Description: 
This is a simple tomato based pasta sauce with an elegant flair. Rosemary is my favorite herb and when paired with the red wine makes for a delightful pasta sauce, better than most I've tasted
