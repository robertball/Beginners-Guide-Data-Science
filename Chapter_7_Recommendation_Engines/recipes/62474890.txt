Ingredients:
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion (or less, to taste. I love onion!)
2 cloves garlic
1 pound lamb meat removed from the bone and cut into bite sized pieces. Any inexpensive cut works.
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup plain yogurt
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons (or more, to taste) dry dill weed
Pita bread
1 tomato
1/2 cucumber

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet on medium high heat. Add chopped onions and garlic, stirring as they cook. When onions begin turning transparent, add lamb meat. Salt and pepper while meat is cooking. Stir occasionally, and cook to medium rare- about 7-10 minutes depending on size of meat pieces.
While meat is cooking, combine yogurt, mayonnaise, and dill in a small bowl. Refrigerate until ready to use. Separately, finely chop tomato and cucumber.
Spoon lamb and yogurt sauce into pitas. Top with tomato and cucumber. Enjoy!
