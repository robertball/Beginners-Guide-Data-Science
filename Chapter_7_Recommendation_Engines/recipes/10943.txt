Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons butter (optional)
1 cup vegetable oil for frying
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar for decoration

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients, except the flour, to blend.  Add the flour a little at a time, and beat until smooth.
Deep-fry in hot oil, about 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). (Fry-Daddy works well).  Heat the iron for about 10 seconds in the oil, then dip in batter.  Place the iron in oil so it is just level with the top of the batter (If you put it in deeper, the batter will not come off the iron).  Remove rosette from oil when lightly browned (it only takes seconds). Drain on paper towel.  Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.  NOTE:  If you chill the batter for a while, the rosettes come out thinner and crispier, but it isn't required.
