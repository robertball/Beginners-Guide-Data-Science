Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
4 ounces lowfat cream cheese
1 egg
2 egg whites
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons cream of tartar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, 1 1/2 cups of white sugar, and cream cheese. Beat in the egg and egg whites until smooth. Sift together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Cover, and refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a small dish, mix together the remaining white sugar and the cinnamon. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls, and roll the balls in the cinnamon and sugar mixture. Place the balls at least 2 inches apart on cookie sheets, and flatten slightly.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
