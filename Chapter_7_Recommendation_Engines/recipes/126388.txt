Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 (15 ounce) can ranch-style beans
garlic salt to taste
4 potatoes, sliced
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain. Stir in the diced tomatoes, ranch-style beans, and garlic salt. Bring to a boil; reduce the heat to low.
Layer the sliced potatoes evenly over the ground beef mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Cover; simmer until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
A family favorite, given to me by a friend, quick and easy and delicious. You can add shredded cheese when the potatoes are tender and cook a few more minutes, and the stew is great with sour cream and salad.
