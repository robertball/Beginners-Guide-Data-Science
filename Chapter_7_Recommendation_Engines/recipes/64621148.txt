Ingredients:
28 ounces vegetable stock (can use chicken stock instead if you like)
2 tablespoons EVOO
1 medium onion, chopped
3-4 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups Arborio rice
10 ounces grape or cherry tomatoes, quartered
28 ounces canned petite diced tomatoes (do not drain)
1 tsp sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1/2 cup white wine
1/2 lb small or medium shrimp, cooked and tail shells removed
4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves
1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a sauce pan bring vegetable stock to boil and set aside on barely simmering. In large deep sided fry pan or wide shallow pot heat EVOO over medium heat. Add onions, garlic and rice, stirring to coat each grain of rice.  Continue to stir and cook until onions start to become translucent (about 3-4 minutes). Add 1 ladle of hot stock and stir constantly until completely absorbed by rice. Add another ladle of stock and stir continually until it absorbed by rice. Keep repeating this until all the stock has been added and absorbed. Add the canned tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, white wine, sugar, salt, pepper, and paprika (and cayenne if using).  Simmer uncovered for 10 to 18 minutes stirring occasionally until  rice is tender. Add shrimp and cook 3 minutes to heat. Stir in the fresh basil and parmesan cheese.  Serve with addition parmesan cheese if desired.
