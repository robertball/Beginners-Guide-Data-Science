Description: 
This recipe uses ingredients found most well-stocked bars, which I put together after many requests for a Key lime pie martini from customers at a restaurant I bartended for. To make it extra special, run a lime around the edge of the martini glass and dip it in crushed graham crackers after chilling. Tastes just like a key lime pie! This recipe makes a single martini. Garnish with lime, if desired.
