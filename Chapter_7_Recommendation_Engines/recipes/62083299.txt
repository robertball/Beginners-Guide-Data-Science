Ingredients:
4 lbs (2 kg) large russet potatoes, cut in eighths
12 garlic cloves, peeled
2/3 c (150 ml) whipping cream
1 c (250 ml ) butter
1 (113 g) pkg soft goat cheese (about 1/2 c / 125 ml)
salt / pepper
1/2 c (125 ml) finely chopped green onions

Directions:
First roast garlic by preheading oven to 350 C and put pre peeled garlic in pan sprinkled with olive oil (about 3 TBSP).  Bake until golden brown and then set aside.
In large saucepan, cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1/2".  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, covered for about 15 min or until potatoes are tender but not falling apart.
While potatoes are simmering, combine cream, butter, goat cheese and 1/2 tsp each of salt / pepper in small saucepan.  Cook over medium-low heat for 3 to 5 min or until butter and cheese are just melted and smooth, stirring frequently, keep warm.
Drain potatoes and mash with roasted garlic.  Add cheese mixture, green onions and salt & pepper to taste just until potatoes are fluffy and smooth (do not overbeat).  Transfer mixture to 11x7" (28x18cm) baking dish). (potatoes may be prepared up to this point, covered tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerated overnight.)
Remove baking dish from refrigerator and let potatoes stand at room temperature for 1.5 hours.  Reheat potatoes, uncovered, at 400F (200 C) for 20-25 min or until heated through.
