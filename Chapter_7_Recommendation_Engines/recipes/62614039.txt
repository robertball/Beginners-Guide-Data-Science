Ingredients:
1 and 1/2 cups pearl or Rose rice. Do not use long grained or Minute Rice
12 cups of water

Directions:
Add the rice to a large 4 to 5 quart pan.
Add the water.
Bring to boil and let rice boil for 15 to 20 minutes on Medium-High.
Turn heat down to low or Medium Low. You want the rice to very slowly boil for 15 to 20 minutes.
Stir rice every 10 minutes or so to make sure it doesn't stick.
At the end of the cooking time, turn off the heat and put a lid or cover on the pan and let it sit overnight. The rice was boiled for over a half an hour, there are no germs in there that can spoil the rice, It will be just fine sitting there on the back of the stove with a lid.
The next morning your pan should be about half to 2/3s full of wonderful creamy rice.
Dip out the desired amount for a serving.
Put it in a non stick pan and heat it or into a microwave proof bowl and heat in the microwave.
Serve just as if were oatmeal or Cream of Wheat.
You can eat it with just sugar and milk like I do or add all sorts of toppings. Maple syrup, cinnamon, raisins, slced bananas, just about any fresh, frozen or canned fruit.
Warm up a bit of your favorite jelly and swirl that over the top.

Description: 
My mom said her grandmother made this rice for her and her brothers and sisters. It is the epitome of comfort breakfast cereal. It is like on oatmeal or Cream of Wheat breakfast but it uses rice and is very inexpensive to fix. And unless you add salt which I don't do, or something with fat in it, the rice is sodium and fat free and acceptable for a vegetarian dish.
