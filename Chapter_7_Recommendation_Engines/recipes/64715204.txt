Ingredients:
2 cups dry great northern beans, rinsed and sorted
1 1/2 pounds chicken breasts or thighs, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
1 medium onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, crushed
28 oz can green enchilada sauce
2 cups chicken broth
2 4 oz. cans diced green chiles, hot or mild, undrained (such as Hatch® brand)
1 tablespoon oregano
1 teaspoon cumin
Garnish:
Monterrey Jack and Cheddar shredded cheese blend
Chopped cilantro

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot®) and select saute function. Pour in 2 tablespoons oil. Add chicken pieces to the hot oil and saute until lightly browned. Add onion and saute until soft and translucent.
Pour in the enchilada sauce, chicken broth, dried beans,  diced green chiles, oregano and cumin into the pot.
Close, lock the lid and seal the vent. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 45 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
When cooking is done release the pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for at least 25 minutes. (Don't release the pressure before the 25 minutes is up or your beans won't be fully cooked.)
