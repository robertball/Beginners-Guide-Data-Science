Ingredients:
1 box white cake mix
2 boxes instant pistachio pudding mix
4 eggs
1 tsp. almond extract
1 cup seltzer water or any clear soda
1 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup chopped maraschino cherries
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Dump everything into a bowl and mix until well combined.
Pour into a well greased and floured pan.
Bake for 50 to 60 minutes or when toothpick inserted comes out clean. I usually check @ 50 min. depending on your oven it may take longer.
Let cool in pan for 10 minutes and then invert onto cooling rack and cool completely.

Description: 
This cake is great anytime. This is my own version of a classic dump cake. Dense like a  pound cake but very moist and delicious.
