Ingredients:
3 - 4 french soft hoagies
3 - 4 romaine lettuce leaves
1 lb. 3 oz. med - large shrimp, roughly chopped (all I had on hand)
1 teaspoon butter
2 large garlic cloves, crushed
1/8 heaping teaspoon dried basil
1/8 heaping teaspoon sugar
salt and pepper to taste
KILLER AIOLI:
1 cup buttermilk ranch dressing (made from  the dry packet of Hidden Valley Ranch Buttermilk Salad Dressing Mix)
1 cup shredded fontina cheese
1 cup minced celery
2 tablespoons minced green onion
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine the KILLER AIOLI ingredients into bowl and blend with an emersion hand blender or use a regular blender. Cover and put in the refrigerator to firm up a bit. If you are in a hurry, put in freezer for a few minutes to speed up the process.
In a hot nonstick pan melt butter, add shrimp, garlic, basil, sugar, salt and pepper. Cook until just pink. DO NOT OVERCOOK!
Cut 3 - 4 pieces of foil out to wrap hoagies.
Put a GOOD amount of the KILLER AIOLI on both slices of bread. Place a lettuce leaf on one side and top with shrimp. Wrap hoagies with foil and stuff in the shrimp that might of fallen out.
