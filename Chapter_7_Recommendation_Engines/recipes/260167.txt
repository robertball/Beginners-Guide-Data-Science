Description: 
It took a while to get into the green smoothie trend. We much preferred a sweet tasting berry burst, but this delicious glass of green goodness is divine. The pineapple chunks add a delicious sweet taste to the drink so it doesn't taste as bitter as other green smoothies. It makes the perfect healthy breakfast or post-workout snack.
