Ingredients:
1 bunch cilantro, rinsed
1 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon honey
4 teaspoons fresh lime juice
Salt to taste
1 canned chipotle pepper
1 tablespoon adobo sauce from canned chipotle peppers
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup rice vinegar
1 clove garlic
1 cup canola oil
Salt to taste
3 pounds extra large shrimp (16-20), peeled and deveined, tail left on
2 pounds thinly sliced pancetta

Directions:
Prepare cilantro oil by pureeing cilantro, canola oil, honey, lime juice, and salt to taste until smooth; pour into a bowl or bottle, and set aside.
Prepare the chipotle vinaigrette by pureeing the chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, lemon juice, rice vinegar, and garlic in a blender until smooth. With the blender running, slowly pour in the canola oil, and puree until creamy. Season to taste with salt, and set aside.
Preheat a grill for medium heat.
Cut the pancetta slices in half. Wrap a half slice of pancetta around each shrimp to cover. Grill until the pancetta has crisped, and the shrimp has turned opaque, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
To serve, arrange cooked shrimp on a warmed serving platter or individual plates, and drizzle with chipotle vinaigrette and cilantro oil.
