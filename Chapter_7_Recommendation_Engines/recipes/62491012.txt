Ingredients:
4 medium sized tomatillos, peeled
3 green Anaheim or California chilis
1 medium onion, peeled
1 green bell pepper
3 jalapeno peppers
1 1/2 pounds of pork, cut into bite sized cubes
2 medium/large tomatoes, chopped
4 cloves of garlic, chopped
1 beef boullion cube
6 oz lager beer (leaves 6 oz for the chef!)
2 tbs Oregano (fresh if you have it)
1 tbs Parsley
1 tbs Cumin
1 tsp Chili powder
4 oz cream cheese
Olive oil
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425.  Cut the tomatillos, onions, peppers and chilis in half, removing stems and skins.  Coat with olive oil and a few pinches of salt and roast in the oven for about 30 minutes or until you get some dark brown edges.  Let cool and chop into bite sized pieces (you can remove seeds from jalapenos and chilis if you would like less heat).
Heat a large skillet over high heat.  Coat skillet with olive oil.  Salt and pepper the pork and cook until browned.  Transfer pork to crock pot or large pot on stove.  Add the roasted chopped veggies.  Add tomatoes, garlic, boullion cube, beer, and herbs and chili powder.  Cook on low heat for 4-6 hours.  Add cream cheese 1/2 an hour before serving.

Description: 
Green chili is a Colorado favorite, it's always a crowd pleaser when we have out of state visitors.  Roasting your veggies first gives this recipe a deeper level of flavor.
