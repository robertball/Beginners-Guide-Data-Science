Ingredients:
2 cups milk
2 eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
3 tablespoons baking powder
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
cooking spray

Directions:
Combine milk, eggs, all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, vegetable oil, sugar, honey, vanilla extract, and salt in an electric blender; blend until smooth.
Place a skillet or griddle over medium heat until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Spray with nonstick cooking spray.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
