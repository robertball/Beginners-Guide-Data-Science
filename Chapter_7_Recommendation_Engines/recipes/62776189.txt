Ingredients:
1 package chicken cutlets
4 sub rolls
8 slices provolone cheese
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
2 jalapenos
1/4 cup pineapple chunks in natural juice
4 tsp. Hot Mango Pepper Sauce
salt and pepper

Directions:
In a small saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add the whole jalapenos and boil for 5-7 minutes. (I knew that the sandwich would be spicy to begin with and boiling the jalapenos first would take away some of their heat.)
Season the chicken cutlets with salt and pepper. Add about 1 tsp. of oil to a large skillet over medium heat and brown the chicken cutlets, about 5 minutes on each side or until they have a brown coating and are cooked through.
Slice the jalapenos into thin rings, removing the seeds. Then cut into smaller pieces. Cut each of the pineapple chunks in half.
Preheat the oven to 350.
On each loaf of bread place 2 slices of provolone cheese, 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, a handful of jalapenos and pineapple and the chicken cutlet. You might need to cut the chicken in half to make it fit on the sandwich better.
Drizzle 1 tsp. of Hot Mango Pepper Sauce on each sandwich.
Bake for 5 minutes in the oven until the bread is toasted and the cheeses have melted.
