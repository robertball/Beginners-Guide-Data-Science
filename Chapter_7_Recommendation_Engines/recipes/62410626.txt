Ingredients:
2 Chicken Breasts
1 cup plain Yogurt
1/2 Onion, chopped
1 Tbsp ground Turmeric
2 Tbsp lemon juice
1/4 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp paprika
1/8 tsp ground ginger
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp salt
ground pepper to taste
1 tsp vegetable oil
1/4 cup water
1 medium cucumber, diced
1 bunch parsley, finely chopped
4 pita breads

Directions:
In a medium bowl create the marinade by combining the yogurt, onion turmeric, lemon juice, cumin, paprika, ginger, cayenne, salt and pepper. This marinade will later become the sauce.
Slice the chicken into long slabs and add to the marinade, mix well, cover and let stand in the fridge for as long as you like, even an hour is good.
Grill the chicken pieces on high heat, about 400F. Let the chicken brown well on each sides, do not mind the edges browning substantially as this adds to the flavour.
While the chicken is grilling, whisk the marinade with the water and heat in a pan with the oil until the sauce is bubbly and thick again.
Cook the chicken until it is well browned and the outside marinade is dry all over. Slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces and toss with the sauce.
Serve the chiken on the naan or pita breads, topped with the cucumber and parsley.
