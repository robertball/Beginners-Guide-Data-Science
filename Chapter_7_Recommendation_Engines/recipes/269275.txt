Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, diced
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1 red bell pepper, diced
2 poblano peppers, diced
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
3 cups diced cooked turkey, or more to taste
1 (8 ounce) package shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided
1 (15.5 ounce) jar red enchilada sauce
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
For the Crust:
1 1/4 cups cornmeal
3/4 cup self-rising flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 large eggs
1 1/2 cups milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and a large pinch of salt. Saute until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add bell pepper and poblano peppers. Season with black pepper, cumin, and oregano. Cook and stir until peppers start to soften, about 2 minutes. Add chipotles and adobo sauce. Stir to combine and remove from heat.
Add turkey and half the Cheddar cheese to the pepper mixture. Add enchilada sauce, remaining salt, and chicken broth. Stir mixture and pour it into a 9x12-inch baking dish; place dish over a sheet pan to catch drippings.
Whisk cornmeal, flour, sugar, and kosher salt together in a large bowl. Add eggs and milk; whisk into a thin batter. Ladle batter over the turkey mixture. Scatter remaining Cheddar cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until the topping is browned and a toothpick comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Description: 
Even if your turkey is perfectly cooked, the reheated leftovers can be a little dry and uninteresting. This tamale pie will rescue the last remnants of your bird in a significantly more exciting and flavorful way than the usual soup. There are two basic types of tamale pie, one with a cornbread topping and the other with traditional masa dough. Here, I wanted to create something that gives us the best of both, and I was very happy with how this came out. Garnish with sour cream and cilantro if desired.
