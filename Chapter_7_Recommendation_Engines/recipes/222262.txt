Ingredients:
1 tablespoon margarine
¼ cup chopped onion
¼ cup sliced celery
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
¼ cup milk
2 cups diced cooked chicken
2  eggs, beaten
¼ cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried chives
2 cups shredded zucchini, squeezed dry
1 tablespoon margarine

Directions:
Melt 1 tablespoon margarine in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion and celery until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir cream of chicken soup and milk into the skillet until well mixed. Add cooked chicken and simmer until hot. Cover and keep warm over low heat until ready to use.
Stir eggs, flour, Parmesan cheese, parsley, chives, and zucchini together in a large bowl.
Melt remaining 1 tablespoon margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 1/4 cup scoops of the zucchini mixture in the skillet in batches, flattening each mound slightly to form a pancake. Pan-fry until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes per side.
Spoon chicken sauce over zucchini pancakes to serve.
