Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package wide egg noodles
6 eggs, beaten
1 (16 ounce) package small curd cottage cheese
2 cups whole milk
1 cup sour cream
1 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Beat eggs, cottage cheese, milk, sour cream, 1 cup white sugar, butter, cream cheese, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl.
Stir egg noodles into cottage cheese mixture, then pour into prepared baking dish.
Combine 1/3 cup white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle mixture atop noodle kugel.
Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and noodles are golden, about 1 hour. Allow pan of kugel to cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before serving.
