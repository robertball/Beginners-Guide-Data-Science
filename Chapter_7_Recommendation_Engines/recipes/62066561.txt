4 large sweet potatos, peeled and cubed
1 stick real butter
3/4 cup water
1 cup brown sugar
cinnamon to taste (optional)
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Peel and cube sweet potatos and set aside.  In 3 qt. heavy stock pot put 1/2 stick of butter, 1 tsp. vanilla and 3/4 cup water (about 1 inch of water at bottom of pot).  Put layers of sweet potatos with sprinkled brown sugar, cinnamon (lightly) & dots of butter. Bring to a beginning boil and cover.  Simmer on low heat for 1 hour or until potatos are tender.  Check for water 1/2 way through cooking, it should not cook out but make a nice syrup.

Description: 
This is an old family recipe that's easy to make and tastes wonderful.  It makes a syrupy sauce that is out of this world.  It's also great with pecans added to the layers!
