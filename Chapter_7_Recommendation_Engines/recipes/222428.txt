Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 large sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®), cut into thin slivers
1 small red onion, cut into thin slivers
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups beef stock
3 tablespoons brandy
2 teaspoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups Italian-style seasoned croutons
3 slices provolone cheese

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir sweet onion and red onion in melted butter until softened, about 10 minutes. Cook and stir garlic into onion mixture until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a slow cooker.
Pour beef stock, brandy, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce into slow cooker. Season with salt and black pepper.
Cook soup on High for 4 to 5 hours.
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Ladle the soup into 3 oven-proof bowls; top with croutons and a slice of Provolone per bowl.
Broil in the preheated oven until cheese melts and begins to brown, about 3 minutes.

Description: 
This is about the best onion soup I've been able to come up with. Tastes better than any restaurant onion soup I've ever had.
