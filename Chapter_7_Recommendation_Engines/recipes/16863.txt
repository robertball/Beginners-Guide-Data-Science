Description: 
This light dip can also be used as a sandwich spread.  Serve cold with crackers or toasted on bread with Swiss cheese.  You can pack the dip into a gelatin mold, then turn out and serve with the look of pate.  For best results, make it 24 hours before serving to allow flavors to blend.
