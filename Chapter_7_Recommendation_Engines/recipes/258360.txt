Ingredients:
1/3 cup pomegranate juice
1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste
1 clove garlic, sliced
4 (6 ounce) fillets salmon
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 pomegranate, peeled and seeds separated

Directions:
Whisk pomegranate juice, soy sauce, and garlic together in a shallow non-reactive bowl until marinade is well mixed. Add salmon and turn to coat. Cover and marinate for 15 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; add garlic from the marinade and cook until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in the marinade and cook until reduced and thickened to a glaze, 4 to 5 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cook salmon on the preheated grill until flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes per side. Serve salmon topped with glaze and garnished with pomegranate seeds.
