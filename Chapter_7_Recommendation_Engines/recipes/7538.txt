Description: 
This is an old Italian family recipe for a cake we make at every big holiday. We actually lost the recipe for a while, and holidays just weren't the same. Then were overjoyed to recover it after a friend reminded us we had given it to her! We call it 'The Cake That Saved Christmas.' A chocolate delight any gangster would love.
