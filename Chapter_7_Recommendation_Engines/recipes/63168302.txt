Ingredients:
1 1/2 - 2 pounds Green Beans, trimmed
Roasted Tomato recipe
For Roasted Tomatoes:
4 cups tomatoes (if the tomatoes are the size of grape tomatoes, no need to cut them; if they are larger, cut so that they are roughly the size of a grape tomato)
Head of garlic, peeled
2 tsp. sea salt
1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
Preheat oven to 400F.
Mix all ingredients and place in a 13"x9" pan.
Roast for 40 minutes, stirring the tomatoes after 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, mash them up with a spatula and eat or store when cooled.
Herbs and vinegars may be added to this as well.

Directions:
Steam green beans for 5 minutes.
While beans are steaming, warm the roasted tomatoes, if necessary.
Combine both and serve.

Description: 
Soooooo good! This is not a difficult recipe, but you need an hour when you know you'll be in the house so that you can roast the tomatoes.
