Ingredients:
3 chicken breast(boneless skinless)
3/4 pounds fresh green beans ( this amount feeds my family so use what you need)
Red potatoes quartered
1packet dried Italian dressing mix
3/4 stick of butter melted

Directions:
Set oven to 350
Place chicken in middle of pan.
Add the washed and fresh green beans on one side and the quartered red potatoes on the other side.
Poor melted butter over everything  and then  add the Italian dressing mix on top of everything.  Personally I only use half the seasoning packet because I have a small family, so tweak  the recipe to feed all of yours ??
Cover with foil bake one hour.
