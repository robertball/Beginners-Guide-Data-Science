Ingredients:
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped green pepper
1/4 cup chopped fresh mushrooms
1 teaspoon olive or canola oil
1 cup unsweetened apple juice, divided
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/2 pound ground turkey
2 tablespoons cornstarch
3 tablespoons cold water
1 teaspoon soy sauce

Directions:
In a small skillet, saute the onion, green pepper and mushrooms in oil until tender. Remove from the heat; cool. In a large bowl, combine the vegetables, 2 tablespoons apple juice, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. Crumble turkey over mixture and mix well.
Shape into a loaf in an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 165 degrees F.
In a small saucepan, bring remaining apple juice to a boil. In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch, water and soy sauce until smooth. Gradually whisk into apple juice. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve with turkey loaf.
