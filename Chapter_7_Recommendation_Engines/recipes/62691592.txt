https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 cups vanilla ice cream *
1 1/2 cups milk (less for thicker milkshakes, more for thinner) *
4 peppermint candies or 1 big candy cane (more if you want it sweeter/mintier)
1 small handful of baby spinach (about 1/2 c)
* Amount for ice cream and milk are estimates.  I usually eyeball the whole thing.  Add enough to make a thick, creamy shake!

Directions:
Blend milk, spinach, and candies in a blender.  Add in ice cream in batches and blend until you can no longer see spinach flakes or hear candies in blender. Serves 6.  Enjoy!

Description: 
A semi-healthy version of the McDonald's Shamrock Shake that we all love.  Spinach replaces green dye.  Great minty taste!
