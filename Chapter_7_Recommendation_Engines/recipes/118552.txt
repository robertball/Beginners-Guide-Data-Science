Ingredients:
2/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 (3.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix
2 eggs
3 tablespoons water
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 (12 ounce) package miniature semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter, oil and sugars until light and fluffy. Add pudding mix, eggs and water; mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; gradually add to the chocolate mixture (dough will be stiff). Stir in the chocolate chips.
Roll into 1-in. balls. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 9-11 minutes or until set and edges are firm. Cool for 2 minutes before removing to wire racks.

Description: 
Crisp outside but chewy inside, these sweet sensations will disappear in a hurry. 'I home-school our six children,' writes Mary Dudek from Alliance, Ohio. 'The kids always have friends over, so I like to keep snacks on hand. They love these cookies.'
