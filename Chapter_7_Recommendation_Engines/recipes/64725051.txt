Ingredients:
Au Jus:
Pan drippings from roast, about 1 1/2 cups
3/4 cup red wine
2 cups beef stock
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
Salt and freshly cracked black pepper
6 rib beef roast, bone in, approximately 10 to 12 pounds
1 package cheesecloth, cut in half (approximately 1 yard)
1 sheet pan
1 roasting rack to fit in sheet pan
Seasoning Mixture:
1 tablespoon dried thyme
1 1/2 tablespoon dried rosemary
4 tablespoons freshly cracked tri-color pepper
1 1/2 tablespoons granulated garlic
1 1/2 tablespoons granulated onion
3 tablespoons kosher salt
1 tablespoon coriander, toasted and cracked
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 carrots, washed, ends trimmed and cut into large (3-inch) chunks
2 yellow onions, peeled and quartered
2 cups water

Directions:
1.	For the roast:
2.	Remove roast from packaging, rinse well. Pat completely dry, wrap with 3 layers cheesecloth. Place on a rack on a sheet pan in back of refrigerator, fat side up. After 24 hours, remove, unwrap, discard cheesecloth and wrap with a fresh piece. Place back in refrigerator for 6 to 9 days undisturbed.
3.	Remove roast from refrigerator. Remove cheesecloth, cut away the fat and trim the ends and any discolored parts of roast.
4.	Preheat oven to 500 degrees F.
5.	Place roast on a rack in a large, heavy roasting pan.
6.	Special equipment: Space in back of refrigerator for up to 10 days .
7.	For the seasoning mixture:
8.	In a medium bowl, combine spices and mix well. Be sure to crush the larger spices well for a uniform rub. (You can use mortar and pestle or large wooden end of a pounding mallet in non-glass bowl.) Rub roast with olive oil, then rub with seasoning. Let rest for 20 to 30 minutes.
9.	Prepare vegetables, make a bed in the roasting pan with the vegetables and pour in the water. Be sure to check the liquid level in the pan occasionally and add additional water, if necessary. (You will need this liquid to make the au jus.) Place roast on top of vegetables and place in hot oven. Roast at 450 degrees F for 40 minutes.
10.	After 40 minutes, reduce heat to 275 degrees F and continue to roast for approximately 2 hours, or until internal temperature (stay away from the bone while checking temp) reaches 135 degrees F. Remove from oven, remove from roasting pan, loosely tent and allow to rest for 15 minutes while making the au jus.

2.	For the Au Jus:

Turn off heat, add in butter. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Strain once more into serving vessel.
