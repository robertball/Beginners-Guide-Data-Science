Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 1/2 cups milk, or more to taste
1 (15 ounce) can white beans, drained
1 (4.5 ounce) can chopped green chile peppers
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1 pinch ground cayenne
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat until bubbling and frothy. Whisk in flour until it forms a smooth, golden paste, about 45 seconds. Pour in milk slowly, whisking constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes.
Stir white beans into the saucepan. Add green chile peppers, onion powder, cumin, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
One lazy weekend afternoon right after Christmas, in the midst of taking down the tree and lots of cleaning, I threw this fast and easy soup together to feed our little family fast with minimal dishes and effort involved. Garnish with cheese or chopped onions. We got out a few chips to dip in it also. It was a hit!
