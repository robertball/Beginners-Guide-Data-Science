Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp kosher salt
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup milk
2 Tbsp olive oil, divided
Toppings:
olive oil
roasted red pepper
Kalamata olives
banana peppers
cherry tomatoes
artichoke hearts
feta cheese
fresh basil

Directions:
Stir together first 6 ingredients in a medium bowl. Use your hand to knead the dough lightly until it forms a soft, smooth ball. If at any point the dough is very sticky, add a bit more flour. Knead the dough for 5-6 minutes. After dough is in a smooth, soft ball, cover with plastic wrap and let sit for a few minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Cut dough in half and roll each half out on a lightly floured surface. When dough is rolled out into a roughly 8×12 rectangle, transfer it to a baking sheet.
Prick the dough with a fork all over and drizzle with olive oil. Top dough with any toppings you are using (except for basil). If you’re toppings are kept in brines (olives, artichokes, etc.) then dry them off well before adding them to the flatbread. Season with salt and pepper.
Bake the flatbreads for 12-15 minutes until browned and crispy around the edges.
Remove flatbreads from oven and sprinkle with fresh basil. Slice and serve while warm!

Description: 
These beauties don’t have any yeast in them so they stay non-puffed and turn into crispy, cracker-like crusts. Topping options are many, but I really like the Mediterranean spread.
