Ingredients:
DOUGH
1 1/4 cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons margarine, cut into pieces
3 cups flour
3 tablespoons sugar
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons yeast
FILLING
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
6 tablespoons margarine, softened
CARAMEL
5 tablespoons margarine
1 cup brown sugar
4 tablespoons honey
1 cup chopped pecans (optional)

Directions:
Make dough in bread machine; use cycle 8.
Prepare filling in 2 cup capacity bowl, set aside.
Prepare a 13-by-9 pan by greasing sides and bottom.
Prepare caramel 10 minutes before dough cycle finishes.  Combine the margarine, brown sugar, and honey in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly.  When margarine is melted and the sugar is dissolved, remove from heat.  Immediately pour into prepared pan.  Spread evenly over bottom.  Sprinkle with nuts, set aside.
When dough is done, turn out onto lightly floured work surface.  Stretch into a 12-by-15 inch rectangle. Leaving a 1-inch border around all the edges, spread the surface evenly with the margarine, then sprinkle evenly with the sugar and cinnamon which will be quite a light filling.  Roll up, and pinch the seam to seal.  Cut into 12 equal portions.  Place the slices close together on top of the caramel, spiral cut side down.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise at room temperature for 45 minutes, or until puffy and even with the rim of the pan.
Preheat oven to 350.
Bake until tops are brown, 30 to 35 minutes.
