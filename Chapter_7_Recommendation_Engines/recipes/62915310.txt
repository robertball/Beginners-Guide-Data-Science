Ingredients:
1 teaspoon dried parsley
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/8 teaspoon dried thyme
1/8 teaspoon dill

Directions:
Mix all ingredients.
To make salad dressing:
Take 3 tsp of mix and blend into 1 cup mayo.  Beginning with 1/2 cup buttermilk, slowly blend buttermilk into mayo mixture, whisking until desired consistency is achieved.  Add additional liquid if desired.
To make dip:
Take 3 tsp of mix and incorporate into 1 cup sour cream or yogurt.  This to desire consistency with buttermilk.
For seasoned veggies:
Slice or dice veggies, drizzle with olive oil, then sprinkle with seasoning mix - a little goes a long way, so don't over do.  Roast veggies @ 400 until done (usually in my oven, 20" for most veggies, 30 to 40 for potatoes).
