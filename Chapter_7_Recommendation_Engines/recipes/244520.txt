Description: 
I learned how to make this when I dated a Belizean man for about a year. He is long gone, but I still make his stew and I love it! This is a very healthy dish but the limes and the hot sauce make it very flavorful. Serve with corn or flour tortillas. Each person may want to spice it up with more hot sauce as they prefer.
