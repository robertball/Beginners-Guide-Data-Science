Ingredients:
1 1/4 cup butter
2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsweetened dark cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 2/3 cups peanut butter chips (10 oz.)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Stir in the eggs and vanilla. Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt, stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, fold in the peanut butter chips. Drop cookies by heaping teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 7 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until set (cookies will be soft, don't overcook!). Cool slightly on tray, then cool on wire racks.
