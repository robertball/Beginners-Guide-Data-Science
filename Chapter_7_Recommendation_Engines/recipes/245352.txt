Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup shortening
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon rum extract
1/2 teaspoon brandy extract
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons cream of tartar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup colored sugar
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Beat sugar, butter, shortening, eggs, rum extract, and brandy extract together in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt; mix until dough is just combined.
Mix colored sugar and nutmeg together in a small bowl.
Roll dough into 1 1/4-inch balls; coat with colored sugar mixture and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are beginning to crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
