Description: 
Indian food is not just curried sauces. It's not too exotic either. Unless exotic is code for yummy and full of flavor. This dish features a healthy mixture of chick peas, tomatoes, onion and spices. Both carnovores and vegetarians will enjoy this meal. My kids love it. Leave out the green chile if the kiddies will be eating. Serve over Bismati or Jasmine rice and enjoy. Namaste y'all
