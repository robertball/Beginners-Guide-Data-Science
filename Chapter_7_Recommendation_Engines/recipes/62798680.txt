Ingredients:
1 lb shredded cabbage
3 T oil
1/2 bell pepper
1/2 c onion, chopped or thinly sliced
1/2 tsp black mustard seed
1/4 tsp cumin powder
1/4 tsp coriander powder
1/4 tsp turmeric
1/4 tsp ground red chilis
1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium to med-high heat
add the mustard seeds- when they begin popping, add the onion.
Stir til the onion begins to soften.  Immediately add the remaining spices except for the salt.
Fry gently til the spices begin to lose some of their rawness, usually about a minute or two will do.
Add the shredded cabbage and stir well to distribute the spices.  On a medium heat, cover the pan and stir occasionally until the cabbage begins to soften.
Remove the lid and stir the cabbage well to cook off the liquid given off by the cabbage as it cooks - the cabbage will shrink considerably as it cooks.
When the cabbage is thoroughly cooked and most of the moisture has cooked off, remove from the heat and serve with rice, chapati, or puri.
