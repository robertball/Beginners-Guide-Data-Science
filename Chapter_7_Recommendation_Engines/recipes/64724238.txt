Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 (16 ounce) package imitation crab meat, flaked
1-2 tsp Cilantro, chopped (optional)
1 (14 ounce) package wonton wrappers
Water
Canola or Vegetable Oil (for frying)

Directions:
In a bowl, mix cream cheese, imitation crab meat, and chopped cilantro (cilantro to taste).
Place wonton wrapper on a plate and cover with damp paper towel. Keep small bowl of lukewarm water nearby for the following steps.
Place 1 1/2 teaspoons filling in center of wonton.
Using your fingertip, moisten the edges of wonton wrapper with water. Fold one corner of wrapper over the filling, and seal the edges. If needed, dip fingertip in water and use more to make the seal. The filled wonton should be the shape of a triangle. Repeat with remaining wontons. Store prepared wontons on a plate or platter under a moist paper towel until ready for frying.
Heat enough oil in deep skillet, stock pot, or deep fryer (350F if deep fryer, otherwise over medium/medium-high heat). Working in batches, fry the prepared wontons until they are a golden brown color and crispy. Drain on paper towels.
Serve warm with your favorite dipping sauce. We use an Asian Sweet Chili Sauce.
