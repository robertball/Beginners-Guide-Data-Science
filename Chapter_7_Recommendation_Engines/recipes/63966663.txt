Ingredients:
2 boneless chicken breasts (cut into large pieces), 4 to 6 cups water, thin spaghetti (about 1/3 to 1/2 pkg), 1/4 onion, 1/4 red pepper, 1/4 green pepper, 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, cayenne pepper, seasonal salt, 1 can golden mushroom soup.  Salt and pepper to taste.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bring water to boil in large pot.  Add chicken pieces.  Boil for a one minute then turn down to medium low heat.  Simmer for 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, cut up onion and peppers and add to 1 1/2 cup cheese in large bowl, mix.  Pull chicken from water to plate and pour two cups of the broth into measuring cup.  Return rest of water to heat and bring back to boil.  Add spaghetti and cook until al dente. Tear chicken apart and add to bowl.  Drain spaghetti, add to bowl. Add soup and seasonings to your liking.  Add 1/2 cup of chicken broth to get a nice texture, not sloppy but make sure it isn't dry.  Pour into 11X7 casserole dish.  Top with the rest of the shredded cheddar cheese.  Bake for 30 minutes.  Enjoy!
