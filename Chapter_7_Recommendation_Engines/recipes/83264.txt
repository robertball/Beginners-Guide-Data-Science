Ingredients:
2 pears, cored and thinly sliced
1 cup diet lemon-lime soda
4 cups baby spinach leaves
1 shallot, finely chopped
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/2 cup toasted pine nuts
1/2 cup raspberry vinaigrette salad dressing

Directions:
Place the pears in a bowl with the lemon-lime soda. Set aside; this will keep them from turning brown.
Place the baby spinach in a serving bowl, and add the shallot, feta cheese and pine nuts. Drain the pears, and discard the soda. Add pears to the salad, and toss to blend. Serve with raspberry vinaigrette dressing.

Description: 
I invented this recipe the year our pear tree had too many pears. I serve it on very special occasions but can be made for everyday meals too.
