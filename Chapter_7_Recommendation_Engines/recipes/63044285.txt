Ingredients:
4 large avocadoes
6 roma tomatoes
1/4 C pitted kalamata olives (or other olives of choice)
italian herbs of choice (either a blend or your own individual seasonings)
salt & pepper to taste
dash of cold pressed virgin olive oil (optional)
1 italian ciabatta loaf or crusty french country loaf

Directions:
Grind the olives in a baby food mill or food processor to bring to a tiny chopped/tapenade consistency.
Dice the tomatoes
Dice the avocados to about 1/2 inch square
Combine olives, tomatoes and avocados, add salt (careful here, the kalamata olives are usually pretty salty, so may not need any additional salt) and pepper and several hearty shakes of italian herbs.  If desired, add a small dash of olive oil (don't need much, if any)
Gently mix so as not to make mixture too mushy.
Slice fresh bread (option - toast lightly).  Bring bowl of tomato/avocado/olive mixture to table, top bread slices at table as you eat them and enjoy a shared meal with family!  Even children love this stuff!
