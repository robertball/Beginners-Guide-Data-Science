Ingredients:
1 Box Cavatappi or Fusilli pasta
1 Cup 2% Milk
4 Tablespoons Flour
4 Tablespoons butter
1-2 cups grated cheese
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 pinch sea salt
2 Tablespoons Pesto

Directions:
Fill a pot with water, and bring to a boil. Stir in the pasta; boil until cooked to desired firmness. Drain, and reserve.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Add flour and stir until the butter and flour are well combined. Pour in milk, stirring constantly as it thickens. (For a thinner sauce, add up to 1 additional cup of milk)
When the white sauce starts to boil (bubble) add 1 1/2 cups of cheese, slowly, stirring constantly. When cheese is completely melted, stir in pesto, salt and pepper.
Return pasta to the pot, and pour in your cheese sauce. Add 1/2 cup grated cheese and mix well.
Serve topped with a sprinkling of Parmesan and a dollop of pesto.
