Ingredients:
1½ lb. carrots
½ c. unsalted whole cashews
3 tbsp. unsalted butter
¾ c. finely chopped yellow onion
2 tsp. minced fresh ginger
1 tbsp. sugar
½ tsp. salt
.13 tsp. cinnamon
1 stick cinnamon
¼ tsp. cardamom

Directions:
Cut the carrots into ribbons using a peeler down the length of the carrot.
Toast the cashews in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat until golden brown -- about 2 minutes. Remove and set aside.
Add the butter, onion, ginger, sugar, and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent -- about 10 minutes. Add the carrots, remaining spices, and 1 tablespoon water. Cook, covered, for 5 minutes.
Remove whole spices, toss in the cashews, and serve hot.
