Ingredients:
1 cup almonds
1/2 cup sliced almonds
1 cup cashews
1/4 cup chopped pistachio nuts
1/4 cup pepitas (pumpkin seeds)
1 cup dried pitted dates, finely chopped
1 cup shredded coconut
1 teaspoon fleur de sel (sea salt flakes)
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup coconut oil
5 egg whites

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x9-inch oven-safe glass baking dish.
Combine almonds, sliced almonds, cashews, pistachios, and pumpkin seeds in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse on the 'coarse' setting until coarsely chopped. Pour 1/2 the mixture into a large bowl. Continue blending the remaining mixture in the food processor until nuts are finely chopped and have a flour-like consistency. Add to the bowl. Fold in dates, coconut, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg and stir to combine.
Add coconut oil and egg whites to the nut mixture in the bowl, folding until well incorporated. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 40 minutes.
Remove and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Cut into bar shapes and wrap in aluminum foil for easy transport.

Description: 
At long last I'm revealing the recipe for my famous Whole30® snack bars. They are delicious as a midday snack or post-gym protein bar. Most protein bar recipes call for added sugar, sugar substitutes, artificial sweeteners, or honey...these use chopped dates to be Whole30® complaint! The recipe is influenced by ingredients found in Jewish macaroons, with egg whites and shredded coconut.
