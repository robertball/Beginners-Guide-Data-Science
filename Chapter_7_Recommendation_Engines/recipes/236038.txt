Ingredients:
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup sour cream
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups chopped apples
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust
Crumble Topping:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 tablespoons chilled butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Whisk 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons flour, and salt together in a large bowl; whisk in sour cream, egg, and vanilla extract. Stir in apples; turn apple mixture into unbaked pie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove pie from oven; reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; sprinkle crumble topping evenly over pie.
Bake pie until apples are tender, about 30 minutes. Cool before serving, about 30 minutes.
