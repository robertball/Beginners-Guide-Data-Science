Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 large onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, crushed
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into cubes
2 tablespoons curry powder, divided
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 tablespoons tomato paste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a rolling boil over high heat; add the fettuccine and return to a boil. Cook uncovered until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Fry the cumin seeds in the hot oil until they begin to pop, 2 to 3 minutes. Cook and stir the onion and garlic in the oil until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken and continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with 1 tablespoon curry powder; cook and stir another 3 to 4 minutes. Pour the diced tomatoes over the mixture and reduce heat to low. Stir in the tomato paste and remaining 1 tablespoon curry powder. Simmer 15 minutes.
Stir the cooked pasta into the sauce to coat. Simmer 2 to 5 minutes, until pasta is reheated.

Description: 
A delicious variation on the usual tomato sauce. Italy meets India. Use a good quality curry powder. I find that 1 tablespoon of regular curry and 1 tablespoon of Malaysian curry powder tastes great. Most Asian markets carry the Malaysian Powder and I like it because it has some heat to it. You could also add chile powder or chiles if you want it 3-alarm spicy.
