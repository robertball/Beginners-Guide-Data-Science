Ingredients:
1 can evaporated milk
1 ca condensed milk
4 eggs
1 t. vanilla extract
1/2 cup caramel milk (from AR posting or store bought)
1 box of chocolate cake mix (and ingredients called for)

Directions:
Preheat oven at 350F
Prepare flan: place the first four ingredients in a blender and process for 5 to 6 minutes
Prepare the chocolate cake according to package instructions
Prepare the mold (can use a Bundt mold) by spaying with Pam
Add to the mold the caramel milk all over the bottom
Add the flan mixture
Add the chocolate cake mixture
Place in the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes
Remove and let cool on top of a rack
Unmold by placing a plate on top of the mold and inverting quickly. (NOTE: you can make the caramel milk by boiling a can of condensed milk COMPLETELY covered with water for 2 hours.DO NOT let the water evaporate, add more boiling water as needed to keep the can covered with water at all times. At the end of 2 hrs. remove from the pan, and elt cool by running cold water on top of the can until it is cool) Caramel milk can be purchased at some Mexican markets as "cajeta", and at Argentinian Markets as "dulce de leche". Recipe for home made caramel milk can be found at AR - but it takes times, a careful eye, and some muscle!

Description: 
This recipe came to me via one of my husband's pot-lucks at work. he liked it so much that he asked for the recipe, of course for me to make it! It was so good, that I have had to share with many of my friends at work and it has become a tradition in our family! There are many versions of this cake; however, this on has a shortcut for the chocolate cake.
