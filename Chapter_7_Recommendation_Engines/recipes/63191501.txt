Ingredients:
1/2 pound bacon, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
3 potatoes, cubed
1/4 cup flour
3 (8 ounce) bottles of clam juice
1 cup milk
2 (6 ounce) cans minced clams
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup half and half
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
In a large saucepan fry the bacon over medium heat until crisp. Drain bacon on paper towels and set aside.
Saute the onion in the bacon fat for about 3 to 5 minutes, until translucent. Sprinkle flour on the onions. Stir well to coat.
Pour in the clam juice and heat until the mixture thickens. Add the potatoes and bacon. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.
Add the milk, clams (with their juice) and half and half. Heat through, about 5 minutes, not allowing to boil. Garnish with the chopped parsley.
