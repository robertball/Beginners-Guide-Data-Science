Ingredients:
4 eggs, separated
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons maple syrup
2 1/4 cups mascarpone cheese

Directions:
Whisk egg whites in a stand mixer fitted with a wire whisk attachment until soft peaks form. Set aside in another bowl.
Beat egg yolks and sugar together in the bowl using the paddle attachment until smooth and pale. Add maple syrup and beat until fully combined. Slowly mix in mascarpone cheese. Fold in egg whites.
Keep in the refrigerator for up to 48 hours, loosely covered with plastic wrap. Cream may begin to separate after 24 hours. Gently stir before serving.

Description: 
An Italian favorite to serve with pandoro or panettone, or even on crepes, or to dip your cantucci biscotti, this mascarpone cream is inspired by Elf, the movie. Instead of rum or brandy, this uses maple syrup for an extra boost in flavor. Buddy might put it on spaghetti, but I wouldn't advise it.
