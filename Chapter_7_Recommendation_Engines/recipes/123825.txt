Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) loaf French bread
1/2 pound ground beef
1/2 pound bulk pork sausage
1 medium onion, chopped
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon fennel seed
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 garlic clove, minced

Directions:
Cut a thin slice off the top of the bread. Hollow out bottom half, leaving a 1/4-in. shell. In a food processor or blender, process bread crumbs until coarse; set aside 1 cup. (Discard remaining crumbs or save for another use.) In a skillet, brown beef, sausage and onion; drain. Stir in reserved crumbs, cheese, egg, parsley, mustard, pepper, salt and fennel; mix well. Spoon into bread shell; replace bred top. Place on a large sheet of heavy-duty foil. In a small saucepan, melt butter; add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Brush over tops and sides of loaf. Seal the foil. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes or until cheese is melted.

Description: 
When my family first tried this sandwich loaf, they suggested I include it as part of our annual New Year's Day celebration. It tastes great with homemade soup.
