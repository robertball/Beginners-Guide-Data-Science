Ingredients:
3 medium overripe bananas
2 eggs
1/3 c vegetable oil
1 1/4 c sugar
1/2 c light sour cream (daisy)
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
1 1/2 c flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 c chopped pecans or walnuts, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a mixing bowl, mash bananas well with fork. Add eggs, beat together with fork.  Add oil, sugar, sour cream, and vanilla; mix thoroughly with spoon (do not use mixer).
Sprinkle flour over top of banana mixture. Sprinkle baking soda and salt over flour. Lightly mix all into banana mixture with spatula or spoon, just until incorporated. Stir in nuts if desired. Let rest in bowl 5 minutes.
Spray pyrex loaf pan with cooking spray. Spread batter evenly in pan. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees. Bake 1 to 1 1/4 hours or until toothpick poked in center comes out clean.  (Enjoy family time as everyone in the house follows the wonderful aroma.)  Cool in pan at least 5-10 min, then turn onto wire rack.
Serve warm or cold, plain or lightly spread with real butter. Enjoy real smiles from family :)  Store leftover bread tightly wrapped in foil (if you have any left.)
