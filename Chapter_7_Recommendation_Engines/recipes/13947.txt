Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package wide egg noodles
3 tablespoons tahini
1 lemon, juiced
1 1/4 cups water
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup yogurt, drained
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1/4 cup olive oil
1 large red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 zucchini, thinly sliced
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water until al dente.  Drain.
Meanwhile, mix together tahini, lemon juice, and water until smooth. Add garlic, yogurt, and pepper sauce.
In a medium skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Saute red pepper and zucchini in oil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until tender crisp. Add tahini sauce, and heat through. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Do not boil or overcook: this sauce curdles easily. Toss noodles with sauce.

Description: 
A creamy garlic sauce and a medley of vegetables served over egg noodles make a superb one dish meal.  Of course if you were looking for something a little more elaborate, a Greek salad, thick slabs of feta cheese, and warm pita bread are wonderful accompaniments.
