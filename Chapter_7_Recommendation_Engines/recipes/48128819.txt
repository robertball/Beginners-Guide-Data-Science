Garlic Cheese Chicken Rollups Recipe

Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 cup dried bread crumbs, seasoned
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 (7 ounce) package garlic cheese spread
(This was fantastic. Once I pounded the chicken breast, the pieces were pretty big so I only used 2 breats and cut them in half (enough to feed my family of 3). I made my own cream cheese mix with a tablespoon of fresh chopped onion, 4 tsp of minced garlic, and some fresh chives and parsley into 8oz of cream cheese. I slathered this on the chicken breast, rolled and toothpicked and then dipped in butter and breaded. It was delicious!!! I will make it again and again!!)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pound chicken breasts until thinned out. In a shallow dish or bowl mix together bread crumbs and cheese. Dip one side of each breast into melted butter or margarine, then into crumb/cheese mixture. Place a dollop of cheese spread at one end of each chicken breast, on the side of the breast not dipped in the mixture. Roll up each breast and secure with toothpicks.
Place rollups in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish and drizzle any remaining butter or margarine over all. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until cooked through and juices run clear.
