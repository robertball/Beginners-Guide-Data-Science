Ingredients:
6 firm bananas, unpeeled
6 popsicle sticks
2 cups chocolate chips
2 tablespoons vegetable shortening
1/2 cup shredded coconut, or as needed

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Cut 1 inch off the bottom of each banana and gently insert a popsicle stick into each one. Carefully remove and discard banana peels. Place bananas on the prepared baking sheet and freeze until solid, at least 2 hours.
Place chocolate chips and shortening in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.
Dip frozen bananas into the melted chocolate and roll in coconut.
Eat immediately or return to the freezer until ready to serve.
