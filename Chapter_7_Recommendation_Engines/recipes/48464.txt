Ingredients:
2 large artichokes (about 1 pound each)
3 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Rinse artichokes under cold water, and use a sharp knife to cut the top 1/3 off of each one. Trim the stems to about 1 inch, and remove the smaller leaves from around the base. Use scissors to remove any remaining leaf tips. Cut each artichoke in half from the bottom to the top, then use a spoon to scrape out the hairy choke. Rinse again to remove any residual hairs.
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, and saute for about 1 minute to flavor the butter. Arrange artichoke halves cut-side down in the skillet. Saute for about 5 or 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Reduce heat to low, and pour in about 1/4 cup of water, cover, and let steam for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the artichokes are tender. A fork should easily pierce the stem.
