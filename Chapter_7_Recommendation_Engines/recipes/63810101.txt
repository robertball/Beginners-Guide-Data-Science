Ingredients:
4 slices bacon, chopped fine
1 minced onion
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound pinto beans, soaked overnight
6 cups water
1 cup barbecue sauce (see related recipe)
1/3 cup packed light brown sugar
2 T brown mustard
1 t hot sauce
Table salt

Directions:
Cook bacon in Dutch oven over medium heat until beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes. Stir in onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add beans and water and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until beans are just soft, about 1 hour.
2. Stir in 1/2 cup barbecue sauce, brown sugar, mustard, hot sauce, and 2 teaspoons salt and simmer, uncovered, over medium-low heat until beans are tender and sauce is slightly thickened, about 1 hour. (If mixture becomes too thick, add water.) Transfer beans to 13 by 9-inch disposable aluminum pan and wrap tightly with aluminum foil. Using paring knife or skewer, poke holes in foil.
3. *If BBQ over charcoal (not gas), put disposable pan off to the side from coals (when there's about 2 hrs left for BBQ ribs) and position ribs directly above beans. This allows the beans to catch the drippings from ribs which makes them more flavorable).
Cover grill and cook until beans are smoky and completely tender, about 2 hours. Discard foil, stir in remaining 1/2 cup barbecue sauce, and season with salt. Serve
3a) Instead of grilling, may finish in oven by baking beans @ 300 degrees for 2 to 2 1/2 hrs more.
