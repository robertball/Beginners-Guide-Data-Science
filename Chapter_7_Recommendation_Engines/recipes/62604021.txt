Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable oil (canola)
6-8 shucked or 8 oz container whole fresh oysters
1 egg
1 cup panko (bread crumbs)
1/8 tsp cayenne
salt & pepper
1 cup mayonnaise
1/2 lemon juiced and zested
1 quarter dill pickle spear deseeded and small diced
1/4 tsp cayenne

Directions:
Heat oil to 180 degrees centigrade (350) in a small sauce pan
Prepare tartar sauce = Mayo + pickle dice + lemon juice & zest + cayenne
When oil reaches 180, take one whole oyster, dip in beaten egg, then coat with panko mixture (panko, cayenne, salt & pepper)
Carefully place in oil & cook until browned, turning once... about 1 minute each side
Place on paper towel on a tray and keep warm in oven (250 degrees F)
You can pace these a minute apart, so there are always 2 in the pot
