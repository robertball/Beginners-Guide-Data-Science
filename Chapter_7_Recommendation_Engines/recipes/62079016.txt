Ingredients:
2 pounds Tilapia fillets
1/2 cup lowfat buttermilk
1/2 cup potato flakes
2 tablespoons butter, separated
2 teaspoons garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley

Directions:
Combine garlic, buttermilk, salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Place the fish fillets in the buttermilk mixture, coating both sides. Let the fish sit for 5 minutes.
Preheat a large skillet on the stovetop. Coat the fish heavily with potato flakes. Melt one tablespoon butter in the pan and place the coated fish in it, and cook for 4 minutes.
Place the remaining butter in the center of the pan, turn the fillets distributing butter evenly under them. Cook an additional 3 minutes or until golden brown and fish flakes easily. Remove from pan, sprinkle lightly with parsley and serve.

Description: 
This is a great way to make fish for those who aren't big fish eaters. My mom came up with it and it has always been a hit! The crunchy potato coating is a delicious element to this quick and easy recipe which also works well with salmon.
