Ingredients:
2 tablespoons coconut oil
2 1/2 pounds bok choy, cut into bite-sized pieces
6 cloves garlic, grated
1 (3 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated
3 cups shredded carrots
2 teaspoons Chinese five-spice powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
12 cups vegetable broth
2 (2 ounce) packages cellophane noodles
3 cups fresh bean sprouts
5 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced

Directions:
Heat coconut oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add bok choy; cook and stir until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and ginger; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add carrots, five-spice powder, and cumin.
Pour vegetable broth into the pot. Bring the soup to a boil. Add noodles; reduce heat and simmer until noodles soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in bean sprouts and scallions. Remove soup from heat; let stand until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
