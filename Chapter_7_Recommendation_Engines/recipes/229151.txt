Ingredients:
1 whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces
2 cups ketchup
1  green bell pepper, diced
1  onion, diced
½ cup water
¼ cup oil
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Arrange chicken pieces in a baking dish in a flat layer.
Stir ketchup, bell pepper, onion, water, oil, vinegar, salt, garlic powder, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour evenly over chicken pieces to coat.
Bake the chicken, basting occasionally, in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
