Ingredients:
2 1/4 pounds pork spareribs
3 pounds raw taro root, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 cups water
1 onion, chopped
1 small white radish, peeled and chopped
2 large green chile peppers, chopped
1 small tomato, quartered
1 tamarind pod
1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and chopped
salt to taste
3 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed
1 small eggplant, chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil; boil spareribs for 15 minutes; drain. Thoroughly rinse the spareribs with cold water. Rinse the pot and return to the stovetop.
Return spareribs to the pot; add taro, 2 cups water, onion, radish, green chiles, tomato, tamarind, ginger, and salt. Bring soup to a boil. Cook until pork and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the rib bone should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Place green beans and eggplant into the soup. Cook until tender, 5 to 7 minutes more. Strain soup into bowls. Arrange the pork and vegetables on a serving platter while hot.
