Ingredients:
6 tomatoes
3/4 cup water
1/4 onion, halved
1 clove garlic
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 onion, chopped
1 serrano pepper
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tomato, chopped
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 (7.75 ounce) can Mexican-style hot tomato sauce (such as El PatoÂ®)
3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
3 medium carrots, peeled and cubed
1 jalapeno pepper, sliced
2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
1/2 tablespoon ground cumin
1 bay leaf
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring 6 whole tomatoes to a boil in a small pot. Transfer to a blender. Add 3/4 cup water, onion halves, and whole garlic clove. Blend until smooth.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chopped onion and serrano pepper. Cook until onion is transparent. Add minced garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chopped tomato and cook for 1 minute more. Add ground beef; cook until browned, about 8 minutes.
Pour canned tomato sauce into the beef mixture. Cook for 2 minutes. Mix in potatoes and carrots. Cook for 2 minutes; add the blended tomatoes, jalapeno, chicken bouillon, cumin, and bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper. Mix well, reduce heat, and simmer until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Let sit for 5 minutes before serving.
