Ingredients:
1 porc loin (good size)
salt & pepper
4 Tbs butter
1 cup of mixed fresh mushroom (any type will do)
1 handful of wild garlic greens or
2 cloves of finely chopped garlic
1 tsp onion powder or
1 small onion very finely chopped
1 cube of concentrated mushroom broth
2 Tbs flour
1-1/2 cups boiling water or heated white wine
1/4 - 1/2 cream to taste

Directions:
Melt half the butter in a large frying pan on a medium heat.  Split the pork loin lengthwise opening each side like a book.  Using a meat hammer on the teethed side, tenderize the loin on each surface (back and front).  Season to taste with the salt & pepper.
Once the meat is brown, remove from pan.  Saut√© the mushrooms, garlic and onion until tender.  Add butter midway through cooking.  Add flour and cook for an additional 2 minutes.
Add the hot liquid to the vegetables along with the mushroom broth concentrate.  Mix well making a velvety sauce. Add cream and slowly bring to a soft boil.  Return the meat to the pan simmering for an additional 10 minutes.
