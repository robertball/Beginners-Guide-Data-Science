Ingredients:
4 pork chops
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon dried rosemary

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat the inside of a baking dish with butter or butter substitute.
Arrange pork chops in the prepared baking dish; season with salt and pepper. Spread mayonnaise over the tops of each pork chop with a spatula. Sprinkle panko bread crumbs over the mayonnaise. Drizzle honey over the bread crumbs. Season each chop with rosemary.
Bake pork chops in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
