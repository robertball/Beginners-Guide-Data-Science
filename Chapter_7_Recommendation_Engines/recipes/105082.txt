Ingredients:
1/3 cup water
1 tablespoon dill seed
1 tablespoon honey
1/3 cup buttermilk salad dressing and seasoning mix
2 cups mayonnaise
1 cup buttermilk
1 1/3 cups milk
1 cup white vinegar
2 large cucumbers, quartered and thinly sliced
3 tomatoes, cubed
2 stalks celery, chopped
1/2 onion, sliced and quartered
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place water and dill seed in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes. Whisk in honey and salad dressing mix, then pour mixture into a large bowl. Whisk in mayonnaise, buttermilk, milk, and vinegar until smooth.
Place cucumbers, tomatoes, celery, onion, garlic, and salt into a separate bowl, and pour half of the dressing onto the vegetables; toss well. Cover, and refrigerate salad for at least 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate remaining dressing for future use.

Description: 
We developed this mid-summer salad to use an overabundance of fresh cucumbers, tomatoes, and celery. This recipe makes more dressing than you need for the salad, but it will keep almost forever in the refrigerator.
