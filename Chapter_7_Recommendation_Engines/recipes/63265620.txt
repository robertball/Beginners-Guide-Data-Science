Ingredients:
1 tbs sesame oil
1 small carrot, diced
2 stalks celery,diced
1 small onion, diced
2 organic skinless, bone IN, chicken breasts
1 tsp sea salt
pinch of black pepper
2 cups green cabbage, thinly sliced
1 bay leaf
1 tsp dried sage
1 tsp dried thyme
6 cups water
2 tsp apple cider vinegar
1/2 C long grain brown rice(omit for advanced plan)
1/4 C fresh parsley, chopped

Directions:
Heat the sasame oil in a large soup pot on medium heat.
Add the carrot, celery, and onion, and saute until the onions become translucent.
Push the vegetables to the side of the pot, lay the chicken breasts in the center and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sear for a minute on each side, then stir the veggies back around the chicken.
Add the cabbage, bay leaf, herbs, water, and vinegar. Bring to a boil then turn down heat and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken from the soup and de-bone it into bite sized chunks.
Bring the soup up to a boil and add the rice, reduce to medium and cover and cook 10 minutes or until the rice is tender.
Return the bite sized pieces of chicken back to the pot, adjust the seasonings (usually not necessary if you omit the rice), add the parsley, and serve!
