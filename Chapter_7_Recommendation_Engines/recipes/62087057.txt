Pan de Muerto Recipe

Ingredients:
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup butter
1/4 sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
2 1/4 tsp. active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees)
2 eggs (one separated)
2 1/3 cups bread flour
2 tsp. cinnamon
2 Tbsp. sugar

Directions:
Heat the milk and butter until the butter is melted.  Stir in the 1/4 cup sugar and salt; set aside.
Combine the warm water and yeast and let stand 5 minutes.  Mix in the milk mixture and one whole egg and one egg yolk (reserve the white for later).  Mixin the flour.
Knead until smooth and elastic - either 10 minutes by hand or 6 minutes with the dough hook on medium.  Place in a bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Poke it to check it - if the dough's done, it won't resist your finger much and the imprint will stay.
Knead the dough briefly to expell air bubbles.  Cut off 1/3 of the dough and set aside.  Divide the larger piece of dough in thirds; roll each third into a rope about 14 inches long.  Braid the ropes and form a wreath, joining the ends with a little water.  Divide the reserved portion in half, and shape each into a bone, about 7 inches long.  Lay the bones in crossed position over the wreath.
Let rise for 30 minutes in a warm place, until puffy looking.
Gently brush with reserved egg white.  Mix the 2 Tbsp. sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle everywhere but the bones.
Bake at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted into the middle of the loaf reads about 195 degrees.  It may be necessary to cover the loaf with foil for the last 10 minutes, to prevent over-browning.

Description: 
Dead Bread - I think every high school Spanish class in Washington got this recipe.  We got 10 points extra credit if we made it for Day of the Dead.
