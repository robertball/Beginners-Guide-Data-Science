Ingredients:
3 Avocados
2 hardboiled eggs
1/2 TSP lime juice
1/2 TBSP garlic, minced
1/2 onion, diced OR 2 TSP dried flaked onion
1/4 TSP cayenne pepper
1/2 TSP Smoked Paprika
Salt and Pepper, to taste

Directions:
Slice Avocados in half, the long way. Twist open, and remove the pit. Using a spoon, scrape the meat from the skin, trying not to damage the skin, and add avocado meat to a mid sized bowl. Set aside the skins, reserving for later. Shell the eggs, and combine avocado meat and mash with a fork or potato masher. Add remaining ingredients and stir. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Fill the avocado skins with the egg/avocado mixture until no more will fit, and enjoy!!
OPTIONAL: top with hot sauce!
