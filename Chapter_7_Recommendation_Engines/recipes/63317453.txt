Ingredients:
1 large Zuchini (cut lengthwise, not too thick)
2 jars of sauce (whatever you like)
1 egg
1 lb of bulk sausage
2 pkgs of Mozzarella cheese (4 cup)
1 container ricotta cheese (large)
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1 tsp basil
1 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder

Directions:
Cover a large 11 x 13 baking pan with tin foil, spread a small amount of sauce down in the bottom of the pan. Lay down strips of Zuchini just as you would pasta. In a bowl, combine 1 pkg of mozzarella, ricotta cheese, egg, salt, pepper, basil and stir well to loosen and should have a very smooth consistency. Meanwhile in a large frying pan, cook the sausage until browned and crumbly, add basil, onion powder, garlic powder, let cool. Take cheese mixture and spoon on top of zuchini and spread as evenly as you can (a wooden spoon works well), then spoon sausage crumbles over top of cheese mixture, top with a little more mozzarella, then cover with sauce. (use as little or as much as you like for sauce) just be sure to cover the zuchini. Then repeat layers. Cover with tin foil, and bake at 425 degrees for one hour. To see if ready, take a fork and poke the zuchini, if still tough, put back in at 20 minute intervals.

Description: 
This is a different variation from a traditional recipe, very tasty and healthy I might add! This is a delicious way to use up that garden zuchini you have left over!
