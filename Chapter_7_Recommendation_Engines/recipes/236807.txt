Description: 
If I made this same combination of ingredients 100 times, each version would be different, which I how I believe these things should work. When I buy peas at the farmer's market, I'm not thinking I need 2 cups, I'm thinking I need to buy some peas. The same goes for the mushrooms. Grab a handful and keep moving. Garnish with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and fresh parsley, mint, or basil.
