Ingredients:
1 cup raw cashew nuts
2 pinches sea salt
8 Medjool dates, pitted
3 tablespoons raw maca powder
1 tablespoon ground cardamom
2 teaspoons olive oil

Directions:
Put cashews and salt in a food processor fitted with the S-blade; pulse until cashews are finely chopped but not a paste. Add dates, maca powder, cardamom, and olive oil; blend until mixture is evenly combined and holds together.
Shape mixture into 10 to 12 balls and refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is my copycat-version of a bliss ball that I discovered at a local juice bar. These little guys taste amazing! They're raw, vegan, gluten-free, and fabulous. 
Maca root is a powerful superfood! 
These little bites pack a wallop and taste phenomenal! Kind of like a cardamom-laced salted caramel snack. Enjoy!
