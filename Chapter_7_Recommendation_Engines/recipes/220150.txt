Ingredients:
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into small pieces
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
5  green onions, sliced
3 cloves garlic, chopped
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 (6 ounce) bags fresh baby spinach leaves
1 cup thinly sliced fresh basil

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, water, and sugar in a bowl.
Marinate chicken in soy sauce mixture for 30 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat.
Cook and stir green onions in oil for 1 minute. Add garlic and cook and stir for 1 minute. Transfer to a small bowl.
Pour 3 tablespoons oil into the skillet. Cook and stir chicken and marinade until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 5 minutes.
Add spinach leaves to chicken. Cover for 4 minutes stirring occasionally.
Stir green onion mixture into chicken and spinach; cook to reheat onions, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir in basil and cook until heated, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve!

Description: 
This is easy and my kids love it. I've also made it with cubed pork from cheap pork chops. You can spice this dish up with crushed red pepper flakes. Serve over rice. Don't substitute dried basil, though! It has to be fresh! And though it sounds like a lot of basil, that makes the dish.
