Homemade Pork Fried Rice Recipe

Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) pork tenderloin, cut into small cubes
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon dry red wine (such as Merlot)
1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons honey
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 clove garlic, minced
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 eggs, beaten
2 1/2 cups cooked rice
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 cup frozen peas, thawed and drained
1 cup bean sprouts
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1/4 cup chopped green onions

Directions:
Combine pork, soy sauce, red wine, brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, and garlic in resealable zip-top bag. Seal and squish the bag to make sure marinade is evenly dispersed over the meat. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate overnight for best results.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drain marinade into a cup and reserve. Place pork on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, turning and basting with the marinade frequently, until pork is no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium to medium-high heat. Pour eggs into the skillet; cook and stir until set but still fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add pork, rice, and onion. Stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to turn translucent, about 6 minutes.
Sprinkle peas, bean sprouts, and soy sauce onto the fried rice. Stir to incorporate and cook, stirring occasionally until heated through, about 5 minutes. Add green onions and mix to combine. Serve immediately.
