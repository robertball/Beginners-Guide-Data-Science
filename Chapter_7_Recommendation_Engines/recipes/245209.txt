Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) box gingersnap cookies
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 (14 ounce) bag chocolate confectioners' coating, or as needed

Directions:
Crush gingersnaps to a fine meal in a food processor.
Mix cream cheese and ground ginger together in the bowl of a stand mixer. Slowly add gingersnap crumbs to cream cheese mixture until it begins to pull away from sides of bowl.
Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.
Roll cream cheese mixture into teaspoon-size balls. Dip each ball in the melted chocolate, allowing excess chocolate to drip back into bowl. Arrange truffles onto waxed paper to dry.

Description: 
My family loves the flavor of gingerbread, but I get tired of making the same old thing. I had an easy recipe for chocolate truffles and adapted it to make these little gems.
