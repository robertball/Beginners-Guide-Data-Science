Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, thinly sliced
1 cup heavy cream
½ cup chicken broth
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 cup spinach, chopped
½ cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken until browned and no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove chicken and set aside on a plate.
Add heavy cream, chicken broth, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning to the skillet. Whisk sauce over medium-high heat until starting to thicken, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and sun-dried tomatoes; simmer until spinach starts to wilt, about 1 minute. Return chicken to the skillet and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
