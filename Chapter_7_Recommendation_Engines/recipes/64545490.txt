Ingredients:
1 head of cauliflower, cleaned, leaves removed & cut into florets (about 4 cups)
1 small white onion, halved & sliced thinly (about 2 cups)
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
3-4 tbsp lemon juice
3 tbsp minced garlic
2 tsp paprika
2 tbsp parsley
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/8 cup Tahini

Directions:
Preheat oven 425 degrees
Place cauliflower in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper
Add 1/4 tsp each salt & pepper to cauliflower
Bake cauliflower 15 minutes then turn on the broiler on high to cook another 5 minutes
Remove cauliflower from oven & place aside
While cauliflower is cooking, heat a medium pan to medium high
Add extra virgin olive oil to the pan
Once the oil is hot, add the onions to the pan
Cook the onions until tender, stirring constantly
The onions can burn fast so watch carefully & remove when tender 8-10 minutes otherwise they will burn
Place onions on a paper towel & add 1/2 tsp salt & pepper
To the pan you used to cook the onions, turn the heat to low & add minced garlic
You should have enough oil left in the pan otherwise add a tiny bit more
After a minute, turn heat off add lemon juice, paprika, 1 tbsp parsley, tahini & whisk in 12 tbsp warm water to thin (I added 12 tbsp to mine)
Be sure to continuously whisk the sauce as you're adding the water or it may burn
Place cauliflower in a bowl, add onions to the top then spoon tahini over it (I like to reserve about half the sauce for dipping)
Sprinkle remaining cauliflower on top & enjoy!
