Ingredients:
1/2 cup warm water (105 to115 degrees F/40 to 45 degrees C)
2 teaspoons honey
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
2 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups milk at room temperature
5 3-inch round metal rings (such as wide-mouth canning jar rings)

Directions:
Stir warm water and honey together in a large bowl. Mix yeast into the warm water and let stand until the yeast begins to bubble, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir flour, salt, baking soda, and milk into yeast mixture. Cover bowl and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes.
Preheat an electric griddle to medium-low heat (220 degrees F/105 degrees C) and grease the griddle. Grease the metal rings.
Place the greased rings onto the griddle and allow to warm for 1 to 2 minutes; spoon about 3 tablespoons of batter into each ring. Batter will be elastic and stringy, but will fill out the ring as it cooks. Cook the crumpets until golden brown on the bottom and bubbles form on the top side, 5 to 8 minutes. Increase griddle temperature to 230 degrees F (110 degrees C) and flip the crumpets. Cook until underside is golden brown, 2 to 3 more minutes.
Remove rings from crumpets, grease the rings and griddle again, and turn griddle heat back down to 220 degrees F (105 degrees C). Repeat to make 2 more batches of crumpets.

Description: 
These are a little like an English muffin, except a bit more dense and cake-like with a hint of sweetness. They are good eaten warm and soft, or you can let them sit out a bit for a more European crusty texture, then slice and toast them. Serve in the manner of biscuits or English muffins. Good for sandwiches, too! Especially good is an egg sandwich made with these.
