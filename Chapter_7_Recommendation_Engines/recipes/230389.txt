Ingredients:
2 large tomatoes, diced
1/2 cup finely chopped red bell pepper
1/4 cup finely chopped red onion
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil
10 leaves fresh basil, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (1 pound) loaf French bread, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1/4 cup olive oil (optional)
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Combine tomatoes, bell pepper, onion, balsamic vinegar, 1/4 cup olive oil, basil, and garlic; let tomato mixture rest for 15 to 30 minutes.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Arrange French bread slices on a large baking sheet; drizzle with 1/4 cup olive oil.
Toast bread in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 1 minute on each side. Top bread slices with tomato mixture using a slotted spoon, allowing excess liquid to drain. Return bread to baking sheet and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.
Broil in preheated oven until cheese melts, about 3 minutes. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This recipe has been modified slightly over tim, but is always a winner, whether for an appetizer or main dish. It even works with winter store-bought tomatoes. The vinegar and basil bring out the flavors.
