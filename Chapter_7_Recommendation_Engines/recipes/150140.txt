Ingredients:
3 cloves garlic
3/4 cup chopped onion
6 tablespoons chopped canned chipotle chilies with some of the adobo sauce
3/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup lime juice
4 teaspoons ground cumin
3 tablespoons paprika
1 tablespoon salt (optional)
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
hot sauce to taste (optional)
2 cups Worcestershire sauce
2 (3 pound) whole chickens, cut into pieces

Directions:
Place garlic, onion, chipotle peppers, and vinegar into a blender. Puree until smooth, then add water, lime juice, cumin, paprika, salt, black pepper, and hot sauce. Blend until incorporated, then add Worcestershire until mixed. Pour marinade over chicken in a large bowl, and toss to coat. Cover, and marinate in refrigerator 6 hours to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil grate. Remove chicken from marinade, and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade.
Grill chicken until juices run clear, turning frequently, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This chicken is grilled after being marinated in a spicy marinade. The chipotle chiles give the marinade its smoky flavor. You can increase the heat to your liking with your favorite hot sauce. Habanero hot sauce works best, as very little is needed to increase the heat without changing the flavor of the marinade. I think mesquite charcoal works best as it enhances the flavor.
