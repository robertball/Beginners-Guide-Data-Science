Ingredients:
1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed
1/2 (2.2 pound) wheel Brie cheese, sliced
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place asparagus in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Cook until tender but still crisp, about 2 to 6 minutes. Drain and place in a shallow baking dish.
Lay cheese slices over asparagus.  In a small bowl combine melted butter, bread crumbs and sesame seeds.  Sprinkle over cheese.
Bake in preheated oven for 8 minutes.
Increase oven to broil.  Broil just until breadcrumbs are golden brown.
