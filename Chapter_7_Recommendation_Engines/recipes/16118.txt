Ingredients:
1 pound eye of round
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the soy sauce, ground black pepper and brown sugar to taste. Mix well and add the steak slices. Place entire mixture with meat into a sealed plastic container and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.
In the oven, place one oven rack on the highest rack setting and one rack on the lowest setting. Place a piece of aluminum foil OR a baking sheet on the lowest rack, to catch any drippings.
Preheat oven to 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Insert a wooden toothpick through the end of each slice of meat, and suspend each slice from the top rack in the oven, using the toothpick as a support for the slice.
Bake at 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) with the oven door propped open to allow moisture to escape. Bake for 6 to 8 hours depending on thickness of slices. Jerky should bend, and not snap.

Description: 
This is one of many variations I have tried. I use my oven. If you have a food dehydrator, be sure to follow factory instructions. I store mine in a plastic jar. No refrigeration needed, and it keeps for months.
