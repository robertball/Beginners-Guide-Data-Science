Description: 
This is a great soup recipe for a cold winter day!  Warms you inside and out.  It is very hearty.  If you love beans as much as I do you will definitely love this recipe.  It is my husband's recipe.  He makes about 10 prepared packages and presents them in decorative jars as gifts for Christmas.
