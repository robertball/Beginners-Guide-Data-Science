Ingredients:
Serves 4-6
400 g dry cannelloni beans
2 l cold water
2 garlic cloves
2 tbs extra virgin olive oil
1 sprig of sage
1 tsp salt
a few peppercorns

Directions:
Wash the cannellini beans and put them in a pot. Add the water, garlic, oil, sage, salt and pepper. Cover with a lid and place over a really low flame. The water must simmer very gently and not boil. The beans will take about 2-3 hours to cook. Let them cool in the cooking juices. Before serving, heat them up until warm, taste for salt and black pepper and drizzle with good extra virgin olive oil.
