Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cassava flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 cup maple syrup
3 eggs, at room temperature
1/2 cup grass-fed butter, melted
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Whisk cassava flour and baking powder together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
Combine maple syrup and eggs in another bowl; beat with an electric mixer until well combined. Add melted butter and vanilla extract. Continue mixing until well combined.
Pour maple syrup mixture into the flour mixture, mixing slowly until combined; batter will thicken a bit as it sits.
Preheat a pizzelle iron according to manufacturers' instructions. Cook pizzelles one at a time until golden, about 4 minutes.
