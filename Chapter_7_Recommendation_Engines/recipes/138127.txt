Ingredients:
1/3 cup ghee (clarified butter)
1 bulb garlic, peeled and minced
1/2 teaspoon toasted cumin seed
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 (3 inch) piece ginger, peeled and minced
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon salt
1 large onion, finely chopped
1 cup water, or as needed
1 (10 ounce) box frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 pound paneer, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon garam masala

Directions:
Melt ghee in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in garlic and cumin seed; cook until the garlic softens, about 3 minutes. Add tomato paste, ginger, 1 teaspoon garam masala, salt, onion, and water. Increase heat to medium, and stir until the tomato paste dissolves. Simmer slowly for 1 hour, adding water as needed to maintain a sauce-like consistency.
Stir in spinach and cook until hot, about 5 minutes. Add paneer, and allow to cook an additional 5 minutes, or until hot. Pour into a serving dish and sprinkle with cilantro and remaining garam masala.
