Ingredients:
1 cup margarine
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Cream together the margarine, sugar and eggs.  Stir in vanilla, flour, baking soda and salt.
Roll out (not too thin) and cut into any shape.  Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 8 minutes.
I have used confectioner sugar frosting, or buttercream frosting, or even canned frosting ( if I'm desperate).  Enjoy!

Description: 
These are soft, cake-like cookies, best with frosting.  Roll them out thickly, and bake no more than 8 minutes. They will stay soft, and everyone raves over them.  I use them as cutouts for holidays.
