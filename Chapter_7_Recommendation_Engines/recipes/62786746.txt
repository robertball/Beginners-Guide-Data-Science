Ingredients:
1 ripe mango, pealed and pitted
3 ripe banans, pealed
2/3 cup brown sugar
juice of 1/2 lime
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/8 tsp allspice
1 stick salted butter
3 large eggs
For glaze (make it when muffins are cooling): about 1 cup powder sugar and just enough water to make thick glaze. Add lime juice to taste.

Directions:
Pure mango and bananas together with brown sugar and lime juice. In a separate bowl whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and spices. Add eggs, room temperature butter and fruit pure. Mix well. Stirr in optional nuts and/or chocolate chips. Pour batter into muffin pan (paper baking cups work best as a liner). Bake in 350 F oven for about 25-30 minutes until toothpick inserted in the middle of a muffin comes out clean. Transfer to a cooling rack. Cover with lime glaze when almost completely cooled down.
