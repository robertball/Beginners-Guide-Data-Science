4 oz. smoked salmon, chopped (can use canned but fresh is much better)
chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (can)

Directions:
Mix the cheese, salmon and the chipotle sauce (these peppers are spicy so add as much or as little as you like).  Roll into a ball and cover with tosted pecan pieces.  Serve with crakers.
