Campfire Omelet Recipe

https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
12 eggs
1/2 pound deli-sliced ham, chopped (optional)
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)
1 green bell pepper, chopped (optional)
1 tomato, chopped (optional)
1 small onion, chopped (optional)
1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over a campfire.
Crack 2 eggs into each of 6 good quality, zip-top sandwich bags. Seal bags and squeeze to beat eggs. Open bags and add ham, Cheddar cheese, bell pepper, tomato, onion, mushrooms, salt, and pepper. Reseal bags 3/4 of the way shut, squeezing out as much air as possible, then seal completely.
Write each person's name on their bag using a permanent marker. Set bags gently into the boiling water; cook for 12 to 13 minutes. Remove bags using tongs or a slotted spoon. Open baggies and slide each omelet onto a plate.

Description: 
So simple and a great escape from doughnuts while camping in the outdoors. My kids love this recipe because they can cook it themselves and add exactly what they like. I place the optional ingredients in separate small baggies, lined up on the table, so each person can add what they like to their individual omelet.
