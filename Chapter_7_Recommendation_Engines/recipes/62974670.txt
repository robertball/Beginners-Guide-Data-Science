Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 lbs ground beef
1 large onion, chopped
1 green pepper, chopped
1 rib of celery, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 jalepeno pepper, seeded and minced
1 14 oz can stewed tomatoes, undrained
1 6 oz can tomato paste
1 32 oz can tomato sauce
2 cups water
1 4 oz can diced green chilis
3/4 cup chili powder
1 14 oz can red kidney beans (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste
Grated sharp cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
In a dutch oven, add oil and cook ground beef on medium heat until no longer pink, but not browned.
Add onion, green pepper, garlic and celery.  Season with salt and pepper and saute until the vegetables become somewhat soft, about 10 minutes.
Drain mixture in a colander and add back to pot.
Add remaining ingredients (except cheese), stirring well after each addition.
Bring chili to a simmer, cover, and cook on stove 3 to 4 hours.  If chili is too thin, put the lid ajar for last 30-60 minutes of cooking.

Description: 
I've been making this chili for the last 30 years.  It never fails!  Have a bowl of it with sharp cheddar on top, or serve it over spaghetti for chili mac with cheddar.  Great on hot dogs, too.  Perfect for a crowd, but also freezes very well.
