Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cream butter and sugars in 8 quart bowl.  Beat in eggs, one at a time.  Sift together flour, soda, and spices.  Add dry ingredients and heavy cream alternately to the sugar mixture. Work in the fruit and nuts with your hands, smooshing well until completely blended.

Substitutions for Darling's Hawaiian Fruitcake Cookies:
For dates and cherries, use candied mango and papaya.  Use macadamia nuts, in place of pecans. Omit nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves, and add 2 tsp. vanilla, banana, coconut, orange, or pineapple flavoring before adding eggs to creamed sugars.

Description: 
This is an awesome holiday cookie.  Great for gift tins.  Nothing says Christmas like fruitcake.  These won't be used for door-stops.  Even fruitcake haters will love them.  Try the variations for different flavors.
