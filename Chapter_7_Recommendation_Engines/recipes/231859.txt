Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 tablespoon milk
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons seeded and diced tomato
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
Heat a 6-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat; pour egg mixture into the hot skillet, tilting so egg mixture covers the entire bottom of skillet. Slowly cook egg mixture until set, 5 to 10 minutes.
Arrange small dollops of cream cheese onto half the omelet; sprinkle tomato and chives over cream cheese. Fold omelet in half over the fillings. Remove skillet from heat and cover until cream cheese has softened, 2 to 3 minutes.
