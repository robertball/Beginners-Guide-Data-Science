Ingredients:
6 tablespoons sesame oil
3 tablespoons sugar
3 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons sesame soil
3 ounce package Asian noodle soup mix (such as Top Ramen), noodles coarsely broken
1/2 cup slivered almonds
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1 10 ounce bag ready-to-use baby spinach
1 bunch green onions
3 stalks celery, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 large can mandarin oranges, drained
2 cups Rotisserie Chicken, chopped bite sized

Directions:
Whisk 6 tablespoons sesame oil, sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce in small bowl to blend.
Heat two tablespoons sesame oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Add noodles from soup mix (reserve seasoning packet for another use.)  Saute noodles until they begin to lightly brown, then add the almonds and sesame seeds.  Total browning should be about 8 minutes.
Pour contents of skillet into a large bowl and cool 10 minutes.  Add green onion, celery, red bell pepper, mandarin oranges, and spinach to the same bowl.  Toss with enough dressing to coat.
