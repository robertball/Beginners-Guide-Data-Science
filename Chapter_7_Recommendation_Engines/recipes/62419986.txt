Ingredients:
1   3 1/2 lb. Tri-Tip Roast
Rub:
3 Tablespoons Kosher Salt
1/2 Teaspoon Black Pepper
1/2 Teaspoon White Pepper
2 Tablespoons Garlic Powder
1/2 Teaspoon Onion Powder
1/8 Teaspoon Cayenne Pepper
1 Teaspoon Smoked Paprika
1/2 Teaspoon Dried Rosemary
1 Tablespoon Dried Parsley

1/4 Cup Vegtable Oil
1/4 Cup Red Balsamic Vinegar
4 Cloves Minced Garlic

Directions:
Mix rub ingredients together.
Mix mop ingredients together.
Rub half of the rub ingredients on roast and let sit at room temperature.
Start briquets and smoke chips on grill, get a glass of water to cool flames when necessary.
When coals are hot and ready, put roast on oiled grill.
Sear and grill for 5 minutes.
Turn over and mop with oil/vinegar mixture then
season with reserved rub mixture.
Grill another 5 minutes.
Continue turning, mopping and seasoning for 30 minutes.  This cooks to medium rare on my grill.
You need to know your grill and check with meat thermometor for desired doneness.
Roast will be charred black.  This is ok and crucial for the great flavor.
When roast is done, put on carving board and let rest for 15 minutes.
