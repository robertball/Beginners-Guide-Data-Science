Ingredients:
1 (12 fluid ounce) can frozen apple juice concentrate, thawed
1/2 cup apple cider
4 pounds Macintosh apples - peeled, cored and chopped
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
1 cup apple brandy
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
In a large saucepan, bring apple juice concentrate, apple cider, and Macintosh apples to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Stirring occasionally, simmer uncovered about 1 hour, until apples are easily mashed.
Mix dark brown sugar, apple brandy, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves into the apple mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Transfer to sealed sterile containers, and cool at least 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
This is the ultimate apple butter recipe given to me by a former English teacher who loves to cook. It reminds me of fall and tastes heavenly. It's sweet, but not too sweet. It is just perfect. It tastes great on muffins, pancakes and vanilla ice cream.
