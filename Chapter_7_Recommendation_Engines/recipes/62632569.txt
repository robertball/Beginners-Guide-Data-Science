Ingredients:
1 to 1 1/2 pounds smoked sausage, sliced
8 small new potatoes, quartered
4 ears of corn, shucked
8 small pearl onions
24 little neck clams
8 crabs, can be snow, king, Dungeness, or blue
8 extra large or jumbo shrimp
1/4 cup Old Bay seasoning
1/4 cup fresh parsley, optional
1 cup melted butter, divided in 4 bowls for dipping

Directions:
Pour 3 cups of water into the bottom of a steamer pot (steamer pot should have a basket or tray to keep the ingredients out of the water). You will need an 8-quart or larger steamer. Layer the potatoes, corn and smoked sausage in the basket. Sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon Old Bay Seasoning. Spread the crab over the clams and sprinkle with Old Bay. (NOTE: you cannot use too much Old Bay.) Cover the pot and place over high heat until it starts to boil, reduce the heat to medium and let steam for 20 to 25 minutes.  Add shrimp in last ten minutes and sprinkle with more old bay.
Dump the contents of the pot, but not the water, onto a large platter and serve with melted butter.
