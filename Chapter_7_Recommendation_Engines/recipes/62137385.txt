Chop potato into small cubes and carrots into small slices.  Add both to boiling water until tender but not mushy as they'll cook a bit more in pie.
Pour meat mixture and vegatables onto pie crust. Sprinkle in the salt and pepper.  Spread cheese on top of mixture. Add top of pie crust. Poke crust with fork around top about 4 times.
Cook in 350 oven for about 35 minutes or until crust is light brown.
