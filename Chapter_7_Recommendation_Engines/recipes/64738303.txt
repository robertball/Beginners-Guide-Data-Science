Ingredients:
2 Large ripe Hass avocados
3 cups chicken stock
1 cup full-fat sour cream
1/2-1 tsp chipotle
unrefined sea salt or Himalayan salt to taste

Directions:
1. Halve the avocados. Remove the pits and discard them. Place the flesh in a blender.
2. Blend the avocado until smooth. Add some stock to help the blending process, if necessary.
3. In a large saucepan, bring the rest of the stock to a boil, then remove from the heat.
4. Add the avocado mash, sour cream, and chipotle. Mix well with a spoon until smooth. If there are lumps, use an immersion blender or regular blender to blend the soup until very smooth.
5. Heat again until hot, but don't let it boil (this is very important! If the mixture boils, it might separate).
6. Season with salt if desired.
7. Divide the soup into soup bowls.
8. Serve with lemon or lime wedges and chopped fresh herbs (like parsley or cilantro) if desired.
