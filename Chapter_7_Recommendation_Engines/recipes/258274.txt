Ingredients:
Enchilada Sauce:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons chili powder, or more to taste
2 cups chicken stock
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon salt
Enchiladas:
cooking spray
1 pound ground beef
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, diced
2 (4 ounce) cans fire-roasted diced green chiles
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
8 low-carb high-fiber tortillas (such as La Tortilla FactoryÂ®)
1 (8 ounce) package shredded low-fat Mexican cheese blend

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour; cook and stir using a wooden spoon until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in chili powder  and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in chicken stock, tomato paste, oregano, cumin, and salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer enchilada sauce until thickened and smooth, about 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat the inside of a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Heat olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, green chiles, and green bell pepper until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix in ground beef and black beans. Stir in 1/2 of the enchilada sauce; cook and stir 1 to 2 minutes.
Spoon beef mixture evenly onto the center of each tortilla and roll tortilla around filling. Place tortillas, seam-side down, in the baking dish. Cover tortillas with remaining enchilada sauce and Mexican cheese blend.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.
