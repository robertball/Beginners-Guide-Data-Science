Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound lean ground turkey
2 cups cubed butternut squash
1 onion, chopped
1 cup 1% milk
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup crushed buttery round crackers (such as RitzÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking dish.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir ground turkey until crumbly and browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add butternut squash and onion to ground turkey; cook and stir until squash is slightly tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain any excess grease from skillet.
Whisk milk, mozzarella cheese, butter, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; stir into turkey mixture. Transfer squash-turkey mixture to the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle crackers over squash-turkey mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes.
