Ingredients:
2 pounds mahi mahi fillets
1/2 cup dark rum
1/2 cup fresh lime juice
2 onion, sliced into thin rings
1 lemon, sliced
2 teaspoons dried oregano
4 tablespoons butter
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Arrange the fish fillets in an oven proof 9x13 glass baking dish. Pour the rum and lime juice over the fish and place a slice onion on each fillet. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Remove fish from the refrigerator and pour off about 3/4 of the liquid. Leave the onion slices in the dish and place a thick slice of lemon on each fish fillet. Sprinkle with oregano and black pepper to taste. Place a pat of butter or margarine on each fillet.
Bake, covered, at 350 degrees F (165 degrees C) for about 20 to 30 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Be careful not to over cook the fish or it will be dry. Serve with the cooked onion and lemon slices.

Description: 
This is an authentic Bahamian recipe I was given on Bimini many years ago. This goes well with a nice salad, garlic bread and a bottle of good German white wine. If you like fish you will not have any leftovers!
