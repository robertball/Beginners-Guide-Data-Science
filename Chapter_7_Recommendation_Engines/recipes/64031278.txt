Ingredients:
1 Cup Water
1/2 Cup red quinoa
1Tbsp olive oil
1 Cup diced onion
2 Cups finely chopped cremini or button mushrooms
1tsp minced garlic
3/4tsp dried marjoram
1/4tsp dried oregano
1 large egg
2/3 Cup shredded cheddar
1/2 Cp whole pecans, toasted and finely chopped
1/3 Cup quick cooking rolled oats
1Tbsp soy sauce
Whole Wheat burger buns

Directions:
1.Combine water and quinoa in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover and cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork and set aside to cool.
2.Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease a baking sheet or line with parchment paper.
3.Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms, garlic, marjoram and oregano; cook, stirring, until the mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Let cool for about 5 minutes.
4.Beat egg in a medium bowl. Add the quinoa, mushroom mixture, cheese, pecans, oats and soy sauce; stir to combine. Scoop scant 1/3 to 1/2-cup portions of the mixture onto the baking sheet and shape into 8 patties about 3 inches wide, (I find having slightly wet hands helps during shaping),  leaving about 1 inch of space between each patty. (The mixture will be crumbly; patting it into burgers on the baking sheet makes it easier to work with. The burgers hold together very well once baked.) **if you have an oil sprayer, I mist each patty once shaped and that gives a nice crunch on the outside once cooked.
5.Bake the burgers until crispy, 28 to 30 minutes. Serve on buns with your favorite garnishes.
