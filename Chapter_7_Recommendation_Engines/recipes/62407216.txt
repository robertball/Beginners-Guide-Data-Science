Prepare grill to medium-high heat.
Remove shrimp from marinade and thread onto bamboo or metal skewers (all facing the same way).
Place shrimp on grill, cover and cook for 2 minutes or until just beginning to brown.
Flip shrimp over and grill for another 1-2 minutes.

Description: 
Do not marinate the shrimp longer than the indicated time. If you are using bamboo skewers, be sure to soak them in cold water for at least 30 minutes. I serve these with Orzo Salad and Grilled Zucchini and Squash.
