1 medium pepper(s), red, bell
1 medium pepper(s), green, bell
2 tablespoon oil, olive, extra-virgin

MAKE-AHEAD: Vegetables can be marinated on the skewers in a covered pan and refrigerated up to 1 day in advance.
Place the yellow squash, green zucchini, sweet yellow pepper, sweet red pepper, and sweet green pepper into a large pot of boiling water, for 1 to 2 minutes. Drain the vegetables, and then plunge into cold water. Set aside.
In a large bowl, pour the 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, then add the white wine vinegar, dried tarragon, garlic, dried thyme, and dried rosemary, stir with a wire whisk. Add the cooked vegetable, tomatoes and the mushrooms; toss gently. Let stand for about 1 hour tossing occasionally.
When ready to cook, drain the vegetables and place on skewers rotating the different vegetable for the best appearance. Bring grill up to medium high heat (about 375ÂºF), place skewers in grill and cover, cook for about 5 minutes, turn skewers over and cook for an additional 5 minutes.
