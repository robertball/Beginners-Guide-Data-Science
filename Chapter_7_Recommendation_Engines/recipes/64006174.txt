Ingredients:
1 large spaghetti squash
1 pound ground turkey sausage
1/2 cup diced onion
1 cup pizza sauce (no sugar added)
1/4 cup natural applesauce (no sugar added)
1/2 cup diced red pepper
1 cup coarsely chopped fresh baby spinach
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cut squash in half lengthwise and bake cut-side down on baking sheet for 25 minutes.
When the squash is cooked, remove "spaghetti" threads from skin and place in an 8 by 8 baking dish. Reduce oven temp to 350.
Brown turkey sausage with onion until no longer pink.
Remove from heat and add diced red pepper, pizza sauce, apple sauce, basil, garlic, oregano, pepper and spinach.
Spread sausage mixture over squash.
Add wisked eggs to the baking dish and toss lightly until egg is just combined.
Bake one hour uncovered at 350 degrees.
