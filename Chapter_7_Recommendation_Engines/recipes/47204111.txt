Ingredients:
12 oz ricotta cheese (low fat is OK)
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1/4 cup parsley flakes
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp basil
1/2 tsp oregano
1/4 tsp black pepper
2 eggs
1/2 of a 10oz package frozen spinach
-32 oz jar Prego spaghetti sauce (or your favorite sauce)
-9 uncooked lasagne noodles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 d.
12 oz ricotta cheese (low fat is OK)
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1/4 cup parsley flakes
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp basil
1/2 tsp oregano
1/4 tsp black pepper
2 eggs
1/2 of a 10oz package frozen spinach
(thaw and squeeze out excess water with paper towels)
Mix all of the above ingredients well; set aside.
-32 oz jar Prego spaghetti sauce (or your favorite sauce)
-9 uncooked lasagne noodles
In a 12x8x2 lasagne pan, make layers as follows:
1/4 of the spaghetti sauce, 3 noodles, 1/3 cheese mixture
1/4 of the spaghetti sauce, 3 noodles, 1/3 cheese mixture
1/4 of the spaghetti sauce, 3 noodles, 1/3 cheese mixture
last 1/4 of the sauce on top.
Carefully pour 1/4 cup water all around the edges.
Cover with foil. Bake for 45 minutes.
Uncover; add shredded mozzarella cheese on top (about a cup - more if you want); bake 15 minutes uncovered.
Let stand ~ 10 minutes before serving.
Instead of spinach, you can use about 2 cups of shredded zucchini; you can also add about 1/2 cup finely shredded carrot.
If you want meat lasagne, use 1/2 - 3/4 lb. sweet Italian sauasge, browned, crumbled and drained and layer it with the other layers.
