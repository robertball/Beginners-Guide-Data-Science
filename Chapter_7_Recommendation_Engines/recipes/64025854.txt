Ingredients:
2 1/3 Cups  flour (300g)
2 teaspoons baking powder (11g or 1 packet)
1 Cup shredded mozzarella or provolone cheese, or a combination (100g)
1 jar, 2.8 ounce real bacon pieces (100g)
1, 3 ounce, can French Fried onions (85-100g)
1 C quark, yogurt cheese, or plain Greek yogurt (250g)
3 T AND 1 t oil (50g)
5 T milk (75g)

Directions:
Heat oven to 450F, or 200c.  Grease a large baking sheet with edges (like a jelly roll pan).
Mix together well the flour and baking powder.  Add the cheese, bacon, and onions to the flour mixture.  Stir well to combine.
In a separate bowl, combine well the quark, oil and milk.  Add to the flour mixture and stir until thoroughly combined.  (You might as well use your hands, since they are required for the next step.)
Roll the mixture into 15 even balls.  Place balls on the prepared sheet.
Bake 20 minutes.
Eat when hot or warm.

Description: 
Our German host daughter is a lovely girl.  Her parents sent this recipe to me along with several others when I felt she might be craving some foods from home.  The entire family loves these.  The best way I can describe them is like a baked pizza hush puppy.  Just fabulous!

I included both the metric and US measurements (or as close as I could figure them from the metric- I actually weigh my flour for the grams).  You may need to adjust to your taste.
