Ingredients:
2 cups angel hair pasta
1/2 cup butter, divided
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/2 cup white cooking wine
1 lemon, juiced
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
3/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs
3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Heat 1/4 cup butter over medium heat in a large, deep skillet. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant. Add shrimp, white wine, and lemon juice; continue to cook and stir until shrimp is bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 5 minutes. Stir in red pepper flakes until well combined. Remove from heat and set aside.
Place remaining 1/4 cup butter, bread crumbs, 1/2 the Parmesan cheese, and parsley in a bowl. Stir until well combined. Set aside.
Place cooked pasta into shrimp scampi mixture; toss until fully coated in sauce. Add remaining Parmesan cheese and toss well. Top with bread crumb mixture.
Broil in the preheated oven until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately.
