Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
10 tablespoons butter, softened
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Sift together flour and cornstarch; set aside. Cream butter until smooth, then add white sugar, confectioner's sugar, vanilla, and salt; beat until fluffy. Slowly add flour mixture to butter mixture, beating on low until dough forms.
On a floured surface, knead in 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Shape dough into two equal parts, pat each into a 6 inch round, and transfer to baking sheet. Cut into wedges.
Bake 25 minutes. Remove immediately to cool on wire rack. Melt remaining chips and drizzle over wedges.
