Ingredients:
5 teaspoons olive oil, divided
1 1/2 cups chopped carrots
1 cup chopped leeks, white part only
1 cup chopped onions
1 pound butternut squash, cubed
10 cups water
1/2 loaf Italian bread, sliced
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 apple, peeled and cubed
3 teaspoons brown sugar

Directions:
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in large stockpot over medium heat. Add carrots, leeks, and onions. Cook and stir until softened and no longer crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Add squash; saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Add water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cover.
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a skillet over medium heat. Gently fry bread until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add bread to the stockpot; stir in allspice and ginger. Cook, covered, until squash has softened, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat remaining oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add apple and brown sugar. Fry until apples are well browned and start to form a crispy crust, 10 to 15 minutes.
Puree the contents of the stockpot using an immersion blender until smooth and free of chunks. Garnish soup with the caramelized apples.
