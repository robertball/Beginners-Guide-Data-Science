In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugars. Add egg; mix well.  Combine the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt and nutmeg; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk just until moistened. Fold in blueberries. Coat muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray and use paper liners; fill two-thirds full with batter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
