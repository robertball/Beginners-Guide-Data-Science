Description: 
The idea of Waldorf salad was unappealing to me for years. So I experimented with ingredients a bit and finally found a recipe that's incredibly delicious! This is my own spin on the traditional Waldorf salad. The ingredients crisp, filling, and bursting with juicy flavor. Perfect for hot summer days when you don't feel like firing up the stove.
