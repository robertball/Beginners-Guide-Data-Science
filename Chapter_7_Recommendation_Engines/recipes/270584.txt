Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup avocado oil
3 tablespoons aquafaba (chickpea water)
Topping:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup vegan margarine (such as Earth BalanceÂ®), melted

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray.
Mix flour, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, and salt together in a small bowl.
Whisk sugar, avocado oil, and aquafaba together in a bowl until sugar is dissolved. Pour in flour mixture; mix until evenly incorporated.
Spoon batter into the prepared tin, filling each cup halfway full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
Combine sugar and cinnamon in a shallow dish to make the topping. Remove hot muffins from the tin and dip in melted margarine; roll in cinnamon sugar to coat. Serve warm.
