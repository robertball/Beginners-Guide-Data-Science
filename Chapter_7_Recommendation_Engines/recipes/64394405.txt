Ingredients:
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 Tbsp olive
2 tsp chili powder
1 1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/4 tsp seasoned salt
1 (15 oz) can diced tomatoes with green chilies (or diced tomatoes and 1 jalapeno)
1 medium onion, sliced
1/2 red bell pepper
1/2 green bell pepper
1 Package of Organic Tortillas

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
Cut the chicken breasts, red and green bell pepper into stripes, and slice the onion.
Place chicken strips in a greased 13Ã—9 baking dish.
In a small bowl combine the oil, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, dried oregano, and salt. Drizzle the spice mixture over the chicken and stir to coat. Next add the tomatoes, peppers, and onions to the dish and stir to combine. Bake uncovered for 20-25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender.
