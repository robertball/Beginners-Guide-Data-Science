Ingredients:
1 pound carrots, peeled and trimmed
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Brush carrots with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Place carrots on the grill, perpendicular to the grates. Reduce heat to medium and cook, turning them regularly, until carrots have started to caramelize and are cooked throughout, 14 to 18 minutes. Move them to indirect heat and continue cooking if they start burning.
Brush carrots with maple syrup and grill 1 minute more before transferring to a plate. Serve immediately.

Description: 
These grilled carrots have a lovely sweet and smoky caramelized flavor, and are a nice change of pace at a summer cookout or dinner party. Use carrots that are no larger than 3/4-inch thick, or cut larger carrots in half lengthwise for even cooking. One pound should yield 6 to 8 medium carrots.
