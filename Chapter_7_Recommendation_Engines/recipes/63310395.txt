Ingredients:
2 Cups All-Purpose Flour
1 Cup Whole Wheat Flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 Tablespoon Baking Powder
4 Tablespoons Maple Syrup (use the good, real stuff)
1 Bottle Dark Beer
8 Tablespoons Salted Butter, Melted & Divided
1 Cup Shredded Sharp Cheddar Cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a 12-cup muffin pan, drizzle about 1/2 teaspoon melted butter into each cup.  Place in oven for approximately 5 minutes to brown slightly.
Meanwhile, sift together flour, salt, and baking powder.
Stir in the remaining melted butter.  Next stir in the beer and then the cheddar just until combined.
Using an ice-cream scoop, plop the batter/dough into the muffin cups.
Bake approximately 15 minutes or just until the top is done and springs back slightly, or a knife inserted into a muffin in the center comes out clean.
