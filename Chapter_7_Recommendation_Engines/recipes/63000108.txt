Ingredients:
Rub Mix:
2 tablespoons onion powder
2 tablespoons salt
2 tablespoons smoked paprika
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons dried thyme
2 teaspoons brown sugar
Chicken:
4lb bird should do wash and dried
Vegetable Oil
1 12oz Budweiser
Rub mix

Directions:
Rub Mix:
In a small Ziploc sandwich bag mix all the rub ingredients. Zip the bag shut and shake it around to mix all the ingredients together. You'll have more than enough rub for the chicken so i recommend pouring half or so in small bowl to use for rubbing the chicken. The remainder of the rub can be stored and used at another time.
Chicken:
Preheat the grill to medium heat.
Make a slice in the skin of at the top of the neck cavity in the front and back of the chicken. With your hand work to separate the skin from the body, make sure to be careful you dont want to rip the skin. Next rub the cavity and skin with the vegetable oil. Season the chicken with rub mixture between the skin and the chicken also over the skin, make sure to season the cavity of the chicken also. Poor out half the beer and sit the chicken on the beer. Cook the chicken for and hour to and hour and a half or till your thermometer reads 165*F.
