Ingredients:
10 ounces brussels sprouts, quartered
3/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 large pork tenderloin (about 1 1/4 pounds), butterflied
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup white wine
1/4 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup diced pancetta or bacon
1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced
1/4 cup dried cherries
1 tablespoon chopped sage leaves

Directions:
1. In a medium pot fitted with a steamer, steam brussels sprouts 8 minutes.
2. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon each salt and black pepper on pork and then spread with mustard. In a 12-inch skillet, warm 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat; add pork and cook 7 minutes. Turn and cook 6 minutes more; remove from pan and slice. Add wine and chicken broth to pan and stir, scraping up brown bits; set aside and keep warm.
3. Warm remaining olive oil in a small saute pan over medium-high heat. Add pancetta or bacon and saute until brown, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add onion; cook until translucent, 5 minutes. Add cherries, sage, and brussels sprouts; cook 3 minutes more. Season with remaining salt and black pepper.
4. On a platter, arrange pork and vegetables; drizzle with sauce. Serve.
