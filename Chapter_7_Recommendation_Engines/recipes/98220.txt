Ingredients:
3 large eggs
1 pinch fine salt
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
6 slices fresh challah
Confectioners' sugar, maple syrup or jam for serving

Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, salt and vanilla.
Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a 9-inch frying pan over a medium flame until melted. Working with 1 piece at a time, turn 2 challah slices in the eggs so that it soaks the bread. Put both slices in the pan. Cook until lightly browned on one side, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn with a spatula and cook for another 2 minutes, or until browned on the second side. Serve up those 2 slices immediately and continue cooking, using 1 tablespoon butter for each batch until you've used all the bread and egg. Serve sprinkled with confectioners' sugar or with maple syrup or jam.
