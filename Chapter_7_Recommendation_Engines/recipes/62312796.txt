2 tablespoons Fresh lemon juice

1/2 teaspoon Dark sesame oil
1 pound Fresh green beans
1 medium Jicama -- peeled and julienned
1 Red onion -- thinly sliced

Directions:
Blanch the green beans, shock them in cold water to halt the cooking process, chop them into bite-size pieces, and set them aside.
Whisk together dressing ingredients. Add green beans, jicama, and red onion. Toss well with dressing. Chill at least 1 hour before serving, tossing again after 1/2 hour (to help the marinating process).
