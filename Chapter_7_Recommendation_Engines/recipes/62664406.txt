Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoon butter, divided
1 1/2 tablespoon olive oil, divided
3 cups crusty bread, cubed
2 teaspoons minced fresh garlic
2 medium zucchini (approx. 11 inches each)
1 1/2 cup chopped roma tomato
1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, chopped very fine
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese (medium sharpness)
1 beaten egg

Directions:
In a large skillet, melt half the butter and half the olive oil over medium heat. Add cubed bread and toss gently to coat.  Saute 3-4 minutes, until fragrant and lightly toasted.
Add minced garlic and saute one minute. Set aside on plate to cool.
Slice zucchini lengthwise with stem and flower ends intact. Use a small spoon to hollow out squash, leaving a 1/4&quot; shell. Place squash &#8220;boats&#8221; in a large baking dish.
Coarsely chop squash innards.
Heat remaining butter or oil in skillet over medium-high heat.
Add chopped squash and tomatoes, rosemary, salt and pepper. Saute 3-4 minutes until vegetables soften.  Remove from heat.
Combine vegetable mixture with toasted bread and 1 1/2 cups grated cheese.
Add beaten egg, stirring to combine.
Stuff zucchini &#8220;boats&#8221; equally with vegetable mixture.
Bake 25 minutes.
Remove from oven and set heat to broil.
Top each squash with an equal amount of remaining cheese. Return to oven and broil 2-3 minutes until golden brown and bubbly.
Serve immediately
