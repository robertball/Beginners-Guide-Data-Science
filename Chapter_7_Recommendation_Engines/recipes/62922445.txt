Ingredients:
2 cans refried beans
1 lb hamburger
1 can sliced potatoes (chop these further)
1 sm can diced green chilies
1 jar mild salsa
1 jar hot salsa
1 sm can sliced black olives
1 whole green onions diced
2 med tomatoes diced
1/2 lb Jack cheese shredded
1/2 lb Chedder cheese shredded
1 tbsp chili powder
1 tsp garlic salt
1/2 tsp salt
1/8 tsp pepper
1 pkg flour tortillas burrito size (12)

Directions:
Brown meat and drain. Add chili powder, garlic salt, salt, pepper and potatoes (chopped)
add beans, olives, tomatoes and onions.
Heat mixture in skillet or sauce pan over medium heat until heated through.
To begin your "assembly line", tear 12 sheets of aluminum foil big enough to wrap one burrito each. Have cheese in separate bowls and salsas ready.
Heat up one flour tortilla at a time in microwave for 10-15 sec until soft.
Lay tortilla on a sheet of aluminum foil, spoon approx 1/4 to 1/2 cup bean mixture into center of tortilla. Sprinkle some of both cheeses ontop. Put a large spoonful of salsa on top of the cheese. (I create half of my burritos in mild salsa, the other half in hot). Roll up tortilla in burrito fashion (fold one end in first, then roll and fold last end over). Roll aluminum foil up around burrito, folding in ends. Make sure you keep the hot salsa burritos in their own pile for easy identification in freezer.
You can eat burritos right away, or take frozen burritos out, just open up aluminum foil with burrito on it and place on baking sheet. Bake at 350 for approx 15 mins on each side.
