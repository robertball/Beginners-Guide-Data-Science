Ingredients:
Shrimp:
2 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 lime, juiced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 pinch salt to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch ground cumin, or to taste
1 pinch chili powder, or to taste
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup uncooked brown rice
1 pound chorizo sausage
Bowls:
8 (10 inch) flour tortillas, or as needed
cooking spray
Sauce:
2 limes, juiced
1 (8 ounce) container low-fat yogurt
1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
1/2 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules, or to taste
Salad:
1 (8 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 head green cabbage, chopped
1 head red leaf lettuce, chopped
2 large tomatoes, chopped
2 red onions, chopped
2 red bell peppers, chopped
2 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced
1 pinch paprika, or to taste

Directions:
Combine shrimp, lime juice, garlic, salt, black pepper, cumin, and chili powder in a bowl and marinate for at least 30 minutes.
Bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo in the hot skillet until starting to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add shrimp; cook until opaque, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let shrimp continue to cook, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain any excess grease and liquid.
Coat tortillas lightly with cooking spray. Place tortillas in an oven-safe metal or glass bowl to hold the shape.
Bake tortillas in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Mix lime juice, yogurt, chipotle peppers, and chicken bouillon together to make the sauce.
Add rice equally to the bottoms of the tortilla bowls. Cover with beans; add cabbage, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, and bell peppers. Top with the shrimp-chorizo mixture, avocados, and sauce. Sprinkle paprika on top.
