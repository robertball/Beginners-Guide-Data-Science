Ingredients:
1 lb new potatoes
1 small onion
1 can coconut milk, unshaken
1.5c chicken boullion
0.5tsp salt
0.5tsp pepper

Directions:
Chop new potatoes in half and add to a pot (if using larger potatoes, peel them and cut into 1 inch cubes).
Thinly slice onion and add to pot with potatoes.
Skim off the thick coconut cream from the top of the can of coconut milk. You should get about 0.25 of a cup, but you can add a little of the coconut water to meet this amount. Add coconut cream to potatoes.
Add chicken boullion and salt and pepper to potatoes.
Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly.
Reduce heat, cover with a lid and simmer until the potatoes are tender. Stir occasionally.
