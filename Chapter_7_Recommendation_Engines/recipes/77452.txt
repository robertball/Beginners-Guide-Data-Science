Ingredients:
1 medium pumpkin - peeled and cubed
5 cups chicken broth, divided
6 dried red chile peppers, stemmed and seeded
1 teaspoon butter
1 large onion, chopped
2 pounds leeks, chopped
1 teaspoon cumin
1 bay leaf
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Bake the pumpkin on a baking sheet in the preheated oven until soft, 30 to 40 minutes.
Combine 2 cups chicken broth and chile peppers in a saucepan over medium-low heat; simmer for 30 minutes.
Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in the butter until caramelized, about 45 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
Cook leeks in the same stockpot until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Add pumpkin, chicken broth with chile peppers, caramelized onion, remaining 3 cups chicken broth, and cumin. Simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Add bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat; stir in buttermilk. Discard bay leaf before serving.

Description: 
Sweet pumpkin, smoky chiles, and tangy buttermilk make this a great cold-weather soup. Be creative with substituting other spices (cinnamon, ginger, cloves, cumin, etc.) to change the feel of the soup. It's great hot or cold with a bit of creme fraiche.
