Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) sirloin tip roast
1 1/4 cups beef broth, divided
4 (8 ounce) can mushroom stems and pieces, drained
1 envelope onion soup mix
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 tablespoons cornstarch

Directions:
Place roast in a large dutch oven with the tablespoon of vegetable oil. Braise it for 10 minutes turning it over so both sides are browned . Pour 1 cup beef broth and mushrooms over roast. Sprinkle with soup mix. Bake in the covered Dutch oven  at 350 degrees F for 1 1/2 hours or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).
Remove roast to a serving platter and keep warm. Pour drippings and mushrooms into a saucepan. Combine cornstarch and remaining water until smooth; gradually stir into drippings. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve with sliced beef.
