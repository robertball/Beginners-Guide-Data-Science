Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
1/4 cup non-fat plain yogurt
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 egg
1 egg yolk
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup blueberries
1/2 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease baking sheets or line with parchment paper.
Sift together flour and baking soda in a small bowl; set aside.
Beat melted butter, yogurt, brown sugar, and white sugar in a bowl until blended. Beat in vanilla extract, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy; mix in flour mixture until just blended. Stir in chocolate chips, blueberries, and cranberries by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop 1/4 cup cookie dough 3-inches apart on prepared baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until edges are lightly toasted, 15 to 17 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
Blueberries are both healthy and great tasting. I altered this original recipe by adding a bunch of them, along with some dried cranberries and some yogurt for butter. They are still big and chewy and super yummy but healthier as well.
