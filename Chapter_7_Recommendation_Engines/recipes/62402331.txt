Description: 
This was the first meal my hubby made me when we were dating.  It is one of the meals he grew up eating.  It sounds strange but let me tell you, you will not be disappointed!  This chicken is juicy, a little sweet and will have you making often.  My kids just love this chicken.  I serve with mac & cheese along with any veggie.
