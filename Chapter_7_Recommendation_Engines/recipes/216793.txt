Ingredients:
1 double crust ready-to-use pie crust
3 cups diced rhubarb
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/3 cup light cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place the rhubarb into one of the prepared pie crusts. Beat together the eggs, sugar, cream, vanilla extract, and flour until evenly blended; pour over the rhubarb. Use the remaining pie crust to create a lattice, and place on top of the pie.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, then reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue baking 45 minutes. Cool completely before serving.
