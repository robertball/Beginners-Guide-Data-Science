Description: 
When you suspect you're done shaking this creamy gin drink, think again. You've only just begin. Keep shaking. Then shake some more. It's a beautiful cocktail, but you have to shake that juice and cream and egg white like crazy to get the right silky texture. Don't give up, it's worth it!
