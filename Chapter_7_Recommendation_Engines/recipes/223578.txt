1 bunch Italian parsley, chopped
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
3 tablespoons raw sugar
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil; add lentils. Cook until lentils are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and rinse.
Combine corn, kidney beans, and parsley in a bowl. Whisk olive oil, vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper together in a separate bowl. Add lentils and dressing to corn mixture; stir to coat.
Chill in refrigerator before serving, about 1 hour.

Description: 
With the rising prices of meat and my pocket book getting smaller and smaller, I have started to experiment with lentils and beans. It's cheap, easy, flavorful, and packed full of protein. Please note the dressing is to my taste so I would suggest tasting as you go. I have also substituted the vinegar with lime juice and the parsley with cilantro for a different flavor. Just play with whatever ingredients you have in the pantry!
