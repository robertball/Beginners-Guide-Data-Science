Ingredients:
1 cup cornmeal
1 cup cold water
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups boiling water
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a mixing bowl combine cornmeal, cold water and salt. Grease a loaf pan.
Bring the remaining 3 cups of water to a rolling boil and stir in the cornmeal mixture. Bring the mixture back to a boil while stirring constantly. Reduce heat to a simmer and stir in the cheese.
Let the mixture simmer for 20 to 30 minutes; stirring frequently. Allow the polenta to simmer until it becomes very thick. Spread the mixture into the loaf pan and refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving.

Description: 
Why buy polenta in a box when you can make it from scratch cheaper?  A great day-before dish. Once the polenta has been refrigerated serve it in a variety of different ways: sliced and fried--or serve it immediately as a mashed potato or rice substitute!
