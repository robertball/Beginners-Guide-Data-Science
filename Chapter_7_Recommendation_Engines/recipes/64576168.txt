Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups Huy Fong Sriracha
1 1/4 cups apple cider vinegar
3 tbsp maple syrup
1/2 tsp ghost chili hot sauce

Directions:
This fits and mixes very well in a standard 28oz sriracha bottle.  I typically brine chicken thighs or whole leg quarters for 1-2 hours, and then I follow up with a 2 hours marinade in this sauce (or sometimes overnight).  After that, it's off to the grill.  Low and slow until it's nice and crispy.

I whipped this together one night for an overnight chicken leg quarter marinade.  It changed my life.
