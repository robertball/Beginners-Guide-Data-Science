1 cup tapioca starch or corn starch or a mix of the two

Description: 
This easy mix has been producing successful recipes in my kitchen for 8 years and can be substituted for regular flour. It has a mild flavor and produces a soft, tender crumb. The gluten eaters will not be able to taste a difference thanks to the wheat- like taste of sorghum. Don't omit the xantham gum, it's essential!
