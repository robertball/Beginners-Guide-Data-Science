1 1/2 tsp vanilla
3/4 tsp pure peppermint extract
1/4 C cornstarch
1/4 C powdered sugar

Line a 9 x 9 pan with plastic wrap.   Leave enough plastic wrap to cover the top as well, spray lightly with cooking spray.
Put the 6 Tbsp of water in a large mixing bowl, sprinkle on the gelatin to soften.
In a tall saucepan add the sugar, lt. corn syrup and 1/4 C water.   Bring to boil over med heat while stirring.  Boil one full minute or bring to 240 degrees on candy thermometer.
Pour hot liquid into gelatin, add salt and begin whipping. Whip for 8-10 minutes and will increase in volume and stiffness.   Add the vanilla and peppermint in the last minute mixing in well.  Pour into prepared pan.  Several drops of red food color, then swirl with a toothpick.  Let stand at room temperature 4 hours.

Dip each side of the marshmallow into the cornstarch/ powdered sugar mixture.  Store in airtight container or ziplock bag.
