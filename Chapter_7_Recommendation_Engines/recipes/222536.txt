Ingredients:
6 tablespoons butter
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 cups half-and-half
1 1/2 cups lobster stock
3 cups cooked lobster meat, shredded
3 tablespoons tomato paste
3 tablespoons minced onion
3 tablespoons minced celery
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1 cup cream

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir flour, sea salt, celery salt, and black pepper into the butter. Gradually stir half-and-half into the mixture, taking care that no lumps form. Add lobster stock; stir. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring constantly, until the soup begins to thicken, about 15 minutes.
Stir lobster, tomato paste, onion, and celery into the soup; season with paprika, thyme, and seafood seasoning. Continue cooking the soup to heat the onion and celery, about 10 minutes. Add cream; stir. Cook until hot, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Adjust the spices to suit your individual likes. You may also substitute cream for part of the half-and-half. Chicken stock will work if you can't get lobster stock.
