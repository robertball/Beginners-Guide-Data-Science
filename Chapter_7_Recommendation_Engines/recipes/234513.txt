Ingredients:
Dry Rub:
1 tablespoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons Mexican oregano
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 pounds flap steak, trimmed of fat
Sauce:
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
2 chipotle peppers, diced
3 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons chipotle mustard
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 limes, halved
4 flour tortillas
1/2 red onion
1/4 cup crumbled queso fresco cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Stir garlic powder, chili powder, Mexican oregano, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl. Sprinkle garlic powder mixture over both sides of flap steak, pat rub into meat, wrap steak in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.
Whisk honey, lime juice, cilantro, chipotle peppers, garlic, vegetable oil, apple cider vinegar, chipotle mustard, cumin, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours. Separate mixture equally into two bowls; one for basting and one for serving.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cook steak on the preheated grill until smoke rises from the spice rub. Turn the meat and squeeze the juice from 2 lime halves over the steak. When the spice rub begins to smoke, turn the meat again. Brush the refrigerated honey-lime basting sauce onto both sides of the steak and cook steak to your desired degree of doneness, 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Let meat rest for 5 minutes and chop against the grain into bite-size pieces.
Spoon grilled meat into tortillas. Top with onion, lime juice, reserved honey-lime serving sauce, and queso fresco cheese.

Description: 
Flap meat, also called 'ranchera' or 'carne asada' meat, is a cheap and flavorful cut that is a staple in Mexican cooking. If you can't find flap meat then you can substitute a pounded-out flank steak.
