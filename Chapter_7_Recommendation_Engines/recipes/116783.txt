Ingredients:
2 (4 ounce) veal cutlets
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter, divided
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 pound fresh mushrooms, thinly sliced
1/3 cup chicken broth
2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley

Directions:
Flatten cutlets to 1/8-in. thickness. In a resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, salt and pepper. Add veal; seal bag and shake to coat evenly. In a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons butter and oil. Add veal; cook over medium heat for about 1 minute on each side or until juices run clear. Remove and keep warm.
Add mushrooms to skillet; cook and stir for 2-3 minutes or until tender. Spoon over veal. Stir broth into skillet, stirring up any browned bits. Add parsley and remaining butter; cook and stir 2 minutes longer or until slightly thickened. Pour over veal and mushrooms.

Description: 
I found the original version of this dish in a magazine and adjusted it to suit our family's tastes. Delicate fine-textured veal requires only a short cooking time, something that makes this simple entree even more attractive.
