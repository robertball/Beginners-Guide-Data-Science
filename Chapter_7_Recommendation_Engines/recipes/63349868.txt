Ingredients:
Cake:
3 C all-purpose flour
2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
1 C coconut oil
1/4 C canola oil
2 C sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
3 large eggs
1 1/2 lbs apples (3 large), peeled and diced into 1/2 inch pieces.  (Pie apples work great with this!)
Sugar cinnamon:
1 Tbsp sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
Glaze:
1 C powdered sugar
5 tsp or so milk
1/4 tsp vanilla extract.

Directions:
Heat oven to 350F.  Spray a 10-inch tube pan with non-stick spray (or grease and flour).
In a bowl, whisk together the flour, 2 tsp cinnamon, baking soda, and salt; set aside.
In an electric mixer, cream together the coconut oil, canola oil, sugar, and vanilla.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Gradually beat in the flour mixture.  Fold in the apples by hand.
Spoon the batter into the prepared pan. Combine the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  Sprinkle over the cake batter.
Bake in prepared oven an hour and 10 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Allow to cool in the pan on a rack for at least 15 minutes, then turn out on the rack and cool completely.
Move the cake to serving dish.  Mix together the powdered sugar with enough milk to make it a thick drizzling consistency and stir in the vanilla.  Drizzle over cooled cake.

Description: 
Got the original recipe from a magazine, but subbed in coconut oil for the butter and changed the glaze a bit.  Not only is it a healthy fat, but it bakes up nicer.  This is super-yummy!
