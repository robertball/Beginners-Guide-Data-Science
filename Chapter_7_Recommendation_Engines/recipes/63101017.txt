Ingredients:
1-1/4 cups sugar
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup Bisquick
1/3 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon good quality vanilla
3 eggs

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease a pie plate. Mix all ingredients in a blender or whisk together in a bowl. Pour into pie plate. Bake until center is set approximately 30 minutes.
This pie sets almost like custard. It is great served warm, but we love it cold from the refrigerator too. A favorite breakfast item in our house.

Description: 
Early in my marriage I saw an ad on the back of the Bisquick box for a Bisquick cookbook. So I hastily sent off for it thinking that I could use some new recipes and feeling confident that Bisquick was a pretty well respected recipe source â€“ it had worked for me so far in my cooking. I found this recipe in that cookbook and have been making it ever since. It is the one pie that no matter where I take it or who I serve it to, I get compliments every single time. Something that was much appreciated in my early stages of cooking.
