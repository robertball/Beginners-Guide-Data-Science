Description: 
These creamy lemon cheesecake bars have a smoother texture than the usual custard texture of a boxed lemon bar mix. I just about died when I had them the first time. A good friend made them for another friend's birthday. I immediately asked her for the recipe as my Christmas present. She courteously obliged. They are the best!
