Description: 
This was a recipe that a Dear Aunt used to make us all the time. We ate it as a main dish with garlic bread, but I think it would make a great side as well. This pasta tends to be a little on the drier side, which is how we like it. Feel free to double the sauce or reduce the amount of pasta used to suite your taste. Enjoy!
