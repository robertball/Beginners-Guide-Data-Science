Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound extra-lean (94%) ground beef
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 (10.75 ounce) can fat-free condensed cream of mushroom soup (such as Campbell'sÂ®)
1/2 cup fat-free sour cream
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
4 cups cooked egg noodles

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Spray a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and set over medium-high heat. Add ground beef. Cook, breaking up, until browned, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Stir mushrooms, onion, and garlic into the skillet. Cook and stir until onion is tender, about 2 minutes. Add wine; reduce heat to low and simmer for 3 minutes. Add cream of mushroom soup, sour cream, and mustard.
Put cooked noodles in a large bowl and pour beef mixture over; toss to coat. Pour into the prepared baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 25 minutes.
