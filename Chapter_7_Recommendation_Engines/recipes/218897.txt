Ingredients:
1 potato
3 zucchini, shredded
1 egg, beaten
1/2 sweet onion, finely chopped
10 fresh mint leaves, finely chopped
1 (8 ounce) package feta cheese, crumbled
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup olive oil, or as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil, and place the potato into the water. Boil until tender, about 20 minutes; remove and let cool. When cool enough to handle, finely dice.
In a bowl, mix together the cooked potato, zucchini, egg, onion, mint leaves, feta cheese, and bread crumbs to make a mixture that holds together when pressed lightly.
Place flour into a separate shallow dish. Form the zucchini mixture into small patties, and dredge patties in flour on both sides.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry the zucchini patties until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain the patties on paper towels; serve hot.
