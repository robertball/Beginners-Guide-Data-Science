Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup sour cream
1 cup crushed buttery round crackers (such as RitzÂ®)
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 cup milk
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix ground beef, onion, bell pepper, 1 cup Cheddar cheese, Worcestershire sauce, sour cream, and crackers together in a bowl. Place mixture on a baking dish and shape into a loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 35 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Heat the cream of mushroom soup, milk, and 1 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese in a saucepan over medium heat until the cheese has melted, about 10 minutes. Pour sauce over the meatloaf before serving.
