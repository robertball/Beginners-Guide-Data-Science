Ingredients:
2 pounds thick-cut bacon, divided
3 tablespoons barbeque seasoning, divided, or to taste
2 pounds bulk Italian sausage
1 cup finely shredded Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese blend
1/4 cup diced fresh jalapeno pepper (optional)
2 green onions, thinly sliced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (12 ounce) bottle barbeque sauce, divided
wood chips, soaked

Directions:
Stack and weave 1 1/2 pounds bacon slices into a 12-inch square lattice. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon barbeque seasoning.
Place the remaining bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crispy, about 10 minutes. Chop the cooled bacon slices into chunks.
Place sausage in a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag most of the way; flatten and shape the sausage into a large square. Cut away the plastic bag and discard; place the sausage square on the bacon lattice.
Sprinkle bacon pieces over the sausage square. Sprinkle Cheddar Jack cheese, jalapenos, green onions, and garlic on top. Drizzle with 1/2 the barbeque sauce and sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons barbeque seasoning on top.
Roll the sausage square into a log. Wrap the bacon lattice over the sausage log and roll tightly.
Place the roll, seam side-down, onto wire racks. Place the racks into the smoker. Add wood chips according to manufacturer's directions. Smoke until no longer pink in the center, about 2 hours, basting the roll with the remaining barbeque sauce during the last 20 to 30 minutes of cooking. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
Remove bacon bomb from the smoker; let rest for 30 minutes before slicing.
