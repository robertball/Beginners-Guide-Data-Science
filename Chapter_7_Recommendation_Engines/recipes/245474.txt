Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds oxtail
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon garlic and herb seasoning (such as Spike®)
1 teaspoon browning sauce (such as Grace®)
1/4 teaspoon ground paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 carrots, thinly sliced
2 stalks celery, thinly sliced
1 onion, chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced
3 cups low-sodium beef broth
1 bunch fresh thyme
1 sprig fresh rosemary
1 bay leaf
2 tablespoons unsalted butter

Directions:
Place oxtail in a shallow dish. Combine Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, salt, sugar, garlic and herb seasoning, browning sauce, paprika, cayenne pepper, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Rub both sides of oxtail with marinade; pour out excess.
Heat vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Sear oxtail in hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to a small plate.
Saute carrots, celery, onion, and garlic in the same skillet until softened, about 5 minutes. Add beef broth, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Add oxtail, with its juices, and butter. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until oxtail is fork tender, about 3 hours.
Uncover skillet and increase heat to high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce reduces and thickens, about 5 minutes.
