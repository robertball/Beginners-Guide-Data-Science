Ingredients:
For Creme:
3 tins of sweetened condensed milk
3 tins of evaporated milk
10 eggs
10 egg yolks
2 teaspoons of vanilla extract
For Caramel:
2 cups of white sugar
1 cup of water

Directions:
Pre-heat oven at 325F.
Mix sugar and water and boil until it turns into a golden caramel. Cover a round baking or bundt pan with it.
Mix eggs and egg yolks. Don't beat the mix as you don't want to out any air into it. Add vanilla and evaporated and condensed milks. Pour into caramel covered pan. Cover with tin foil.
Place in oven in a water bath. Bake for 2 1/2 hours or until you stick it with a thin knife and it comes out clean. Let cool down and refrigerate at least overnight. Carefully separate from the pan with a thin knife. Flip over a deep round tray.
If caramel remains adhered to the pan, add 1/4 cup of hot water and place it over high heat. Caramel will melt and mix with the water, making some more caramel sauce to serve creme caramel with.

Ideal for impressing your guests serving it as dessert after a scrumptuous dinner. It's just sweet enough to saciate your craving with a cup of coffee in a cold afternoon, or chilled in a warm summer day or even after a large meal. My all time favorite!
