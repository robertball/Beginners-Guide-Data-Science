Ingredients:
1 red pepper, roasted, skinned & seeded
1 1/2 cups roasted cashews (haven’t tried raw ones)
1/2 cup water
2/3 cup nutritional yeast flakes
1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup “nacho slices” (canned jalapenos)
2 tablespoons of the jalapeno liquid
2 tablespoons tahini
1 tablespoon tamari
salt to taste, if necessary

Directions:
Basically, just whirl all the ingredients in a blender until really creamy. If you want to, you can add everything except for the jalapeno slices, get it all gooey, then just pulse the jalapenos, leaving some little chunks.
