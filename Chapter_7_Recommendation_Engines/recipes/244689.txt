Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
8 ounces bacon, cut into small pieces
1 onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, sliced
1 (750 milliliter) bottle Riesling wine
3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
10 ounces shiitake mushrooms
1 bay leaf
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles
1/4 cup butter, or to taste
2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir bacon until crispy, about 10 minutes. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes.
Mix wine, chicken, mushrooms, and bay leaf together in a large pot over medium-high heat.
Transfer bacon mixture to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. Once mixture is drained, transfer to to chicken mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and sauce is slightly thickened, 30 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl; add butter and mix until coated.
Stir cream into chicken mixture until evenly combined. Serve chicken mixture over buttered egg noodles.
