Ingredients:
Head of cauliflower
1 Tablespoon Light Butter (I prefer to use I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter)
1 Tablespoon Light Sour Cream
2 Cloves Garlic
Salt & pepper to taste
1 Tablespoon Parmesan Cheese

Directions:
Clean cauliflower and cut the center bottom to remove the stem and leaf parts.
Dice cauliflower into chunks and put into a large pot. Fill pot with water to cover the cauliflower.
Top with fresh cracked salt and pepper.
Cover pot with lid and boil cauliflower for about 25 minutes until tender.
Drain in a colander.
Add cauliflower, light butter, light sour cream, garlic, salt and pepper to a food processor.
Mix until all ingredients are combined and cauliflower is a creamy texture.
Top with Parmesan cheese.
