Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1/2 white medium onion diced
3-6 mini bell peppers chopped (red, yellow, orange)
3 cans Rotel diced tomatoes with green chili's
3 cans bushes chili beans (mild or medium)
1-2 cans of water (depending on your preference)
4 tbs cumin
2 tbs ancho chili powder
1 tbs crushed garlic (from a jar) or appx. 3 fresh garlic cloves
2 72% chiradelli chocolate squares
1 tbs sugar
1 tbs Mexican oragano
1 tsp curry powder
salt & pepper to taste
flour

Directions:
Brown Hamburger on medium for a few minutes
Add Onion & bell peppers, continue to saute' until  the onion is clear and the meat is browned.
Mix cumin, chili powder, garlic, mexican oragano, curry powder and salt & pepper.  Saute' until spices are covering the meat.
Add chili beans, use a little water to swish out the remaining sauce and beans from the cans.  Add Rotel tomatoes & water until your desired consistency is met.
Stir.  Then add Chocolate and Sugar.  Let the chili boil on medium high heat stirring constantly for a few minutes.
Reduce heat and let simmer stirring occasionally for at least 30 minutes.  The longer you have to let the chili simmer the more flavorful it will be!
NOTE: If your chili is not as thick as you like, simply  add a few tablespoons of flour to a 8 oz glass, put enough water in to cover the flour and make a paste, stir with a fork and slowly pour the mix into the chili.  It will take about 30 min to see if the thickener is to your liking.
