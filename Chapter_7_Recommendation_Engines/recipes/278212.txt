Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1 tablespoon honey
16 ounces kale, stems removed and discarded, leaves torn into bite-sized pieces
1 red onion, chopped
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon minced garlic
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
5 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
1/2 cup toasted walnuts, chopped

Directions:
Combine water and cranberries in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until cranberries are soft and liquid is syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in honey, remove from the heat, and allow to cool.
Put kale and red onion in an 8-quart pot or a very large bowl.
Whisk olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl; pour over the kale and stir well. Add feta cheese, walnuts, and moist cranberries with their syrup; stir until well combined. Cover and place in the refrigerator to marinate, stirring occasionally, until kale has wilted and shrunken in size, 3 to 8 hours.
To serve, transfer to a smaller serving bowl.

Description: 
I originally combined several recipes for kale salad and made several versions over the last 5 years. Despite numerous requests, I did not write it down until last year and have since perfected it. Whenever I take it to a potluck, I always take an empty bowl home.
