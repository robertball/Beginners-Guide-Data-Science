Ingredients:
2 cups frozen unsweetened pitted dark sweet cherries 1/2 cup plus 1 tbsp. granulated white sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup yellow cornmeal
1 tbsp. baking powder
1/4 tsp. salt
One 14.75-oz. can cream-style corn
3/4 cup fat-free liquid egg substitute
2/3 cup fat-free plain Greek yogurt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with foil baking cups, or spray it with nonstick spray.
Microwave cherries in a microwave-safe bowl for 1 - 2 minutes, until completely thawed. Do not drain.
Transfer cherries and excess liquid to a blender or large food processor. Add 1 tbsp. sugar. Pulse briefly, just until cherries reach a roughly chopped consistency.
In a large bowl, mix flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and remaining 1/2 cup sugar.
In a medium bowl, thoroughly mix cream-style corn, egg substitute, and yogurt. Transfer contents to the large bowl and stir well.
Add cherry mixture to the large bowl and stir. Evenly distribute batter among the muffin cups -- cups will be FULL to the brims.
Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 - 30 minutes. Enjoy!
