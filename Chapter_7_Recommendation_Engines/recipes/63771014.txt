Description: 
This is a simple rub that combines three heats to hit the tongue in perfect proportion. By putting black pepper with cayenne (and chili powder in this case) you get a double dose of heat. I suggest that you pick a mild chili powder for this rub so that it doesn't overpower the flavor of the brisket
