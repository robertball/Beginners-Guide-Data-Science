Ingredients:
1lb. Of ground beef or ground turkey meat
1/2 cup chopped onions
1teaspoon ground pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder (optional)
1-2 teaspoons of sugar or sugar substitute
Squirt of prepared yellow mustard
1 1/2 cups of tomato sauce (or chunk less spaghetti sauce)
2 cups of water
8 oz. Uncooked macaroni pasta
2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese (or substitute if want to be it lactose free)
1/8 to 1/4 cup of milk (or lactose free alternative)

Directions:
Using non stick spray, cook onions until tender.
Add ground beef or turkey and cook until brown.
Add pepper, onion powder, sugar and mustard and mix together well.
Add tomato sauce, water and uncooked pasta and bring to boil.  Lower heat, cover and simmer for about 15 minutes.  Stir occasionally to prevent sticking to bottom of pan or pot.
Remove from heat and stir in shredded cheese and milk.  If you like it creamy add more milk.  Serve immediately.  Sauce will thicken as it cools.

Description: 
All cooked in one pot and just like the boxed meals, but minus the trans fats!  Can be made Gluten free too, just substitute the regular pasta for GF macaroni noodles.  If you want Lactose Free, use Veggie, Soin cheese in place of the regular shredded cheese AND a lactose free milk in place of regular milk. Being lactose intolerant, I have substituted the ingrediants always.  I have even used ground turkey in place of ground beef and spaghetti sauce when i am out of tomato sauce.
