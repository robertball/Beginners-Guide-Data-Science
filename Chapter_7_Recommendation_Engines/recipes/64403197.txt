Ingredients:
1 ½ cups fresh raspberries
¼ cup chocolate chips (64 chips -2 servings)
8 tbsp. (1 stick) unsalted butter, chilled whole?
½ cup whole milk?
½ cup Greek yogurt
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour (white winter wheat) plus more for dusting the work surface
1/2 cup natural rice protein powder?
2 tsp. baking powder?
¼ tsp. baking soda?
½ tsp. salt?
lemon zest? From 1 lemon
1 tbsp. unsalted butter, melted

Directions:
Adjust an oven rack to middle position and preheat to 425° F.  Grate the chilled butter on the holes of a large box grater, put grated butting in a bowl and place in the freezer. Stuff raspberries with chocolate chips and place in the freezer until needed.
Whisk together the milk and sour cream in a medium bowl; refrigerate until needed.  Combine the flour, protein powder, baking powder, baking soda, salt and lemon zest in a medium-mixing bowl.  Whisk to combine.  Add the grated butter to the flour mixture and toss with fingers until thoroughly coated.
Add the milk mixture to the dry ingredients and fold with a spatula just until combined.  Transfer the dough to a generously floured work surface.  Dust the top of the dough with flour, and with well-floured hands, push the dough together into a ragged ball.  Add small amounts of flour as needed to prevent sticking. (I do not use extra flour- there are so many flour bits that I didn’t feel extra flour was necessary)
