Ingredients:
6 chicken thighs
1 pack of Mary Hill Dumplings
1/4 stick of butter

Directions:
Place salted and peppered chicken thighs in a large pot of boiling water. Add 1/4 stick of butter. Allow chicken to cook for about an hour or until it almost falls off the bone. Remove all the chicken from the broth. Bring the broth to a boil. You'll need about 6 cups of broth for one package of Mary Hill Dumplings. Begin dropping dumplings in one at a time. I third them before dropping them in. You can microwave the dumplings for 20 seconds to remove them more easily from the paper. After the last dumpling is added, stir very gently. Turn the heat to lowest setting, cover, and cook for 30 to 35 minutes or until dumplings are tender. Be sure to stir occassionally - GENTLY - as they will fall apart. Debone the chicken. Add chicken back to the dumplings after they are tender.

Description: 
You may want to make your dumplings from scratch and freeze them overnight, but I would suggest you use Mary Hill Dumplings. They are jus as good as homemade if not better.
