Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 pound ground beef
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 1/2 tomatoes, chopped
1/3 onion, chopped
1/4 bell pepper, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 tomatoes, quartered
2/3 onion, chunked
1/4 bell pepper
1/3 cup water, or as needed
1 tablespoon vinegar
3 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons dried basil
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons dried parsley
2 teaspoons dried cilantro

1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon hot sauce (such as TabascoÂ® Chipotle Pepper Sauce)
1 teaspoon brown sugar
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add ground beef and cumin; cook and stir until meat is browned lightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in chopped tomatoes, chopped onions, diced bell pepper, and minced garlic; cook and stir until meat is browned and vegetables are soft, 5 to 7 minutes.
Combine quartered tomatoes, chunked onion, bell pepper, water, vinegar, garlic cloves, Worcestershire sauce, basil, oregano, parsley, cilantro, paprika, soy sauce, hot sauce, brown sugar, and salt in a blender; blend sauce to desired thickness. Add more water if a thinner sauce is desired.
Pour sauce onto ground beef; cover and cook until the sauce reaches desired consistency, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
I started making fresh spaghetti sauce when my wife was sick with cancer and the Venezuelan doctor put her on a diet which included no canned goods. I have since doctored it up until I have gotten it to this point. Serve over spaghetti and add Parmesan cheese, if desired.
