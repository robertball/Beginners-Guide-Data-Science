Ingredients:
1 cup water
2/3 cup bourbon whiskey
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons lemon juice
4 (6 ounce) beef rib-eye steaks

Directions:
Whisk together the water, bourbon whiskey, soy sauce, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and lemon juice in a bowl, and pour into a plastic zipper bag. Add the rib-eye steaks, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Remove the rib-eye steaks from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Grill the steaks on high, 1 to 2 minutes per side, to sear the meat. Move the steaks to a cooler part of the grill and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes per side, if desired.

Description: 
After eating this style of steak in a restaurant a few times, I worked on making my own marinade. The results are tender and do not have an overbearing bourbon taste. This marinade is very different from the only other one I have seen on this site.
