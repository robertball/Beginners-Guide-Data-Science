Ingredients:
1 pound shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup butter, softened
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups crisp rice cereal
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 dashes Worcestershire sauce
1 pinch garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine cheese, butter or margarine, flour, crispy rice cereal, salt, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. Mix well and form small balls out of the dough (the dough will yield approximately 55 balls). Flatten each ball of dough with your fingertips until the dough is very thin and arrange the discs on a cookie sheet.
Bake for 12 minutes; or until the Cheese Crispies are golden and slightly brown around the edges. Enjoy!
