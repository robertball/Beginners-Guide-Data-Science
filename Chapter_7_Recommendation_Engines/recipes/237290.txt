1 tablespoon avocado oil
2 pounds beef sirloin tip roast
1 (28 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, drained

2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar

Heat avocado oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook beef roast in the hot oil until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer roast to a slow cooker. Pour tomatoes and beef broth over roast; add onions and bell peppers.
Mix tomato paste, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, cumin, and salt together in a bowl; pour over onions and bell peppers.
