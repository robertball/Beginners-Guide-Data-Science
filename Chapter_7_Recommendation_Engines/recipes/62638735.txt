Ingredients:
3 (1/4 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
3/4 cup warm water (105 115)
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup warm water (105-115)
2 tablespoons olive oil
vegetable oil cooking spray
1 tablespoon Italian spices (optional)

Directions:
In a 2 c measuring cup or sm bowl, combine yeast, sugar and 3/4 c warm water; let stand 5 minutes.
Combine yeast mixture, flour, salt, water, and oil in lg bowl, stirring til well blended.
Turn out dough onto floured surface; knead 5 minutes.
Place in bowl coated w/ cooking spray, turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 30 mins or til dough is doubled in bulk.
Punch dough down; knead 4 – 5 times.
Divide dough into 6 equal portions; roll each into 8” circle.
Cook each round on each side in a non-stick 8” skillet coated w/ cooking spray over med heat about 2 mins per side or til dough rounds are lightly browned.
Cool crusts and freeze in an air-tight container up to 6 months.
TO MAKE PIZZA: Place frozen crusts on baking sheets; spread w/ 1/4 c pasta sauce and sprinkle w/ favorite toppings.
Bake at 425 for 12 – 15 minutes or til edges are lightly browned and cheese melts.
FOR EXTRA FLAVOR: I like to add Italian seasoning/spices to the crust for extra flavor.
