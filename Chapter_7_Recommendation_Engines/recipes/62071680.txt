Ingredients:
- 8 large Romaine leaves
- 1/3 cup diced ham
- 1/3 cup diced fresh mozzarella or feta cheese
- 1/4 cup diced green onion
- 1/4 cup diced tomato
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bring large pot of water to boil and blanch Romaine leaves for 30 seconds in boiling water.  Remove leaves from pot and plunge into bowl of cold water to stop cooking.  Dry leaves with paper towel and lay flat.  Press on center vein at base of leaf with the heel of your hand to flatten it and make it easier to roll.
Mound ham, cheese, green onion, tomato and garlic (evenly split between the 8 leaves) in the large part of the Romaine leaf and sprinkle with Italian seasoning.  Fold sides of leaf over the filling and roll leaf tightly.  Secure roll with a toothpick.  Place rolls in glass baking dish and bake for 10 minutes.  Enjoy!
