Ingredients:
1 lb. hamburger
1/2 cup onion, chopped
1/4 cup green chilis, diced
1 (8 oz.) can tomato sauce
2 tsp. garlic juice
salt, to taste
1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese, grated
1 can of 8 refrigerator biscuits
1 egg, beat lightly
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven at 375 degrees.
Brown beef, onion and chilies in large frying pan.  Drain fat and stir in tomato sauce, garlic juice and salt.  Simmer while preparing dough.  Separate biscuits to make 2 layers.  Press one layer (4) into an ungreased baking pan, 8x8 or 9x9 square pan.
Combine cheese (save some for topping), sour cream and egg.  Mix well and add to meat.  Pour meat mixture on biscuits in pan.
Now press your other 4 biscuits to form a top layer.  Sprinkle with remaining cheese.  Bake for 25 minutes.
You can also add 2 tsp. chili powder.  You can also add 1 1/2 cups jack cheese if you don't want cheddar or you can mix both.
