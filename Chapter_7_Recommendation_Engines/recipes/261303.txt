Ingredients:
Roast:
1 (5 pound) standing beef rib roast, trimmed of fat
2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds, crushed
2 pounds new potatoes, halved
1 onion, cut into thin wedges
Dipping Sauce:
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
3 tablespoons horseradish
1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives

Directions:
Let beef stand at room temperature 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir together 2 teaspoons salt, garlic powder, pepper, thyme, and fennel seeds in a small bowl. Put beef, rib side down, on a rack set in a roasting pan. Rub beef with spice mixture.
Place pan in preheated oven. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers at least 135 degrees F for medium-rare, 1 3/4 to 2 1/4 hours, or 150 degrees F for medium, 2 1/4 to 2 3/4 hours. Transfer beef to a cutting board; let stand, covered with foil, about 15 minutes (do not drain pan).
Meanwhile, boil potatoes and onion in a pot of salted water 10 minutes. Drain, then sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Remove rack from roasting pan, add vegetables, and toss to coat with drippings. Return pan to oven and roast until vegetables are browned and tender, 30 to 40 minutes.
