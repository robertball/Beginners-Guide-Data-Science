Ingredients:
1/2 C Olive Oil
1/2 C Canola Oil
1 Tbls Lemon Juice
1 Tbls Orange Juice
2 Tbls Hot Pepper Sauce
1 Tbls Dried Parsley
1 Tsp Oregano
1 Tsp Salt
1 Tsp Black Pepper
4 cloves of garlic, minced
1 Tbls Tomato Paste
2 Lbs large Shrimp, peeled and deveined
Skewers

Directions:
In a large plastic bag mix together all ingredients except the shrimp and smoosh it around until well blended.  Reserve a few tbls for basting later.  Add the shrimp and let marinade in the refridgerator for 2 hrs or overnight. The longer you marinade the better the flavor.
Preheat grill to medium low heat. Thread shrimp onto skewer and discard marinade.
Lightly oil grill grate.  Cook shrimp for 5 minutes per side or until opaque, basting frequently with reserved marinade.

Description: 
This is my take on the Grilled Marinated Shrimp from Robbie Rice.  The orange juice makes a big difference as it adds a little sweetness and cuts the lemon taste and the Olive oil is too heavy on it's own.  I get requests for this recipe often enough that it was time to enter it.
