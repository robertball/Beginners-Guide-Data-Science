Ingredients:
1 lb. filo thawed completely
1/2 pound butter
1 pound IMPORTED feta
1/4 tsp. salt
3 eggs beaten
1 tsp. chopped dill

Directions:
Thaw filo completely. If you don't it will crack and crumble as you handle it.
Crumble cheese into a bowl using fork to break it up. Add salt and beaten eggs and mix in. Add dill.  Butter sheet of filo. Cut sheet lengthwise into 3 strips. While you are working with this sheet, fold remaining filo in its own wax paper and cover with a damp dish towel or saran wrap to keep from drying out.
Drop a teaspoon full of mixture onto corner of strip and fold over to make a triangle. Now continue to fold the triangle over and over until you reach the end. Fold any little strip that might left inside. Butter both sides and put in a plastic box lined with wax paper to freeze. Between each layer of triangles, put a sheet of wax paper.
Top with a final sheet of wax paper and put into freezer.
When you want to serve them, heat over to 350 degrees and bake until the corners are starting to brown and they are becoming golden. If they are completely frozen, they will take about 20 minutes I think but if they haven't been frozen they will take about 10 minutes to reach this stage. Good luck!
