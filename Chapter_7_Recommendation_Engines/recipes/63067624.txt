Ingredients:
One pound or more of well-cleaned, fresh-harvested wild chanterelle mushrooms
3 tablespoons olive oil, 1 pad butter
2 cloves crushed garlic
kosher or sea salt & fresh ground pepper to taste
1/2 cup port, sherry or other sweet red wine

Directions:
The chanterelle is a mushroom of distinctive appearance, abundant in Northwest forests in the fall. (Be sure you know what you are harvesting!) Clean well 8-10 medium-to-large-sized shrooms. (Clean by brushing away debris ... do not rinse.) Quarter down the stem or slice in generous portions.
Heat in a cast iron skillet or nonstick pan (medium heat) 3 tablespoons olive oil to sizzling (not yet smoking). Stir in garlic then quickly toss in chanterelles and butter. Fresh chanterelles will quickly produce liquid.
Cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until most of the liquid evaporates off (about 10 minutes). Add salt & pepper to taste, increase heat, then carefully pour in wine and reduce while stirring (about 2 minutes).
Remove from heat and serve steaming. Perfect with flatiron steak or other favorite red meat. Chanterelles have a sweet, peach-like flavor that is enhanced by red wine and a wonderful complement to red meat.
