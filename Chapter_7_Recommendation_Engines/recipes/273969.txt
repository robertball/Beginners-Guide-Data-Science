Ingredients:
1  lime, juiced
2 tablespoons olive oil
½ teaspoon chili powder
½ teaspoon cumin
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts
4 cups torn romaine lettuce
2 cups mixed baby greens
2 cups corn kernels
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
½ cup canned black beans, rinsed
½  cucumber, diced
½ cup ranch dressing
¾ cup chunky salsa
1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro
1 cup crushed taco chips

Directions:
Mix lime juice, olive oil, chili powder, cumin, salt, and black pepper together in a resealable plastic bag along with the chicken breasts. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cook chicken on the preheated grill until juices no longer run pink, about 5 minutes per side. Allow to cool for about 5 minutes; roughly chop and refrigerate.
Toss romaine lettuce, baby greens, corn, Cheddar cheese, black beans, and cucumber together in a large bowl. Set aside.
Mix ranch dressing, salsa, and cilantro together in a small bowl. Pour dressing over salad and toss gently. Sprinkle salad with crushed taco chips and diced chicken and serve immediately.

Description: 
I came up with this delicious meal salad after I found I was all too often relying on prepackaged deli salads that were too expensive and not always the freshest. This is quick and easy, can be prepared ahead and scaled up or down depending on the servings needed.
