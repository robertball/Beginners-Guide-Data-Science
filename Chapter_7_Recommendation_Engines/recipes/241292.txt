Ingredients:
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (15 ounce) jar mild picante salsa
1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth

Directions:
Season chicken breasts all over with salt and black pepper.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken breasts in hot oil until browned, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Pour salsa and chicken broth over chicken, bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn chicken over, stir salsa mixture, and continue to simmer until chicken is tender and sauce is slightly thickened, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
This easy-to-make recipe is a great weeknight family dish I threw together, and we enjoyed it a lot. Delicious with rice. Can also be shredded and served with tortillas.
