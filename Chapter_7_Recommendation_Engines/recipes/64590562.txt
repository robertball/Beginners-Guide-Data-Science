Ingredients:
1 large spaghetti squash
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large zucchini
1 yellow onion
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 red bell pepper
2 cups green beans
1 14 ounce can diced tomatoes
Sea salt
Freshly ground pepper
2-3 teaspoons Italian Seasonings

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Poke about 10 holes in your spaghetti squash and bake for 25 minutes.  (you don't want it cooked all the way).
Cut the zucchini in half then half again and chop.  Cut the onions into slices along with the bell pepper and cut the green beans in half.  Heat your braising pan over medium-high heat.
Add oil in the pan and once hot add in zucchini and season with about 1 teaspoon of sea salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper.  Let cook for about 3-5 minutes.  Add in garlic, onion and pepper and let cook for 3 minutes.  Add in green beans and let cook for 2 minutes.
Add in sauce, Italian seasonings and let simmer for 5 minutes.  After the spaghetti squash cools enough to cut in half then remove seeds.  Take a fork and remove the thread into the pan.  Toss around.
Add in more salt and pepper to taste.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees then cover and bake for about 10 minutes.  Keep warm until ready to serve.

This was certainly the hit of the party!  I served this Paleo Pasta Primavera with my Paleo Pork Roast Loin and it disappeared right in front of me!
