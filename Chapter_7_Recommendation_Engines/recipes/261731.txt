Ingredients:
2 cups soy milk
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
2 cups cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup canola oil
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 cup frozen corn kernels

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a greased, 10-inch cast iron skillet in the preheating oven.
Mix soy milk and vinegar together in a bowl. Let stand until curdled, about 5 minutes.
Mix cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Pour oil and maple syrup into the soy milk mixture. Whisk with a fork until foamy, about 3 minutes. Pour over cornmeal mixture and mix until combined. Fold in corn kernels. Pour batter into the hot skillet.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes. Slice into squares or wedges.

Description: 
This is a basic cornbread that's great with vegan chili. It's nice for anyone who's vegan or if you just happen to be out of eggs. It tastes best when cooked in a cast iron skillet that's been preheated in the oven.
