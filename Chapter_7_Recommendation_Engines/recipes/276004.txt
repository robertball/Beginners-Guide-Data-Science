Ingredients:
2 pounds country-style pork ribs
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 shallot, finely chopped
1/3 cup chili sauce
1/3 cup apricot preserves
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1/8 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
Brush ribs with 2 tablespoons oil and season with salt and pepper. Arrange 1/2 of the ribs in a single layer in the air fryer basket.
Cook in the preheated air fryer until ribs are fork-tender and fully cooked, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer ribs to a baking pan and place in the preheated oven to keep warm while cooking the remaining ribs.
Meanwhile, heat 2 teaspoons oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add shallot; cook and stir until tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in chili sauce, apricot preserves, soy sauce, ginger, and chipotle pepper. Heat and stir until bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.
Transfer ribs to a serving platter. Brush generously with glaze and garnish with chives.
