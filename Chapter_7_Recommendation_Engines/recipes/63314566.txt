Ingredients:
4 eggs
1 3/4 cups milk
1/2 tsp of Cajun Seasoning
1 1/4 cups all-Purpose flour
1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese

Directions:
Place 12-muffin tin into cold oven.  Preheat to 425.
Blend eggs, milk, and seasoning in blender on HIGH for 30 seconds.  Add AP flour and blend for another 30 seconds.  Let sit until oven is hot.
Take hot pan out of oven and spray liberally with non-stick cooking spray.  Pour batter evenly into pan.  Divide the cheese evenly over each cup and return to oven.
Cook for 25 minutes.  Turn heat down to 350 and cook for another 15 to 20 minutes - or until popovers are dark brown and crusty.
Serve immediately.
