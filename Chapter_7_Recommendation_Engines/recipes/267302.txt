Ingredients:
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 clove garlic, minced

1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper
salt and pepper to taste
2 fresh peach, sliced into 8 pieces
1 tablespoon avocado oil
8 ounces fresh spinach
6 ounces fresh raspberries
1/4 cup sliced blanched almonds

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Combine olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, mustard, salt, and pepper in a small container with a lid. Cover and shake vigorously to combine dressing ingredients. Set aside.
Brush peach slices lightly with avocado oil. Place peaches, cut-side down, onto the grill; cook until grill marks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn each slice and cook until grill marks form, 1 to 2 minutes more. Remove from grill
Divide spinach between 4 salad plates. Top each salad with 4 grilled peach slices. Evenly distribute raspberries and top with some almonds. Drizzle each salad evenly with dressing.

Description: 
Right before your grilled entree comes off the grill, throw some peaches on for the salad. The caramelization adds a dimension of flavor and appearance to the peaches. Put them on a bed of fresh spinach, add raspberries and a good vinaigrette, and some almonds, too, for crunch.
