Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (16 ounce) package potato gnocchi
1 (15 ounce) can great Northern beans, rinsed and drained
1 pinch red pepper flakes
1 (6 ounce) package baby spinach leaves
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add onion and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes. Remove from heat.
Heat tomato sauce in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until bubbling, about 5 minutes; reduce to a simmer and keep warm.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain and transfer to the skillet with onion mixture; toss with warmed tomato sauce. Add beans and red pepper flakes; stir. Cook over medium heat for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in spinach, folding until just wilted, about 5 minutes.
Transfer gnocchi to individual serving bowls and top with Parmesan cheese.
