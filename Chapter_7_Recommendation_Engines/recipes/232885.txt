Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can pears in juice
1 (15 ounce) can peaches in juice
1 (15 ounce) can pitted cherries in water
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1/2 cup brown sugar, divided
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter, cut in small pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Pour pears, peaches, and cherries with their liquids into the prepared baking dish; stir. Stir oats and 1/4 cup brown sugar together in a bowl; sprinkle over the fruit mixture. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar over the oat layer. Sprinkle cinnamon over the brown sugar. Arrange butter pieces evenly over the top.
Bake until hot, bubbly, and slightly brown at edges, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Perfect for cold weather! An excellent brunch dish or side for waffles, pancakes, scones, or shortbread.  Also great served warm over vanilla ice cream! For best results, use canned fruits that do not have corn syrup or other sweeteners added. Add up to 1/2 cup more brown sugar for a sweeter dish. Virgin coconut oil can be used in place of the butter.
