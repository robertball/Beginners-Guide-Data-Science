Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first six ingredients.  Place half of the mixture at a time in a blender; cover and process until pureed.  Transfer to a large bowl; stir in cream and orange juice, if desired.  Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.
In a skillet over medium heat, saute bread cubes in butter until golden brown.  Remove from the heat.  Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon; toss to coat.  Cool.  Stir soup before serving; garnish with croutons.
