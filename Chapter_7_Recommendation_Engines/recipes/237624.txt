Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup crushed cornflakes
2 tablespoons butter, softened
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon honey
Frosting:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow fluff
Toppings:
1/2 cup sliced strawberries, or to taste
2 apricots, sliced, or to taste
2 kiwi, peeled and sliced, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix cornflakes, butter, corn syrup, and sugar in a bowl until evenly combined; press onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drizzle crust with honey and cool in refrigerator, about 15 minutes.
Stir cream cheese and marshmallow fluff together in a bowl until smooth and creamy; spread over cooled crust, keeping a 1/2-inch border of crust. Chill crust in refrigerator until completely cooled, about 15 minutes.
Arrange strawberries, apricots, and kiwi over the cream cheese layer.
