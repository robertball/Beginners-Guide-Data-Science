Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 3/4 cups milk
1 1/4 cups beef stock
1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
Combine cornstarch, salt, parsley, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small bowl.
Pour cornstarch mixture, milk, beef stock, and egg noodles into the skillet of beef. Bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in sour cream and Parmesan cheese; do not return to a boil.

Description: 
My family loved the boxed version of this ground beef stroganoff, but we have done away with processed foods. I created this out of necessity, and they don't miss the box at all! It's creamy and delicious!
