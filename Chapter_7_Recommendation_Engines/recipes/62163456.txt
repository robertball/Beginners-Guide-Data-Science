Ingredients:
4 bulbs of Kohlrabi
1 Tablespoon olive oil
1 clove Garlic, minced or crushed
salt and pepper to taste
1/3 cup finely grated parmesean cheese

Directions:
preheat oven to 450 degrees
Slice off the thicker green coating of the kohlrabi bulb, and then slice off the tough bottom...next slice kohlrabi into 1/4 inch thick slices and cut each of those slices in half.
mix olive oil and garlic in a mixing bowl, add salt and pepper to taste (I use about 1/8 tsp each)
toss the kohlrabi slices in the olive oil mixture, then spread evenly in a large shallow baking dish (so it's just in one layer, not overlapping slices) I use a stoneware pan that's about 10 X 15 inches.
bake this for 15-20 minutes...stirring the slices around so they brown evenly.
stir again and then sprinkle the Parmesan on top.  Return to oven until the cheese has started to get crisp (about another 5 minutes or so)
serve immediately

Kohlrabi is a root vegetable that reminds me of a potato crossed with an artichoke heart.
