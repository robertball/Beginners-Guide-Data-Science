Description: 
For perfectly prepared pork chops (preferably bone-in) you must brine them for at least 1 to 2 hours and pick chops that are at least 1/2 to 1-inch thick. The success to this dish is the brine for moistness. There are many brine variations out there for what flavor you are wanting to accomplish but, it is an important part of the overall dish.
