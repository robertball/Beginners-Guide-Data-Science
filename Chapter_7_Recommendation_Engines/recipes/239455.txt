Ingredients:
Crumble Topping:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons wheat germ
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon canola oil
Muffin Batter:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup wheat germ
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs, beaten
2 (3.9 ounce) containers Mott'sÂ® Healthy Harvest Blueberry Delight Applesauce
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup blueberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees  F. Lightly oil or coat 12 muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. To make the topping, combine the flour, wheat germ, and brown sugar in a bowl. Add the oil and stir until the dry ingredients are well coated with the oil. Set aside.
Meanwhile, whisk together the flour, wheat germ, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl. Combine the eggs, applesauce, brown sugar, oil, and vanilla in a separate bowl and whisk until well blended.
Pour the liquid ingredients over the dry ingredients and stir until just moistened. Gently stir in the blueberries. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups. Arrange the topping evenly over the muffins, using the back of a spoon to gently press the topping into the batter.
Bake 20 to 22 minutes, or until the topping is golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
