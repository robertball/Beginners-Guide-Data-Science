Ingredients:
6 eggs, beaten
1 1/4 cups Italian-style dry bread crumbs
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons dried parsley
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a medium bowl combine eggs, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt and pepper.  Mixture should be moist and sticky, but should hold together when formed into balls.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
