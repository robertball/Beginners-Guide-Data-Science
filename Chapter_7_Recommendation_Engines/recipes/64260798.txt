Ingredients:
FOR MEATBALLS
1	slice day-old whole-grain bread
1/4	cup low-fat (1%) milk
1	medium onion, peeled and quartered
1	medium red bell pepper, seeded and quartered
2	cloves garlic
1	egg, lightly beaten
1	pound 93% lean ground turkey
2	tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley
1	tablespoon grainy Dijon mustard
3/4	teaspoon salt
1/2	teaspoon black pepper
Cooking spray
FOR DIP
1/4	cup light mayonnaise
1/3	cup nonfat Greek yogurt
4	teaspoons grainy Dijon mustard

Directions:
1 Tear bread into 2-inch pieces, and pulse in a blender or food processor until fine crumbs form. (You should have ¾ cup.) Soak bread crumbs in milk in a bowl until absorbed. Pulse onion, bell pepper, and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped; stir into bread crumbs. Add remaining meatball ingredients except cooking spray; stir until well mixed. Chill, covered, for 1 hour.
2 Preheat oven to 450°F. Coat a large rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. Shape mixture into 1-inch balls; arrange on prepared pan. Bake until firm and cooked through, about 15 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes.
Make dip:
3 While meatballs bake, stir together all dip ingredients in a small bowl. Serve with meatballs.

Description: 
For a break from beef, try these tender turkey meatballs. Don’t use extra-lean turkey breast; it dries out too easily.
