Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all purpose flour

Directions:
Put the butter in a large mixing bowl and microwave on defrost for 5 seconds to soften. Be careful not to melt it!
Add sugar and baking powder to the butter and mix until combined.
Beat in egg and vanilla extract.
Stir in the flour.
Divide dough into 4 equal portions. Roll each portion into a "snake shape" with your hands until about 12 inches long.
Place the rolls on an ungreased cookie sheet about 4 inches apart. With your fingers, gently flatten the rolls until they are about 3 inches wide.
Bake at 325 for 12-15 minutes or until nicely browned around the edges.
Cut the warm cookies into 1 inch strips and let cool.
Enjoy!

Description: 
These vanilla flavored sugar cookies are cut right on the cookie sheet while still warm. The outcome is a rectangular cookie, crunchy on the outside, slighty chewy on the inside, that is just right for dunking into milk or coffee!
