Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped green pepper
1 garlic clove, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 cup water
3/4 cup uncooked long grain rice
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cumin
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup picante sauce
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced ripe olives, drained

Directions:
In a large skillet, brown chicken in oil for 2-3 minutes on each side. Remove and keep warm. In the same skillet, saute the onion, green pepper and garlic until tender. Stir in the tomatoes, water, rice, bouillon and seasonings. Bring to a boil. Pour into a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish; top with chicken.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until rice is tender. Uncover; spoon picante sauce over chicken and sprinkle with cheese. Bake 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Garnish with olives.
