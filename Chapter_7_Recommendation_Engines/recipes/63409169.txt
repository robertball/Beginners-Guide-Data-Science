Ingredients:
8 cups peeled and cubed potatoes
2 cups peeled and chopped onions
4 cups chopped celery
2 teaspoons salt
4 cups half and half
6 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, optional garnish

Directions:
Place potatoes, onions, celery and salt in water to cover in a large pot. Simmer until tender, about 15 minutes.
Put in blender or food processor fitted with the metal blade and puree until chunky. (I just used a masher)
Return to soup pot; add half-and-half, butter and cheese. Stirring, simmer until piping hot. (Do not boil.)
Garnish with parsley if desired.
