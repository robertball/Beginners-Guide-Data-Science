Ingredients:
1 pound  flank steak
1/4 cups plus 1 teaspoon cooking oil
3/4 teaspoon chili powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup crushed pineapple, drained (from an 8-ounce can)
1/2 jalapeño pepper with seeds, chopped
1 small red onion, chopped
1 tablespoon lime juice
1/4 cup chopped cilantro or parsley
1/4 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper
1/2 pound penne

Directions:
1. Heat the broiler. Rub the flank steak with the 1 teaspoon oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the chili powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Broil the meat until medium rare, about 4 minutes per side. Let it rest for 5 minutes and then cut it diagonally into slices.
2. In a large glass or stainless-steel bowl, combine the pineapple, the remaining 1/4 cup oil, the jalapeño pepper, onion, lime juice, cilantro, black pepper, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon chili powder. Stir in the sliced steak.
3. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the penne until just done, about 13 minutes. Drain and toss with the salsa and steak.

Description: 
Unusually delicious, with tons of room for alteration depending on your preference!  The beef needs to be cooked either very slowly or quickly to remain tender.
