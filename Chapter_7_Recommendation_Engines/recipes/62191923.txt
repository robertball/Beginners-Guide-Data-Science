Ingredients:
3 cups white sugar
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 cup vegetable oil
2/3 cup water
4 eggs
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 1 large and 2 small loaf pans.
In a large bowl, combine sugar, pumpkin, oil, water, and eggs.  Beat until smooth.  Blend in flour, spices, baking soda, and salt.  Fold in chocolate chips and nuts. Fill cans to 3/4 full.
Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until an inserted knife comes out clean.  Small loaves will cook faster so watch them after 30 minutes.  Cool on wire racks before removing from cans or pans.
