Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup buttermilk
3 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed

Directions:
Cream together butter and sugar in a large bowl. Add eggs and beat until light and fluffy. Combine the nutmeg, salt, baking soda, and baking powder in a small bowl. Stir in the buttermilk and add this mixture to the creamed ingredients. Gradually stir in the flour one cup at a time. If dough is still too sticky to roll, gradually add more flour until you can form the dough into a ball. Cover and chill dough for at least an hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll dough out to 1/4 inch thickness on a lightly floured surface. Cut into shapes and place on ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake until no indentation remains when cookies are lightly touched, about 10 minutes. Cool cookies on rack.

Description: 
Grandma Abbey made these cookies for my MIL (her granddaughter) when she was a child in the 1930's.  They're my husband's favorite.  With a delicate nutmeg flavor, they stand up nicely to frosting.  Grandpa Boskat, my MIL's father, always preferred his with sugar sprinkled on top, but Grandma Boskat frosted the rest for her children.
