Ingredients:
French bread, sliced horizontally
OR
slices of firm bread(EX. sourdough)
olive oil
thin sliced mozzarella cheese
thin tomato slices
dried basil
dried oregano
fresh ground pepper
grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the broiler. Lightly toast whichever bread you choose, then brush the top of each piece with a little olive oil. Place the bread on a baking sheet.
Place a few slices of mozzarella cheese on the bread(you don't need much). Top with the tomato slices. Generously sprinkle basil, oregano, and pepper on the tomato slices. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese all over the tomato. Broil the sandwiches until the mozzarella is melted and bubbly and the Parmesan cheese is golden brown. Serve immediately.
