Ingredients:
1 leftover ham bone
2 cup leftover ham cut into 1/2 cubes
8 slices bacon cooked and diced
1 pound dried split peas
1 cup chopped carrots
1 cup chopped potatoes
1/2 small red onion, minced
1/2 cup leftover pineapple diced
1/2 cup frozen corn (Optional)
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 cloves garlic minced
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground clove
1 bay leave

Directions:
Place the ham bone in a large pot over high heat. Add water to cover (approx 12 cups), bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and let simmer for a few hours or until bone falls apart.
Allow to cool and clean the stock, discarding the bone, excess fat, and any cartilage. I refrigerate stock overnight to skim fat off top.
Return any good ham and any additional leftover ham to the pot and bring back to a boil.
Add the onion, garlic, brown sugar, ground clove, ground black pepper, bay leave and allow to simmer for 1 hour. Then pour in the split peas, potato, and carrots. Allow to simmer for at least 1 more hour to allow the peas to break down.
Add the pineapple, and serve each bowl with some bacon bits on top.

Description: 
My mother used to throw together leftovers from a ham meal to make a split pea soup. She made her own broth from the ham bone. A good winter soup that sticks to your ribs and is good with crushed saltines on top.
