Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground turkey
4 links Mexican chorizo sausage, casings removed
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon chipotle chile flakes
1 pinch ground black pepper
2 tablespoons buttery spread
4 slices pepperjack cheese
4 hamburger buns
1/4 cup mayonnaise, divided
2 cups spring mix lettuce, divided
1 lime, juiced

Directions:
Combine ground turkey, chorizo, garlic, onion powder, chipotle flakes, and black pepper in a large bowl; mix with your hands until well-blended. Shape into 4 loosely-packed patties.
Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat until hot; grease with buttery spread. Place patties on the griddle; cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue cooking for about 5 minutes. Flip patties and cook until browned on the second side, about 6 minutes.
Top each patty with a slice of pepperjack cheese. Cook until cheese is melted, about 1 minute more.
Toast hamburger buns in a toaster oven. Spread 1 1/2 teaspoon mayonnaise over each half. Place cooked patties over bottom buns. Top each patty with 1/2 cup spring mix lettuce. Sprinkle lime juice over lettuce. Cover with top buns.
