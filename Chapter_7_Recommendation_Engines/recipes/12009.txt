Ingredients:
4 ounces linguine pasta
2  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, sliced into thin strips
2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
2 tablespoons butter
1  green bell pepper, chopped
½  red bell pepper, chopped
4  fresh mushrooms, sliced
1  green onion, minced
1 ½ cups heavy cream
¼ teaspoon dried basil
¼ teaspoon lemon pepper
¼ teaspoon salt
⅛ teaspoon garlic powder
⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguini pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.
Meanwhile, place chicken and Cajun seasoning in a bowl, and toss to coat.
In a large skillet over medium heat, saute chicken in butter until no longer pink and juices run clear, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add green and red bell peppers, sliced mushrooms and green onions; cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat, and stir in heavy cream. Season the sauce with basil, lemon pepper, salt, garlic powder and ground black pepper, and heat through.
In a large bowl, toss linguini with sauce. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.
