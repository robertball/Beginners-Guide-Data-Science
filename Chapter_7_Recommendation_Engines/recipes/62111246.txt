Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 lbs. lean ground beef
3 eggs
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup gluten free bread crumbs or gluten free cornflake crumbs
1/4 cup dried onion flakes
1 to 2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 24 oz.jars of spaghetti sauce

Directions:
Put enough gluten free bread or cornflakes in your blender  to make 1/2 cup.
Pulse the blender until you have very fine crumbs.
Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix well.
Using a small scoop or your hands, shape meatballs and saute in olive oil until brown.
Drain off the excess fat if needed.
Add 2 jars of your favorite spaghetti sauce to your saute pan and cover. (Make sure your sauce is gluten free)
Let simmer for about 20 minutes.
Use them with spaghetti or in meatball sandwiches (my kids' favorite)
I save my leftover gluten free bread crusts, toast them in a slow oven, and save them in the freezer so I can have gluten free bread crumbs whenever I need them.
