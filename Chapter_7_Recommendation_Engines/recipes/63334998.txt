Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds lean ground turkey
1 1/4 cup quick cook oats
1 (1 ounce) packages dry onion soup mix
1 (1 ounce) packages dry mushroom & onion soup mix
2 tsp dried minced garlic
2 tsp dried minced onion
1 tsp seasoned salt
2 cups egg beaters eggs (equivalent to 4 eggs)
8 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
6 oz chopped fresh spinach

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Put oats, soup mix, garlic, onion, seasoned salt in a large bowl, mix well. Add chopped spinach to bowl & mix again.
Add ground turkey, eggs & Worcestershire to spinach/oat mixture, mix with hands until evenly combined(food safe gloves come in handy here). Do not over mix or the meat will become tough.
Press mixture into (2) greased 12 count muffin pans, each muffin should be level with brim of each cup. Makes about 18 muffins.
Bake in preheated oven until the meatloaf reaches 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) and is no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes.
For better results add a small amount of water to the remaining empty muffin cups, just enough to cover the bottom of each one.
