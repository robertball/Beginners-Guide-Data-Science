Ingredients:
1 lb. hot ground pork sausage
4 oz. cream cheese, room temp
1/2 c. shredded sharp cheddar
1/2 c. grated parm
1 T. dijon mustard
1/2 t. garlic powder
1/4 t. salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix all of your ingredients together in a large bowl, gently until just combined.
Roll heaping tablespoons of the pork mixture into balls, place on your prepared baking sheet.
Place balls into the preheated oven for approximately 30-35 minutes.
Remove from oven onto a paper towel lined plate to soak up excess grease.
Serve immediately - great plain or serve with honey mustard.

Quick and simple -low carb/gluten free.  Perfect Game Day snack!  I like this recipe best with hot sausage for a little kick, but you can make it with your preference.
