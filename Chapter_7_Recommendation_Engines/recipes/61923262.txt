Ingredients:
5 carrots, chopped
3 onions, chopped
2 (16 ounce) can pureed tomatoes
2 (16 ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes, with liquid
1 large head cabbage, chopped
1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
1 (1 ounce) envelope Lipton noodle soup
1 (15 ounce) can cut green beans, drained
10 stalks celery, chopped
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth

Directions:
Sautee onions and garlic in a bit of EVOO.  When they begin to soften, add carrots and celery.  Cook until they are about to brown, stirring often.
Add soup mixes, tomatoes, beef broth, and enough water to cover vegetables. Simmer until vegetables are tender.
Add green beans in the last 5 minutes of cooking, so they do not become over tender.
Recipe can easily be cut in half.
May be stored in the refrigerator for several days.

Description: 
I've adapted this recipe from the Cabbage Fat Burning Soup, because I've tried the soup diet before, but could never stay on it because I could never really stomache the cabbage.  This is a thicker version of that soup without the cabbage, enjoy!Modified from: Cabbage Fat-Burning Soup
