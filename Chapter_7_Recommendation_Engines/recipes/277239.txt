Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
1 pound ground turkey
1 medium onion, chopped
1 envelope dry onion soup mix (such as Lipton®)
1 tablespoon dried parsley
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent roll dough (such as Pillsbury®
1 egg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Butter 2 cookie sheets.
Mix ground turkey with onion, onion soup mix, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper. Form mixture into about 48 small meatballs.
Open 1 package of crescent rolls, keeping the other refrigerated. Separate dough along dotted lines. Cut each triangle into thirds. Place a meatball in the middle of each, stretch and wrap the dough around it, and pinch to seal. Place stuffed rolls seam-side down onto one of the prepared cookie sheets.
Repeat with the second roll of crescent dough and remaining meatballs. Whisk egg in a bowl. Brush egg wash over each roll.
Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a meatball reads at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm.
