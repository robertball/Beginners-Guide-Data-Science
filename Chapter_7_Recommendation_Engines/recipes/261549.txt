Ingredients:
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon olive oil
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large sweet potato, diced
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, divided
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder, divided
1/4 teaspoon chile powder with lime (such as Trader Joe's Chile Lime Seasoning BlendÂ®)
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, or to taste
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon adobo sauce from chipotle peppers
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 large eggs
2 teaspoons olive oil
4 (6 inch) corn tortillas, or more to taste
1 cup fresh spinach
2 avocados, sliced
3 radishes, thinly sliced
2 green onions, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine garlic, 1/2 teaspoon olive oil, and a pinch each salt and pepper in a small piece of aluminum foil. Fold it up to loosely cover and set it on the corner of the baking sheet.
Toss sweet potato together with 2 tablespoons oil on the baking sheet. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon sea salt, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, chili powder, onion powder, chile powder with lime, and paprika on top. Toss thoroughly and spread out.
Roast in the preheated oven until sweet potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place roasted sweet potatoes in a bowl. Unwrap the foil packet and toss roasted garlic mixture into the bowl of sweet potatoes.
Place remaining sea salt, garlic powder, onion powder, pinto beans, lime juice, water, adobo sauce, and black pepper in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 4 minutes. Mash bean mixture together. Cover and keep warm.
Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Crack eggs into the pan and separate them; immediately cover with a lid. Cook until whites are set and yolks are mostly firm, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat.
Heat tortillas in the preheated oven until warm, about 5 minutes.
Place each tortilla on a plate. Layer on a small handful of spinach, a spoonful of mashed pinto beans, a small amount of sweet potato cubes, and a few slices of avocado. Place a fried egg on top. Sprinkle with radishes, green onions, and cilantro.
