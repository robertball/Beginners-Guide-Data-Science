Ingredients:
2 medium fennel bulbs (optional)
2 pounds potatoes, quartered lengthwise
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
2 bunches thin asparagus spears, trimmed and cut into 3-inch pieces
2 medium onions, chopped
3 cloves garlic, diced
2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cut off fennel fronds. Slice bulbs in half lengthwise, and cut each half lengthwise again into 3 wedges.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place fennel pieces and potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet. Toss with olive oil, salt, granulated garlic, pepper, paprika, and chili powder.
Roast vegetables in the preheated oven, tossing halfway, until tender, about 30 minutes.
Add asparagus, onions, and garlic to the roasted vegetables and gently toss. Continue roasting until asparagus is tender and starting to brown on the tips, 10 to 15 minutes more. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.
