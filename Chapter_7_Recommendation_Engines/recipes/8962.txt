Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 cups all-purpose flour for coating
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon butter
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 ¼ cups half-and-half cream
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups fresh sliced mushrooms
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon browning sauce
1 cup sour cream
⅛ cup chopped green onion for topping (optional)

Directions:
In a shallow dish or bowl, season flour with salt and pepper to taste. Dredge chicken in seasoned flour to coat. In a large skillet, brown coated chicken in melted butter or margarine until golden.
In a medium bowl combine the soup, half-and-half, dry onion soup mix, parsley, garlic, mushrooms, nutmeg and browning sauce. Mix all together and pour mixture over chicken in skillet. Reduce heat to low and let simmer, covered, for 1 hour.
Stir in sour cream and heat through, but DO NOT BOIL! Top with chopped green onion and serve over noodles or rice, if desired.

Description: 
I wanted something like the traditional beef stroganoff and threw this one together, writing down everything as I went so I wouldn't forget.  I served with noodles, but rice would be great, too. Asparagus for a vegetable and a green or fruit salad is great!  Nutmeg seems to be the secret ingredient of many Stroganoff recipes.
