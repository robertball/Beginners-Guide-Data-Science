1 can carnation evaporated milk
1/2 lb butter

2 cups icing sugar
1 tbsp vanilla

Directions:
Combine evaporated milk, butter and brown sugar in a pot. Start on high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes. Please make sure to STIR constantly, as this mixture will burn quickly.
Take off heat after 10 minutes and add the vanilla.
Then slowly add the icing sugar, stirring it in as you go.
