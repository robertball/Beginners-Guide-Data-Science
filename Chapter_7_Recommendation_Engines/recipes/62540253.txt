Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
2 eggs
2 egg yolks
milk or water as needed

Directions:
Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder. Add eggs and egg yolks and mix until dry ingredients are moistened. Add small amounts of water or milk if needed. Dough will be very stiff. Use your hands for the best mixing.
Press into a ball and cut in quarters.  Wrap in plastic wrap and allow to rest for 15 minutes.
Roll out on floured surface 1/16 to 1/8 inch thick; cut to desired width and length. Lay on linen dish towel or cooling rack to dry.
Add to boiling broth such as chicken or turkey and cook until done. This may take at least 1/2 hour.

Description: 
These egg noodles must be rolled very thin and be allowed to dry somewhat before boiling. They will swell considerably during cooking, so cut them much smaller than you'd like your finished product to be.Modified from: Homemade Egg Noodles
