Ingredients:
2 (10 ounce) packages chopped frozen broccoli, thawed
1-2 (6 ounce) packages chicken flavored dry stuffing mix
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup dry minced onion
6 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tespoon dry minced garlic (more if fresh garlic is used)
1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt

Directions:
Place broccoli in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover. Cover, and bring to a boil. Cook 5 minutes. Uncover, and continue cooking 2 to 3 minutes, until tender. Remove from heat, drain, and cool.  (No need to cook broccoli if thawed)
In a large bowl, mix broccoli, stuffing mix, Parmesan cheese, onion, eggs, margarine, pepper, garlic and salt. Cover, and chill in the refrigerator approximately 1 hour, until moisture has been absorbed. (Very important step)
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Roll the chilled mixture into 1 inch balls, and arrange on a medium baking sheet.
Bake 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until browned.
