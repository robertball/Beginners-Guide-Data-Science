Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) whole chicken, cut lengthwise
kosher salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or as needed
1 cup water
1 cup maple syrup
1  lemon, juiced
2  chile peppers, chopped
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Sprinkle chicken halves generously with salt, pepper, and cinnamon. Put chicken in a roasting pan; pour water into pan.
Roast chicken in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
Whisk maple syrup, lemon juice, and chile peppers together in a bowl; brush chicken with maple syrup mixture. Pour any remaining maple syrup mixture into the pan.
Cook chicken until no longer pink at the bone, juices run clear, and skin is lightly browned, 30 to 40 more minutes.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Brush chicken with butter; bake until skin is crisp, 10 to 15 more minutes.

Description: 
Our family eats a chicken every other weekend so sometimes it is challenging to find new ways of roasted chicken. This idea nailed it. Delicious, juicy, interesting. Tummies were full and my daughter even asked for second serving - VERY rare. Great with couscous, raisins, and peeled almonds as a side dish.
