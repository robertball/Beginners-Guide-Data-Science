Ingredients:
packaged biscuits

Directions:
I've done them two different ways. The first way was to kind of poke a hole in the middle of each one, enlarge the hole, then deep fry them until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels and either dust with powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar or top with a glaze. The second way was to take each uncooked biscuit and dip it in melted butter, then roll in cinnamon sugar, put on a baking sheet, press an indention in the middle with your thumb, fill it with your favorite jam, and then bake according to the package directions. We made 10 packages of these (100 donuts!!) one Sunday morning to take to church when it was our turn to provide snacks for the coffee service.
