Ingredients:
1 lb. (or more to taste) lean ground beef
2 cans diced tomatoes (with basil, oregano & garlic)
2 cans chili beans
1 can family size Campbell's tomato soup
1 lb. macaroni noodles(more or less to taste/preference)
1 packet Chili-O seasoning
garlic salt (to taste)
shredded cheddar cheese and light sour cream (as garnish)

Directions:
Lightly spray medium to large size skillet with non-stick spray. Add lean ground beef, sprinkle with garlic salt to taste and cook thoroughly. Once beef is cooked, drain grease.
Meanwhile, in a large pot, boil macaroni noodles until tender. Once noodles are cooked, drain the leftover water and return the noodles to the pot.
Add Campbell's tomato soup, beef, two cans of tomatoes, two cans of chili beans, and one packet of Chili-O seasoning to the macaroni.
Heat thoroughly on medium stirring frequently so noodles don't stick.
Serve with shredded cheddar cheese and light sour cream as garnish.

Description: 
My 90-year-old great grandma said it was the best chili she ever ate! It's a combination of my mom and dad's chili recipes with my own added flair. I love chili so I have modified the recipe throughout the years and this one is a keeper!
