Ingredients:
2 large egg whites
1 teaspoon water
1 teaspoon orange extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons orange-flavored liqueur (such as Grand Marnier速)
1 1/2 teaspoons coffee-flavored liqueur (such as Kahlua速)
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
1 tangerine, finely zested
1 pound shelled pecan halves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Heavily butter a large metal baking sheet.
Beat egg whites and water together in the bowl of a stand mixer until stiff peaks form. Add orange extract and vanilla extract; beat until incorporated, 1 minute.
Mix sugar, cinnamon, salt, and black pepper together in a separate bowl; fold sugar mixture into egg white mixture until just incorporated. Fold in rosemary and tangerine zest until evenly mixed. Add pecans to the sugar-egg white mixture; toss to coat. Spread coated pecans in one layer onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, turning the baking sheet and stirring the pecans with a metal spoon every 8 to 10 minutes, until crispy and golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer to a sheet of parchment paper to cool completely.

Description: 
These are a year-round favorite in our house. We've made several variations and still come back to this one as our all-time favorite. Hand-shelled pecans from Grandma's tree, with a vanilla-orange sugar coating that gets its depth from cinnamon, pepper, rosemary, and a bit of Kahlua速 and Grand Marnier速.
