Ingredients:
1/2 cup shelled pumpkin seeds
1/2 cup shelled sunflower seeds
1/4 cup butter
1 cup minced onion
3/4 cup sliced celery
3/4 cup grated carrot
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 tablespoon dried thyme
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 bay leaves
1 loaf whole-grain bread, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 cup wheat and barley nugget cereal (e.g. Grape-Nutsâ„¢)
1/4 cup dried cranberries
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 egg, beaten
2 cups vegetable broth

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread the pumpkin and sunflower seeds onto a baking sheet. Toast the seeds in the oven until lightly browned and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, carrot, cardamom, thyme, parsley, and bay leaves to the butter and cook until the vegetables are tender; remove the bay leaves.
Toss together the toasted seeds, bread, cereal, cranberries, and vegetable mixture in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Add the eggs and mix. Add the vegetable stock gradually until the mixture is moist, but not mushy. Transfer mixture to a lightly greased casserole dish.
Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes.
