Ingredients:
One bunch of kale
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon minced garlic

Directions:
1.  Soak the kale in a large bowl of water for two minutes.  Don't disturb it so the sand and dirt falls to the bottom of the bowl.  Lift the kale from the bowl.  Don't dry it.  Cut off the thick stems and discard.  Chop the remaining kale into one inch pieces.
2.  Heat the oil over medium-high in a large pan that has a lid.  Add the garlic.  Once the garlic is sizzling, carefully add the kale.  There might be some splatter because the kale is still wet.  Cover with the lid.
3.  Cook kale for 5-7 minutes until bright green and slightly tender.  Stir the kale in the pan every couple of minutes using tongs, replacing the lid each time.

Description: 
Kale is supposed to have cancer-fighting properties.  I love it, but my husband hates it.  Cooking it this way is the only way he'll eat it.
