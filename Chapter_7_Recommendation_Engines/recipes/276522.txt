Ingredients:
1 pound Brussels sprouts, cut in half
2 Anjou pears, cubed
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 onion, diced
1 teaspoon garlic powder
salt to taste
1 slice bacon, cut into small pieces, or more to taste
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking pan.
Combine Brussels sprouts and pears in a bowl with 2 tablespoons olive oil, diced onion, garlic powder, and salt. Spread into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and tender, 25 to 30 minutes, tossing after 15 minutes to brown evenly.
While baking, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
Drain bacon grease form the skillet and discard; add remaining olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the skillet. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture reduces slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour over roasted mixture and serve.
