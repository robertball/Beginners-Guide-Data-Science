Ingredients:
1/2 tablespoon butter

10 spears fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2 inch pieces

1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme

1 pinch cayenne pepper
salt and pepper to taste
2 cups water
1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice

Directions:
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and saute the onion for about 2 minutes. Stir in asparagus and zucchini, and saute 5 minutes, or until tender. Season with oregano, basil, thyme, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until vegetables are coated with the seasonings.
Pour water into the vegetable mixture, and stir in rice. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 20 minutes, until the rice is tender.

Description: 
This is a great side dish - fast, flexible and easy (cooks in 1 pan)! I serve it with fish, but it would also go great with chicken. You can use it with any style of rice. Try different vegetables, too!
