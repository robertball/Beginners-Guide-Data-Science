Ingredients:
2 onions, minced
4 garlic cloves, chopped
3 teaspoons olive oil
2 teaspoons turmeric
2 teaspoons cumin
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 tablespoon agave nectar, or honey
3 carrots, sliced 1/4 inch thick
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 14oz cans chickpeas, washed and drained
lemon wedge as garnish
cilantro as garnish

Directions:
Heat the oil in a Tagine or dutch oven. Add the onions and garlic and saute until soft.
Add the turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne pepper and black pepper to coat the onions and garlic. Once coated, add the honey/agave and coat. Once coated, add just enough water to cover the bottom of your pot, then add the carrots. Cook on medium low for 12 minutes.
Mix in the chickpeas, and assure there is still just enough water in the pot to cover the bottom. Don't water it down too much; you want it fairly thick. Cook for 7 minutes.
Serve with lemon wedge to make the flavors pop. Garnish with cilantro.

Description: 
This tagine is a deliciously spicy meal that is my go-to dinner for guests, because everyone loves it-- and it's vegan! I usually pair it with some cumin roasted cauliflower.
