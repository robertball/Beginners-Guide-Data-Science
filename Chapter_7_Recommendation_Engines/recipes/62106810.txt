Ingredients:
2 cups penne pasta (rotini works well too)
1 1/2 cups tomato sauce (homemade or store-bought)
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 cup sliced Button mushrooms
1 tbsp. Olive Oil
1/2 tsp. garlic salt
1/4 tsp. freshly cracked pepper
1 tsp. Italian seasoning
1/2 tsp. hot pepper flakes (more if you like extra heat)
1/4 cup parmesan cheese
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella/monteray jack cheese

Directions:
Sprinkle chicken breasts with cracked pepper and grill until no longer pink inside (about 20 minutes), cool chicken for 10 minutes then cut into bite-sized cubes.
Saute mushrooms in the olive oil and cook the pasta until "al dente", drain and rinse the pasta and place in a large bowl.
Add remaining spices, tomato sauce, mushrooms and cut-up chicken, toss gently.
Spray a 2 quart casserole dish with no-stick spray.
Place half the pasta/chicken mixture into the dish.
Sprinkle half the cheeses overtop.
Place the remaining pasta/chicken mixture into the dish and top off with the remainder of the cheese.
Bake in a 350 F. oven for about 25 minutes until cheese is melted and pasta sauce is bubbling.
