Ingredients:
2 pieces whole wheat bread
8 eggs
1/2 cup milk
salt and pepper to taste
4 oz. grated cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Put 12 foil muffin holders into a muffin baking pan. (Don't use the paper.)
Cut the bread into half inch squares and evenly distribute them on the bottom of the muffin cups.
In a mixing bowl or large measuring cup that has a pour spout thoroughly whisk together the eggs and milk.  Add a few dashes of salt and pepper.
Evenly distribute the egg mixture into each muffin cup.
Sprinkle an equal amount of both the cheese and sausage into each muffin cup on top of the egg mixture.
Bake at 350 for 15 minutes or until eggs are set.  Enjoy or freeze.
