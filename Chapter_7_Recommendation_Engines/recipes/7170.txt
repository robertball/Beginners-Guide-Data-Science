Ingredients:
2 cups Herman Sourdough Starter
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 teaspoons baking powder
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup margarine
1 cup white sugar
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons raisins (optional)
2 tablespoons chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
In a large bowl combine Herman Sweet Sourdough Starter, flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder and eggs until well blended.
Knead dough in bowl for 5 to 7 minutes, or until mixture is smooth.
Let rise in warm place until doubled. Punch down. On a lightly floured surface, press dough into a 10 x 20 inch rectangle. Combine melted margarine, sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread mixture over dough. Sprinkle with walnuts or raisins, if desired.
Starting on long side, roll up dough, jellyroll fashion. Press ends together to make a seam. Cut in 1-inch slices and place in an ungreased, 11x14 inch cake pan. Allow rolls rise to double their size.
Bake in a preheated 325 F oven (165 degree C) for 20 to 25 minutes, until lightly browned.
