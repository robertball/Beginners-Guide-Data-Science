Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 (32 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 large carrot, finely shredded
1 stalk celery, diced
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 bay leaf

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir onion in the hot oil until translucent, about 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Stir diced tomatoes, carrot, celery, Italian seasoning, oregano, salt, pepper, and bay leaf into the saucepan. Simmer until flavors combine, about 1 hour.
Pour sauce into a food processor, discarding bay leaf. Cover and blend carefully until smooth.

Description: 
I have young boys and they are, unfortunately, picky eaters. However, when I make this marinara sauce, and then blend it up so no veggies can be picked out, they love it. I also use this for pizza sauce, lasagna, and any recipe that calls for marinara. I hope your family enjoys as much as we do!
