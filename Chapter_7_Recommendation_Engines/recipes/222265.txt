Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup whole-wheat pastry flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 cups white sugar
1 cup coconut oil
3 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups shredded zucchini
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup butter, softened
4 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups, or line with paper muffin liners.
Sift all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a bowl.
Beat sugar, coconut oil, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 4 minutes; fold in zucchini and walnuts. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture until batter is well mixed. Fill prepared muffin cups with batter about half full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 15 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
Beat cream cheese and butter together with an electric mixer in a bowl until smooth. Gradually beat confectioners' sugar into cheese mixture until frosting is light and fluffy. Spread frosting over completely cooled cupcakes.
