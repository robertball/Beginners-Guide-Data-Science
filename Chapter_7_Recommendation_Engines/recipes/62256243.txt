Ingredients:
1 lb sturdy pasta (penne, fussili, bowtie)
1 cup finely diced Sweet Potato (or 1 medium potato)
1 cup finely diced Butternut squash
1/2 lb fresh shrimp (peeled)(more if you want!)
4 tbsp butter, divided
2 tbsp flour
1 red bell pepper finely diced
3 tbsp tarragon, chopped
2 cups milk
1/2 cup Parmesan
Salt and Pepper

Directions:
Cook the pasta per the package directions.
Saute the peeled/diced butternut squash and sweet potatoes in 2tbsp butter until soft.
Add shrimp, and cook until done (about 2-3 minutes per side), remove all ingredients from the pan.
Saute red bell pepper and tarragon in remaining 2 tbsp of butter, and add flour to make a roux. Cook about 2 minutes over medium heat.
Add milk, 1/2 cup at at time to make a light cream sauce. Let the milk come to a simmer so that the roux properly thickens. You want it to be the texture of heavy cream. Add parmesan to sauce.
Add squash, sweet potatoes shrimp, and pasta to pan and mix well. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
