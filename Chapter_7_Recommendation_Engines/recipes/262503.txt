Ingredients:
2 zucchini, sliced
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish or line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine zucchini slices and olive oil in a large bowl and toss to coat well.
Mix Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, oregano, salt, and pepper in a second bowl or shallow dish. Dip oiled zucchini into bread crumb mixture and arrange close together on the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, turning after 20 minutes so they brown evenly.
