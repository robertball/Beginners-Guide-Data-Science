Ingredients:
1 envelope unflavored gelatin
1/3 cup water
2 cups heavy cream
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons Spice Islands® Whole Cloves
3 Spice Islands® Cinnamon Sticks
1 teaspoon Spice Islands® Pure Vanilla Extract
1 cup frozen raspberries
1/4 cup orange marmalade
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon Spice Islands® Ground Cloves
1/4 teaspoon Spice Islands® Ground Nutmeg

Directions:
Combine gelatin and water in a small bowl-set aside for 15 minutes to soften gelatin.
Mix cream, sour cream, sugar, cloves and cinnamon sticks in medium saucepan. Gently stir over medium heat until mixture comes to a simmer. Remove from heat and strain to remove cloves and cinnamon sticks. Whisk gelatin mixture into strained cream. Add vanilla.
Lightly coat six 3/4-cup ramekins with non-stick spray. Divide panna cotta between ramekins. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight to set.
Thaw raspberries; crush using a fork. Stir in remaining sauce ingredients. Heat for 1 minute on HIGH in microwave. Cool.
To serve, run a knife around each dessert and invert on plate. Spoon sauce over.
