Directions:
Whisk the mustard and vinegar together in a small bowl. Drizzle in the olive oil while whisking to create a dressing; set aside.

Description: 
Great salad you can serve on the side of a main dish or add roasted chicken and have as a meal! Chopped Belgian endive and radicchio can be substituted for the baby greens if you prefer a more exotic twist on salad recipes.
