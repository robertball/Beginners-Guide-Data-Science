Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup lemon juice
8 cloves garlic, minced
3 carrots, sliced
2 white onions, sliced
6 stalks celery, sliced
10 cups water
8 cubes chicken bouillon
2 cups dried split peas
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 teaspoons curry powder

Directions:
In a large soup pot over medium heat, heat the olive oil, and stir in the lemon juice, garlic, carrots, onions, and celery. Cook and stir until the carrots become soft enough to break apart with a fork, about 20 minutes. Transfer the vegetables and their juices into a bowl, and refrigerate. Once slightly cool, place them into a blender, and blend until the mixture forms a smooth puree.
Pour the water into the soup pot, and stir in the chicken bouillon cubes until they dissolve. Pour in the vegetable puree, and bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Stir in split peas, Italian seasoning, cumin, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and curry powder. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the peas soften and break down into a thick soup, at least 45 minutes.

Description: 
We set out to make some split pea soup and thought the flavor would be improved by adding some curry to it.  It's wonderful on its own or over rice.
