Ingredients:
1 pound rigatoni pasta
3 cups purchased garlic-flavored croutons,about 5 ounces   (I use a 6 ounce bag of the brand name Rothbury Farms Garlic Croutons)
1/4 cup slivered almonds,toasted (about 1 ounce)
1 cup julienned roasted red bell peppers
3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Place the croutons and the almonds in a food processor. Pulse until it becomes the texture of bread crumbs. Set aside.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes.
Drain pasta into a large serving bowl.
Add the crouton and almond mixture to the hot pasta.
Add the peppers and the olive oil.
Toss to combine and serve.

Description: 
This is from Giada De Laurentiis on the foodnetwork.
It's more of a pasta salad, not saucy.  Very good especially to take to a pot luck* or serve for a luncheon or a side dish for dinner.
