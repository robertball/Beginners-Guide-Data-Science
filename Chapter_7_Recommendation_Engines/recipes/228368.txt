Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1/4 white onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, excess sauce discarded
6 ounces roasted red jalapeno peppers
4 ounces pepperoncini peppers, stemmed and seeded
4 dried Chinese hot peppers, stemmed and seeded
2 long hot chile peppers, stemmed and seeded

Directions:
Combine chicken broth, white onion, garlic, chipotle peppers, roasted red jalapeno peppers, pepperoncini peppers, dried Chinese hot peppers, and long hot chile peppers in a pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the peppers have softened, about 15 minutes.
Transfer mixture to a blender. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.

Description: 
This chile paste is spicy but not to an extreme. It has a sweet, smokey flavor to it that is great for recipes calling for chile paste or mixing with Ranch dressing for a spicy dip. I use this in a recipe of mine for baked beans that gives it a nice little kick without being overbearing. There is not a large variety of fresh chile peppers available in my area so most of the peppers I used were bottled.
