Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 quarts cold water
⅓ cup balsamic vinegar
¼ cup salt
1  bay leaf
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
8 cloves garlic, minced
1 pinch salt
3 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes, or to taste
4 pounds chicken wings, separated at joints, tips discarded
2 tablespoons fine bread crumbs
1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat foil with cooking spray.
Combine water, vinegar, 1/4 cup salt, bay leaf, thyme, oregano, and rosemary in a large stockpot and bring to a boil. Add chicken wings, return to a boil, and cook for 15 minutes. Remove chicken wings with a slotted spoon to a cooling rack and allow to dry for 15 minutes.
Mash garlic and a pinch of salt together in a mortar and pestle until smooth.
Combine mashed garlic, olive oil, black pepper, and red pepper flakes in a large bowl. Add chicken wings and bread crumbs; toss to coat. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
The trick to keeping these oven-baked chicken wings crispy, is parboiling the wings in a flavorful liquid, which helps season the chicken and produce a surface texture in the oven that your guests will swear came straight out of a deep fryer.
