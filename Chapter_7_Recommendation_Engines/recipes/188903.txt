Ingredients:
1 pound ground chuck
1 ½ teaspoons chili powder
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons paprika

¼ teaspoon onion powder
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon ground cumin
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
¼ teaspoon ground allspice
2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard
1 teaspoon beef base
1 cup water, or more as needed
3 teaspoons buttery crackers (such as Keebler Club(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Crackers)

Directions:
Combine the ground chuck, chili powder, cinnamon, paprika, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, allspice, mustard, beef base, and 1 cup water in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; use a potato masher to break up the beef and mix the rest of the ingredients through the beef; bring to a simmer; reduce heat to medium-low and continue to simmer 2 to 3 hours, adding water occasionally to keep the mixture moist. Once the mixture is softened, stir in the crushed crackers to thicken.
