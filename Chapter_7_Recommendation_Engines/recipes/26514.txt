Description: 
The word quesadilla derives from two Spanish words; queso, meaning cheese, and tortilla. Technically, a quesadilla contains only cheese, but other variations can be very delicious. This version, featuring corn and ORTEGA ® Diced Green Chiles, is a sure-fire winner at the lunch or dinner table.
