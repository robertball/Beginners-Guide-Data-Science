Description: 
These sugar cookies are amazing but I wanted to try to cut some calories so I replaced some of the sugar with Splenda. They still taste great and now they are pretty guilt free. If you decide to ice them, I would keep it light -- maybe some cute dots!Modified from: The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies
