Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground pork
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 medium onions, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (8 ounce) can mushroom pieces
1 (14.5 ounce) can wax beans
1 (15 ounce) can sweet peas
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 (28 ounce) can tomato sauce
chili powder to taste
ground nutmeg to taste
dried marjoram to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat, and cook the ground pork until evenly browned. Reserving the juices in the skillet, remove pork, and set aside.
Stir the onions and garlic into the skillet, and cook in the pork juices over medium heat until tender. Mix in the mushrooms, wax beans, peas, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper. Cook and stir until tender and heated through.
Return the pork to the skillet. Mix in the tomato sauce. Season with chili powder, nutmeg, marjoram, and salt. Reduce heat, and simmer about 45 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
