Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 pounds sweet Italian pork sausage, cut into 3/4-inch pieces
5 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1/3 cup dry white wine
2 1/2 cups passata (crushed tomatoes)
salt
1 pinch red pepper flakes
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in sausage. Cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and wine and bring to a simmer. Stir in passata and bring to a simmer. Cook until sauce starts to thicken, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and red pepper flakes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and add to the sauce. Stir to combine and serve.

Description: 
You can make this hearty tomato and sausage pasta dish as spicy as you like by using more or fewer red pepper flakes. In Italy luganega, a coiled pork sausage, is used, but you can use any type of Italian pork sausage.
