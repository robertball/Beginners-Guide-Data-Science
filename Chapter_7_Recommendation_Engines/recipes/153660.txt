1/3 cup sliced almonds

Add the garlic and almonds to the fat in the skillet and cook briefly over medium heat until toasted. Add the Brussels sprouts and quickly toss to coat with the hot oil. Sprinkle the red wine vinegar over the sprouts and toss again to coat. Cook, stirring frequently, until sprouts are wilted.
