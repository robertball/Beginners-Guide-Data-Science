Ingredients:
1 (32 ounce) container plain yogurt
2 cucumbers
1 medium head garlic
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill weed
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the yogurt in a large square of double cheesecloth.  Tie the cheesecloth at the top and let any excess liquid drain for about 4 hours.
Peel cucumbers; remove seeds with a spoon.  Shred the cucumbers, then squeeze to drain excess liquid.
Peel and mince garlic.
In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, dill, salt and pepper.  Add yogurt, cucumbers and garlic and stir until evenly combined.  Refrigerate until ready to use.
