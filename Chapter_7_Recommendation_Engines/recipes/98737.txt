Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups self-rising flour
1 1/2 cups old-fashioned oats
1/2 cup white sugar
2/3 cup brown sugar
1 cup butter, softened
2/3 cup apple jelly
1/4 cup chopped cashews
1 (11 ounce) package butterscotch chips

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease the bottom of a 9 inch square baking dish.
Mix the flour, oats, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl. Cut the butter into the flour mixture until the mixture is crumbly. Set aside 3/4 cup of the mixture and press the rest into the bottom of the prepared dish. Spread the top with the apple jelly.
Stir the reserved flour mixture and the cashews together in a bowl; sprinkle over the apple jelly. Scatter the butterscotch chips over the cashew mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown; 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool completely before cutting into bars.

I was in the mood to make something with butterscotch in it, and this is what came of it! I meant to make these for my friends, but my family got to them first! Enjoy! If you don't have apple jelly, use apricot preserves, its also really yummy!
