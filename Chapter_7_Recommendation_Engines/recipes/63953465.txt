Ingredients:
15 lemons
Several lemon leaves (opt.)
1.75 liter 100 proof vodka
2 cups white sugar
2 cups water
Also need 3 liter mason jar and cheesecloth

Directions:
Scrub lemons and leaves and pat dry. Zest the lemons using a zester or vegetable peeler, being sure avoid the white pith beneath the peel.  It will make the limoncello taste bitter.  Place zest into a large glass jar with a tight fitting lid. Add lemon leaves. Pour in vodka. Cover and let infuse for 15 days in a cool, dark place. Shake the jar every 2 days to mix the ingredients.
After 15 days, make a simple syrup by combining sugar and water in a medium saucepan. Stir until sugar dissolves and barely comes to a boil. Allow syrup to cool to room temperature. Pour syrup into vodka mixture.  Close jar and shake to mix ingredients.  Let rest again for 15 days, shaking every 2 days to continue good infusion.
Strain completed limoncello through cheesecloth into glass bottles, and seal each bottle with a cork.
Place bottled liqueur into the freezer. When icy cold, serve in chilled glasses or use in your favorite recipe.
