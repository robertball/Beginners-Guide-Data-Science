Ingredients:
1 pound Medjool dates, pitted
3/4 cup raw cashews
3 tablespoons shredded unsweetened coconut
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon coconut oil
1/2 teaspoon espresso powder
8 ounces vegan chocolate chips (such as Enjoy LifeÂ®)

Directions:
Put dates, cashews, coconut, water, cocoa powder, coconut oil, and espresso powder in an oiled food processor; blend until evenly combined. Form mixture into balls using oiled hands. Arrange balls on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet; chill in refrigerator for 1 hour.
Melt 1/2 of the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl for 30 seconds; stir and microwave again for 30 seconds until chocolate is mostly melted. Add remaining chocolate chips to bowl and stir until all the chocolate is melted.
Rub hands with oil and dip balls in the melted chocolate; remove with a fork, allowing excess chocolate to drip back into bowl. Arrange chocolate coated truffles on the baking sheet. Chill for 1 hour.

Description: 
These vegan chocolate truffles are just a few natural ingredients but so delicious! This would be excellent with almonds as well! Some of the chocolate-covered balls can be rolled in some coconut or chopped nuts or sprinkle the tops with sea salt.
