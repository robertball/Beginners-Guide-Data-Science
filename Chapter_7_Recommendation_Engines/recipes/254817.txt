Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup white wine
1 lemon, juiced
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1 bunch fresh dill, stems trimmed
1 (1 pound) salmon fillet
1/2 cup toasted almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix butter, white wine, lemon juice, and garlic together in a small bowl.
Pour a small amount of the butter mixture into an 8x8-inch baking pan until bottom is evenly coated; cover with a thin layer of dill. Place salmon, skin side down, into the baking pan. Sprinkle with remaining dill; pour remaining butter mixture over salmon. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 25 to 35 minutes. Sprinkle generously with almonds before serving.
