Ingredients:
4 tomatoes, peeled and chopped
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon dried minced onion
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 stalks celery, chopped
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 bay leaves
8 cups hot water
1/2 head green cabbage, shredded
1/2 cup beef base
1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 bunch kale, chopped

Directions:
Combine tomatoes, butter, dried minced onion, salt, and black pepper in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring mixture to a simmer, place a cover on the saucepan, and cook at a simmer for 15 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a stock pot over medium heat. Cook and stir celery, onion, garlic, and bay leaves in hot oil until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomato mixture; cook and stir another 5 minutes.
Remove and discard bay leaves. Pour water into the stock pot. Stir green cabbage, beef base, herbes de Provence, and red pepper flakes into the water. Loosely cover the stock pot and cook the mixture for 25 minutes.
Stir kidney beans and kale into the soup. Again loosely cover the pot and continue cooking another 15 minutes.

Description: 
I made this recipe as a spin-off of Portuguese kale soup. I liked it so much! I like to serve this with freshly squeezed lemon juice or grated Parmesan cheese (but not both).
