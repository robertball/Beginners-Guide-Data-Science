Ingredients:
2 TBS Olive Oil
1 small onion - chopped rustic
3 cloves garlic - chopped rustic
2 zucchini - I chop these by slicing and then quartering.  Same with the squash
2 yellow squash
1 cup New Mexico Roasted Green Chile
2 TBS black pepper
2 ears of grilled corn
1/2 c Feta Cheese

Directions:
I grill the corn in husk.  When the corn is done, cut the corn off the cob.  Reserve corn to add later.
Saute onions and garlic together, sweat them down.
Add zucchini and squash, saute add black pepper
Add roasted green chilen, corn and feta cheese.  Cook down till cheese is melted.
I do this on the Stove top.
