4 eggs
3.5 cups plain flour
.5 tsp salt
.5 tsp soda
1 cup buttermilk
1 tsp lemon extract
Glaze â€” whisk all together.
1/4 cup lemon juice (sometimes I use fresh squeezed, sometimes not ;)

1/4 stick of butter, softened
2 cups of 4X sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Cream butter and sugar together for 10 minutes.
Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each.
Sift dry ingredients together.
Add dry ingredients a little at a time, alternating with buttermilk and beating well after each addition.
Add flavoring.
Pour batter into well greased & floured bundt pan, filling only 2/3.
Lower oven temp to 325 and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes (check after one hour).
Let the cake rest for 10 minutes, then turn out onto cake plate.
Immediately pour half the glaze over the cake. Let that cool, then pour the rest of the glaze over the cake.
