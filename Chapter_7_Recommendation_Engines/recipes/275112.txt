Ingredients:
2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed
2 teaspoons salt
4 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
1 cup diced sweet onion
1 1/4 cups mayonnaise
2 teaspoons celery salt
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; add salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside until cool enough to touch, but still warm.
Peel potatoes and cut into chunks. Place in a bowl and add eggs and onion. Mix in mayonnaise, celery salt, and pepper until well combined. Refrigerate until flavors have melded, about 1 hour. Serve chilled.

Description: 
The fantastic flavor of this potato salad is created by peeling the potatoes after they're cooked and mixing the ingredients while warm. Using golden potatoes makes this recipe special! Celery, bell pepper, and olives may be added if desired.
