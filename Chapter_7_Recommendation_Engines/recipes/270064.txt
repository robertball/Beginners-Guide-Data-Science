2 (3 ounce) beef tenderloin steaks
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 small carrot, peeled and very finely chopped

1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme
1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
1 clove garlic, minced
1/3 cup dry red wine

Directions:
Coat tenderloins with oil and rub with salt and pepper.
Quickly sear tenderloins in a frying pan over medium-high heat, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a roasting pan. Add carrot, rosemary, thyme, parsley, and garlic; pour red wine over the top. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) when ready to cook.
Bake in the preheated oven until tenderloins are firm and heated through, about 35 minutes.
