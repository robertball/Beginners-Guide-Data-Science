Ingredients:
1 envelope (1 tablespoon) unflavored gelatin
1 1/2 cups brewed coffee, cooled
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup white sugar, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt, divided
3 eggs, separated
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine gelatin and cold coffee in a small bowl; set aside for 5 minutes to soften. In a heat-proof bowl or the top of a double boiler, combine coffee mixture, milk, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and the egg yolks. Set the bowl over a pan of over simmering water. Stir until sugar is dissolved and gelatin has melted.
Whisk in remaining 1/4 cup sugar, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and the egg yolks. Cook and stir until mixture is thick and creamy and coats the back of a metal spoon. Remove from heat.
Whip the egg whites (with a pinch of salt, if desired) until stiff peaks form. Fold egg whites and vanilla into slightly cooled custard. Pour into a serving dish or lightly greased mold and chill until set, at least 4 hours.

Description: 
A refreshingly cool dessert that is souffle and gelatin in one. Old recipe from my grandmother. When chilled, the gelatin will separate into its own layer. Serve with whipped topping.
