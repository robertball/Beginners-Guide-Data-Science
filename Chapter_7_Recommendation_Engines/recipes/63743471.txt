Description: 
I was at our local fish store to pick up salmon but spotted perfect Ahi Tuna. I came home and mixed together the perfect seasonings. My husband wanted a little pasta so I pulled out a 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 container mini-roma tomatoes and a zucchini. This was a great dinner for my hubby and I. 
If you are following a Paleo or Gluten Free Pasta you can substitute pasta for spaghetti squash, gluten free pasta or even zucchini noodles. Be creative!
