Ingredients:
7 cups peeled and diced potatoes

4 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste

10 tablespoons butter
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
4 cups milk

Directions:
Combine the potatoes, celery, onion, ham and water in a crockpot. Cook on low for 6-8 hours. Stir in the chicken bouillon, salt and pepper.
Warm milk in the microwave.  In a saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour with a whisk, and cook, stirring constantly until thick, about 1 minute. Slowly stir in milk as not to allow lumps to form until all of the milk has been added. Add to soup.  Mix thoroughly. Serve immediately.
