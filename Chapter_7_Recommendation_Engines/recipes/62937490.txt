Ingredients:
Salt and pepper as needed
4 chicken thighs
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup celery
1 cup carrots
1 cup onions
1 small shallot
8 oz of uncooked fusilli noodles
2 bay leaves
a pinch of oregano
3 cups chicken stock
1 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon dijon mustard

Directions:
Apply salt and pepper to skin side of chicken thighs.
In a medium frying pan, heat olive oil.
Once heated, place chicken thighs carefully skin side down in the pan.
Fry chicken until grolden brown, about 7 minutes. Carefully remove from pan making sure to scrape the skin off the bottom of the pan and set aside for later.
While chicken is cooking, chop up celery, carrots, onions, and the shallot.
Then, add chopped veggies to pan and saute them until they begin to soften, about 7 minutes.
Once veggies are soft, evenly stir in uncooked noodles.
Next, add bay leaves, oregano, and salt and pepper to taste.
Combine chicken stock, wine, and dijon mustard in a large measuring cup and pour over veggie and noodle mixture.
Place chicken thighs skin side up on top of the veggie noodle mixture.
Liquid should almost cover the top of chicken. Add more stock or wine if needed.
Cook covered for 20 minutes on medium heat, or until noodles are soft.
Plate and serve.

This dish is a combination of chicken noodle soup and a coq au van. I always make it when I get a cold, but it is darn good for any occasion.
