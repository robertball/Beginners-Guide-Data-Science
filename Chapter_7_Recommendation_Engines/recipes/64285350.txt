Ingredients:
2 (14.5 Oz.) Cans Chickpeas/Garbanzo Beans, Drained, Rinsed & Dried
2 Tbsp. Shredded Dry Parmesan
1 Tsp. Dried Crushed Rosemary
1 Garlic Clove, Minced
1/8 Tsp. Garlic Powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. and line a baking sheet with foil. Give the foil a light spritz of some non-stick cooking spray and set aside.
Toss the chickpeas and the rest of the ingredients together in a large bowl until they are all well and evenly coated.
Arrange the garbanzo beans onto the baking sheet in a single layer and give them a little spritz of non-stick cooking spray.
Place the sheet into the preheated oven and bake for 30-40 minutes or until the chickpeas are crisp.
Carefully remove the sheet from the oven and set aside to cook slightly before serving.
