1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup white flour
2 1/4 teaspoon RapidRise yeast

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine 2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, and salt.
Stir very warm water and oil into flour mixture.

Cover; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes.
Lightly oil a cookie sheet and sprinkle with corn meal.
Press the dough onto the cookie sheet and score into stripes with a pizza cutter.
Brush on oil, dried oregano and basil, garlic powder and salt.
Bake at 400F for 20 minutes.
Variation: Add herbs and garlic powder to dry ingredients to make herb dough. Sprinkle on cheese.
