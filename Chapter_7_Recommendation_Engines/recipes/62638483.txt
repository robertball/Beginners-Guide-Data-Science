Ingredients:
1 tablespoon each of coarsley ground black pepper, dried parsley flakes, kosher salt, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.
1 teaspoon of dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper

Directions:
Combine and mix all ingredients, making sure to break up any lumps. Lightly brush your steak with EVOO, or a cooking oil, then cover each side of the steak generously with the rub and rub it into the meat. The rub should be thick enough to cover the steak completely, but not so thick you can not see the meat.
This rub does have a high heat factor to it. If you cannot handle heat reduce the cayenne and crushed red pepper to 1/4 teaspoon for medium heat and 1/8 teaspoon for slight heat. You can even leave them out if you are really wimpy.
