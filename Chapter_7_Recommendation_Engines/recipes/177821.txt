Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds sweet Italian pork sausage, casing removed
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's® Condensed Cream of Broccoli Soup (Regular or 98% Fat Free)
1/2 cup milk
1 (16 ounce) bag frozen broccoli cuts
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
4 1/2 cups corkscrew-shaped pasta, cooked and drained
Crushed red pepper

Directions:
Cook the sausage in  a 6-quart saucepot over medium-high heat until the sausage is well browned, stirring frequently to break up meat.
Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion and garlic to the saucepot and cook until tender. Pour off fat.
Stir the soup, milk, broccoli and 1/4 cup of the cheese into the saucepot. Heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the broccoli is tender, stirring occasionally.
Put the pasta in a large serving bowl. Pour the sausage mixture over the pasta. Toss to coat. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Serve with red pepper, if desired.
