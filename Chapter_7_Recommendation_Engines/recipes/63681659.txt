Ingredients:
2 Tbsp. butter
2 oz. bacon, finely chopped
1 cup scallions, finely chopped
½ cup celery, finely chopped
1 Tbsp. fresh ginger, grated
4 pounds mussels, thoroughly cleaned and bearded
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
1½ cups Hennepin
¾ cup heavy cream (optional)
2 Tbsp. finely minced fresh cilantro or parsley

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot (with lid). Add the bacon and cook over medium heat for 3 minutes. Add the scallions, celery and ginger and simmer, stirring, for another 3 minutes. Add the mussels, flavor with a generous grinding of black pepper. Pour the beer and the cream over the mussels and cover the pot tightly. Bring to a boil over high heat and steam the mussels in the covered pot until they all open, 3 to 6 minutes, depending on their size. Shake the pot vigorously a few times to toss the mussels with the buttery vegetables and to allow them to open. Discard any mussels that remain closed. Divide the hot mussels into soup plates along with the broth. Garnish with the minced cilantro or parsley. Serve with a generous portion of “Belgian fries” or bread, and Hennepin.
