Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package ground beef
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup uncooked long grain rice
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 teaspoon browning sauce (such as Kitchen BouquetÂ®)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a 4- to 6-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add tomatoes, rice, onion, green bell pepper, browning sauce, salt, chili powder, pepper, and thyme. Cover.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring after 20 minutes, until rice is tender, about 1 hour 10 minutes.
