Ingredients:
6 - Tilapia filets
1- 4oz Achiote Paste
1/3 cup olive oil
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Blend the olive oil and Achiote paste in a blender until smoothe.
Marinate the Tilapia in the mixture for approx 20-30 minutes. I usually use a zip lock baggie.
Place on a cast iron griddle about 4 minutes each side.
This fish is great for fish tacos or just eat as a meal as it is. Simple and delicious!
