Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, drained and chopped
1 (16 ounce) package sharp Cheddar cheese, sliced
1/2 cup milk
1 (4 ounce) packet saltine crackers, crushed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.
Spread half the macaroni into a 9x13-inch casserole dish; top with half the tomatoes and half the Cheddar cheese. Repeat layering with remaining macaroni, tomatoes, and Cheddar cheese. Pour milk over entire casserole; sprinkle with crushed crackers.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and crackers are golden, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a family recipe that I have found most people who try it, love it. You can substitute RitzÂ® crackers for a sweeter taste. Also, it is very good as leftovers. Add a splash of milk and microwave.
