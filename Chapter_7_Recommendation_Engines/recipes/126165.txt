Ingredients:
3 pounds medium red-skinned potatoes
Dressing:
3/4 cup sour cream
3/4 cup mayonnaise
2 celery stalks, finely diced
1/2 tablespoon celery seed
2 tablespoons chopped chives
1 teaspoon dried mustard
3/4 cup Lindsay® Sliced Black Ripe Olives
Salt and freshly ground white pepper, to taste
1/4 cup chopped parsley
Garnish:
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
1 tablespoon finely chopped chives

Directions:
In a large pot of boiling water, cook the potatoes until tender but slightly resistant when pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes. Drain and cool, but do not peel. When cool, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces and place in a medium bowl.
In a small bowl, combine the sour cream, mayonnaise, celery, celery seed, chives, mustard, olives, salt and pepper to taste, and parsley. Mix well.
Pour the mixture over the potatoes and toss gently until evenly coated. Taste for seasoning. Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.
Transfer the salad to a serving bowl and garnish with parsley and chives. Serve cold.

Lindsay® Olives
Description: 
The red skins are left on the potatoes in this salad for extra color and texture. Celery seed and celery add freshness and crispness as well as a counterpoint for the tangy chives. This salad is perfect with cold roasted chicken.
