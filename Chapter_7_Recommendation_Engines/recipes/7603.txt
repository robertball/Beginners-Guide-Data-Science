Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup nonfat plain yogurt
1 pint fresh strawberries
1 pint fresh raspberries
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease one 11x7 inch glass baking dish.
Cream 1/2 cup of the butter or margarine with 1/2 cup of the white sugar until light, beat in the egg. Add the baking powder and the salt. Stir in the 2 cups of flour one cup at a time alternating with the yogurt. Spread batter into the prepared pan. Arrange fruit over top of batter. Sprinkle topping over fruit.
To Make Topping: Mix together 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup butter or margarine, and the cinnamon until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Bake  at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the cake is top is puffed and nicely browned. Allow cake to cool. You can serve it directly from the baking dish or for a more attractive presentation, I cut it up into squares and arrange them on a platter.

Description: 
I've always called this a buckle (I'm from the Midwest), but my friends here in California, say it's a 'coffee cake', but no matter the name they love it!
