Ingredients:
Cake:
1 (16.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 (3 ounce) package raspberry-flavored gelatin mix
1 (10 ounce) package frozen raspberries, thawed with juice retained
4 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup hot water
Frosting:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen raspberries, thawed
1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
Topping:
1/2 cup fresh strawberry halves
1 cup raspberries
1 fresh blackberry

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 2 9-inch round pans.
Combine dry cake mix and gelatin powder in a large bowl; add 1 package raspberries with juice, eggs, vegetable oil, and hot water. Beat mixture thoroughly; divide batter between prepared round pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 28 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
Fold 1 package thawed frozen raspberries through whipped topping in a bowl; spread about half the frosting evenly over 1 cake, place other cake atop the frosted cake, and frost with remaining frosting. Refrigerate at least 2 hours.
Top frosted cake with halved strawberries along outer edge and with raspberries in a circular pattern in the middle. Place blackberry in center of cake.

Description: 
A quick gourmet cake that is very moist. I made this for a friend's birthday as a nice alternative to standard birthday cake since she preferred whipped frosting to buttercream.
