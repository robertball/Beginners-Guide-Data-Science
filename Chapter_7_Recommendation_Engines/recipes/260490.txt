Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower
2 tablespoons salt, divided
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
1  onion, chopped
1  celery rib, chopped
2  eggs
½ cup half-and-half
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons onion powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 pound cooked chicken, chopped
1 (16 ounce) bag frozen broccoli
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup shredded pepper Jack cheese
½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place cauliflower florets in a blender and cover with water; blend briefly on high speed until cauliflower is the size of rice.
Pour cauliflower rice and water into a pot; add 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute. Drain cauliflower rice in a wire sieve or colander lined with cheesecloth; cool.
Heat oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat; stir in onion and celery. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
Beat eggs, half-and-half, remaining 1 tablespoon salt, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder in a large bowl. Stir in cauliflower rice, onion mixture, chicken, broccoli, mozzarella cheese, and pepper Jack cheese. Spread into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle top with Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbly and the top is golden brown, about 50 minutes.

Description: 
Very delicious, low carb and gluten free. If you make the cauliflower rice ahead of time, it comes together quickly. Cauliflower stayed good in the fridge for 48 hours.
