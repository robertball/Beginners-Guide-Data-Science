Ingredients:
1 blood orange juiced
a few mint leaves
1 1/2 jigger of gin (I suggest Hendricks)
1/2 jigger of sweet vermouth
real homemade maraschino cherries (they are black and super syrupy)
ice
lemon lime soda of your choice

Directions:
Squeeze all the juice out of your orange to equal about 1/3 a cup. Place ice and mint in glass and muddle.
Fill glass with remaining ingredients, add a little bit of the syrup from the cherries. Stir together, and drink cold.
How much ice and lemon lime is up to your taste.
