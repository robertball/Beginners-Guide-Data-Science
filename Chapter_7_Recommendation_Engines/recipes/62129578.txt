Ingredients:
1 cup mini marshmallows
1 tbsp water
1 1/2- 1 3/4 cup powder sugar

Directions:
Place marshmallows in a standard 1 cup measuringand pack them in.
Place in a microwave safe bowl and add the water. Put in the microwave for about 20 seconds.
Add the sugar and mix and fold until all is incorporated and it is no longer sticky. I take it out of the bowl when it gets to the point where most of the sugar is incorporated and I knead it in my hands. This takes roughly about 5-7 minutes.
Take a fondant roller or a regular rolling pin and roll out to use.
