Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) box Betty Crocker速 SuperMoist速 white cake mix
1 1/4 cups water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 egg whites
1 (0.13 ounce) package cherry-flavored or other red-colored unsweetened soft drink mix
1/2 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
1 (12 ounce) container Betty Crocker速 Whipped fluffy white frosting
Green food color
Red food color
2 tablespoons miniature semisweet chocolate chips
2/3 cup green jelly beans

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for dark or nonstick pans). Grease bottoms only of two 8- or 9-inch round cake pans with shortening or cooking spray. In large bowl, beat cake mix, water, oil, egg whites and drink mix with electric mixer on low speed 30 seconds; beat on medium speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. (Batter will be lumpy.) Stir in 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips. Pour into pans.
Bake as directed on box for 8- or 9-inch round pans. Cool 10 minutes. Remove from pans. Cool completely, about 1 hour.
In small bowl, stir 1 cup of the frosting with 10 to 12 drops green food color. Stir 10 to 12 drops red food color into remaining frosting. Frost sides of cakes with green frosting; press green jelly beans into frosting. Frost tops of cakes with red frosting; press remaining 2 tablespoons chocolate chips into frosting for seeds. If desired, cut cakes crosswise in half and arrange 'slices' randomly on tray. To serve, cut into wedges. Store loosely covered at room temperature.
