Ingredients:
1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1/2 cup diced hot Hatch green chiles
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 jalapeno pepper, minced, or to taste (optional)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 halibut steaks
2 cups sliced zucchini

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine tomatoes, green chiles, sugar, garlic, jalapeno, salt, and black pepper in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; add zucchini. Simmer until sauce is combined, 5 to 10 minutes.
Place halibut steaks in a shallow casserole dish; pour sauce on top.
Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 30 minutes.
