Ingredients:
1 (12.4 ounce) package refrigerated cinnamon roll dough with icing
1 (12 ounce) package bacon

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a rack on top. Arrange bacon on the rack and place in a cold oven.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook bacon while oven heats until slightly cooked but not crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. Blot excess grease with paper towels.
Grease 16 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Unroll cinnamon roll dough into a flat sheet on a work surface. Cut strips in half widthwise. Place a piece of bacon on each dough strip and roll dough to enclose the bacon. Place rolls in the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are golden brown, 13 to 17 minutes. Cool slightly.
Top cinnamon roll bites with icing from package.
