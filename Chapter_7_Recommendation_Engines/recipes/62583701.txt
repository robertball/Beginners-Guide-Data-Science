Ingredients:
3 eggs
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, melted
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat eggs and sugar until thick. Stir in the melted butter and vanilla. Sift together the flour and baking powder, and blend into the batter until smooth. Heat the pizzelle iron. Drop about one tablespoon of batter onto each circle on the iron. You may need to experiment with the amount of batter and baking time depending on the iron. Cool completely before storing in an airtight container.
