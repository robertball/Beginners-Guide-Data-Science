Ingredients:
1 box farfalle pasta
1 can (15oz.) garbanzo beans
1 can (13.75 oz.) artichoke hearts, diced
1.5 cups frozen peas
1/2 cup black olives, diced
1/2 red onion, more or less to taste
1.5 cups queso blanco, diced
1 bottle of your favorite Italian Dressing (I only use Girard's Old Venice Italian)
Cracked Black Pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook pasta al dente in lightly salted, boiling water.  Meanwhile, in an extra large bowl, add garbanzo beans, diced artichokes, frozen peas, diced black olives and diced onion.
Drain pasta and immediately add to your bowl.  Add queso blanco and italian dressing. Toss to coat and top with a generous portion of freshly cracked black pepper. Let sit for 5 minutes for peas to thaw and flavors to develop.
