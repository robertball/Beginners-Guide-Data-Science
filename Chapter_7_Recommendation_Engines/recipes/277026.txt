Ingredients:
Shortbread Crust:
baking spray
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon salt
Pecan Pie Filling:
4 large eggs
2/3 cup light brown sugar
1/4 cup salted butter, melted
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup Golden Eagle syrup
3 cups pecans, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on at least 2 sides. Spray the parchment paper with baking spray.
Combine flour, butter, powdered sugar, and salt in a food processor and pulse 6 or 7 times to combine. Transfer mixture to the lined pan and press into an even layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack.
Combine eggs, brown sugar, melted butter, flour, and salt together in a large bowl. Mix in syrup until well combined. Stir in pecans. Pour over the still-warm shortbread crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool completely in the pan for at least 1 hour. Run a knife around the edge of the pan and pull out using the parchment overhang. Slice into bars.

Description: 
With pecans being native to the southern US, this easy bar version of the classic pie is perfect for Thanksgiving. Pair the proverbial nut with Golden Eagle syrup, an Alabama specialty, and this dessert is as Southern as they come.
