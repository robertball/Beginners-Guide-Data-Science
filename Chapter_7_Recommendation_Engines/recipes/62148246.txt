Ingredients:
3/4 c. Hersheys cocoa powder
2 lb box of Nestle's Quik (chocolate flavor)
1/2 of a 20 quart box of Carnation dry milk
1 lb powdered sugar (3 3/4 cups)
1 8 oz jar powdered non dairy coffee creamer
1 8 oz jar powdered non dairy french vanilla creamer

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together, and if desired, place into mason jars or other well sealed containers. To mix, add 1/3 to 1/2 cup mix to hot water or milk. To decorate mason jars, take six inch squares of fabric and place over the top. Secure with ribbon, and tie a note made out of cardstock or recycled Christmas cards with mixing instructions to the ribbon as well. You can also tie on a bag of homeade marshmallows or crushed candy canes.

Description: 
My family has made this mix every year since I can remember and given it to friends and neighbors as a nice gift to accompany our fresh baked cookie trays. You can add a little Buttershots (for the adults only) to make an excellent holiday cheer drink also, or some instant coffee for mocha hot chocolate. Hint* don't use store brands for your ingredients, or your mix will not taste as rich as it should.
