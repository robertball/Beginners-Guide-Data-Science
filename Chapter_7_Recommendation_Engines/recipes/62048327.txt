Ingredients:
1 medium onion, chopped
4 Tbsp butter or butter substitute
1 15oz can tomato sauce
4 cloves garlic
1.5 Tbsp turmeric
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp allspice
1.5 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp ginger
2 15oz cans chickpeas, drained
1-2 green peppers, chopped
Salt to taste

Directions:
Saute the onions in the butter.  When lightly browned, add the garlic and sauté, making sure it doesn’t burn.  Add the tomato sauce and spices, stir.  Simmer over medium heat for about 5 minutes and then add the chickpeas.  Stir until everything is evenly cooked and serve immediately.  Great with rice and steamed broccoli.

Description: 
Quick, easy and tasty.  Be careful of what cooking utensils you use, turmeric tends to stain things yellow if not washed off immediately.  I suggest using a metal spoon to stir and serve, so no non-stick pans, even though I have never had one stained.
