Ingredients:
1 head green cabbage, finely shredded
1 cup finely shredded red cabbage
3/4 cup finely chopped pineapple
1 large carrot, finely shredded
5 slices cooked bacon, chopped
1/2 red onion, grated
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
3/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
3 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, pureed
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
8 kosher all-beef hot dogs
8 hot dog buns

Directions:
Combine green cabbage, red cabbage, pineapple, carrot, bacon, red onion, and parsley in a large bowl.
Whisk mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, chipotle puree, sugar, honey, Dijon mustard, onion powder, garlic powder, celery salt, salt, and pepper in a bowl until well combined. Pour over the cabbage mixture and toss well. Let stand for at least 15 minutes before serving.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill hot dogs until golden brown on all sides, about 7 minutes total. Transfer to a plate. Place buns cut-side down on the grill and grill until lightly golden brown, about 20 seconds.
Place hot dogs in the buns and top with cabbage slaw.
