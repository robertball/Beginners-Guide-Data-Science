Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
1/2 large onion, chopped
1/2 large cucumber, sliced
1/2 cup canola oil

1 1/2 teaspoons ground mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook penne at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Transfer to a large bowl.
Blend onion, cucumber, canola oil, vinegar, sugar, garlic powder, salt, mustard, parsley, and pepper in a food processor or blender until smooth, about 2 minutes.
Pour sauce over pasta; toss to coat. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.
