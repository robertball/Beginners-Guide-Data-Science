Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
5 tablespoons flour
2 teaspoons beef bouillon
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon
2.5 cups water
1 small onion, finely chopped
fresh ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Use half the butter to sautee the onions until transluscent.
Add the other half of the butter then the flour to make the roux, mixing constantly until golden brown. The best way to make a good roux is to use a whisk and make sure the butter does not burn.
Add the water and bouillon and continue to whisk until desired color and consistency. Continuous stirring is needed to prevent lumps from forming. Add black pepper to taste.
Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook until thickened.
