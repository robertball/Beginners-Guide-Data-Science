Ingredients:
2 packages (8 oz each) cream cheese, softened
1 tomato
4 stalks of celery
2 cups of bacon bits
1/2 cup of ranch dressing
1 box of wheat thins (or triscuits if you prefer)

Directions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, mix together the softened cream cheese and the ranch dressing.  Blend well.
2. Chop celery into small, bite-sized pieces and cube the tomato* into small pieces.
*I prefer to scoop out the mush in the middle of the tomato and just use the fleshy outside.
3. Mix in chopped celery, tomato, and the bacon bits.  Mix until there is a little bit of everything in each bite.
