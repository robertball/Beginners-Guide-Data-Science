Ingredients:
1/4 cup of butter
1/2 cup of milk
8 ounces of softened cream cheese
1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Set a medium sized saucepan to medium heat, and add the butter and milk. Once the butter is melted, add the cream cheese (melts easier if it is cut up). Whisk contents until well mixed, then add the Parmesan (much better if you grate the cheese yourself, rather than buying pre-grated). Whisk contents until completely blended. Enjoy!
