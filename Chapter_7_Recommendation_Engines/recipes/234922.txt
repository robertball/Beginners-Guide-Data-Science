Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup half-and-half
1/4 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread
1/2 cup Ghirardelli® 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips
1/4 cup Ghirardelli® Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
3/4 cup boiling water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine flour, 1/4 cup of the sugar, the baking powder, and salt. Add half-and-half. Whisk until smooth. Stir in chocolate-hazelnut spread and Ghirardelli(R) 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips.
Divide batter evenly among six 5- to 6-ounce oven-safe ramekins or bowls. Place in a 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and the Ghirardelli(R) Unsweetened Cocoa Powder. Gradually stir in boiling water. Pour evenly over batter in ramekins.
Bake, uncovered, for 20 to 25 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted into cake portion comes out clean. Centers will indent slightly when done. If desired, top each cake with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream, fresh raspberries, and/or chopped toasted* hazelnuts.
