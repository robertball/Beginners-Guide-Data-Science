Pour into prepared pan.  Bake for 1 hour or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.  Let cool for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a serving plate.  Let cool completely.  For icing, mix powdered sugar and Kahlua until it is a creamy consistency, free of lumps.  Evenly distribute over top of cake and allow to drizzle on all sides.
