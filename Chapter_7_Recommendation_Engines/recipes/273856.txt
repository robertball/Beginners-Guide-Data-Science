Ingredients:
1 cup frozen peas
1 medium potato, peeled and cubed
3 leaves fresh mint
2 tablespoons powdered baby formula

Directions:
Fill water into a small saucepan to about a 1-inch depth. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add peas and potato; boil until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the mint leaves for the last minute of cooking.
Drain and reserve cooking liquid. Using an immersion blender, puree to desired consistency using formula powder and the reserved cooking liquid as needed to achieve your desired consistency. You can puree completely smooth for younger babies or leave it a little chunky for older babies.
