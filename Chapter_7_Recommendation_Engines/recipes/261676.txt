Ingredients:
Pickled Red Onion:
1/2 large red onion, thinly sliced
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1 head cauliflower, outer leaves trimmed
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Avocado Crema:
1/2 avocado
1/4 cup sour cream
2 small limes, juiced
1 tablespoon chopped cilantro
1 pinch salt
1 (15 ounce) can seasoned black beans
1 cup quartered cherry tomatoes
1/4 cup crumbled queso fresco
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
1 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place onion slices in a small colander. Bring 2 to 3 cups water to a boil in a kettle. Pour over onion and let drain.
Mix vinegar, salt, sugar, and cumin together in a jar. Mix in onion slices. Cover and place in the refrigerator.
Cut cauliflower in half from top to bottom. Place each half flat against the cutting board. Cut into 1/2-inch slices. Arrange carefully on the prepared baking sheet, trying to keep slices intact. Drizzle olive oil over cauliflower; season with salt and pepper.
Roast cauliflower in the preheated oven until evenly browned, about 30 minutes.
Combine avocado, sour cream, lime juice, 1 tablespoon cilantro, and salt in a blender. Blend until creamy and smooth.
Heat black beans in a small saucepan until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Spoon warmed beans over cauliflower. Dollop avocado crema over beans. Scatter pickled onion slices, cherry tomatoes, and queso fresco over crema. Garnish with 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.

Description: 
Skip the chips and use slabs of roasted cauliflower instead! I opted for these toppings because they were balanced and played well off each other, but you can change them up as you please.
