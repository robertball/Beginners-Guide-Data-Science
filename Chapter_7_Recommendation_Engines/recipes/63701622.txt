Description: 
People always tell me these are the best chocolate chip cookies they've ever had!  Most cookie recipes call for 2 sticks (1 cup) of butter; I use less, which keeps the cookies from spreading and makes them more chunky.  People also like the combination of semi-sweet chunks and milk chocolate chips.
