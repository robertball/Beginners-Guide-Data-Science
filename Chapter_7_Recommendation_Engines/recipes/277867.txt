Ingredients:
Filling:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound yellow onions, chopped
6 scallions, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 pounds ground beef
2 tablespoons dried oregano
1 1/2 tablespoons salt
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon butter, or as needed
36 empanada pastry discs
1 egg white, beaten

Directions:
Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions, scallions, and bell pepper. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are translucent, 10 to 15 minutes.
Add ground beef, oregano, salt, cayenne pepper, and cumin to the onion mixture. Cook and stir beef until no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly, then cover and place in the refrigerator until meat is completely cooled, about 1 hour.
Remove filling from the refrigerator and transfer into a colander to drain. Return filling to the Dutch oven.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Liberally grease a baking sheet with butter.
Place about 2 tablespoons filling into the center of an empanada disc. Fold empanada in half into a crescent shape, press the edges of the dough together with a fork or your fingers to seal, and place onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining empanadas and filling. Brush tops with egg white.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.

This authentic recipe was given to me by a visiting Argentinean professor while I was studying Spanish in college. They have become a staple food in my household as they are both simple to make, and delicious.
