Description: 
This BBQ sauce is a recipe a friend's mother gave me when I told her I was making pulled pork sandwiches. I intended to use bottled sauce since it was my first time preparing pulled pork. My pulled pork turned out ABSOLUTELY amazing because of this recipe. I'll admit I added a few dabs of bottled sauce because I wasn't confident the consistency of this sauce would be ok. Regardless, this is good stuff!
