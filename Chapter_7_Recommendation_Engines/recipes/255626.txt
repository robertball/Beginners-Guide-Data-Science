Ingredients:
1/2 sugar pumpkin, halved and seeded
1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed
1/4 cup chia seeds
1 cup hot water
1/3 cup crystallized sugar cane juice (such as SucanatÂ®)
1/4 cup agave nectar
1 1/2 cups spelt flour
1 cup brown rice flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 cup walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add pumpkin, cover, and steam until fully cooked, 35 to 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with olive oil.
Place chia seeds in a blender; add hot water and let sit for 5 minutes.
Scoop flesh out of pumpkin halves and add to blender. Add crystallized sugar cane juice and agave nectar to blender; blend until pumpkin mixture is very smooth.
Mix spelt flour, brown rice flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves together in a bowl. Fold pumpkin mixture and walnuts into flour mixture until batter is just mixed; spoon into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Description: 
Vegan pumpkin bread! This is an egg-free pumpkin bread. No oil, no butter, just pure flavor. I love this bread toasted with a little butter or ghee or margarine.
