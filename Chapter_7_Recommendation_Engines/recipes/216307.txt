Ingredients:
Vegetable cooking spray
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 eggs
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell'sÂ® Condensed Tomato Soup
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1 3/4 cups sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 large carrots, finely shredded
1 cup golden raisins
1/2 cup walnuts, chopped
1 cup heavy cream
2 teaspoons grated orange peel
2 tablespoons orange-flavored liqueur

Directions:
Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 12-cup fluted tube cake pan with the cooking spray.
Mix the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in a large bowl.
Beat the eggs with a fork or wire whisk in another large bowl. Beat in the soup, oil, sugar and vanilla. Stir in the carrots.
Add the soup mixture to the flour mixture, stirring just to moisten. Stir in the raisins and walnuts. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake for 1 hour or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove the cake from the pan and cool completely on the wire rack.
Stir the cream, orange peel and liqueur in a medium bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on high speed until the mixture is stiff. Serve the whipped cream mixture with the cake.
