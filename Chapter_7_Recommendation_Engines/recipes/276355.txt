Put-the-Lime-in-the-Coconut Macaroons Recipe

Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package flaked coconut
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoon grated lime zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 egg whites
1 pinch salt
2 (4 ounce) packages white baking chocolate, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix coconut, sweetened condensed milk, lime juice, zest, and vanilla extract in a bowl until well combined.
Beat egg whites and salt with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Fold into the macaroon batter until incorporated. Drop tablespoonfuls of batter onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool cookies on a wire rack.
Melt white chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl for 1 minute. Stir; continue cooking until smooth and glossy, about 30 seconds more.
Dip the bottom of each cookie into the melted chocolate. Return to the parchment paper. Drizzle remaining melted chocolate over the top. Let stand until hardened, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Fresh lime zest and juice are added to coconut macaroons that are drizzled with white chocolate. Delightful! Store well covered at room temperature for 2 to 3 days, though they won't last that long!
