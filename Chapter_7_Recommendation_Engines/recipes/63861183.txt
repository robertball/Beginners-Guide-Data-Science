Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter (can use hard margarine)
1/2 cup all-purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon black pepper (more is better, I use freshly ground pepper)
4 cups pan drippings	 (or see options below the recipe)

Directions:
Drain the pan drippings for the roasted turkey through a fine strainer.
Let sit and then remove any fat from the top of the drippings.
Add in chicken broth or water to make 4 cups if necessary.
In a medium saucepan, melt margarine or butter.
Add in lots of black pepper.
Add in 1/2 cup flour plus 3 tablespoons; constantly whisk for about 3 minutes over low heat.
Slowly add in the 4 cups turkey broth/drippings; whisk constantly over medium-low heat until bubbly and thickened (about 3 minutes).
Use right away or keep warm over lowest heat setting, whisk again before serving.
**OPTIONS** to make this gravy using all chicken broth prepare as directed using 4 cups chicken broth and 1 tablespoon chicken bouillon ---- or you may add in chicken broth omitting bouillon powder to pan drippings to make up 4 cups.
