1 onion, chopped
2 pounds ground beef
4 green bell peppers, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:
Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; cook the onion in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the ground beef, bell peppers, tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and red pepper flakes to the saucepan; stir.
Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until the peppers are soft and the beef is tender, 4 to 6 hours.

Description: 
These are a classic Rhode Island treat. So delicious in a soft sub-roll with a little salt on top. My toddler loves to dip chips in it too. This can also be cooked in a slow cooker.
