Ingredients:
2 tablespoons buttery spread (such as Smart BalanceÂ®)
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 pounds onions, halved and thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
6 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
1/3 cup dry sherry
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon sherry vinegar
6 slices sourdough bread, toasted
2/3 cup shredded vegan cheese

Directions:
Heat buttery spread and oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, and salt. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring often. Reduce heat to very low and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are very tender and brown, 50 to 60 minutes.
Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 to 4 minutes. Blend in broth, sherry, and Dijon mustard. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Stir in sherry vinegar.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Ladle soup into 6 oven-proof bowls. Top each bowl with a slice of toast and some vegan cheese. Broil until cheesy is bubbly and golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve hot.
