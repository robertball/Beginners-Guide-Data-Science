Ingredients:
4 small zucchini, grated and squeezed dry
3 tablespoons coconut oil
1 tablespoon butter
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon chili powder, or more to taste
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
2 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Combine zucchini with coconut oil and butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add Parmesan cheese, chili powder, salt, and cayenne pepper. Stir until cheese melts.
Reduce heat to low and add eggs; stir quickly until fully mixed in. Increase heat back to medium and cook, stirring and flipping occasionally, until edges of the hash are lightly browned, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe makes an amazing side dish. Flavorful and high in healthy fat, it is a great complement to a meat or other high-protein main dish. If you like the flavors of zucchini and chili powder and miss the texture of mashed potatoes, try this one.
