Description: 
I have lightened up this traditional amish macaroni salad. Growing up, I loved to eat this refreshing salad at summer picnics. Unfortunately, the fat and calories made it a rare treat. This lightened up version is great. I've made it many times now and my guests never knew it was light version.Modified from: Amish Macaroni Salad
