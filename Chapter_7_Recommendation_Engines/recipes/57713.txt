Description: 
I have been told that this is the recipe from a (now defunct) restaurant chain the the San Francisco Bay Area. This creamed corn is in a thick and sweet sauce. This isn't a low-fat side-dish for calorie counters, but once in a while -- live it up! Very tasty with a holiday prime rib or turkey dinner. The recipe does call for M.S.G. (Accent) which I have never used. Frankly, it's delicious and very easy to make, even without the M.S.G.
