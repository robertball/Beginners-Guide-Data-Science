Description: 
A delicious and hearty chili con carne that is also easy to make. The small addition of brown sugar and touch of vinegar in combination with the chili powder gives the soup an enticing flavor trio. Add more or less to suit your individual tastes. Offer cornbread like my Mom did and you have a tasty, tempting meal.
