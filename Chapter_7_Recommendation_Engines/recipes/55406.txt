Ingredients:
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons milk
3/4 cup soft bread crumbs
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 cup beef broth
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1 medium green bell pepper, cut into strips

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the egg, milk, bread crumbs, salt and nutmeg. Add ground beef, and mix by hand until well blended. Shape into 4 patties. Place a skillet over medium heat. Add patties, and brown for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove from the skillet.
Add onion to the skillet, and cook until tender but not browned. Drain off excess fat. Whisk together beef broth and flour. Pour into the skillet, and stir in Worcestershire sauce and thyme. Cook over medium heat, stirring until thickened. Return patties to the skillet, and add green peppers. Cover, and simmer until burgers are cooked through, about 5 minutes.
