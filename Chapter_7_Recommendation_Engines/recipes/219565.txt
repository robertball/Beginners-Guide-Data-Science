Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) package Pepperidge Farm® Milano® cookies
1/2 cup chopped pecans
3 tablespoons butter
2 (4 ounce) bars white chocolate, coarsely chopped
1 3/4 cups milk

Refrigerate for 1 hour.
Heat the chocolate and 1/4 cup milk in a 1-quart heavy saucepan over low heat until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth, stirring often. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let cool to room temperature.
Combine the pudding mix and the remaining milk in a large bowl and stir according to the package directions. Stir in the chocolate mixture. Fold in1cup whipped topping. Spoon the mixture into the cookie crust. Refrigerate for 3 hours or until the filling is set.
Top the pie with the remaining whipped topping, the raspberries and shaved chocolate.
