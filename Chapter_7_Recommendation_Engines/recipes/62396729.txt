Ingredients:
4 Japanese eggplants (or 1-1.5 Volvo sized eggplants:)
1 Tbsp of finely minced garlic
2 onions
1 Tbsp Thai chili garlic paste (or chili bean sauce)
2 Tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp sugar
1.5 Tbsp oyster sauce
.125 C of water
.5 tsp sesame seed oil
pepper to taste
4 Tbs cooking oil (separated)
6 cups cooked rice (hot)

Directions:
Cut off the tops of the eggplants and cut into 1 inch cubes.
Slice the onions thin-ish.
Heat a wok or skillet. Pour in 2 Tbs cooking oil until it just starts to smoke. Pan-fry the eggplants just until the outside starts to brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
Add the rest of the cooking oil. Reheat. Over high heat, saute the onions for about 30 seconds. Add the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds. Add the rest of the ingredients and stir to blend well. Return the eggplants to the skillet or wok and toss to coat each piece with sauce. Lower the heat, cover and simmer for about 5 minutes or until eggplants are fully cooked and almost all of the liquid has been absorbed. Turn off the heat, Drizzle sesame seed oil over the cooked eggplants and give the dish a final stir. Serve hot over rice.
