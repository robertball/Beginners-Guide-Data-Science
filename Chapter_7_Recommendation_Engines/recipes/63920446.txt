Ingredients:
1 pound bag 15 bean mix
1 ham bone w/some meat still attached
6 cups chicken stock

2 bay leaves
2 tbsp liquid smoke
1 1/2 tbsp ground mustard powder
2 cups chopped ham
Salt & Pepper, to taste (if needed)

Directions:
Soak beans 24 hrs or more in water.  Beans will absorb a lot of water, so make sure beans are a few inches below water surface
After beans have soaked, drain completely
Bring chicken stock to a boil over high heat in a pot large enough to hold beans and eventually the ham bone
Add beans and reduce to simmer for 1 hr
After 1 hr bring chicken stock and beans back to a boil
Add ham bone, carrots, celery, onion, garlic and and bay leaves and reduce heat to low for 1 hr
After 1 hr, add liquid smoke mustard powder and chopped ham.
Stir and let simmer for 30 minutes
Remove ham bone
Season soup to taste with salt & pepper
