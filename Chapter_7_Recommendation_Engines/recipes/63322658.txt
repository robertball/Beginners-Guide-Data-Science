Description: 
This recipe came to me via a friend whose husband is Celiac. This has to be the most amazing recipe I have come across! Not only because of how good it tastes but because given the ingredients, you would never know there is no flour in the recipe! The texture is so amazingly like that of a normal cake! I have tweeked it from her recipe to make it something that my family can enjoy!
