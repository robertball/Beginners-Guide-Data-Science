Description: 
I came up with this recipe by taking measurement ideas from different recipes to come up with my own version. It was important for me to use ingredients I liked because I won't eat or drink it if I don't like the taste. I needed it to be just the right consistency and smoothness. I serve them in a 16 oz. double-walled cup. For a smoother taste, first grind up the rolled oats.
