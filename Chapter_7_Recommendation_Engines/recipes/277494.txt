Ingredients:
2 cups shredded cooked chicken, or more to taste
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend
1 (4 ounce) jar chopped pimento peppers
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
1 onion, finely chopped
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 jalapeno pepper, diced, or more to taste
10 frozen empanada discs, thawed
1 quart vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Mix chicken with Mexican cheese blend, pimentos, green chiles, onion, mayonnaise, and jalapeno.
Place about 1 tablespoon of the mixture into the center of each empanada disc. Run a wet finger around the rim of each disc. Fold into a half-moon shape and press edges together with a fork to seal well.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fry 1 to 2 empanadas at a time in the hot oil until brown, 1 to 2 minutes per batch.

A definite party pleaser, these easy chicken empanadas (pastelillos as Puerto Ricans call them) are so delicious! I promise that you will receive rave reviews. They are so tasty with the right amount of heat to them. I don't like spicy items and this recipe is perfection balancing flavor and spice. Enjoy!
