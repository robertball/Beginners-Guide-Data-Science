Description: 
This chocolately-hazelnut spread, blended with frozen banans, is a tasty and healthy indulgence of chocolate and fruit.  And with banans being loaded with potassium and vitamin B-6, this is the perfect mid-afternoon 'pick-me-up' to fuel your mind, elevate your mood, lower your blood pressure and stress levels, and suppress your appetite.  You can decrease or increase the amount of milk you use, depending on how thick you like your smoothies...and the ice is optional.  I like a VERY cold and thick shake-like drink.
