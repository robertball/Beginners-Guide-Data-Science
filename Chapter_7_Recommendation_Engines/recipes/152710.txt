Description: 
This was my Grandma's recipe for Sloppy Joes. It is very easy to make and uses items you probably already have in your pantry. Kids, as well as the adults, will love this All-American favorite. A slice of American cheese adds a nice touch.  For an extra kick, add your favorite hot sauce to taste.
