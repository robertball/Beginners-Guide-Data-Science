Ingredients:
1 1/2 heads boston lettuce torn in bite size pieces (I prefer the "live" kind)
1/2 jicama cut in 1 1/2 in. sticks
1 1/2 red peppers cut in 1 1/2 in. sticks
3 sweet tangerines in wedges (like California Cuties)
1/2 cup pepitas (raw pumpkin seeds)
2 diced avocados
2 TBSP fresh lime juice
1 cup Bottled cilantro lime dressing or find a recipe for such online

Directions:
1. Place Boston lettuce leaves in large bowl
2. Toss the jicama, red pepper, tangerine wedges and pepita together and place a top lettuce.
3. Dice avocados, sprinkle lime juice on avocados to keep them from browning.  Put avocados a top salad.
4. Serve the cilantro lime dressing in a smaller side shaker to add as the salad is served.

Description: 
Inspired by chef Traci des Jardins and my upbringing in California, this is a fresh twist to the norm.  The colors from the produce give it the Christmas look.
