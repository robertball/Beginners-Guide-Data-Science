Ingredients:
1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In a saucepan, bring milk and butter to a boil. Add flour all at once and stir until a smooth ball forms. Remove from the heat; let stand for 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the cheese, onion, garlic powder and pepper; beat until mixture is smooth and shiny. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls 2 in. apart onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite biscuit recipes because it's fast, simple and doesn't require any special ingredients. I sometimes freeze some baked puffs, then reheat in foil.
