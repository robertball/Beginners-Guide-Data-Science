Ingredients:
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
2 zucchini, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 yellow squash, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 eggplant, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 onion, finely diced
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning, or to taste
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste
1 teaspoon tomato paste (optional)
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Pour diced tomatoes into a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-low heat; add zucchini, yellow squash, eggplant, and onion; stir once. Sprinkle salt over vegetables. Bring mixture to a boil and simmer until the vegetables start to cook down, 10 to 15 minutes; stir in Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and black pepper to taste.
Cook uncovered over medium-high heat until the sauce has reduced and vegetables are tender, about 1 hour, stirring often. (Or if preferred, cover pan and cook over low heat 2 to 3 hours.) Stir in tomato paste and adjust seasonings. Drizzle with olive oil just before serving.
