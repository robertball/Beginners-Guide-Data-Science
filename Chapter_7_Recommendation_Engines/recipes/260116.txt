Ingredients:
1 (13.8 ounce) can prepared pizza dough
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 (8 ounce) package sliced pepperoni
1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese
cooking spray
1 cup pizza sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Unroll pizza dough onto the baking sheet and stretch it slightly. Cover evenly with mozzarella cheese. Scatter pepperoni over the cheese. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.
Roll up the dough starting from the shortest end. Center the roll on the baking sheet. Spray the outside with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Slice and serve with pizza sauce.

Description: 
This quick and easy crowd-pleaser is a recipe my 3 young boys (all under 5 years old) can help me prepare. They love sprinkling the cheese and pepperoni and watching me roll it all up.
