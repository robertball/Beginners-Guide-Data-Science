Ingredients:
1 cup butter or margarine, softened, divided
1 1/2 cups packed dark brown sugar
3 eggs
4 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate
*2 cups pureed cooked beets, ((I use one can of shoestring beets drained & one can of sliced beets drained))  (see notes at bottom about the beets)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
powdered sugar,  if desired to sprinkle on top after baked and cooled

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, with beaters cream 3/4 cup butter and brown sugar. Add eggs; mix well.
Melt chocolate with remaining butter; stir until smooth. Cool slightly.
Blend chocolate mixture, beets and vanilla into the creamed mixture (mixture will appear separated).
Combine flour, baking soda and salt; add to the creamed mixture and mix well (do-not over beat, hand mixing well will work a this point).
Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan. Bake at 375 degrees for 45-55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
Cool in pan 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack. Cool completely.
Before serving, dust with confectioners' sugar-optional.
