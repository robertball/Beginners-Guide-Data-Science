Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1/4 cup instant cappuccino coffee powder
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 egg whites
1 1/4 cups water
1 cup shortening
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
4 tablespoons milk
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon instant coffee powder
1 cup hot water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch cake pans.
In a large bowl, combine cake mix and 1/4 cup cappuccino. Pour in 1 1/4 cups water, 3 egg whites and 1 tablespoon oil. Mix well, then pour batter into prepared pans.
Bake in preheated oven according to package directions until a toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean. Cool in pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks and cool completely.
To make the Mocha Frosting:  In a large bowl, combine shortening with vanilla. Blend in half of the confectioners' sugar. Blend in 2 tablespoons milk. Repeat with remaining confectioners' sugar and 2 tablespoons milk. Mix in approximately half of the cocoa.
Dissolve the 1 tablespoon instant coffee into 1 cup of hot water. While still warm, pour two tablespoons of the coffee into the frosting mixture. Mix in remaining cocoa. Add coffee mixture, a tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is achieved. Fill and frost cake.
