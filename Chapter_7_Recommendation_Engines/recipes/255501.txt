1 1/2 cups croutons
1 cup thinly sliced almonds

Write names onto sticky notes, such as "graveyard weeds" for lettuce, "troll hair" for Cheddar cheese, "gravestones" for croutons, "dragon claws" for almonds, "headless horseman slices" for carrots, "witch eyes" for olives, and "black lagoon slime" for dressing. Label bowls with sticky notes.
