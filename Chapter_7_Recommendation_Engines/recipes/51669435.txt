Ingredients:
1/2 cup alfredo sauce
1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan cheese
1 (12 inch) pizza crust
2 cups cooked chicken breast strips, marinated in Italian dressing
1 cup sliced mushrooms
fresh basil leaves
1/2 cup shredded mozarella cheese
1 cup toasted chashews

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Mix additional pepper and the parmesan cheese into the sauce. Spread alfredo sauce over the pizza crust.  Arrange chicken pieces and mushrooms over the sauce, add fresh basil,  then sprinkle with cheese.  I toast raw cashews in a little olive oil and sprinkle lightly with salt.  Add to top of pizza.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is melted and lightly browned at the edges.  For best results cook on a pizza stone.
