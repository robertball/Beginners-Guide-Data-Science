Ingredients:
5 slices bacon
12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut in bite size pieces
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped bell pepper (any color)
1 garlic clove, minced
4 cups chicken broth
1 1/2 cups frozen whole kernel corn
1 (14.75 ounce) can cream-style corn
1/4 cup Argo® Corn Starch
1 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon Spice Islands® Fine Grind Black Pepper
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Cook bacon in a large pot over medium heat until browned and crisp; drain on paper towels and crumble when cool enough to handle. Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon drippings.
Saute chicken, onion, bell pepper and garlic in hot bacon drippings; cook 3 to 5 minutes until chicken is no longer pink and onion begins to soften. Add chicken broth, frozen corn and cream-style corn. Combine corn starch with milk and stir into soup.
Heat to boiling over medium heat, stirring constantly; reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes. Add salt, pepper and cheese; stir until cheese is melted.
Ladle soup into bowls; sprinkle bacon over individual servings.
