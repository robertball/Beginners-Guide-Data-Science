Ingredients:
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple rings in juice, cubed and juice reserved
1 pound kielbasa (Polish) sausage, cut into quarter moon pieces
2 medium onions, cut into wedges and sliced
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2/3 cup rice vinegar
2/3 cup brown sugar
6 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons soy sauce

Directions:
Place pineapple, kielbasa sausage, and onions into the bottom of a slow cooker.
Combine water and cornstarch in a bowl and whisk until smooth.
Whisk together reserved pineapple juice, rice vinegar, brown sugar, ketchup, and soy sauce in a saucepan. Bring mixture to a simmer; pour in cornstarch slurry. Whisk until well combined and thickened slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and pour over the ingredients in the slow cooker. Mix well to coat.
Cover and cook on High until kielbasa is cooked through, and mixture has thickened and reduced, 3 to 4 hours.
