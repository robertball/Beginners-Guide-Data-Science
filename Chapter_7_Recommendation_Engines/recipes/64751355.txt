Description: 
We just got an outdoor skillet grill and it is fantastic!  You can cook everything at once! I’ve been experimenting with fish and this one has been a winner.  I make smashed potatoes and a side of asparagus right along side of this. We like a well done fish just grill to your desired temp.
