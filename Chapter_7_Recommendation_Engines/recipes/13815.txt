Description: 
This is an Austrian classic. 'Knodel' (you pronounce the k) means 'dumpling' in German.  My mother used to make this a lot when I was small because it's a good way to use up stale bread.  It remains one of my fondest childhood taste memories.  The quantities are approximate, because this is one of those recipes that isn't written down, so I had to follow her around the kitchen the last time she made it.  Be sure the bread is stale.  If it isn't, dry it in the oven after cutting it into cubes.
