Ingredients:
Salt
1 1/2 pounds green beans, trimmed and cut into thirds
1 tablespoon EVOO
1/2 pound button mushrooms, sliced
4 tablespoons butter
2 large shallots, chopped
3 to 4 cloves garlic, chopped
Pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
4 tablespoons flour
1/2 cup dry white wine
2 cups chicken stock/poaching liquid from Poached Chicken, recipe follows
1 cup cream or half-and-half
1 wheel Boursin (5.4 ounces) or other garlic-and-herb cheese
1 1/2 pounds cooked pulled or sliced Poached Chicken, recipe follows
2 to 3 tablespoons fresh chopped tarragon or 1 tablespoon dried tarragon
Fried Onions, homemade or store-bought

Directions:
For the casserole: Heat a few inches of water to a low boil, add salt and the green beans and cook 3 to 4 minutes to tender-crisp, drain.
Heat the EVOO in a large, deep skillet over medium to medium-high heat, add the mushrooms and lightly brown them, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the butter, shallots and garlic, season with salt, pepper and thyme, and stir 2 to 3 minutes more. Add the flour, stir a minute, add the wine, stir in the stock and thicken. Add the cream and Boursin and reduce the heat to simmer. Add the green beans and chicken and thicken a bit; stir in the tarragon.
Transfer into a casserole dish and cool. Cover and refrigerate for a make-ahead meal.
To reheat: Bring back to room temp. Bake at 375 degrees F until bubbly, 50 to 60 minutes; top with homemade or store-bought Fried Onions.
