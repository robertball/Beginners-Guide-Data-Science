Ingredients:
For the topping
4 oz Cream Cheese softened
4 oz Grated Sharp Cheddar Cheese
1 Small can ortega fire roasted chiles chopped
1 Small can chopped jalepenos (optional)
3/4 teaspoon Garlic Powder
1/4 teaspoon Black Pepper
1.5 LB. 80% lean ground beef
Seasoning Salt
Black Pepper
1 Tablespoon butter
1 Tablespoon oil
Thinley sliced onion
Hamburger Buns, toasted

Directions:
Mix all the topping ingredients together and set aside.
Form the meat into six patties. Season them liberally with the salt and pepper. Heat a skillet over medium heat and add butter and oil. Cook the patties about 3-4 minutes until a nice crust forms. Flip the burgers and place some of the cheese topping on each burger. Cover the pan and cook for an additional 4 minutes or to your liking. Place a burger on each of the toasted buns and put some onion slices on top. Serve with french fries to wipe up the yummy sauce that falls on the plate.
