Description: 
I came up with this recipe in an attempt to use up some pears before they went bad. I really like what I came up with mainly because it's not super complicated and there aren't any other competing flavors with the pears. The other ingredients are delicate and allow the pears to stand out. With all that being said, please note that these measurements are approximations... Enjoy!
