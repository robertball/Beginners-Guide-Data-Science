Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 onion, chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
8 fresh mushrooms, sliced
2 teaspoons curry powder
1 pound beef top sirloin, thinly sliced
2 cubes beef bouillon
1 1/2 cups boiling water
1 (6 ounce) can mushroom stems and pieces, drained
1/4 cup dried shiitake mushrooms
1 1/4 cups heavy cream
1 (8 ounce) package uncooked egg noodles

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and fresh mushrooms; cook until the onions are translucent. Stir in curry powder until well blended. Place the meat strips in the skillet, and fry until evenly browned.
Dissolve the bouillon cubes in the boiling water, then stir into the skillet. Add the mushroom stems and pieces and dried shiitake mushrooms. Let the mixture simmer over medium heat until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain.
Reduce the heat under the skillet to low, and pour in the cream, stirring until the sauce is an even color. Simmer for about 5 minutes, but do not boil. Serve over noodles.

Description: 
Tasty beef and mushroom stroganoff.  This was my favorite recipe as a kid, my Mum came up with it from the stuff that was left in the cupboard! I've since modified the ingredients to add my own personal touch.
