Ingredients:
Peach Cake is pushing 25,000 shares! I have made it twice and it is great! NO EGGS! Peach cake:
1 large can sliced peaches, drained and mashed (I used 2 regular cans since that is all I had at the time) You could also use fresh peaches.
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
Drain the peaches and empty into a large bowl. I just used my hands to mash them. Add flour, sugar and soda and mix well. Spray a 9 x 13 inch cake pan and pour in batter. Bake in a preheated 350F degree oven for 35 minutes. See recipe below for icing.
ICING:
3/4 cup sugar
3/4 regular sized can of evaporated milk
1 stick butter or margarine
1 cup coconut (I used a little more than a cup of coconut)
1 cup nuts
Boil everything but the nuts on top of the stove until thickens, remove from heat, stir in nuts and spread on cooled cake.
