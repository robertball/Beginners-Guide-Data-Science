Ingredients:
6 Yukon Gold potatoes
1 small sweet onion, diced
3 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
1/2 cup diced celery
1/4 cup chopped sweet pickles
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup sweet pickle juice
1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer potatoes to a large bowl.
Mash potatoes with a potato masher. Stir in onion, eggs, celery, pickles, salt, and black pepper. Mix mayonnaise, pickle juice, and mustard in a separate bowl; pour over potatoes and mix well. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.
