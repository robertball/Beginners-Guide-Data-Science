Ingredients:
1 butternut squash, halved and seeded
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste
2 teaspoons dried thyme
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup diced yellow onion
1 large clove garlic, diced
3 tablespoons plain yogurt
1 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons milk, or to taste
1/4 cup grated Romano cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place butternut squash halves on a baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil over squash. Season with thyme, salt, and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven, turning once, until squash feels soft when pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Cool until easily handled.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Scoop flesh of the squash into a food processor; add onion-garlic mixture, yogurt, garam masala, and nutmeg. Blend until smooth, adding milk to loosen slightly. Pulse in Romano cheese.
Refrigerate squash filling until set, about 30 minutes.
