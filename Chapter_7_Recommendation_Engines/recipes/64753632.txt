Ingredients:
1 kg Plums, chopped About 10 -12 medium
250 g Sugar About 1 C
1/2 Tsp Fine Sea Salt
1/2 Tsp  Dry Ginger Powder
1/2 Tsp Medium Hot Chili Powder To Taste
1/8 tsp Ground Cinnamon
1/2 Tsp Ground cloves Can add up to 1 Tsp
2 Tbsp vinegar

Directions:
Remove  the  seeds  from the  plums  and  chop into small  pieces.
In  a thick bottomed  stock pot mix  the chopped  fruit with  sugar. Cook over  medium  heat  stirring  occasionally.  Cook for  about  8  to 10 minutes  until the  mix  turns to  liquid.
Add salt , chili powder ,  ginger powder , cinnamon and  cloves to the mix  . Over  low  heat  cook until  the mix  reaches  the  desired  consistency.  Stir  often  to prevent  the  chutney from   sticking  to the bottom of the pan.  Taste and add more  spices  if needed.
When the chutney  thickens  place a drop of it into a bowl with cold water. If it sets and does not spread the chutney is ready , otherwise cook a little more and test again.
Add  the vinegar, mix in  and  cook over low  heat for  5  more  minutes. Stir  frequently to prevent  burning.
Bottle  into  clean   sterilized bottles   and  process in  a  water/pressure  Canner  if planning to store for  long ,  otherwise  cool  completely and  refrigerate.
Use within the  next  few  weeks (3 to 4 ).
