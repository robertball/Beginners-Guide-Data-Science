Ingredients:
2 cups elbow macaroni
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch ground nutmeg
2 1/4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
2 cups finely chopped broccoli
1 cup pumpkin puree
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in flour until smooth. Stir in milk and bring to a simmer. Continue to cook and stir until thickened, about 1 minute more. Remove from heat. Stir in mustard, pepper, and nutmeg.
Add 2 cups Cheddar cheese, broccoli, and pumpkin puree, stirring until cheese is completely melted. Drain macaroni and stir in until well coated. Pour macaroni and cheese into a baking dish. Top with remaining 1/4 cup cheese and bread crumbs.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.
