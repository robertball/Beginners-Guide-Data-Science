Ingredients:
1/4 c. salt pork or bacon, diced
1 onion, finely chopped
2 T. butter
1/4 c. flour
2 c. chicken stock OR bottled clam juice
2 c. milk
2 russet potatoes, peeled and diced
2 t. dried thyme
Salt and Pepper (to taste)
2 - 10oz cans chopped clams and their juice
1/2 c. heavy cream or half and half (optional)

Directions:
Using a large pot over medium flame, add pork or bacon and saute until it renders fat and becomes crispy. Add onion and saute until onion is translucent. Stir in the butter and flour and let cook for about 1 minute, until a good roux forms.
Whisk in the stock or clam juice and milk, beating out any and all lumps. Add the potatoes, thyme, salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender and cooked through.
Stir in clams and their juice and simmer another 2-3 minutes, enough to heat through. Stir in the optional cream, adjust seasonings, and serve hot.
