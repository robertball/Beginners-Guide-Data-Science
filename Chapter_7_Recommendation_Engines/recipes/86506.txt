2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons McCormick® Grill Mates® Montreal Steak Seasoning

Directions:
Mix all ingredients, except steak, in a large, self-closing plastic bag or glass bowl.
Add steak, turning to coat well. Marinate in refrigerator 30 minutes, or longer for extra flavor.
Remove steak from marinade and grill over medium-high heat 6-8 minutes per side for medium rare (145 degrees F) to medium (160 degrees F) doneness. Baste with remaining marinade halfway through cooking, if desired. Discard any leftover marinade.
