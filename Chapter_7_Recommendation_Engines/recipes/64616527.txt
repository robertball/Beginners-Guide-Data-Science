Ingredients:
6 ounces cherry-flavored Jello (not sugar-free)
1 cup boiling water
10 ounces Coca-Cola
1 can (14.5 to 16 ounces) red tart pitted cherries in water
1 can (8 ounces) crushed pineapple
1 cup chopped pecans (raw or lightly toasted)

Directions:
Place the Jello in a large bowl. Pour the boiling water over it and stir until dissolved. Stir in the Coca-Cola. Refrigerate mixture until partially firm, about 30 minutes. NOTE: check and stir every 3 to 5 minutes. You want it a thickened but not set.
Place the cherries and juice in a food processor fitted with a knife blade or in a blender. Pulse or blend a few times to lightly chop the cherries.
Once the Jello mixture has thickened, stir in the chopped cherries and it's juice, pineapple and it's juice, and pecans. Pour into a Jello/gelatin mold. Refrigerate until set or overnight. Remove salad from the mold by inverting onto a serving platter. Serve cold.
