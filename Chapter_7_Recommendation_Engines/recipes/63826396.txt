Ingredients:
8 cups of popped popcorn
1/4 C of Butter
3 T of light corn syrup (honey is a good substitute)
1/2 C of sugar (brown sugar is a good substitute)
Food coloring

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.  Line a cookie sheet with foil and spray with non-stick spray.  Place popped popcorn in an extra large mixing bowl.
Place butter and corn syrup in a sauce pan on medium heat.  Stir until butter is melted.  Add sugar and your desired amount of food coloring and stir until well mixed.
Increase heat and bring to a boil.  Then reduce heat to a simmer.  Continue simmering for 5 minutes.
After the sugar mixture is done simmering, immediately pour over popcorn in the mixing bowl.  Be careful, it will be extremely hot!  Mix right away with one or 2 large spoons.  Keep stirring until everything gets well coated.  Spread the mixture as flat and even as possible onto the prepared cookie sheet.
Place in the oven and bake for about 10 to 15 minutes.  Mix once during baking.
Remove the pan from the oven and let cool to room temp.  Then break the popcorn into pieces and enjoy!

Description: 
I made this popcorn in a rainbow of shades and everyone loved it.  It ends up tasting kind of like caramel corn.  I always have tons of people begging for the recipe!
