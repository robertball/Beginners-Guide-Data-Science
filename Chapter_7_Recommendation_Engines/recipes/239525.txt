Description: 
This is my ultimate comfort food, thanks to years of enjoying it as a child. While the flavors aren't sophisticated, they're satisfying. This basic dish is virtually fail-proof and is a great way to use up leftover pasta as a side or can be a quick meal in a pinch. In my family, it was served with ketchup, but feel free to jazz it up with your favorite vegetables for a nutritious variation.
