Ingredients:
2 C. all purpose flour
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. white sugar
1 packet, quick rise yeast
1 C. warm water (about 115 to 120 degrees, NO higher!)
3 Tbl. olive oil
More olive oil for bowl

Directions:
In a small bowl, add the warm water to the yeast.  Allow to sit for about three minutes and add 1/2 tsp. white sugar and the olive oil.  Set aside while you measure the flour and salt into a medium bowl.  Mix the dry ingredients.  Add the yeast mixture all at once, stirring with a wooden spoon until a loose ball forms. Add more flour if the dough is too wet to form ball. Place dough on floured surface. Set the kitchen timer for 5 minutes and allow the dough to rest.  DO NOT skip this step!  After the timing rings, knead the dough until it is elastic--about five minutes.  You may need to add a little more flour during the kneading process, if the dough is too sticky.  Form a ball.  Coat a medium bowl with enough olive oil to coat.  Roll the ball of dough in the oil. Cover the dough with a warm, damp tea towel.  Allow to raise until double in a warm place, about 30 to 40 minutes.  Turn the proofed dough onto a floured surface. Use your hands or a rolling pin to form the dough into a shell and gently place onto a baking sheet.  Top with your favorite toppings.  Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes until crust is browned and the topping are bubbly.

Allowing the dough to rest after mixing and again after kneading creates a delicious pizza dough.
