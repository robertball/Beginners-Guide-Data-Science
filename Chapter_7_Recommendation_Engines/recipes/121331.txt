Description: 
'While the fish is marinating, I toss together a big bowl of Italian Spinach Salad,' Judy relates. 'Prepared Italian dressing makes this twist on traditional wilted spinach salad simple ti fix. I usually have a hard-cooked egg ready in the refrigerator, and the dressing just takes seconds to heat.'
