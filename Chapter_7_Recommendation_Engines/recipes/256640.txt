Ingredients:
Â½ cup oil and vinegar dressing, divided
4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pint grape tomatoes, halved
1 bunch fresh basil, thinly sliced
1 (8 ounce) package fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Pour 1/4 cup dressing into a small bowl.
Arrange chicken breasts evenly in the center of a grill pan. Brush both sides of the chicken breasts with dressing; season with salt and pepper.
Pour remaining 1/4 cup dressing into a mixing bowl. Add tomatoes and basil. Toss to coat evenly with the dressing.
Spread the tomato mixture evenly around chicken in a single layer.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove pan from oven and top chicken with fresh mozzarella; return pan to oven.
Continue baking until mozzarella cheese is golden brown and bubbly and chicken is fully cooked, about 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
