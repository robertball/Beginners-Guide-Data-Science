Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 small onion, chopped
1 cup cubed fully cooked ham
2 small potatoes, chopped
2 small tomatoes, chopped
3 green onions, chopped
3 tablespoons minced garlic
3 large eggs, beaten
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, ham, potatoes, tomatoes, green onions, and garlic in the hot oil until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer vegetable mixture to a plate.
Pour eggs into the same skillet and season with salt and pepper. Tilt skillet until eggs cover the entire bottom; cook over low heat until eggs are set in the middle, about 5 minutes. Spoon about 1/4 cup vegetable mixture onto 1 side of the omelet; sprinkle half the Cheddar cheese over vegetable mixture. Fold the other half of omelet over the filling. Top omelet with remaining Cheddar cheese.
