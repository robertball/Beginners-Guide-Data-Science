Ingredients:
4 cups heavy cream (not ultra-pasteurized)

Directions:






Submitter: 
Chef John
Description: 
While the name doesn't exactly make the mouth water, the flavor and texture of clotted cream are the stuff of legends. The long, slow cooking sort of toasts the cream, which imparts a sweet, nuttiness that I don't think I've tasted in any other preparation. This is just delicious spread on warm biscuits or scones and topped with homemade jam.
