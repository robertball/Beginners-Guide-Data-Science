Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1/3 cup canned pumpkin
1 egg
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Mix in canned pumpkin, egg, cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, and ground ginger until well combined.
Stir flour and baking powder together in a small bowl. Add flour mixture to pumpkin mixture in thirds, mixing dough well between each addition.
Spoon cookie dough into a cookie press fitted with a pumpkin-shaped die and press dough onto a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until edges just begin to brown, about 8 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
