Description: 
This is meant for people who are on a strict no-sugar or added sweetener diet. People who are used to eating sweet cakes usually don’t like this cake.  It is a chocolate cake sweetened with dates. It is perfect for a first birthday smash cake, but if you do that make sure that your child has been introduced to each ingredient before the day to prevent allergic reactions. This recipe doesn’t do well with added nuts, they get soggy.
