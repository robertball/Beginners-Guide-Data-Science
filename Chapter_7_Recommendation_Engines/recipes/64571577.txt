Ingredients:
1 cup Pace Picante medium salsa
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 lb pork tenderloin (or pork shoulder)

Directions:
Place pork tenderloin in slow cooker. Mix brown sugar and salsa in a medium bowl. Pour over tenderloin and cook on low for 7 hours. Shred pork with forks and place back into slow cooker juice for approx 15 min.
For best results, I recommend using a medium size slow cooker 2.5-3 quart size.
For just as easy cleanup---use a slow cooker liner.
