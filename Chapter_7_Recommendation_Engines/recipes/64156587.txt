toppings: Dehydrated Unsweetened Coconut Flakes, raisins, flax seed, dark chocolate chips, cinnamon, and/or anything else you can think of.  I added even more tupelo honey:) Feel free to lather on apple butter, strawberry preserves, or even more peanut butter.  Ever heard of carrot jam?  It's very tasty with this snack, too!
