Ingredients:
1 cup water, or as desired
2/3 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons honey
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 cantaloupe - peeled, seeded, and diced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint, or to taste
3/4 cup champagne
10 leaves mint, for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Cook and stir water, sugar, honey, and lemon juice together in a saucepan over medium heat until sugar is dissolved and mixture is clear, about 10 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium-low, add cantaloupe and chopped mint, and cook until liquid reduces by half, 5 to 10 minutes.
Transfer cantaloupe mixture to a wide, shallow dish and refrigerate to cool completely.
Blend the cantaloupe mixture until smooth. Stir champagne into the pureed mixture until smooth. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve onto a rimmed baking sheet.
Freeze strained mixture until completely firm. Scrape frozen puree from sheet and blend in a blender until smooth. Pour onto the sheet and freeze again until firm. Repeat process until the mixture is smooth and creamy, like a sorbet. Garnish with mint leaves.
