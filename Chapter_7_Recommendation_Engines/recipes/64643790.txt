Ingredients:
1/2c butter, softened
1/4c sour cream
1t vanilla
4c sifted confec sugar

Directions:
Cream the butter & sour cream.  Add vanilla.  Add a little salt, if using unsalted butter.  Gradually add sugar.  Whip till light.This makes quite a bit of frosting - how much depends on how long it's whipped.  If you double the recipe & divide in thirds, you'll have about 2c frosting per container.  It freezes beautifully.  :)
