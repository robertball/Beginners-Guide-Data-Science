2 (16 ounce) cans garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained and rinsed
6 tablespoons olive oil

2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons tahini (optional)
2 eggs

1 teaspoon ground cumin
6 slices turkey bacon, sliced into small strips (optional)

Place garbanzo beans, 6 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, water, and tahini in a blender. Puree until thick and smooth. Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl.
Stir eggs into hummus mixture until completely mixed.
Gently stir bread crumbs, carrots, onion, garlic salt, lemon pepper, onion powder, cumin, and turkey bacon into hummus mixture until thoroughly combined.

Description: 
I wanted hummus for dinner but the hubby is a hearty eater so I figured meet in the middle and make falafels! Well, I got a little creative :) Great with tzaziki sauce or you can get all crazy and use jalapeno jelly like me.
