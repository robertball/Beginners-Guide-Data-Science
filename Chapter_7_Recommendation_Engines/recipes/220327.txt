Ingredients:
1 tablespoon whipped butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 pinch garlic salt
1 pinch kosher salt
1/4 cup low-fat milk
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry

Directions:
Melt whipped butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; stir flour, garlic salt, and kosher salt into the melted butter until smooth.
Whisk in low-fat milk, bring to a simmer, and reduce heat to low. Simmer sauce until thickened, whisking constantly, about 1 minute.
Stir spinach into the sauce and heat until warmed through, 1 to 2 more minutes.

Description: 
This is a quick and flavorful way to prepare spinach during a busy weeknight. It goes great with a homestyle meal or when making something lite and healthy. Regular butter or whole milk can be substituted. I use whipped butter and low-fat milk to reduce saturated fat. Fresh spinach may be used, although I recommend frozen, but will need to be boiled until tender, finely chopped, and dried very well. Double the sauce ingredients to make a slightly creamy texture. Recipe makes 2 regular or 3 small servings. Hope you like it.
