Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
3 cloves garlic, chopped
2 packets Swanson® Flavor Boost™ Concentrated Beef Broth
4 (8 inch) flour tortillas, warmed
4 romaine lettuce leaves
4 tomato slices, cut in half
4 red onion slices, cut in half

Directions:
Cook the beef and garlic in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat.
Stir the concentrated broth in the skillet and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling.
Place 1 leaf lettuce onto each tortilla. Spoon about 1/2 cup beef mixture down the center of each tortilla. Top each with 2 half slices tomato and 2 half slices onion. Wrap the tortillas around the filling.
