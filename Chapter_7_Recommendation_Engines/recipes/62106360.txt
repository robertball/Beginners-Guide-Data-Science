12 pickled hard boiled eggs
approx. 1/4 c low fat mayo
1/4 c diced pickled beets
1 1/2 tsp horseradish

2-3 large lettuce leaves, cleaned or sprigs of watercress

Directions:
Slice each egg in half.  Remove yolks and place in small mixing bowl.
Using a fork, smash the yolks until well crumbled.
Add mayo and mix.  Adjust amount of mayo to your desire.
Add diced beets, horseradish and salt. Mix well.
Place eggs, cut side up, on a serving plate.  Place a small piece of lettuce or watercress on each egg and press down gently with finger so that greens sit in the yolk recess.
Pipe the yolk mixture on top of the greens to fill eggs.
Serve.

Description: 
I took a chance and created this with the pickled eggs I made after Easter.  They have a pretty spring look compared to plain deviled eggs and are simple and good.
