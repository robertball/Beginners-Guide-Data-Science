Ingredients:
Falafel:
1 1/4 cups water
1 (6 ounce) package dry falafel mix
2 cups vegetable oil for frying
salt to taste
Cucumber Dressing:
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup diced cucumber
1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley
1/8 teaspoon salt
Salad:
1 (10 ounce) bag mixed salad greens
2 tomatoes, diced
1 avocado, diced
8 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
3 hard-boiled eggs, diced
3/4 cup feta cheese

Directions:
Mix water and falafel mix together in a bowl; let stand for 10 minutes. Form mixture into 12 patties, about 1/2-inch thick.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Fry falafel patties, working in batches, in the hot oil until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer cooked falafel to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon; season with salt. Cool falafel to room temperature; break into pieces.
Whisk sour cream, milk, cucumber, parsley, and 1/8 teaspoon salt together in a bowl until dressing is smooth and creamy; refrigerate.
Spread greens onto serving plates. Arrange tomatoes, avocado, bacon, eggs, feta cheese, and falafel in rows over the greens. Drizzle dressing over each salad.

Description: 
This is my take on an American-Mediterranean fusion. Well, we were also low in the protein area that night, so this was created. Considering the dish is a salad, it is still plenty filling and full of fresh flavors. The time spent making it is all in the prep work, then just simply assemble.
