1 (18.25 ounce) package brownie mix with syrup pouch (for 13x9-inch pan)
1/4 cup HERSHEY®'S Cocoa Powder
1/4 cup finely crushed peppermint candies
2 tablespoons HERSHEY'S® Chocolate Syrup (from syrup pouch)

Directions:
Stir together brownie mix, cocoa and crushed peppermint candies in large bowl. Add contents of syrup pouch, water, egg and oil, beating until well blended. Refrigerate about 1 hour or until firm enough to roll.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Line cookie sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease. Remove wrappers from candies.
Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Roll balls in powdered sugar and place on prepared cookie sheet.
Bake 9 to 11 minutes or until set. (Some peppermint may melt out along edges of cookies. After removing from oven, immediately use edge of knife or spatula to push melted peppermint back to edges of cookie.) Cool 2 minutes. Press candy piece into center of each cookie. Slide parchment paper and cookies to wire rack or remove cookies from cookie sheet to wire rack. Cool completely.
