Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups whole milk
4 egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
6 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust
Topping:
1 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine sugar, cornstarch, gelatin, and salt in a medium saucepan. Stir in milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, 7 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low.
Beat eggs yolks and vanilla extract in a bowl. Slowly whisk in a small amount of the hot milk mixture. Slowly pour mixture back into the pan, whisking constantly. Cook and stir over low heat until custard is very thick, about 2 minutes. Do not let boil. Remove from heat.
Stir in chocolate until melted. Pour into the prepared graham cracker crust and chill for 2 hours.
Combine heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Beat using an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form. Pipe onto the chilled pie.

Description: 
This pie is demanded from my family for every holiday. I found the recipe online back in the late 90's. To many disappointed family members' dismay, I temporarily lost my handwritten copy after moving, I couldn't find online, and I wasn't able to make it for one holiday. I'm adding it here so I will always have it. I hope you enjoy it as much as my family does.
