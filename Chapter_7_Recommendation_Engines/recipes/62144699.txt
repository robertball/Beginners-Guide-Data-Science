1/2 cup COLD butter
1 package active dry yeast (1/4 ounce)
1/4 cup warm water
1/2 cup warm milk
1 egg, beaten

1 cup sugar

1 egg
1/2 cup chopped almonds
Glaze:
1 cup confectioners sugar
4 teaspoons water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons sliced almonds
5 maraschino cherries, cut in half

Directions:
Combine the flour, sugar and salt; cut in butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs.
Dissolve yeast in warm water; stir into flour mixture with warm milk and egg.
Beat until smooth (dough will be very soft).
Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Divide dough in half; refrigerate one half.
On a well-floured surface, roll remaining half into a 15-in. x 6-in. rectangle.
Combine filling ingredients in food processor until smooth.
Spread half of the filling down center of rectangle in a 2-inch wide strip.
Fold sides of dough over filling; overlapping 1-1/2-in.; pinch edges to seal.
Shape into an oval; pinch ends together.
Place seam side down on a lightly greased cookie pan.
Cover and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes.
Bake at 375Â° for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.
Cool for 15 minutes.
Combine confectioners' sugar, water and vanilla.
Drizzle over the Danish.
Sprinkle with nuts and cherry halves.
Do not bake together.
Oven temperatures vary, and dough will release filling out of seams.
