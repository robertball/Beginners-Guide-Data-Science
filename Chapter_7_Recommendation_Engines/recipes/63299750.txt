Ingredients:
- Either a box of brownie mix, or a homemade batch of brownies
- Whipped cream (either homemade, or canned). For an easy homemade recipe I just use a cup of heavy whipping cream, 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/4 tsp of vanilla.
- Peanut butter sauce (melt one 10 ounce package of peanut butter chips with 1/4 cup of milk, 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1/4 tsp of vanilla over low heat until combined, let cool). This time I double this recipe due to a request last time that it needed more sauce!
- Reese's peanut butter cups, chopped
- Kit Kat bars, chopped (last time I used Reese's Pieces)
- 2 packages of instant vanilla pudding made according to their directions.

Directions:
- First Layer - broken up brownies.
- Second Layer - vanilla pudding
- Third Layer - peanut butter sauce
Fourth Layer - Reese's peanut butter cups & Kit Kat bars
Fifth Layer - whipped cream.
Continue building your trifle with these layers until you've run out of ingredients or room.
