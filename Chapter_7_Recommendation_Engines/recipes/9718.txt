Ingredients:
1 pound almond paste
1 1/4 cups white sugar
4 egg whites
4 cups pine nuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease cookie sheets.
Break almond paste into pieces and mix together with sugar, using your hands to crumble paste.  In a separate bowl, separate the eggs and beat the whites into soft peaks.  Slowly add to almond paste mixture and mix until just blended.
Place pine nuts into bowl.  Roll dough into  1-inch balls and press into nuts.  Coat evenly and place on cookie sheets about 1 inch apart.
Bake 15 to 17 minutes, until lightly golden.   Let cool on cookie sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to racks.
