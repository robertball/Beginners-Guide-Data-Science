Ingredients:
2  eggs, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons melted butter or margarine
½ cup matzo meal
1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
½ teaspoon salt
1 dash white pepper
1 tablespoon water
6 cups chicken broth
1 medium carrot, cut into 2 inch julienne strips

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix eggs with the melted butter or margarine.  Stir in matzo meal, parsley, salt, pepper, and water to form a soft dough.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Bring chicken broth and carrots to a boil in a large pot.  Reduce heat to a simmer.  Shape the matzo dough into 12 balls.  (For easier shaping, dip hands in cold water from time to time).  Drop the matzo balls into the simmering broth.  Cover and cook for 30 to 40 minutes.
