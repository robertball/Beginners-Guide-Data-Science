Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground turkey breast
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon pink curing salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground dried sage

Directions:
Combine ground turkey, water, liquid smoke, kosher salt, pink salt, pepper, onion powder, paprika, garlic powder, and sage in a large bowl. Mix until evenly combined. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
Form as many sticks as you can fit on the racks of a dehydrator using a jerky gun.
Set the dehydrator to 155 degrees F (68 degrees C).
Cook for 2 1/2 hours. Unplug the dehydrator and remove the lid. Let jerky sit for 1 hour for final drying.

Description: 
It had been years since I watched National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation so when it came on the other night, I popped a bowl of popcorn and sat down to watch it. I had forgotten how funny the turkey scene was and it inspired me to create this turkey jerky recipe. Consume within 3 days or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 30 days.
