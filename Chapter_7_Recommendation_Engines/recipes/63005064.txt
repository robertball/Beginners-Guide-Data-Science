Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) cans peaches in heavy syrup
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1/2 cup butter
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Empty peaches into the bottom of one 9x13 inch pan. Cover with the dry cake mix and press down firmly. Cut butter into small pieces and place on top of cake mix. (Hint: use cold butter from the refrigerator and use your grater and grate the butter.) Sprinkle top with cinnamon.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 minutes.
You can use the recipe for a apple crisp topping, then you wouldn't cover the cake with butter.
Streusel topping:
1 C. butter
1 C. sugar
1 C. brown sugar
1 C. flour
1 C. Old Fashioned Oatmeal (dry)
Combine and mix until mixture resembles little peas.
Sprinkle on top of cake and bake.
