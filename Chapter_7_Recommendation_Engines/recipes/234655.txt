Ingredients:
1 large head cabbage, shredded
1 green bell pepper, finely chopped
1 small small onion, finely chopped
2 carrots, shredded
2 cups boiling water
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup water
3/4 cup cider vinegar
2 teaspoons celery seed

Directions:
Combine cabbage, green bell pepper, onion, and carrots in a large bowl. Mix boiling water and salt together in a bowl and pour over cabbage mixture. Set aside for salt to draw out extra water from vegetables, about 1 hour. Drain well.
Mix sugar, 1 cup water, cider vinegar, and celery seed in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Remove saucepan from heat and cool completely.
Pour cooled sugar-vinegar mixture over drained cabbage mixture in a large bowl and toss until slaw is well mixed. Spoon slaw into resealable plastic bags and freeze.

Description: 
My husband kept talking about 'Freezer Slaw' that his mom made and I couldn't find a recipe for it and she couldn't find hers. Luckily, his aunt still had it! This is a great make-ahead slaw that stays crisp! I shred the cabbage and other vegetables in the food processor.
