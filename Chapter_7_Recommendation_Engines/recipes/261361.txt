Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups chicken stock
1 cup parboiled brown rice
1/4 cup orzo
3 tablespoons margarine
1 tablespoon tomato paste
2 teaspoons adobo seasoning

Directions:
Mix chicken stock, brown rice, orzo, and margarine in a saucepan using a fork. Bring to a boil. Mix with a fork again and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until stock is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Mix in tomato paste and adobo seasoning until rice is a consistent reddish color.

Description: 
This is the ultimate evolution of my rice pilaf. I had some extra tomato paste around that needed using. Let's face it, practically no one uses the entire can at once! This easy dish pairs well with chicken.
