1 (5 ounce) goat cheese, softened
1/2 cup basil pesto
3/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes, softened and chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Open the pita bread halves up into pockets. Spread goat cheese onto one side of the inside of each pita pocket. Spread a layer of pesto over the goat cheese. Sprinkle with sun-dried tomatoes. Place pita halves onto a baking sheet.
Bake for 3 to 5 minutes in the preheated oven, just until the filling is warm, and the bread is lightly toasted.
