Ingredients:
4 Burrito sized tortillas
1 lb cooked chicken
1 Large avocado, sliced or diced
1 large tomato diced
1 cup Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
1/2-1/3 C salsa verde
1/4 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons cilantro, chopped (opt)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Place cheese distributed among the 4 tortillas, add cooked chicken. ( I like it shredded, but you can cube it. The chicken can be cold as it may be from left overs.) Add avocado slices/cubes then roll like a burrito. place side by side on cookie sheet, cook for 5-10 min until the edges start to golden, allowing time for the cheese to melt and chicken to warm up. (I like mine a little more crisp)
Smother in Salsa verde and cheese on top, place in oven until cheese is melted.
Put diced tomatoes on top, a dollop of sour cream, and garnish with cilantro.
Enjoy!
