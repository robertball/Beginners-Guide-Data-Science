Ingredients:
1/2 of a 3oz pkg strawberry gelatin
2 TBS cornstarch
1 c sugar
1 qt small fresh strawberries, washed, stemmed, halved, and patted dry
1 baked pie crust
1 container of whipped topping

Directions:
Whisk together gelatin, cornstarch, sugar, and 1 cup water together in saucepan. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat and cool several hours until mixture reaches room temperature. DO NOT refrigerate! When cooled, fold in strawberries. Pour into baked pie crust. (I prefer a crust with just a touch more salt for that sweet and salty flavor!) Refrigerate 3 hours or until set. Top with whipped topping. Keep remaining pie covered and refrigerated.

Description: 
A perfect use for those small garden strawberries! My mother-in-law makes this pie every year for my husband's birthday 'cake' in May. Once you try it, one slice won't be enough!
