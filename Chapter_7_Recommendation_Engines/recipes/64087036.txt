Ingredients:
8 large tart apples (about 4 1/2 lbs), peeled, cored, and sliced
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 tbsp all-purpose flour
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1 box carrot cake mix
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 eggs
3 cups powdered sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla
1/2 to 3/4 cup buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  Spray 13x9 inch baking dish with cooking spray.
In a large bowl, toss apples, brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon until coated.  Pour into the baking dish.
In the same bowl, stir together cake mix, butter, and eggs until blended.  Spread over apples.
Bake 40 to 45 minutes until filling is bubbly and topping is golden brown.
In a medium bowl, mix powdered sugar, vanilla, and enough buttermilk to make glaze thin enough to dribble.  Drizzle glaze over individual servings of warm cobbler.
