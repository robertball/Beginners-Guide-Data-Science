Description: 
When my husband and I moved from Oklahoma to Rio Grande Valley in Texas years ago, I gained an appreciation for a variety of fresh vegetables. This tasty recipe is a simple way to dress up one of our favorites--asparagus!                                      --Billie Moss, El Sobrante, California
