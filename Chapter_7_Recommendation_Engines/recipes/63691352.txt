Ingredients:
1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 egg yolk
1 C. Sugar, divided
24 slices white sandwich bread, crusts removed
1 Tbsp. cinnamon
3 Tbsp. butter, melted

Directions:
In a medium bowl, beat cream cheese, egg yolk, and 1/4 cup sugar until smooth; set aside.
Roll out each bread slice with a rolling pin.  Spread cheese mixture over bread, distributing evenly.  Roll up each slice jellyroll-style and place seam-side down on a baking sheet.
In a shallow dish, combine remaining 3/4 cup sugar and the cinnamon.  Brush butter over rollups then roll them in the cinnamon-sugar mixture, until completely coated.  Repeat with remaining rollups, placing them on the baking sheet after coating.
Cover and freeze for at least 2 hours.
Just before serving, preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake roll ups 10-12 min. or until golden.
