Ingredients:
Filling:
3 large eggs
1 15 oz can pumpkin puree (or 2 cups fresh pumpkin puree)
1 cup full fat coconut milk
1 tsp vanilla extract
¾ cup light brown sugar
½ tsp sea salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 ½ tsp pumpkin pie spice

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat the eggs.
Whisk in the pumpkin, coconut milk and vanilla extract until combined.
Add sugar, salt, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice and mix until completely combined.
Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F.
Lightly grease a pie plate and set aside.
Roll out your pie dough on a well-floured surface (pastry cloth) to fit the size of your pie plate.
Carefully transfer the dough to the pie plate and shape the crust how you want it to look.
Pour the filling into the unbaked pie crust and cover the crust with a pastry shield
Bake for 15 minutes at 425 degrees F.
Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and continue to bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a knife inserted comes out clean.  It may be a bit wobbly still, but it will firm-up as it cools.
Allow the pie to cool on a wire rack for 2 hours (Be patient! This is important).  Serve or refrigerate until ready to serve.
