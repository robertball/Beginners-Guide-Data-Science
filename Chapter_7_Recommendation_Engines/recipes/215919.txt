Ingredients:
1 egg, beaten
2 ounces dry bread crumbs
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
16 ounces Classico® Tomato and Basil Sauce
2 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking sheet.
Pour egg into a small shallow bowl. Place bread crumbs in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken into egg, then into the bread crumbs. Place coated chicken on the prepared baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until no longer pink and juices run clear.
Pour 1/2 of the pasta sauce into a 7x11 inch baking dish. Place chicken over sauce, and cover with remaining sauce. Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses on top and return to the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
