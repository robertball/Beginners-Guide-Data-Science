Description: 
I love the convenience of the slow cooker but I do not care for the sodium content by using cream of mushroom soup etc. Sadly many of today's recipes call for the can of soup. I have tried many recipes over the years and adjusted them and this is the result. Please do use the wine, most of the alcohol dissipates with the cooking.
