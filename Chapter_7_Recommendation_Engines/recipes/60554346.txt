1 onion, chopped
2 (15 ounce) can black beans
1 (12 ounce) can tomato sauce

1 (10 ounce) cans diced fire roasted tomatoes with green chilies, undrained
1/2 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning
6-8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1 cup chicken broth (from concentrate)

Directions:
Place the onion,  black beans, tomato sauce, beer, chicken broth, and diced tomatoes in a slow cooker. Add taco seasoning, and stir to blend. Lay chicken thighs on top of the mixture, pressing down slightly until just covered by the other ingredients. Set slow cooker for low heat, cover, and cook for 5 hours.
Remove chicken thighs from the soup, and allow to cool long enough to be handled. Stir the shredded chicken back into the soup, and continue cooking for 2 hours. Serve topped with shredded Cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and crushed tortilla chips, if desired.
