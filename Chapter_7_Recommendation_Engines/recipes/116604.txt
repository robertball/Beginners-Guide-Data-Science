Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
3/4 cup sugar
3 eggs
2 teaspoons peppermint extract
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup crushed peppermint candy
FROSTING:
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons shortening
1/2 cup crushed peppermint candy

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in extract. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir in peppermint candy. Gradually add to creamed mixture, beating until blended (dough will be stiff).
Divide dough in half. On an ungreased baking sheet, roll each portion into a 12-in. x 2-1/2-in. rectangle. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Carefully remove to wire racks; cool for 15 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; cut diagonally with a sharp knife into 1/2-in. slices. Place cut side down on ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until firm. Remove to wire racks to cool.
In a microwave safe bowl, melt chocolate chips and shortening; stir until smooth. Dip one end of each cookie in chocolate; roll in candy. Place on waxed paper until set. Store in an airtight container.
