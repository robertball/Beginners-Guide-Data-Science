Ingredients:
1 pound chopped fresh broccoli
1 1/2 cups cubed, cooked chicken meat
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of broccoli soup
1/3 cup milk
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon butter, melted
2 tablespoons dried bread crumbs
Per previous reviews, I added dashes of lemon pepper seasoning, season salt and a dash of garlic powder while coooking the chicken. I also added a little more broccoli and a little more bread crumbs than what the recipe calls for. I'm glad I didn't give up on this one, it was worth it. Next time, I'm going to have to double the recipe so that everyone gets their fill. This recipe is worth trying...with some minor modifications. SOOO cheesy and broccoli! YUM

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place the broccoli in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook 5 minutes, or until tender. Drain.
Place the cooked broccoli in a 9 inch pie plate. Top with the chicken. In a bowl, mix the soup and milk, and pour over the chicken. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Mix the melted butter with the bread crumbs, and sprinkle over the cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly brown.
