Ingredients:
6 eggs
1 1/2 Cups of sugar
2 sticks of butter (1 Cup)
Vanilla (I don’t measure it, ever)
1 tsp Lemon zest (or 1/4 tsp of lemon juice)
3 1/2 Cups of flour
4 tsp of baking powder
Pizzelle iron

Directions:
Beat the eggs until light.
Add sugar, butter, lemon and vanilla.
Mix well.
Add flour 1/2 cup at a time.
Add baking powder.
Mix well but don’t over mix.
Heat pizzelle iron.
Spray iron with Pam on top and bottom. I usually have to spray only for the first 3 cookies. After that they seem to not stick anymore.
Using two spoons drop a walnut size amount onto iron.
Press in iron for about 1-2 minutes.
Cool.

Description: 
Another mandatory cookie for Christmas! Billy loves to help me make these and Theo likes to eat the fat edges. I don’t like too much lemon in these so sometimes I leave it out or put in a 1/4 tsp of lemon juice.  Also, I have left out the baking powder once and could not tell the difference! I’m terrible at following recipes. A double batch may be necessary.
