Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 pinch ground cardamom
2 cups finely grated coconut
6 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Sift flour, confectioners' sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl. Blend in butter, vanilla extract, allspice, and cardamom with your hands until dough comes together. Wrap and chill dough for 1 hour.
Pinch off pieces of dough and roll into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Pour coconut onto a shallow plate. Roll cookie balls in coconut and place 1 inch apart on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 20 minutes. Let cool.
Combine chocolate, vegetable oil, and almond extract in a small, deep microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until melted and smooth, 1 to 3 minutes.
Dip half of each cookie diagonally into the melted chocolate and shake off excess. Return to the baking sheets and refrigerate until chocolate sets, about 10 minutes.
