Ingredients:
1 cup butter flavored shortening
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon Vanilla extract
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon(or to desired flavor)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening and 1 1/2 cups sugar. Stir in the eggs. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended.
In a separate bowl, stir together the 3/4 cup of sugar, and the cinnamon. Roll dough into walnut sized balls, then roll the balls in the cinnamon-sugar. Place them onto an unprepared cookie sheet, two inches apart.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Edges should be slightly brown. Remove from sheets to cool on wire racks.
