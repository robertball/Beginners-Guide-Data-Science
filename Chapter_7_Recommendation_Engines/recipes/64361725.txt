Ingredients:
* 4 cups mussels
* 2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 2 Tablespoons chopped yellow onion
* 2 Tablespoons chopped garlic
* 2 Tablespoons Pernod or other anise/licorice flavored liqueur.
* 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh basil
* 1 lemon, juiced
Lemon Butter Sauce:
* 1/4 cup real butter
* 2 Tablespoons minced yellow onion
* 2 Tablespoons minced garlic
* 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
* 2 Tablespoons dry white wine
* Kosher salt and white pepper to taste

Directions:
1) To make the mussels; soak the mussels in cold water for 8 minutes. Scrub with a stiff brush. Remove beard with a sharp knife. Rinse mussels again in cold water.
2) Heat oil in a skillet; add mussels. Cover and cook until shells begin to open, about 2 minutes. Add onion and garlic. Toss to mix; cook, covered for 1 minute. Add Pernod, basil, lemon juice, and lemon butter sauce. Cook for 45 seconds and discard any mussels that did not open. Serve in a deep bowl.
3) For lemon butter sauce: Melt butter over low heat. Remove from heat and let sit until the milk solids settle to the bottom. Skim the clear butter from the top. Discard sediment. Saut√© onion and garlic in 2 Tablespoons of the certified butter until transparent. Stir in lemon juice, white wine, season salt and pepper. Simmer 2-3 minutes to reduce liquid. Remove from heat and swirl in cold butter until sauce is smooth.
