Ingredients:
1 cup rice flour
3 large eggs
1/2 cup almond milk
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 pinch salt
1 cup warm water
3 1/2 tablespoons coconut oil, divided

Directions:
Whisk rice flour, eggs, almond milk, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl until well mixed.
Combine water and 3 tablespoons coconut oil in a separate bowl until well blended. Whisk into the flour mixture. Pour batter through a sieve into a clean bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Heat remaining coconut oil in a griddle over medium heat. Ladle a portion of the batter into the pan and spread out. Cook until set, about 30 seconds per side. Repeat with the remaining batter.
