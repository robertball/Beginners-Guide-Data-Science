Ingredients:
3 cups salted cocktail peanuts
1/4 cup honey or brown sugar barbecue sauce (may take a bit more to completely coat nuts)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degress.
Stir the sauce and peanuts together until well coated. Spread on a large cookie sheet. Bake at 300 for 15 - 19 minutes. Stir every now and then to prevent sticking and sort of turn them over a bit.
