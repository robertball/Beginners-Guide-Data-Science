Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) unbaked deep dish pie crust
3/4 cup white sugar (use 1/2 cup instead)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (heaping)
1/2 teaspoon salt (use 1/4 instead)
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger (heaping)
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves (heaping)
2 eggs
1 (15 ounce) can LIBBY'S® 100% Pure Pumpkin (or any pure pumpkin)
1 (12 fluid ounce) can NESTLE® CARNATION®(use fat free instead) Evaporated Milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. ( pre-bake the pie shell for 5-10 minutes @400 degrees first)
Combine sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger and cloves in small bowl. Beat eggs lightly in large bowl. Stir in pumpkin and sugar-spice mixture. Gradually stir in evaporated milk. Pour into pie shell.
Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F.; bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until knife inserted near center comes out clean. Cool on wire rack for 2 hours. Serve immediately or refrigerate. (Do not freeze as this will cause the crust to separate from the filling.)
