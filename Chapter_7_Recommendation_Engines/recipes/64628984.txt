Ingredients:
1 large marshmallow
2 chocolate chip cookies
1 tbsp chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as NutellaÂ®)
1 tsp chocolate sprinkles

Directions:
Spread half of the chocolate-hazelnut spread on the underside of each chocolate chip cookie. Sprinkle each evenly with the chocolate sprinkles. Set cookies aside.
Heat the marshmallow over an open flame until it begins to brown and melt. Watch it carefully to ensure it doesn't burn.
Sandwich the marshmallow between the spread on the two cookies.
Allow the marshmallow to briefly cool before eating.

Description: 
S'mores are a way of life for my family. We are always looking for a new way to enjoy them while camping. This variation is one of our favorites. If you have a sweet tooth for chocolate and an average s'mores just won't cut it, this one definitely will!
