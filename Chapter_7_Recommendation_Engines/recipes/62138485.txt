Ingredients:
4 Cups cooked, coarsely chopped chicken
1/2 Cup Mango Chutney, such as Major Grey's
1/2 Cup slivered almonds, lightly toasted
3 Tbs. butter
3 Tbs. olive oil
2 Onions, finely chopped
3 ribs of celery, finely chopped
2 Tbs. sweet or milk Curry Powder, preferable Madras
1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
1 Cup Golden raisins
1 (28 ounce) can Chopped Tomatoes with juice
8 Cups Chicken Stock, preferably home made...
2 Cups cooked Wild Rice
2 Golden Delicious Apples, cored and chopped
1/4 Cup chopped fresh Parsley
2 Tbs. Lemon Juice
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the cooked, chopped chicken, mango chutney, and slivered almonds. Mix well and set aside.
In a 4 1/2 quart dutch oven or soup pot, over medium-high heat, melt butter and olive oil until hot. Add the onions, garlic, and celery. Cook, stirring often, until the onions begin to wilt, about 5 minutes.
Add the raisins and the tomatoes with their juice. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring often to prevent sticking. Add the curry powder and cayenne pepper.
Finally, add the chicken stock, wild rice, apples, parsley, and lemon juice. Stir in the chicken and chutney mixture.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for about 5 minutes, until the apples are crisp-tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Enjoy!
