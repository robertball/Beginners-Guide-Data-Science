Ingredients:
1 package (14 ounces) sweetened shredded coconut (5 1/3)
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup chilled butter, unsalted and cut into small pieces
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/2 cups flour

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Set aside 2 loosely packed cups of coconut in a pie plate. Place the remaining coconut in a food processor along with sugar, salt, and baking powder; process until finely ground. Add butter, and process just until no lumps remain. Add egg and vanilla; process just till smooth. Add flour; pulse until a crumbly dough begins to form, scraping sides of bowl as needed (do not overmix).
2. Scoop level tablespoons of dough into reserved coconut. (I use a spring style cookie scoop for ease and uniformity.) Roll in coconut to form balls, coating with the coconut.
3. Arrange balls, about two inches apart on parchment lined cookie sheets. Bake until lightly golden, 23 to 25 minutes. Cool for two minutes on cookie sheet. Transfer cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely.
4. Store in an airtight container.
