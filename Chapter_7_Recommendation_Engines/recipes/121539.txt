Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/4 cup cold butter or margarine
MUFFINS:
1 1/2 cups butter or margarine, softened
3 cups sugar
6 eggs
1 1/2 cups sour cream
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons grated lemon peel
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
GLAZE:
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1/3 cup lemon juice

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour and sugar. Cut in butter until crumbly; set aside. For muffins, cream butter and sugar in a mixing bowl. Beat in eggs, sour cream, lemon juice and peel. Combine flour, baking soda and salt; stir into creamed mixture just until moistened. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Sprinkle with reserved crumb topping. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until muffins test done. Cool in pans for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks. Combine glaze ingredients; drizzle over muffins.
