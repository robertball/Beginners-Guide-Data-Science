Description: 
Living in San Francisco, I've had more than my fair share of crab, prepared in more ways than I can remember. I've never enjoyed it more than in this Singapore-style chili crabs recipe. Just be sure to have lots of napkins around. My friends in Singapore tell me they serve this with at least twice the amount of sauce, and a type of fried roll to soak up the goodness with. So, if you want to rock the chili crab like a Singaporean, then you should probably double the sauce ingredients!
