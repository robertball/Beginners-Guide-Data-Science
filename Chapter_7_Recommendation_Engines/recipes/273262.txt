Ingredients:
4 cups basmati rice
8 cups water
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon chili garlic sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons peanut oil, divided
1 pound pork shoulder, cut into 1/4-inch cubes
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups chopped red bell pepper
1 cup frozen shelled edamame
2/3 cup thinly sliced green onions

Directions:
Bring water and rice to a boil in a large pot. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, and hoisin in a bowl.
Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon peanut oil; swirl to coat. Add pork in a single layer; cook, without stirring, for 2 minutes. Stir-fry until pork is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 4 minutes. Transfer pork to soy sauce mixture; toss to coat.
Pour egg into the pan; cook, without stirring, until set, about 45 seconds. Cut egg into bite-sized pieces.
Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add bell pepper, edamame, and 1/2 cup green onions; stir-fry 1 minute. Add cooked rice; stir-fry 2 minutes. Add pork and soy sauce mixture; cook, stirring constantly, until heated through, about 1 minute. Top rice with egg and remaining green onions.
