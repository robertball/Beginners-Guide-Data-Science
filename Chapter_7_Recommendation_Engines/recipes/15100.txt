Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 medium slice yellow onion, diced
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 (15 ounce) cans mixed vegetables
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of celery soup
1/2 cup ketchup
1 (10 ounce) package refrigerated biscuit dough

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Crumble ground chuck into a large skillet and saute over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add onion, and saute until meat is no longer pink and onion is beginning to brown. Drain grease.
In a large bowl, mix together cream cheese, vegetables, cream of celery soup, and ketchup. Add hamburger and stir until ingredients are thoroughly combined. Spread mixture evenly into a large casserole dish. Place biscuit dough on top, allowing room for biscuits to spread without touching.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, until biscuits are browned and fluffy.
