Sweet Chewy Granola Bars Recipe

Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups old fashioned rolled oats
1/2 cup whole almonds, coarsely chopped
1/3 cup honey
1/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup dried cranberries, coarsely chopped
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons mini (or chopped) chocolate chips

Directions:
Line bottom and sides of a 8-inch or 9-inch square pan with aluminum foil.
Combine oats & nuts in medium to large bowl.
Combine butter, honey, brown sugar, vanilla extract and the salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally until butter melts and the sugar completely dissolves.
Pour butter mixture in to bowl with oats and almonds. Mix well. Let cool about 3-5 minutes then add cranberries and a 1/4 cup of the mini chocolate chips. Stir to combine. The chocolate chips will melt a little and help to hold the bars together.
Transfer oat mixture to lined pan then use a spatula or damp finger tips to firmly press the mixture into the pan. Press hard here, this way the bars will stay together once cooled and cut. (I use a large metal spatula and press firmly on each quarter of the pan several times.)
Scatter remaining 2 tablespoons of chocolate chips over pressed granola mixture then use a rubber spatula or finger tips to gently press them into the top. Cover then refrigerate at least 2 hours (better yet, overnight).
Remove block of granola mixture from pan then peel away aluminum foil. Cut into bars.
