Ingredients:
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 1/2 cups whole milk
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brewed espresso, chilled
1/4 cup chocolate syrup
3/4 cup cocoa roast almonds, chopped
4 ounces dark chocolate, chopped

Directions:
Mix heavy cream, whole milk, sugar, espresso, and chocolate syrup in a bowl until sugar is dissolved. Refrigerate until chilled.
Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches "soft-serve" consistency. Stir in almonds and dark chocolate. Serve soft ice cream or transfer ice cream to a one- or two-quart lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight.
