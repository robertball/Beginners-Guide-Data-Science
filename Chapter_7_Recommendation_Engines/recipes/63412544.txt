Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 stalk celery (chopped)
1 onion (chopped)
6 medium to large russett potatoes (peeled and cubed)
4 cups whole milk
Pepper (to taste)
16 ounces processed cheese food (cubed small)

Directions:
In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat.
Once melted, add chopped onion and celery.  Heat until soft and clear (about 3-5 minutes)
Increase heat to high, add potatoes and just enough water to cover.  Boil for about 20 minutes, or until potatoes a really breaking down (from a regular boil to a think boil).  Stir occasionally.
Once the potatoes are breaking down, reduce heat, add pepper to taste, and add 4 cups milk while stirring.  Heat back up, but don't boil.
Add the cubed cheese a handful at a time while stirring to prevent clumps.
Once the cheese is completely melted and the soup is hot, serve with a good, hard bread.
