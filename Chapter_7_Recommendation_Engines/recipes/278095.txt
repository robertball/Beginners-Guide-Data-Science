Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (19 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
2 (28 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
2 cups water
1 (12 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1/4 cup dry red lentils
1/4 cup uncooked quinoa
1/4 cup chili powder
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper
3 teaspoons cornstarch
3 tablespoons water, or more as needed

Directions:
Heat oil in a medium Dutch oven over medium heat; stir in onion, green and red bell peppers, and garlic. Cook and stir until vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes.
Mash 1/2 of the black beans in a small bowl. Transfer to the Dutch oven with the remaining whole black beans. Add diced tomatoes, 2 cups water, corn, lentils, quinoa, chili powder, brown sugar, paprika, salt, turmeric, oregano, cumin, red pepper flakes, and black pepper; stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 2 hours.
Make a slurry by mixing cornstarch with 3 tablespoons water until completely dissolved, adding more water if necessary. Stir slurry into the chili and simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes. Mash chili with a potato masher to desired consistency.
