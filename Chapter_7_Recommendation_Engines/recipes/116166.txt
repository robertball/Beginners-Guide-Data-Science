Ingredients:
FILLING:
1/2 cup sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 cup whipping cream
1 (9 inch) pastry shell, baked
GLAZE:
1/2 cup crushed strawberries
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 1/2 cups quartered strawberries
1 1/2 cups fresh raspberries

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch, flour and salt; gradually stir in milk until smooth. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until thickened and bubbly. Reduce heat; cook and stir 2 minutes more. REmove from the heat and stir a small amount into egg; return all to the saucepan. Cook and stir until almost bubbly. Reduce heat; cook and stir 1-2 minutes more (do not boil). Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla and almond extract if desired. Cool to room temperature. Whip cream; fold into filling. Pour into pastry shell. Chill for at least 2 hours. About 2 hours before serving, prepare glaze. Combine crushed strawberries and water in a saucepan; cook for 2 minutes. Combine sugar and cornstarch; gradually stir into the berries. Cook until thickened and clear, stirring constantly. Strain. Cool for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, arrange quartered strawberries and raspberries over filling; pour glaze evenly over berries. Refrigerate for 1 hours.

I found this recipe in a very old cookbook and made it for a family gathering. The pie was gone in no time. It's a perfect summertime treat.
