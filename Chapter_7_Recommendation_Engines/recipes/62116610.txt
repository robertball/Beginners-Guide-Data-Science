Ingredients:
4 Cups mixed olives (with pits)
4 - 5 sprigs of fresh rosemary
5-6 whole garlic cloves, peeled
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
2 tangerines or nectarines
3 slices, sweet onion
2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
3 tsp balsamic or red wine vinegar
Fennel seeds (approx 1 tsp)

Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 250 degrees F
Mix olives, pepper flakes, vinegar and garlic in mixing bowl.
Carefully peel citrus to get just the zest & reserve strips.
Squeeze juice from one tangerine/nectarine into the mixing bowl with the olives.
Add the citrus zest strips and toss with the olives.
Take a piece of heavy duty foil large enough to make a foil pocket for the olive mixture, and pour the mixture onto the foil.  Place the onion slices (separated)on top of the olives, and then the rosemary sprigs.  Drizzle the olive oil on top. Sprinkle the fennel over the olives.
Fold & seal the foil packet completely.
Place the packet in a baking pan, and place in oven to slow roast.  Serve warm.
