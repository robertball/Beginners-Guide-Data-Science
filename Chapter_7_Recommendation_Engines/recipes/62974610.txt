Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) fillets cod
1 cup creamy Italian-style salad dressing
1/4 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese or colby jack
1 cup crushed potato chips, plain or sour cream flavored

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (260 degrees C). Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. Or can use non stick foil to line.
In a medium bowl, marinate the fish fillets in the salad dressing for a few minutes.
Toss the shredded cheese and crushed chips together. Place the marinated fish fillets in the prepared baking dish and top with the cheese/chip mixture. Discard the leftover marinade.
Bake, uncovered in the preheated oven for 13 minutes or until the fish can be flaked with a fork.
