Ingredients:
1/2 cup matzo meal
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup almond meal
1/4 cup chocolate chips, or to taste (optional)
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon vanilla sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Stir matzo meal, milk, ground almonds, chocolate chips, eggs, vanilla sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until the edges start to dry and are browned dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
I was looking for a good Passover pancake recipe and failed to find one I liked the look of. Through some trial and error (and some suggestions from my mother-in-law), I came up with this one, and it was a big hit. If you don't put in chocolate chips it tastes nice with some jam.
