Description: 
Tried this at a party one day and even though I begged I never got the complete recipe. So after much trial and error, this is my take on it.. If you like things sweet & spicy you will love this!
I think it's even better than the original! 
I've made it a million times now as a appetizer at parties and I've always been asked for the recipe.
