Ingredients:
Ingredients:
•	6 large Red potatoes
•	1 large onion
•	3 tablespoons butter or canola oil for frying
•	2 cups sour cream
•	1 1/2 teaspoon salt
•	1/2 teaspoon paprika
•	1/4 teaspoon black pepper
•	2 hard-boiled eggs, shelled and sliced
•	3 oz. Cream cheese
•	1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
•	1 Tbls Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a large pot, heat water until boiling. Add potatoes in their skin. Return to boil. Reduce heat, cover, and cook until a knife can be easily inserted (approximately 25-30 minutes). Do not cook the potatoes until they are too soft to slice nicely. Drain. Set aside to cool slightly.
Chop onion. In a frying pan, heat butter. Saute onion until translucent. Set aside to cool slightly.
Preheat oven to 350° Fahrenheit (180° Celsius). Grease a 9X13 inch baking dish.
Peel and slice potatoes into 1/4 inch slices. In a bowl, mix onion, sour cream, salt, paprika and pepper. Gently combine the potatoes with the sour cream mixture.
Place half the potato mixture in baking dish. Layer hard-boiled eggs slices on top of the potatoes and then cream cheese on top the eggs. Cover with the rest of the potatoes. Combine bread crumbs and parmesan cheese and sprinkle on top.
Bake, uncovered, at 350° Fahrenheit (180° Celsius) for 45 minutes.
