Ingredients:
1/2 white onion
1 lb. ground sausage (breakfast sausage)
1 can ro-tel diced tomato
2 8oz. blocks of cream cheese

Directions:
Chop the onion finely and sautee until transluscent in a large skillet. Add sausage and brown. Pour off grease. Add the can of tomato and the cream cheese. Stir until the cheese is melted and smooth. At this point I transfer the mixture to a crock pot and turn it on low to keep it smooth and warm. It will firm up quickly. Serve it with tortilla chips and enjoy!

Description: 
This recipe takes the traditional quick cheese dip and turns it on its head! Cream cheese is substituted for processed cheese giving it a rich and hearty texture. My parents loved this recipe so much they now eat it for dinner rather than a snack.
