Ingredients:
2 cups canola or other vegetable oil
8 (6 inch) corn tortillas, quartered
Salt, to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a 10-inch skillet to 370 degrees. Drop triangles in hot oil, 8 at a time. Fry, turning chips once or twice, until they stop sizzling and turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove with tongs or a slotted spoon and drain on a wire rack set over a shallow pan. Sprinkle with salt immediately.

Description: 
Not only is this relatively inexpensive, but it's also easy to make! And, these chips can be cooled and stored in an airtight container for two days.
