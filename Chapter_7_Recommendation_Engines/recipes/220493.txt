1 tablespoon prepared mustard
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:

Description: 
This is an excellent version of sloppy joes. We used to fix this at the concessions at the ballpark, and it was the first to go every time. Everyone always asks for the recipe. Serve on hamburger buns or sandwich rolls.
