Ingredients:
10 pounds red potatoes
2 pounds bacon
8 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
4 cups processed cheese sauce
2 cups sour cream
2 cups mayonnaise
2 large onions, finely chopped
1 tablespoon minced chives

Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, cool, and cut into cubes.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-quart baking dish.
Combine potatoes and bacon in a large bowl. Mix Cheddar cheese, cheese sauce, sour cream, mayonnaise, onions, chives, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Stir cheese mixture into potatoes; transfer to baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.
