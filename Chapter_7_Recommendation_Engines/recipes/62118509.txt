Pumpkin Fudge Recipe

Ingredients:
3 c sugar
3/4 c butter
1 (5 oz) can evaporated milk
1/2 c pumpkin puree (fresh, prepared or canned)
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice
12 oz white chocolate chips or chopped, good quality white chocolate
7 oz marshmallow creme
1 c chopped pecans (or substitute walnuts), optional
1 tsp real vanilla extract

Directions:
Line a 9-inch by 13-inch baking pan with foil and butter generously.
In a large, heavy saucepan (clip a candy thermometer onto the pan at the start, if using - recommended), combine the first 5 ingredients. Stirring constantly, bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and continue cooking for about 25 minutes, or until the mixture reaches the soft-ball stage (234 degrees on a candy thermometer).
Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the white chocolate, continuing until it's all melted. Add marshmallow creme, nuts (if using) and vanilla. Blend the mixture thoroughly to incorporate all ingredients evenly, and then spread the fudge evenly in the prepared pan.
Allow fudge to cool, then lift out foil and cut into squares. Wrap tightly and store in the refrigerator.
