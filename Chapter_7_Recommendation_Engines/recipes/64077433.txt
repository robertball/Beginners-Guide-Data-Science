Ingredients:
2 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoon cold water
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup lite soy sauce
1/2 cup cider vinegar
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 skinless chicken breasts

Directions:
In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the cornstarch, cold water, sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, ginger and ground black pepper. Let simmer, stirring frequently, until sauce thickens and bubbles.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Place chicken pieces in a foil-lined, lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Brush chicken with the sauce. Turn pieces over, and brush again.
Bake covered in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Turn pieces over, and bake uncovered for another 15 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run clear. Brush with sauce every 10 minutes during cooking.
