Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
salt to taste
¾ cup bread crumbs
½ cup Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon dried basil
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon crushed garlic

Directions:
Season chicken breasts with a little salt.
Mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, basil, and pepper in a bowl.
Heat olive oil and garlic in a skillet over medium heat until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
Dip chicken breasts in the garlic oil, then into the bread crumb-Parmesan mixture. Place chicken in a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
