Ingredients:
1 TBL unsalted butter
3 slices thick-cut turkey bacon, diced
1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
+ Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
1/3 cup dry white wine
2 bunches kale, tough center ribs discarded, chopped
+ pinch of freshly ground nutmeg
1 cup heavy cream
8 oz cherry tomatoes, halved (abt 1 1/2 cups)
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
6 large eggs

Directions:
1. Melt butter in a large skillet with a lid over medium heat. Add bacon and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 3 minutes. Add onions and season with salt and pepper. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until onion is soft and golden, 10 to 15 mins.
2. Add wine, set heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Stir in kale and season with salt and pepper. Cover skillet and cook 5 mins, then uncover and cook 5 more mins, stirring occasionally, until pan is nearly dry. Add nutmeg and cream. Bring to a low simmer and cook until slightly thickened, about 3 mins. Stir in cherry tomatoes. Remove from heat and spoon evenly into a 9x13" baking dish. Smooth top and sprinkle with Parmesan. Cover and refrigerate up to 24 hrs or proceed.
3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Make 6 wells in kale mixture. Crack eggs into wells. Season eggs with salt and pepper. Bake until egg whites are set 25 to 30 minutes.
