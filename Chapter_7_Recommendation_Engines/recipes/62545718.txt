Ingredients:
1 Yellow Squash, chopped into blocks
1 Zucchini, chopped into blocks
3 cloves of Garlic, Minced
1 package of extra firm tofu
3 Tablespoons of Soy Sauce
1 Tablespoon of Sriracha Sauce
4 Tablespoons of brown sugar
Butter or olive oil for frying
Salt and pepper to taste
Shredded cheese (Optional)

Directions:
Cut tofu, yellow squash and Zucchini into bite sized blocks. Set aside. Mince garlic.
In a large sized frying pan or wok, heat up butter or olive oil. Add minced garlic and stir frequently; do not let the garlic burn.
Add Yellow Squash and Zucchini. Stir frequently for roughly 7 minutes, or until vegetables have softened.
Remove squash and zucchini and set aside in a bowl.
Place tofu blocks (or slices) into the same pan, and add brown sugar and soy sauce. Cook each side of tofu until golden brown.
When tofu is golden brown, add squash and zucchini back into the pan, and cook for another 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Add Sriracha, salt and pepper to taste, and stir.
Serve hot by itself, or with shredded cheese on top (optional)
