Ingredients:
Cake:
1/2 cup shortening
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs, room temperature
1 teaspoon butter flavored extract
4 tablespoons red food coloring
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup buttermilk, room temperature
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon baking soda
Cream Cheese Frosting:
1/2 cup butter, room temperature
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, room temperature
4 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round pans.
Beat shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, mixing until fully incorporated. Stir in butter flavoring. Make a paste with food coloring and cocoa and add to the shortening mixture.
Mix buttermilk, salt, baking soda and vinegar; add to batter alternating with the flour mixture.
Divide batter into prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven until cake springs back when touched lightly with a finger or tester comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes. Cook completely on wire rack.
To Make Cream Cheese Frosting: beat butter and cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Mix until well blended.
