Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
2 cups finely chopped pecans
1 tablespoon sifted confectioners' sugar, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 4 baking sheets.
Beat butter and brown sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer. Stir in vanilla extract. Stir in flour gradually; mixture will be crumbly. Add pecans and work into the dough.
Pinch off dough in teaspoons; roll in hands to form balls that are about 1/2-inch in diameter. Place onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until firm and browned on bottoms, 15 to 18 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Roll warm cookies in confectioners' sugar.
