Description: 
The outstanding barbecue taste of these beans makes them a favorite for cookouts all summer and into the fall. It's a popular dish with everyone--even kids. Having meat in with the beans is so much better than plain pork and beans.                    --Donna Fancher, Lawrence, IndianaModified from: Fourth of July Bean Casserole
