Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons poppy seeds
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
8 ounces plain non-fat yogurt
2 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 large lemons, zested and juiced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 muffin cups.
Mix flour, sugar, poppy seeds, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Beat yogurt, eggs, oil, lemon zest, and lemon juice together in a separate bowl; pour into the flour mixture and stir until you have a light and almost fluffy batter. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn out onto wire rack to cool slightly.
