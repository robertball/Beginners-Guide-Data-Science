Description: 
I got this recipe from my Mom several years ago, however, I don't know where she got it. It's delicious and can be made ahead of time. Very tasty. Serve with a salad and rolls if desired, making a wonderful meal. The recipe can be doubled or tripled, depending on the size of the group you need to feed!
