Skillet Potatoes Brian Recipe

Ingredients:
1 large baking potato or 2 medium
1/4 cup all purpose flour
1-1/2 tsp garlic powder
2-1/2 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp Spanish smoked paprika (pref.) or chipotle
1 tsp salt
1/8 tsp white pepper
1-1/2 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp crushed red pepper
1/4 tsp black pepper or 3 twists of a pepper mill
1/2 tsp celery salt
1.5 tbsp canola or vegetable oil.
2 tsp. reduced fat bacon bits (Hormel)
1/2 cup veal or beef stock
1 12" Skillet (recommended to get the texture best)

Directions:
1. Wash the potato(oes) and pat dry.
2. Put water into a medium bowl.
3. Cut the potatoes in 1/2" to 3/4" chunks by slicing first along the length, then flipping the potatoes on the cut side and making four cuts to create nine pieces out of each slice.  Put them in the water in the medium bowl.
4. In another bowl, add the dry ingredients: Flour and spices. Use your fingers to dry mix them until blended.
5. Heat up a cast iron skillet (best) on high for 5 minutes, then reduce to low/med. heat.
6. Drain the potatoes in a colander until damp dry. Don't let stand too long.  Transfer the potato chunks to the potato rub that you've created.  Toss the potatoes in the rub and set aside.
7. Add the oil to the pan.
8. Pick up small handfuls of the coated potato chunks and add them to the pan. Let them sit for a minute, then stir gently to turn over to another side. Stir again after another minute. You want the coating to stay with the potato, not the pan. When cooked around, cover the pan, reduce the heat slightly.
Add the bacon bits and stir.
Cook for five minutes, then drizzle a SMALL amount of the stock/broth, just enough to steam the potatoes, over them. Do not use all of it.  Stir and cover.
Repeat this process of steaming for five minutes two more times.  When the potatoes are dry the last time, turn off heat and serve in the skillet on the hot pad.
