Ingredients:
5 egg yolks
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup Marsala wine
1 cup heavy cream, chilled
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 pound mascarpone cheese
2 cups strong brewed coffee, room temperature
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 cup brandy
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
48 ladyfinger cookies
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
To make zabaglione:  In the top of a double boiler, beat yolks and 1/4 cup sugar until smooth and pale yellow.  Place over simmering water and gradually beat in Marsala.  Continue to beat over simmering water until soft mounds form, 5 to 10 minutes.  Transfer to a cool bowl, cover and refrigerate 30 minutes.
Whip heavy cream with 2 tablespoons sugar until soft peaks form.  Fold in mascarpone and zabaglione.  Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.
In a small bowl, combine coffee, 2 tablespoons sugar, brandy and vanilla.  Arrange 16 ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9x13 inch dish.  Spoon about 1 tablespoon of coffee mixture over each cookie.  Ladyfingers should be soaked, but not crumbling.  Spoon one-third of the cheese mixture over the ladyfingers, and spread evenly.  Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon cocoa.  Repeat layering twice.  Cover and refrigerate 5 hours before serving.
