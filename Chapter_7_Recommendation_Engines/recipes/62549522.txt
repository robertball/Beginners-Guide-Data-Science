Ingredients:
1 pound wild salmon fillet, skinned (see Tip)
2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion, or scallion
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 teaspoon finely chopped peeled fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon kosher or sea salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or canola oil
4 tablespoons Green Goddess Sauce, (recipe follows)

Directions:
1.With a large chefâ€™s knife, chop salmon using quick, even, straight-up-and-down motions (do not rock the knife through the fish or it will turn mushy) until you have a mass of roughly 1/4-inch pieces. Transfer to large bowl and gently stir in onion (or scallion), cilantro, ginger, salt and pepper, being careful not to overmix. Divide the mixture into 4 patties, about 1 inch thick. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes (or up to 2 hours) before cooking.
2.Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the burgers and cook until browned on both sides and just cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes total. Serve with 1 tablespoon Green Goddess Sauce each.

Description: 
The key to perfect salmon burgers is to handle the fish delicately: don't overseason, overhandle or overcook it. Cutting the salmon into small pieces by hand takes a little while, but you want it in tender little bits. Serve over a bed of salad greens with the Green Goddess Sauce dolloped on top.
