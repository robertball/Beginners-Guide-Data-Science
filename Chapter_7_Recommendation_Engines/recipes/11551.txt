Ingredients:
1/3 cup blanched almonds
4 raw almonds
3/4 cup butter
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg white
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Finely grind the almonds in a food processor.
In a medium bowl, cream the butter and sugar together. Mix in ground almonds and egg white. Stir in the flour.  Roll dough into 1 inch balls and press into the sandbakelse molds to form a thin coating. Place molds on a baking sheet and bake for 12 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly before removing from molds. Gently tapping the molds on the counter will help to loosen the cookies.
