Ingredients:
2 cups crushed gingersnaps
1/3 cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons white sugar
Filling:
1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin
6 tablespoons lime juice
2 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream, divided
9 (1 ounce) squares white baking chocolate
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon lime zest

Directions:
Combine gingersnaps, butter, and sugar in a large bowl. Press onto the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of a greased 9-inch springform pan.
Sprinkle gelatin over lime juice in a microwave-safe dish. Let stand for 1 minute. Microwave on high power for about 20 seconds. Stir until gelatin is dissolved. Set aside.
Combine 1/2 cup heavy cream and chocolate in a large microwave-safe bowl. Melt in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes. Stir until smooth. Cool for 5 minutes.
Stir dissolved gelatin into the melted chocolate.
Beat cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Gradually add chocolate mixture and lime zest; mix well.
Beat remaining heavy cream in another large bowl until stiff peaks form. Gently fold in cream cheese mixture. Spoon over the gingersnap crust. Cover and refrigerate until set, 8 hours to overnight.
