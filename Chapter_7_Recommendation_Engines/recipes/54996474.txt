Ingredients:
1/2 pound sugar snap peas, trimmed
1 cup fresh raspberries
2 tablespoons raspberry vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil (or canola)
1 pinch sugar
salt and pepper to taste
lemon juice to taste
1 cup fresh blueberries
2 cups torn mixed salad greens
1/4 - 1/2 C roasted walnuts

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Place snap peas in pot, and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.
Place about 1 1/2 tablespoons raspberries in a strainer over a bowl, and crush with a wooden spoon. Discard pulp. Mix vinegar, oil and sugar with the strained raspberry juice. Add salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste.
In a large bowl, gently toss the dressing with the snap peas, remaining raspberries, and blueberries. Cover, and chill at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Toss with greens and walnuts just before serving.
