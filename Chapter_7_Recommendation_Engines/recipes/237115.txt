Ingredients:
3 cups oil for frying, or as needed
1 head cauliflower, broken into florets
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg, beaten
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Heat frying oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Toss cauliflower florets with salt in a bowl. Stir egg and vegetable oil together in a bowl; whisk flour and milk into egg mixture until batter is smooth. Working in batches, drop several pieces of cauliflower into batter and stir to coat.
Working in batches, fry battered cauliflower pieces in preheated oil until they rise to the top of the oil and float, 2 to 4 minutes. Carefully turn pieces over and continue frying until golden brown, about 2 minutes more.

Description: 
My Grandma Nickie used to make this 'treat' and we could never get enough. After many attempts, I've managed to copy her. Both my boys asked me to teach them to make it.
