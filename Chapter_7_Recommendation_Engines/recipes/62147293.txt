Description: 
These are a nice, less unhealthy alternative to classic chocolate chip cookies.  Made with carob instead of chocolate they are also a nice treat for chocolate deprived migraine sufferers like myself.  Carob chips, sucanat and evaporated cane juice can all be found at your local health/natural food store.
