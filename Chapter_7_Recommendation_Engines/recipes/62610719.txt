Ingredients:
•	1 cup flat warm porter or stout beer
•	1/2 cup strong coffee
•	2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
•	2 1/2 cups whole wheat bread flour
•	2 tablespoons white bread flour
•	1 cup rye flour
•	1 teaspoon sea salt
•	2 tablespoons olive oil
•	2 tablespoons honey
•	1 tablespoon molasses
•	3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
•	1 tablespoon wheat germ
•	¼ teaspoon onion powder
•	1 tablespoon caraway seed
•	2 teaspoons active dry yeast

Directions:
Place ingredients into the bread machine in order suggested by the manufacturer. I only use my machine for kneading and rising.
After kneading cycle remove bread and shape into rustic loaf on a baking sheet. I use parchment paper on my sheet to keep the bottom of the loaf from getting too dark. I cross cut Xs on top of loaf. Let rise for one hour.
Mix together an egg wash of 1 egg white and 1 tablespoon warm water and paint top of loaf.
Bake at 395 for 45 minutes to 50 minutes.
Cool on rake one hour before slicing.
