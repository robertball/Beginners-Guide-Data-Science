Ingredients:
1/2 pound lean ground pork
1/4 cup diced onion
1 garlic clove, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 jalapeno chile, minced*
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
4 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1/4 cup grated Cheddar or Jack cheese

Directions:
In large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, cook pork with onion and garlic until browned; drain off any drippings and remove to large bowl. Stir cumin, oregano, jalapeno and cilantro into pork mixture.
Wipe out skillet with paper towel and heat over medium-high heat. Place one tortilla in skillet; top with half of the pork mixture, spreading evenly, and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of cheese. Top with another tortilla and cook on one side until nicely browned (about 2-3 minutes), pressing down occasionally on top tortilla (using a spatula or, carefully, your hand). Turn and brown the other side, remove to cutting board and cut into 8 wedges. Repeat process to make 8 more quesadilla wedges. Serve with salsa, if desired.
