1  onion, chopped
1 ¼ cups chicken broth

⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
2  green onions, chopped
2 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook chicken and onion in oil 4 to 5 minutes, or until onion is tender.
Stir in the chicken broth, green chiles, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, cilantro, and cayenne pepper. Reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.
Stir in the beans, and simmer for 5 more minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. Garnish with green onion and shredded cheese.

Description: 
Serve with corn bread and salad. If you cube the chicken ahead of time, make corn bread muffins while preparing the chili, and use a bagged salad mix from the produce department, this is a very fast meal to put together.
