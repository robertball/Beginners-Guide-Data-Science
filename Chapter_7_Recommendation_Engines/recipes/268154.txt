Ingredients:
3 cups fresh cranberries
2 cups water
2 cups white sugar
1 (6 ounce) package cherry-flavored gelatin (such as Jell-O®)
2 cups crushed pineapple
2 cups diced pears
1 cup pecans, or more to taste

Directions:
Combine cranberries, water, and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook until berries are splitting open and tender, about 10 minutes.
While cranberries cook, pour cherry-flavored gelatin mix into a casserole dish.
Pour cooked cranberry mixture over gelatin in the casserole dish and stir to dissolve and mix evenly. Place in the refrigerator until gelatin is set, about 1 hour.
Add pineapple, pears, and pecans. Stir and serve.
