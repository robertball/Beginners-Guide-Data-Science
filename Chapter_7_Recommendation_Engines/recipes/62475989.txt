Directions:
Place the chicken, butter, soup, seasoning and vegetables in a slow cooker, and fill with enough chicken stock to cover.
Cover, and cook for 7 to 8 hours on High.
About 90 minutes before serving, roll out the biscuit dough and cut into "noodles".  Place the "noodles" into the slow cooker, pushing them down and making sure they are covered by sauce. Cook until the dough is no longer raw in the center.
Taste for seasoning (salt & pepper) and serve.
