1 pound ground beef
1 large onion, chopped
2 (10.75 ounce) cans Campbell's® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup (Regular or 98% Fat Free)
2 (10.75 ounce) cans milk
1 cup finely shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup Pepperidge Farm® Seasoned Croutons

Directions:
Cook the beef and onion in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often to break up meat. Pour off any fat.
Stir the soup and milk in the saucepan. Cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Stir in 1/2 cup cheese. Cook and stir until the cheese is melted.
Divide the soup among 8 serving bowls. Top each bowl with 1 tablespoon remaining cheese and 2 tablespoons croutons.
