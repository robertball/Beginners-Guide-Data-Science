Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
½ cup honey
¼ cup Dijon mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place chicken breasts in a baking dish; sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Mix honey and mustard in a small bowl and pour mixture over chicken. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until the juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink inside, about 40 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
