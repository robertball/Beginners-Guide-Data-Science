Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) box penne
1 (5 ounce) can tuna, packed in olive oil, drained
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh basil
1/2 large organic lemon, juiced and zested
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 ounce canned anchovy fillets, drained
2 teaspoons capers
1 clove garlic, thinly sliced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/2 bunch fresh parsley, finely chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
Empty tuna into a bowl and mash with a fork while pasta is cooking. Mix with 2 tablespoons olive oil, basil, lemon juice, lemon zest, salt, and pepper.
Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet and fry the anchovies for 3 minutes. Add capers and garlic; cook, stirring constantly, for an additional 3 minutes. Add tuna mixture and tomatoes; simmer sauce for about 5 minutes.
Drain pasta and add to the sauce. Mix well. Stir in parsley before serving.

Description: 
This is my version of a tuna pasta dish with capers, anchovies, and tomatoes. I make it at least once a week as it is my husband's favorite and he proclaims it's restaurant quality. You can easy double the recipe if you're cooking for more people.
