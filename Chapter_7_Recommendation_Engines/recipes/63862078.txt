Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 8-ounce block of cream cheese, softened
1 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  next time I’d add 1.5 tsp.
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 cup mini chocolate chips, plus extra for sprinkling

Directions:
In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the brown sugar until it dissolves and the mixture starts to bubble. Stir in vanilla and set aside to cool.
In a separate bowl, cream the cream cheese and powdered sugar together for 60 seconds. With the mixer on low speed, add in brown sugar and butter mixture, then the salt. Mix until combined. Stir in the mini chocolate chips.
Garnish with additional mini chocolate chips. Serve with animal crackers, Nilla wafers, or graham crackers. I found that this tasted better the colder it got.

Description: 
This is AMAZING. It is very rich and I like it best served with Nilla Wafers & Graham Crackers. However, Pretzels are awesome if you like the sweet and salty combo. YUM everyone loves this!
