Ingredients:
1 pound bacon
1/2 cup butter
1 onion, sliced thin
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (4 ounce) package fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 cup white wine
2 cups chicken stock
1 (14 ounce) package seasoned stuffing cubes
1 (10 ounce) jar oysters, drained and cut into thirds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet; cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Remove bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Reserve drippings in the skillet.
Add the butter to the bacon drippings and melt over medium-high heat. Cook the onion, garlic, and mushrooms in the butter and drippings until the onion has caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the wine into the skillet; allow the wine to warm; remove from heat.
Place the stuffing cubes in a large bowl. Pour the vegetable mixture over the cubes. Add the chicken stock. Fold the oysters into the mixture. Transfer the stuffing to a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
I could never find the right oyster stuffing recipe, so I made my own with bacon, onion, mushrooms, and oysters. It is great with grilled turkey.
