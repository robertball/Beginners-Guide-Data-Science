Description: 
I didn't have prepared mustard on hand as requested in another recipe, so I substituted a combination of honey mustard and dry mustard. When I found it a bit sweet, I double the recipe without doubling the honey and added about 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard to arrive at this great version. It is a tangy dressing that goes great with spinach and chicken salad. Store in the refrigerator.
