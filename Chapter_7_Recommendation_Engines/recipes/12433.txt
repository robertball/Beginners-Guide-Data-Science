Ingredients:
1 medium sugar pumpkin
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch single crust pie
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
4 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup honey, warmed slightly
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Cut pumpkin in half, and remove seeds. Lightly oil the cut surface.  Place cut side down on a jelly roll pan lined with foil and lightly oiled.  Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) until the flesh is tender when poked with a fork.  Cool until just warm.  Scrape the pumpkin flesh from the peel.  Either mash, or puree in small batches in a blender.
In large bowl, blend together 2 cups pumpkin puree, spices, and salt.  Beat in eggs, honey, milk, and cream.  Pour filling into pie shell.
Bake at 400 degrees F ( 205 degrees C) for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a knife inserted 1 inch from edge of pie comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
