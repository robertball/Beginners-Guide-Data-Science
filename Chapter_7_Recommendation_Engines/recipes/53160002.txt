Ingredients:
1 cups penne pasta
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
1 cloves garlic, crushed
1 teaspoons dried oregano
salt and pepper to taste
A little extra-virgin olive oil
10 cherry tomatoes, halved
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 cucumber, sliced
1/4 cup sliced black olives
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the penne, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Rinse with cold water and drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Whisk together the vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Set aside. Combine pasta, tomatoes, onion, green and red peppers, cucumber, olives, and feta cheese in a large bowl. Pour vinaigrette over the pasta and mix together. Cover and chill for 3 hours before serving.
