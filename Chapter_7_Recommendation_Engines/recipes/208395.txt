Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) boneless beef chuck roast
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup water
1 tablespoon anise seed
1 tablespoon sesame seed
1 large green bell pepper, julienned

Directions:
Rinse and pat dry the roast. Coat the roast evenly with the flour; season with salt and pepper.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic to the hot oil; sear the beef in the oil until all sides are slightly browned. Transfer the roast to a slow cooker. Pour the water over the roast.
Cook on Low for 5 hours. Add the anise seed and sesame seed to the slow cooker and cook another 4 hours. Add the green bell pepper and continue cooking until the meat is tender and easily pulled apart, about 1 hour more.
