Ingredients:
Filling
1/2 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons orange juice
1 tablespoon fresh grated orange zest
6 ripe Bartlett pears, peeled, cored, and sliced
1 cup fresh cranberries or frozen, unthawed cranberries
Topping
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup cold butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 cup low-fat buttermilk
1 egg white, lightly beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Combine SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, cinnamon, orange juice, and orange zest in a large bowl, stirring until SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener dissolves. Add pears and cranberries; toss to coat. Divide pear mixture evenly among 6 (8-ounce) ramekins or custard cups. Place ramekins on a baking sheet; bake 15 minutes.
Make Topping: COMBINE flour, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl; cut butter in with a pastry blender or two knives until mixture is crumbly with some pea-sized pieces. Stir in buttermilk. Remove ramekins from oven; reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F.
Drop batter evenly over pears; brush with egg white. Immediately return cobblers to oven. Bake 30 additional minutes, or until topping is browned. Cool 10 minutes before serving.
