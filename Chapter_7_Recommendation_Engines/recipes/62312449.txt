Ingredients:
- Quinoa; 100 gms (4 oz), rinsed
- Parsley, leaves only; 2 good handsful, chopped but not too finely
- Lime; 1, grated zest and the juice
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil; 2 tablespoons
- Salt
- Pepper, freshly ground

Directions:
Bring a pan of water to the boil, then add salt. Add the Quinoa and cook until it is just tender, but still has some bite to it. This will probably take 15 minutes, but start testing at around the 12 mark!
Drain and then cool under running water.
Meanwhile, mix together the lime zest, lime juice and oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Put the grain into a bowl and mix in the lime juice and oil.
Finish by stirring in the parsley leaves.
