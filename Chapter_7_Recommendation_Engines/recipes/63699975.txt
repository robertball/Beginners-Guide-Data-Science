Ingredients:
6 large potatoes
4 eggs
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped sweet pickles
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 finely grated carrot
4 T. chopped bacon
1 can black olives
2 T. dried dill weed
1 tsp. garlic salt
1 tsp. celery salt
1 tsp. ground black pepper
3 T. yellow mustard
1cup mayonnaise
1cup sour cream

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes.  Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil; cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. While the eggs and potatoes are cooling down, chop the celery, onion, sweet pickles, bacon, olives and carrot. Put all these in a large bowl and combine with the mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard and spices.
When the eggs and potatoes have cooled, drain, peel, and chop them all.  Add to the wet vegetable mixture and combine well. Chill thoroughly before serving.
