Jan's Stuffed Chicken Breast with White Wine Sauce Recipe

Ingredients:
1 pound package of Perdue Thin Sliced Chicken Breast Cutlets
1 box of prepared stuffing mix (or your favorite home made)
SAUCE:
3/4 cup dry white wine
1 cup chicken broth
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon dried sage
Salt and pepper to taste
4 tbsp butter
1 tbsp finely minced garlic
3 tbsp flour
2 tbsp finely minced fresh parsley

Directions:
Use a meat mallet to pound the chicken between two sheets of wax paper.  You want them thin enough to roll around the stuffing completely.  (Should be at least the size of your open hand as a quick gauge)
Prepare stuffing as box directs.  Divide into 6 portions and shape into ovals.
Wrap chicken around stuffing and tuck ends under.  Place in a greased (or parchment lined) baking pan.
Cover and bake 350 for 30 minutes, remove foil and continue to bake until internal temp reaches 170.
While chicken is baking, melt butter in a large sauce pan with garlic.  Cook about 2 minutes over medium heat being careful not to brown the garlic.  Add flour and whisk until mixture thickens.
Add wine and blend well with whisk. Cook for 2 minutes while whisking, and mixture begins to thicken.
Add broth, mustard, parsley and salt and pepper to taste.   Cook, while continuing to whisk, until mixture begins to boil.  Sauce should begin to thicken.  Continue to reduce the sauce until the sauce heavily coats the back of a spoon. Serve immediately over cooked chicken breasts.
