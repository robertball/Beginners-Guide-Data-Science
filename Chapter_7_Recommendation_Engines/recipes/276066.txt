Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 eggs
12 ounces baking white chocolate (such as Baker'sÂ®)
2 teaspoons vegetable shortening, or as needed
1 (3 ounce) package sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan.
Combine cream cheese, sugar, and almond extract in a bowl and whip using an electric mixer on low speed until combined. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 1 hour; refrigerate for at least 3 hours more.
Scoop cheesecake into small balls using a melon baller or a tablespoon-sized scoop. Place on a wax paper-covered cookie sheet. Freeze cheesecake balls, 8 hours to overnight.
Place chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Stir in shortening until consistency is smooth and easy to work with.
Dip each cheesecake ball into chocolate to coat; replace on the cookie sheet. Garnish with sliced almonds while chocolate is still warm.
Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.
