Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound bulk Italian sausage
1 large onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
4 medium potatoes, cubed
4 cups chicken broth
4 cups chopped kale
1 cup half-and-half

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function.
Heat oil in the cooker. Add sausage and cook until no longer pink, about 3 minutes. Stir in onion and garlic; cook until softened and translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Add potatoes and chicken broth. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure and set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Stir kale into the cooker. Select Saute function. Cook, uncovered, for 2 minutes. Stir in half-and-half. Turn off the cooker and serve.
