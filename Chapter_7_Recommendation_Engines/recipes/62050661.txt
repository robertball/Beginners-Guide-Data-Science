Description: 
I've been making this marinade for years.  Everyone who's ever tasted it want's the recipe.  It has a very intense flavor that everyone just loves, especially my husband and 9 year old son!  The best part is that it only takes minutes to make.  I typically use this on Pork Kabobs.  I thinly slice up a pork tenderloin and put it onto skewers.  I pour on the marinade and let it maridnade overnight turning occasionally.  The longer it marinates the more intense the flavor.  Yum-yum-yum!  You're going to love this one!
