Ingredients:
4  cups penne or bowtie pasta
2 small chicken breasts (chopped into 1/2 inch cubes)
1 bunch asparagus (chopped into 1 inch spears)
1/2 cup pine nuts
1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese
1/4 cup fresh basil (chopped)
2/3 cup of feta cheese (Bulgarian feta is preferable as it is less dry)
2 medium garlic coves (chopped fine)
1 large lemon (juice only)
1/2 olive oil
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon lemon pepper
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Cook pasta to desired tenderness, rinse and set aside.
In a large pan, saute garlic, butter, asparagus,  basil and oregano for 2 minutes while stirring.
Add chicken cubes to pan and continue to stir until the chicken cubes turn white and cook around the outside. This should take about 5 minutes.
Cover the pan and continue to cook covered for another 5-10 minutes until the asparagus softens up.
Mix the contents of the pan with the pasta in a large bowl
Add all other ingredients except for the feta cheese and mix well.
Just before serving, add 1-2 tablespoons of crumbled feta cheese to each bowl of pasta. This should always be kept separate from the pasta until serving.
