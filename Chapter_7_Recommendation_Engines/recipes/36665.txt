Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 (4 ounce) skinned, boned duck breast halves
3 1/2 cups cooked wild rice (about 1 cup uncooked)
1 cup sliced green onions
1 cup seedless green grapes, halved
1/4 cup chopped pecans, toasted
1 tablespoon grated orange rind
1 cup fresh orange juice
1/3 cup sherry vinegar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
7 leaves red leaf lettuce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
Place a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat until hot. Add duck; cook 2 minutes on each side or until lightly browned. Place duck in an 11 x 7-inch baking dish coated with cooking spray. Bake at 450 degrees for 20 minutes or until done. Let cool. Cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips.
Combine duck, rice, green onions, grape halves, and pecans in a large bowl. Toss well; set aside.   Combine orange rind and next 4 ingredients (orange rind through pepper) in a small bowl; stir well. Pour over duck mixture; toss well. Serve salad on 7 lettuce-lined plates. Serve at room temperature.

Description: 
To make a complete meal, this main-dish salad only needs a loaf of crusty French bread and a glass of wine to round it out. If boneless duck breasts are unavailable (ask your butcher), substitute 1 pound of pork tenderloin for the duck.
