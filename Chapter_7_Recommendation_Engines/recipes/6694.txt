Ingredients:
7/8 cup water
1/2 tablespoon salt
1/4 cup honey
2 eggs
1/4 cup butter, melted
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons active dry yeast

Directions:
Place water, salt, honey, eggs, melted butter or margarine, flour, and yeast in order given into the bread machine. Set the machine to Dough cycle, and start.
Remove dough from the machine after first rising. Divide dough into three or four equal pieces. Braid the pieces, and tuck the ends under; pinch to seal. Place on a greased baking tray. This bread can also be made in a 9 x 5 inch greased loaf pan. Allow to rise until doubled in size.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven until the crust is a deep golden brown, about 35 to 45 minutes.
