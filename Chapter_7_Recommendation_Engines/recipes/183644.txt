Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-O®
1 1/2 cups shredded coconut
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, or as needed
1 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-O®
30 whole cloves

Directions:
Pour the milk into a mixing bowl, and sprinkle 1 package of strawberry gelatin overtop. Stir to dissolve the gelatin, then stir in the coconut and graham cracker crumbs until a stiff dough forms. You may need to use additional graham cracker crumbs to make a firm dough.
Roll the dough into approximately 30 - 1 inch balls. Pour the remaining strawberry gelatin into a small bowl, and roll the cookies in the gelatin to coat. Place the cookies onto a serving tray, and press a whole clove into each to form a stem.

Description: 
This is a no-bake Christmas cookie that is a must-have in my family during the holidays. Having the clove to suck on at the end is the best part! They are delicious and pretty, not to mention simple to make.  Everyone hears about sugar plums at Christmas, but nobody knows what they are! Kids LOVE these. Be sure to remove the whole clove before giving to small children however.
