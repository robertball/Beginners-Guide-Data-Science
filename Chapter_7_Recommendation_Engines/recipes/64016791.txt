Ingredients:
1 Cup Hellman's or Best Foods mayonnaise
2 tablespoons sweet pickle relish
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon sweet paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder

Directions:
Combine mayonnaise, relish, and mustard in a small bowl.  Add remaining ingredients and stir to combine.  Chill for at least 10 minutes to let seasonings rehydrate and flavors combine.  Use on your own homemade big mac!
To make a big mac - take a sesame seed bun and slice 1/2" off top bun.  Toast exposed sides of bun in skillet or toaster (use the bagel setting for top and bottom buns).  Meanwhile, mince a white or yellow onion, shred iceberg lettuce and set aside.  Form 2  1/8lb. beef patties and fry in a skillet or on a grill.  Lay out buns and dollop sauce on each bun, then layer on minced onions and lettuce.  Then one slice of American cheese on bottom bun and place patties on bottom and middle buns.  Top with top bun.
