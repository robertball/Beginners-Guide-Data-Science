2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
2 tablespoons grated orange zest

Directions:
In a shallow container, mix together orange juice, soy sauce, ginger, orange zest, garlic, chile paste, and salt. Add pork chops, and turn to coat evenly. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Turn the pork chops in the marinade occasionally.
