Ingredients:
4 3/4 Cups of wholewheat flour
1 cup shredded Carrots
2 small overripe bananas, mashed
2 Tbsp Honey
½ Cup Unsweetened Apple sauce
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp Cinnamon
1 egg
1 cup water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease 2 large baking sheets.  (I used my large Pampered chef stoneware bar pans)
In a large bowl, combine together all the ingredients except the water. Slowly mixing in the water a little at a time.
Mix together on a medium speed until the ingredients are thoroughly combined. The dough should be quite stiff.
Turn the dough onto a floured surface and kneed for approximately one minute.
Roll out the dough to ¼ inch thickness and cut with a 1” round cookie cutter.
Bake for 35 minutes at full heat, then turn the oven off and leave the cookies in the oven for a further 30 minutes.
Leave cookies in the baking tray for 10 minutes before cooling on a wire rack.
