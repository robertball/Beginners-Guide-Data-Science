Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 onion, chopped
1 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1 cup evaporated milk, divided
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 can cream of mushroom soup
1 can cream of chicken soup

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the bread crumbs with 2 tablespoons of evaporated milk and stir, allowing the crumbs to absorb the milk. Add the ground beef, onion, egg, salt and black pepper to taste. Mix well and form into golf ball sized meatballs.
Heat butter or margarine in a skillet over medium to medium high heat and add the meatballs. Carefully shake the skillet to turn the meatballs, as needed. Saute for 10 to 15 minutes, or until meatballs are browned on all sides.  Transfer the meatballs to a crockpot.
Mix together the soups and remaining evaporated milk.  Pour over meatballs in crockpot.  Heat for 3 - 4 hours on low.  May need to add milk to thin out sauce if needed.  Serve over cooked noodles.
