Ingredients:
1/3 cup peanut butter
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup chocolate chips
2 1/2 cups mini round corn tortilla chips
1/4 cup miniature marshmallows
1/4 cup sweetened flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat your oven's broiler.
Combine the peanut butter and confectioners' sugar in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat the mixture until the peanut butter melts, about 1 minute. Place the chocolate chips in a separate microwave-safe bowl; melt the chips in the microwave, about 1 minute.
Arrange the tortilla chips into an even layer on a baking sheet. Drizzle the peanut butter mixture and the melted chocolate over the chips. Scatter the marshmallows and coconut over the chips.
Place under preheated broiler until the marshmallows begin to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve hot.

Description: 
These are exactly what the name says: dessert nachos. It sounds a little strange, but they are creamy, crunchy, chocolaty, and sweet. The slight saltiness of the nachos goes perfectly with the sweet chocolate and salty-sweet peanut butter.
