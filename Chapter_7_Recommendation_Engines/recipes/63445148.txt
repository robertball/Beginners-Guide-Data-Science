Lepp Cookies Recipe

Ingredients:
8 oz or 1 cup sorghum molasses or dark molasses
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup lard or Crisco
1 pint or 2 cups of flour
1/2 cup of buttermilk
2 1/2  teaspoons of baking soda
1/2 Tablespoon of each: clove, ginger, nutmeg, all spice
1 Tablespoon of cinnamon
1 cup of chopped mixed nuts ( I used pecans and walnuts)
1 cup of mixed fruit (I used raisins and dried cranberries)
Pinch of salt

Directions:
Heat molasses, lard and sugar and let cool.
Add baking soda to milk, then add all ingredients together in a mixing bowl.
Mix together until a wet dough forms.
Pour ingredients onto a sheet of wax paper. Use your hands to shape the dough into rolls. You wonâ€™t use your hands too long, the dough is very sticky. Once you have a log shape going, wrap the wax paper around the sides of the dough and use it to roll the dough into shape. I cut my dough into two rolls.
Wrap the wax paper around the dough and chill. Chilling can be over night or you can freeze it and bake it much later.
Slice and bake at 350 for 12 to 15 minutes.
To ripen them: Store in an air tight container (like a stone jar or plastic container) at room temperature for a month or freeze them (icing and all) and eat them until next year.
Lepp cookies are served frosted and unfrosted. I choose to make a Browned Butter Frosting for mine.
