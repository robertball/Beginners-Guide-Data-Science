Description: 
A wonderful marinade that makes even the toughest cuts of beef so tender you could cut them with a butter knife. Tastes great on pork chops and chicken, too. Play with the amounts of garlic and ginger to suit your taste. I tend to use more rather than less. Makes enough for four servings.
