Ingredients:
MARINADE/BASTING SAUCE:
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup cider vinegar
4 tablespoons honey
4 tablespoons canola oil
2 green onions, minced
CHICKEN & VEGGIES:
10 large mushrooms, cut in half
1 green pepper, cut into large chunks
1 red or orange pepper, cut into large chunks
1 yellow onion, cut into large chunks
3-4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into chunks
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix the soy sauce, cider vinegar, honey, canola oil, and green onions with a wire whisk.
Blanch the veggies so they are easier to thread onto the skewers.
Place the chicken in a bag and add enough mixture to coat it, then massage bag. Place veggies in another bag with the rest of the marinate. Put both bags in the fridge and let marinate at least 1 hour.
Preheat grill for high heat.
Remove the veggies and chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Pour the marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes.
While sauce is simmering, thread chicken and veggies onto skewers.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Cook skewers for 15 to 20 minutes, brushing occasionally with remaining soy sauce mixture, until chicken juices run clear.
