Ingredients:
2 lbs. chicken wings
1/2 cup light soy sauce
1/2 cup orange juice
1 tbsp. grated orange peel
3 tbsp. rice vinegar
1/4 cup brown sugar
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tbsp. fresh ginger, minced
1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes (or to taste)
1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp. freshly cracked black pepper
For optional garnish, chopped parsley and orange slices.

Directions:
Rinse and pat dry chicken wings.
Whisk together remaining ingredients (except garnishes) until brown sugar is dissolved.
Pour marinade over chicken wings in a sealable container or plastic zipper-top bags, and turn to coat evenly.
Marinate in refrigerator for at least one hour - or up to 8 hours - turning occasionally.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F
Cover baking sheet with foil and spray with cooking spray; place chicken wings, discarding remaining marinade, on foil-lined sheet and bake for approximately 20 minutes, turning wings occasionally.
Garnish with fresh chopped parsley and orange slices, if desired.
