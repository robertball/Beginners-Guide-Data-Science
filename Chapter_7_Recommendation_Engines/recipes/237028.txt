Ingredients:
Cake:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 1/4 cups vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
4 apples, thinly sliced
1 1/2 cups finely chopped walnuts
Topping:
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Whisk oil, white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into sugar mixture; fold apples and 1 1/2 cups walnuts into batter. Pour batter into a 10x13-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until cake is set, about 1 hour. Pierce surface of cake in several places with a large fork.
Stir brown sugar, butter, and milk together in a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until sugar is dissolved and mixture boils, about 2 1/2 minutes. Sprinkle 1/2 cup walnuts over hot cake and pour brown sugar mixture over the top.

Description: 
Best apple cake we've ever eaten. I've taken three recipes and combined them to create what my family now requests for birthdays! We think the cake is better once it sits for awhile. Even refrigerated and then heated back up, the flavors seem to really stand out. You can substitute pecans for the walnuts.
