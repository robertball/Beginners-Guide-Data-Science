Ingredients:
Jay's Signature Pizza Crust (found on this site, better than any store-bought)
4 oz. pizza sauce
pepperoni slices
Shredded Mozzarella Cheese (enough to cover surface)
olive oil
Additional toppings and/or seasonings of your choice (I used italian seasoning, parmesan cheese...it might be wise to keep it simple so the crust can withstand the weight of the topping when dipping)

Directions:
Prepare crust as directed (see Jay's Signature Pizza Crust Recipe on this site)
Roll out and place on a large non-stick rectangular baking sheet.  Score the dough with a knife lengthwise, creating strips approximately 2 inches wide.  Score again horizontaly once, though the middle of the strips, so that they are each approximately 2" x 6".
Brush with olive oil.
Sprinkle with italian seasoning.
Brush all with pizza sauce.
Press slices of pepperoni into dough; 3 per strip.
Top with parmesan cheese.
Sprinkle all with mozzarella.
Bake in the oven at 425 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes.  Slice along the score lines and serve with your choice of dipping sauce and enjoy!

Description: 
I made this for a Super Bowl party, and it was a hit! Dip in Garlic dressing, marinara, or melted cheese (or all 3)!
