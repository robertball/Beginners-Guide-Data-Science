Ingredients:
3 quarts peanut oil for frying
2 tablespoons salt
3 tablespoons coarse ground black pepper
2 tablespoons cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons garlic salt
2 tablespoons onion salt
2 cups all-purpose flour
6 eggs, beaten
6 pounds beef ribs, cut into single rib pieces

Directions:
Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together the salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic salt, and onion salt. Place the flour in a separate bowl or plate. Whisk eggs in a large bowl. Rub the spice mixture onto all of the ribs. Dip each rib in egg, then in flour, then egg, then flour again.
Place the ribs in a fryer basket so they are not crowded, try 4 or 5 at a time depending on the size of your fryer. Cook for about 8 minutes. Remove to paper towels to drain. Continue with remaining ribs.

Description: 
This is a great recipe from a member of our cook-off team. Beef ribs are breaded and deep-fried. This would be best in an outdoor deep-fryer. Two racks of ribs should give you about 6 pounds.
