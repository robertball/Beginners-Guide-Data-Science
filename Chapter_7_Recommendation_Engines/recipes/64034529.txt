Description: 
Funeral potatoes are cheesy au gratin potatoes that LDS Relief Societies frequently serve as part of a dinner prepared for the grieving family to eat after a loved one's funeral. The funeral potatoes are generally served with ham, rolls, salad, cake, and of course, Jell-O. I'm not sure how the tradition evolved, but funeral potatoes are definitely comfort food.
