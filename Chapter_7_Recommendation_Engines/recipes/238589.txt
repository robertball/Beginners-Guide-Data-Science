Description: 
The term 'wonton' is mostly commonly translated as meaning 'irregularly-shaped pasta'. The second translation I found is from a popular Cantonese homonym that literally means 'swallowing clouds'. If given the choice between eating 'irregularly-shaped pasta', or 'swallowing clouds', I'm going with the clouds every time! You can add ginger, onion, soy, hot pepper, cilantro, lime, lemon grass, etc., to suit your taste and customize the broth.
