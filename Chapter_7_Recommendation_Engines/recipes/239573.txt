Ingredients:
1 cup chopped walnuts
2 tablespoons sunflower seed oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 bunch kale, stemmed and leaves torn into strips
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir walnuts in the hot skillet until toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Mix olive oil, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; add kale and chickpeas and toss to coat. Spread kale and chickpeas mixture onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until kale is wilted and slightly crunchy, about 25 minutes.
Toss kale and chickpeas mixture, walnuts, parsley, and lemon juice together in a bowl.
