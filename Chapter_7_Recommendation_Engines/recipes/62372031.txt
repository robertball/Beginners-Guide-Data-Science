Ingredients:
¾  c butter
¾ c flour
1 qt chicken broth
1 qt. Fat-free half and half
2 boneless/skinless breast, boiled and shredded or rotisserie chicken breasts shredded
1 c. shredded taco cheese or Colby-jack
2 lg poblano pepper, roasted, seeded and diced
1 jalapeno or serrano pepper, seeded and diced
1 lg clove of garlic, finely minced or grated
2 jarred, roasted red pepper-rinsed, dried and diced
2 (15 oz) cans black beans, drained and rinsed
3 c. frozen corn, rinsed and drained
1 tsp. Salt
1 tsp. Fresh-ground pepper
1 Tbs. Cumin
1 Tbs. Chili powder
Few dashes of hot sauce (I prefer Cholula Mexican Hot Sauce)
Blue corn tortilla chips & additional shredded cheese for topping

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large stockpot (I use a 7 qt size), whisk in the flour and heat for about a few minutes to get rid of the flour taste (continue to whisk).  Whisk chicken broth and heat until slightly thickened.  Whisk in half & half heating until slightly thickened, whisk in cheese until thoroughly melted.  Add remaining ingredients and simmer for about 30 minutes until heated through.
Top in bowls with crumbled blue corn tortilla chips and additional shredded cheese.
