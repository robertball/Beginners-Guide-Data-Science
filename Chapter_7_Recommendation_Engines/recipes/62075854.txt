Ingredients:
Measurements are approximate, adjust to your taste.
Fruit:
6 cups Watermelon,
3 cups Cantalope,
4 sliced Kiwis,
1-2 diced Apples,
1/2 cup Raisins,
1/2 cup shredded coconut
Dressing:
8 fresh lemons, juiced (one in reserve, see below)
1/2 can of coconut milk, unsweetened
1/2 to 1 cup sugar
1 inch x 1 inch (about) fresh peeled ginger,chopped finely, or more if you love ginger.
Nuts:
1 1/2 cups raw cashews
1 tbsp butter
3/4 cup sugar
1 tbsp chopped, dried mint
1 tsp cayenne
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander

Directions:
Make the dressing first, so that the apples don't brown.
Dressing: In a blender, add lemon juice and sugar and blend until sugar is dissolved. Taste for your desired level of sweetness, and adjust sugar if needed. Add coconut milk and chopped ginger. If you don't like to chop ginger, I learned that putting smallish cubes of it in a garlic press will work as it does for garlic. Blend until creamy and smooth.
Nuts:
Add all ingredients to non-stick frying pan and cook over medium-low until sugar is melted, and nuts are coated and brown. Spread out on a foil-covered cookie sheet to cool.
Fruit:
Chop, or melon ball all fruit into bite-size pieces.
If you are serving the salad immediately, pour dressing over salad, and toss. Sprinkle nuts on top.
If you are serving later, juice one more lemon and toss the chopped apples in the lemon juice so that they don't brown. Drain. Add the apples to the other fruit, and the lemon juice to the dressing.
