Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 cup white sugar
1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries (such as Ocean SprayÂ®)

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add sugar and cook until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Mix cranberries into the sugar water; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until desired consistency is reached, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
A great side dish for Thanksgiving dinner. It can be used as filling for cranberry/cream cheese tarts and also makes a great topping on bagels, corn bread, or cheesecake. Pour into a serving dish or jars and cover. The pectin in the cranberries will make the cranberry sauce gel as it cools. I usually use a fork to mix it up which will make it more pliable.
