Ingredients:
1/3C Olive Oil
2Tbsp Fresh Lemon or Lime Juice
Zest from Lemon or Lime
2Tbsp Balsamic Vinegar
2Tbsp Worcestershire Sauce
1/3C Grated Parmesan Cheese
2-3 Cloves Crushed Garlic
1 Can Flat Anchovies Minced
2 Raw Eggs
Fresh Ground Black Pepper
Romaine Lettuce
Croutons

Directions:
Using a nonreactive bowl I mix together the olive oil, juice, zest, vinegar, Worcester, crushed garlic, eggs, Parmesan, and  anchovies. After washing and coarsely cutting the romaine toss in the bowl until coated. Add fresh ground black pepper to taste. I like to let the salad stand for about 10 minutes prior to serving to let it slightly wilt the romaine lettuce.
Options include adding mustard, capers, pickled onions, etc...

Description: 
My father began in food service in the early 50's and worked in many parts of the USA. Not sure where he came across this dressing but it was a regular at our dinner table. It is very easy to adjust for you taste. Be creative!
