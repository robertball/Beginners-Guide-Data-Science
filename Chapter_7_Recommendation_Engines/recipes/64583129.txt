Ingredients:
1/2 cup of Dijon mustard
1/4 cup of maple syrup
1 tablespoon of rice wine vinegar.
2 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 8)
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 Tbsp fresh rosemary

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 450º F.
Mix Dijon mustard,  maple syrup, rice wine vinegar.
Put chicken thighs into a 7 x 11 inch baking dish. Then, salt and pepper the thighs. Pour your maple mustard mixture over them, turning the thighs in the mixture so they are fully coated.
Put the chicken thighs into the oven, and let them bake for 40 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 165ºF. Baste the tops of the chicken with the sauce half way through.  Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before serving. Plate the chicken, whisk the sauce that remains in the baking dish, and then spoon the extra sauce over the top. Sprinkle over some fresh rosemary.

Description: 
I have never gotten so many compliments before, let alone for a piece of chicken. I have never encountered a dish that is so basic and simple to put together yet creates such a big pay off. This chicken, quite simply, is one of the most savory things I’ve ever eaten. If you are the busiest person on the planet and don’t have much cooking experience, but you have to prepare a meal to woo the love of your life, cook this chicken!
