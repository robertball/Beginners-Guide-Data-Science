Ingredients:
2 cups cooked chicken
1 can (10 3/4 ounces) condensed cream of mushroom soup, undiluted
1 can (10 3/4 ounces) condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted
2 soup cans water
4 teaspoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 can refrigerated buttermilk biscuits (8 biscuits)

Directions:
1.	Mix all ingredients, except biscuits, in 4 1/2-quart CROCK-POT® slow cooker.
2.	Cut biscuits into quarters and gently stir into mixture. Cover; cook on LOW 4 to 6 hours.
Don't add water to the CROCK-POT® slow cooker, unless the recipe specifically says to do so. Foods don't lose as much moisture during slow cooking as they can during conventional cooking, so follow the recipe guidelines for best results.
