Ingredients:
Flatbread:
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 cup lukewarm water
1 pinch white sugar
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
Topping:
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
6 ounces bacon strips, diced
3 onions, cut in half and thinly sliced
3/4 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons heavy cream
3/4 cup sour cream
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley

Directions:
Place 3 cups plus 3 tablespoons of flour in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Add yeast, 3 to 4 tablespoons of the lukewarm water, and sugar into the well and stir in a small amount of flour from the sides. Set aside until mixture is frothy, about 10 minutes.
Pour in remaining water and olive oil. Mix with a wooden spoon until everything is well combined.  Add 1 teaspoon salt and knead vigorously with your hands until dough holds together as a ball.
Loosely cover dough with a clean dish towel and let rise in a warm, dry place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
Prepare the topping while dough rises. Stir 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of heavy cream and sour cream in a bowl until smooth; season with salt, pepper, and parsley.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll out 2 pieces as thinly as possible into long rectangles on a large piece of parchment, so both will fit on one baking sheet. Fold the sides of the dough pieces to form a 1/4-inch edge all around. Spread cream topping evenly across the dough and top each dough piece with 1/4 of the bacon and the onion rings. Transfer the 2 flammkuchen with the parchment paper onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes. Repeat with the other 2 dough pieces.
