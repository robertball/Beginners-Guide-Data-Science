Ingredients:
1/3 cup organic ketchup
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoons canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce
2 teaspoons cider vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
4 bone-in, skin-on chicken breast halves (about 3 lb.)
Cooking spray

Directions:
1. To prepare sauce, combine first 6 ingredients in a small saucepan; bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat; simmer 15 to 20 minutes or until thickened.
2. To prepare chicken, combine garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, cumin, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl. Loosen skin from breast halves by inserting fingers, gently pushing between skin and meat. Rub the spice mixture evenly under loosened skin; let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.
3. Preheat grill to medium-high heat, lighting only one side of the grill to enable both direct and indirect grilling.
4. Coat grill rack with cooking spray; place chicken, skin side down, on lit side of grill (direct heat). Cover and grill 8 minutes on each side. Remove skin from chicken; discard skin. Baste chicken with sauce mixture. Move chicken to the unlit side of the grill (indirect heat). Cover and grill an additional 5 minutes on each side or until done, basting every minute. Serve with remaining sauce.
