Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 cups sliced onion
3 garlic cloves, crushed
8 1/2 cups beef stock
1 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 bay leaves
1 1/4 pounds Montreal smoked meat (smoked brisket)
1/3 pound thinly sliced Canadian bacon
10 (7 inch) baguettes, slit lengthwise but still attached

Directions:
Heat butter in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
Pour beef stock, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce into onion mixture; add bay leaves. Drop in Montreal smoked meat and Canadian bacon one slice at a time. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.
Use tongs to remove meat from the stock and distribute evenly inside sandwich baguettes. Remove bay leaves; ladle stock into individual bowls for dipping. Serve hot.

Description: 
A new twist on a classic dish, made with Montreal smoked meat, a smoky beef, and Canadian bacon. In our house, we usually eat the au jus after we're done dipping our sandwiches in it.
