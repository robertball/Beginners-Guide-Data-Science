Ingredients:
1 cup of marsala cooking wine
8 cups of chicken broth
3 bay leaves
12 boneless skinless chicken breasts
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup of butter
1 larege onion, diced finely
2 bunches of green onions, sliced finely
1-1 1/2 cups of flour
2 cups of frozen mixed veggies

Directions:
1.)  In a medium stock pot bring the marsala wine, chicken broth and bay leaves to a boil.  Place chicken breast into mixture and cook them for 10-15 minutes
2.)  In a second skillet add olive oil and butter.  When the butter melts add the onion and saute for 5 minutes or until tender.  Add the flour and cook for another 3-5 minutes.
3.)  Remove the chicken from the stock mixture and dice it up into bite size pices.  Slowly pour the stock mixture into the onion roux (the other pot) constantly whisking.  Discard the bay leaves, add the mixed veggies to the pot and add the chicken.  Heat until sauce is boiling, remove from heat and serve! (you may add extra seasonings if desired)
