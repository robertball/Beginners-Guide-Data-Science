Ingredients:
1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces
1 tablespoon garam masala
1 tablespoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons olive oil
2  onions, chopped
1 cup chicken broth
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
4  potatoes, peeled and cubed
4 tablespoons curry powder
salt and pepper to taste
2 ounces golden raisins

Directions:
Rub the chicken with garam masala and garlic powder. In a large saute pan, over medium heat brown chicken in olive oil in a large pot.
Remove chicken and saute onions in the same oil, until golden. Return the chicken to the pan and cover with the broth. Simmer until the meat is tender and can be easily picked off of the bone. Remove the chicken to cool.
Mix the soup into the broth in the pan, then add the potatoes and the curry. Simmer until tender. As soon as the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the skin and bones and, if necessary, cut into bite size pieces. When the potatoes are done, add the meat to the potato mixture and heat through. You may add golden raisins at this point if desired, adjust seasonings and serve!
