Description: 
This cranberry drinking vinegar is a great way to spruce up your holiday drinks and cocktails. Add a bit of sparkling water, ginger beer, or tonic water for a non-alcoholic sipper. Or, add a splash of gin or vodka with a few ounces of your favorite sparkling water for a tangy cocktail. It's even delicious as a substitute for plain vinegar in your vinaigrette recipe.
