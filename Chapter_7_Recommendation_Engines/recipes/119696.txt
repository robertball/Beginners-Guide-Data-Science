Ingredients:
5 eggs, beaten
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup chocolate malted milk powder
2 cups milk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
4 cups whipping cream
1 cup malted milk balls, crushed

Directions:
In a heavy saucepan, combine the eggs, sugar and malted milk powder.  Gradually add milk. Cook and stir over low heat until mixture reaches 160 degrees F and coats the back of a metal spoon. Remove from the heat. Cool quickly by placing pan in a bowl of ice water; stir for 2 minutes. Stir in vanilla. Press plastic wrap onto surface of custard. Refrigerate for several hours or overnight.
Stir in cream and malted milk balls. Fill cylinder of ice cream freezer two-thirds full; freeze according to manufacturer's instructions. Refrigerate remaining mixture until ready to freeze. Allow to ripen in ice cream freezer or firm up in your refrigerator freezer 2-4 hours before serving.
