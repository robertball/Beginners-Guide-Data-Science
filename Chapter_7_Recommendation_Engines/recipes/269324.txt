Ingredients:
4 egg yolks
4 tablespoons water
4 tablespoons Marsala wine
4 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Pour a few inches of water into a pan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low to keep water at a simmer. Combine egg yolks, water, Marsala, and sugar in a large heat-proof bowl and set above the simmering water. Cook, whisking constantly with a balloon whisk, until sugar is dissolved and mixture starts to thicken, about 2 minutes.
Continue cooking and whisking until sabayon is the texture of mousse and holds its shape, 15 to 20 minutes. Lift bowl occasionally to let steam escape and keep eggs from overcooking. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Sabayon is a creamy yet dairy-free dessert. Use an oversized bowl to allow room for the balloon whisk. Whisk in large, gentle strokes rather than furiously; you're trying to give the mousse time to cook.
