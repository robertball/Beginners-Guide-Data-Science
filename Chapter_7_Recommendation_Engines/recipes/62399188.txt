Ingredients:
4 pounds russet potatoes, cut into 1/4 inch cubes (may use 4 lbs of frozen cubed hash browns)
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 onion, chopped
2 tablespoons butter (I use olive oil)
1 (8 ounce) package shredded colby-Monterey Jack cheese blend
1 (8 ounce) bottle Ranch dressing

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Place the potatoes in the baking dish. Season with chili powder, salt, garlic powder and pepper. In a non-stick frying pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat (or use olive oil); saute chopped onion in melted butter (or oil) until onions are soft. Pour onion mixture over potatos in baking dish and lightly toss to mix. Cover dish with aluminum foil, and bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, until potatoes are tender. Remove from oven, and mix in the cheese and Ranch dressing. Continue cooking 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
