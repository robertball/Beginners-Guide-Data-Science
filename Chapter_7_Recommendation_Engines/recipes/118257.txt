Ingredients:
1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
6 tablespoons butter or margarine, divided
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 (6 ounce) fillets trout
1/3 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute mushrooms in 2 tablespoons butter until tender. Stir in parsley. Remove mushrooms to a serving platter; keep warm. Combine flour and salt in a shallow dish; coat fillets with flour mixture on both sides. Add 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet. Cook trout over medium heat for 8-10 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily with a fork; arrange over mushrooms.
For sauce, melt remaining butter in a small saucepan. Gradually stir in cream and lemon juice. Bring to a boil for 3-4 minutes or until slightly thickened, stirring constantly. Serve over trout and mushrooms.

Description: 
A mild lemon sauce accented by fresh mushrooms complements these tender trout fillets from Kathy Kittell of Lenexa, Kansas. 'When fish is on sale, I buy plenty to serve to my large brood, because it always gets eaten up right away,' she notes.
