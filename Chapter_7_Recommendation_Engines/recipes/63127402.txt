Ingredients:
2 celery ribs, chopped
1 green pepper, chopped
1 small, sweet onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 cup chicken stock
1/2-1 tbsp cajun seasoning
3 (16 ounce) cans red beans, drained
1/4 pound ham steak, chopped into 1/2 inch 'chunks'
1/2 pound sausage, cut into pieces
4 cups cooked rice

Directions:
In a medium pot saute celery, onions, green pepper and garlic until tender.
Add stock, beans, ham, and seasoning mixture. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Remove about a cup to a cup and a half of the beans and mash them with a fork or a potato masher, then return the mashed beans to the skillet. Add sausage and return the mixture to a boil. Simmer for for 5-10 minutes, or until it reaches the desired thickness.
Serve over rice.

Description: 
I rarely have time to soak beans, so I came up with this quick 'cheat' for decent red beans and rice. It's a simple recipe, that's pretty close to what I used to eat back when I was a kid.
