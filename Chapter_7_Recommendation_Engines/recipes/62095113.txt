Ingredients:
6 eggs
water
all purpose flour
salt and pepper
2 large cans tomato juice

Directions:
Crack eggs into medium size mixing bowl.
Add 1/2 shell of water per each egg.
Add a couple of shakes of salt.
Beat lightly with fork and add enough flour to make a soft dough.
Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead until dough is elastic and not sticky.
Roll out very thin and slice into 1" x 2" size pieces.
Bring juice to boil in a large pot and drop dumplings in rolling juice one at a time.
Stir every so often to prevent dumplings from sticking to bottom.
Cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring often.
Add salt and pepper to taste (liberal pepper!).

Description: 
Simple, comforting dumplings in a tomato base, best served with sausage patties and a side salad of wilted greens. (I like to eat a bite of sausage with a bite of dumplings at the same time!)
