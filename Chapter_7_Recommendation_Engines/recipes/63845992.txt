Ingredients:
1 12 oz. package semi-sweet chocolate chips or chunks
1 14 oz. can sweetened condensed milk

1 10 oz. package mini marshmallows

Directions:
In a double boiler, melt chocolate chips, milk, and butter. Remove from heat.
Fold in walnuts and marshmallows.
Line a 13 x 9 pan with wax paper or parchment paper (tip: spraying the pan with cooking spray first will help the wax paper stick better).
Spread fudge mixture evenly in pan and chill for 2 hours, or until firm.
