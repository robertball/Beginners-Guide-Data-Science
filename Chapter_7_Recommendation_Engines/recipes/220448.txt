Ingredients:
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1 cup light brown sugar, packed
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup Irish cream liqueur
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted

Directions:
Grease an 8-inch square baking pan and line with 2 pieces of parchment paper about 14 inches long; allow the ends of the paper to hang over the sides of the pan by several inches.
Stir evaporated milk, light brown sugar, white sugar, unsalted butter, and salt in a heavy saucepan over medium heat until the mixture forms a thick, smooth syrup.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until a candy thermometer inserted into the center of the boiling syrup without touching the bottom of the pan reads 238 degrees F (112 degrees C), 20 to 30 minutes. Stir often. Candy temperature will rise slowly at first, then more quickly as temperature increases; watch carefully.
Remove saucepan from heat and stir in the Irish cream liqueur and vanilla extract until thoroughly combined.
Scrape the mixture into the work bowl of a large stand mixer fitted with beaters; set the machine on low speed and mix in confectioners' sugar in 3 additions, allowing the sugar to blend in completely before adding the next addition. Scrape down the bowl frequently and mix fudge until completely smooth, about 2 minutes.
Scrape fudge into the prepared baking pan and place on a level surface to cool and set up, 3 to 5 hours.
Use the parchment paper ends as handles to lift the fudge out of the baking pan before slicing into cubes for serving.

It's really Christmas once this fudge is made. This festive fudge is always the star of my annual cookie tray exchange and a requested gift by friends and family. I like to shop every year for unique gift wrap. Whether it's Chinese take-out boxes or miniature tins, it's enjoyed by all.
