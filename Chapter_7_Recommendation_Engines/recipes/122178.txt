Description: 
Other fruits are often used in relishes and sauces, but I decided to make one with my favorites - strawberries and blueberries. I get rave reviews when I serve this fruity, distinctive salsa over meat. It's also delicious atop a spinach or lettuce salad. -Diane Hixon, Niceville, Florida
