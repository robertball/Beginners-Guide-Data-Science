Ingredients:
For the Crust:
1 cup finely crushed pretzels
Â¼ cup sugar
1/3 cup margarine or butter, melted
For the Filling:
One 14-oz can sweetened condensed milk
1/3 cup frozen limeade concentrate, thawed

1 cup whipping cream
Lime slices (optional)

Directions:
For the Crust:
Stir together crushed pretzels and sugar.  Stir in melted margarine or butter.  Spread mixture evenly into a 9-inch pie plate.  Press onto bottom and sides to form a firm, even crust.  Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F oven for 5 minutes or till edge is lightly browned.  Cool on a rack.
For the Filling:
In a large mixing bowl combine sweetened condensed milk, limeade concentrate, tequila, orange liqueur and, if desired, food coloring.  In a medium mixing bowl beat whipping cream till soft peaks form; fold into tequila mixture.  Spoon filling into crust.  Cover and freeze about 4 hours, or till firm. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.  If desired, garnish with lime slices.
