3/4 cup chopped pecans
3/4 cup packed golden brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
Cake Batter:
2 cups all-purpose flour

Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and sugar in large bowl.
Stir in melted butter, sour cream, milk, eggs, vanilla, and apples until smooth. Pour into prepared pan.
