Ingredients:
3/4 cup uncooked short-grain white rice
1 1/2 cups water
2 cups 2% milk
1 teaspoon maple flavored extract
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground cloves
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Combine the rice and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and let simmer over low heat for 20 minutes, or until all of the water has been absorbed.
Stir in 1 3/4 cups of the milk, sugar and maple flavoring, bring to a boil, and let simmer over medium heat until thick and creamy, about 15 minutes. Stir in the remaining milk, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and butter. Cook stirring over low heat for another 5 minutes. Pour into a casserole dish, or serving bowls, and let stand for 5 minutes before serving. This can be served cold also.
