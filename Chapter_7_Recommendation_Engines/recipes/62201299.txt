Ingredients:
For the salad:
1 medium spaghetti squash (3-4lbs)
2 english cucumbers
1 small red onion, sliced thinly
8 oz cherry tomatoes
6 oz kalamata olives, pitted and halved
1 clove of chopped garlic
For the dressing:
2 lemons (and zest from 1)
4-6 tbs of olive oil
1 tbs of garlic salt
Pepper to taste

Directions:
Slice the squash length wise into 2 halves.  Turn the oven to 350 degrees and bake the squash halves flesh side down for about 30 minutes, or until you can easily cut into the skin side with a knife.  Take out the oven and set aside to cool.
In the mean time, slice the cherry tomatoes into two halves.  Peel, seed and slice the 2 english cucumbers.  Combine the tomatoes, cucumbers, thinly sliced red onions and the olives into a salad bowl, add the chopped garlic.  When the squash has thoroughly cooled, scoop the flesh out as spaghetti strands and mix in with the salad mixture.  Take care to combine well.
In a small bowl, combine zest of 1 lemon and the juice from 2 lemons.  Slowly wisk in the olive oil until smooth.  Add the garlic salt and pepper to taste.
Add the dressing mixture to the salad, toss thoroughly and chill in the refrigirator for at least 2 hours before serving.
