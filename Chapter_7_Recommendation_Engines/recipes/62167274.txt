Ingredients:
3 lbs Golden Delicious apples, cored, pared, and quartered (or any tart apple)
2 lbs Red Delicious apples, cored, pared, and quartered (or any sweet apple)
3/4 cup water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger (optional)

Directions:
Place apples, water, and lemon juice into a large pot.
Bring contents to a boil, stirring occasionally.
Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, or until the apples become soft and easily breakdown.
Remove from heat.
Add in the remaining spices, if desired.
Using a potato masher for chunky applesauce, or a food processor for smooth applesauce, mash/blend the ingredients together.
Allow to cool slightly.  Serve warm or chilled.
