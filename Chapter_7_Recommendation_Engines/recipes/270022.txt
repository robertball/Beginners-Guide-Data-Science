Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 onion, sliced
10 cloves garlic, diced
1 (1 inch) piece ginger root, peeled and grated
2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar
3 pounds chuck roast, trimmed and cut into several large pieces
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon chile-garlic paste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Add butter and onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds more. Deglaze the pot with vinegar and scrape the bottom. Add chuck pieces, brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, chile-garlic paste, salt, and black pepper.
Close and lock the lid; be sure vent is closed. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 45 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Remove beef and shred.
