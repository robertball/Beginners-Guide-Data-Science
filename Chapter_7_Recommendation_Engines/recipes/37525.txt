Ingredients:
1 (19.8 ounce) package brownie mix
1 1/2 cups cold milk
1 (3.4 ounce) package JELL-O Vanilla Flavor Instant Pudding & Pie Filling
3 drops red food coloring
3 drops yellow food coloring

Directions:
Prepare and bake brownie mix as directed on package for 8 or 9-inch square baking pan. Remove from oven. Immediately poke holes down through brownies to pan, 1-inch apart with wooden spoon handle.
Pour milk into large bowl. Add pudding mix. Beat with wire whisk 2 minutes. Stir in a few drops food coloring to tint mixture orange. Quickly pour about 1/2 of the thin pudding evenly over warm brownies and into holes. Tap pan lightly to fill holes. Let remaining pudding mixture stand to thicken slightly. Spread remaining pudding over top of brownies to "frost".
Refrigerate 1 hour or until ready to serve. Cut into 2-inch squares. Cut each square diagonally into triangles.
