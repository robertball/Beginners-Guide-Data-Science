Ingredients:
1 cup coconut milk
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
2-1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2-1/2 cups flour
1 beaten egg

Directions:
In a bowl mix the coconut milk, sugar and cinnamon; heat in the microwave to 110 degrees fahrenheit; stir the cinnamon into the milk again; add the yeast and wait about fifteen to twenty minutes for it to begin growing
Add the salt and oil, stirring
Add the flour about a cup at a time, finally kneading a little with your hands; form a ball; coat top with oil; cover with a towel and let rest an hour
Begin preheating oven to 350 degrees
Using a knife, scrape the dough onto a floured surface; using two knives and working in opposing directions cut the dough into even thirds then each portion into halves and again into halves (making twelve equal-sized portions)
Grease a cookie sheet and using a knife scrape one of the portions of dough from the surface and into your floured hand, work into a ball using both hands, distributing onto the sheet; dust each dough ball with flour; let rise again for another 30 minutes
Place onto center rack of oven and cook for 10 minutes; brush each roll with beaten egg and put back into oven for another 10-12 minutes until golden brown; rolls should be springy to the touch when done
Place rolls on a wire rack to cool

Description: 
My Honduran friend described the various coconut-flavored breads where she's from and was so enthusiastic about them that I wanted to try these as well. I've created this recipe so that you can try them, too. These dinner rolls are sweet-tasting and smell wonderful just coming out of the oven.  Your family should enjoy them.  Feel free to double the recipe if you need more servings.
