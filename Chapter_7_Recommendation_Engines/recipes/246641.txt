Ingredients:
2 pounds beef short ribs
3 tablespoons soy sauce
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 Korean radish (mu), cut into 1-inch slices
1/2 onion
2 cloves garlic
1 slice fresh ginger
4 ounces Korean glass noodles (dangmyun)
2 scallions, sliced into 1-inch pieces
1 tablespoon cooked egg strips (optional)
1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
Soak ribs in a large bowl of cold water to drain residual blood, changing water as needed, about 1 hour. Drain.
Mix soy sauce, 4 cloves minced garlic, sesame oil, and pepper together in a bowl. Add sliced radish.
Place ribs in a large pot and cover with water. Add onion half, 2 cloves garlic, and ginger. Bring to a boil, skimming any foam that floats to the top, about 15 minutes. Drain, discarding onion, garlic, and ginger.
Rinse ribs and return to the pot. Cover with fresh water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.
Stir radish mixture into the pot. Cook until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Add noodles and scallions; cook until noodles are tender, 2 to 4 minutes.
Ladle soup into bowls. Garnish with egg strips and toasted sesame seeds.
