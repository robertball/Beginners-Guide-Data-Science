Ingredients:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup ketchup
1 large clove garlic, pressed
3 cups canola oil for frying
2 green plantains, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
1 pinch garlic salt

Directions:
Combine the mayonnaise, ketchup, and garlic in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fry plantain chunks until golden but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Allow the plantains to cool slightly, then smash each piece of plantain in a tostonero or with the bottom of a clean can. Fry the flattened plantains a second time until golden and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes more. Season with garlic salt.

Description: 
I love plantains and I craved these all the time when I was pregnant. They are great as a side dish or appetizer. After you smash them, but before you fry them the second time, you can put them in a resealable plastic bag and freeze them for later. There's no need to defrost them but be careful when you drop them in the hot oil. You can adjust the mayonnaise to ketchup ratio to your liking and add more or less garlic.
