Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups butter (can be cut to 1 1/4 cups)
3/4 cups minced onion
2/3 tsp salt
1 loaf day-old bread (10 cups), lightly packed crumbs or cubes
1/4 cup diced celery
1 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning
1/2 cup minced parsley
1/4 tsp pepper
2 eggs (beaten)
1 cup turkey/chicken broth

Directions:
Melt butter in deep kettle.  Add onion; simmer until tender.  Add celery. Combine rest of ingredients except bread crumbs.  Add to butter mixture.  Fold in bread crumbs and heat well, without browning, stirring frequently.  Be careful to JUST heat, not cook, the stuffing.
Note: Just keep multiplying the quantities to suit the appetite of your family.  This will fill a small turkey (8-10 lb), but I always make more and bake in a covered dish for 30 mins at 300 degrees.  You can also microwave small quantities of uncooked stuffing ... Do NOT overbake)

Description: 
This recipe has been in my family for more than 60 years.  We fix it every Thanksgiving, and it is more of a Thanksgiving staple than the turkey itself.  [We quadruple the recipe to get us through the holiday.]
