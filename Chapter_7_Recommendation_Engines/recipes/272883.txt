Ingredients:
½ cup peanut butter
6 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
3 ½ tablespoons rice vinegar
3 tablespoons brown sugar
3 tablespoons sesame oil
2  red Thai chiles, seeded and finely chopped
2 tablespoons chile-garlic sauce
2 tablespoons freshly grated ginger
1 teaspoon fish sauce
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
1 cup matchstick carrots
1  red bell pepper, sliced into thin strips
4  green onions, thinly sliced
2 cups bean sprouts, rinsed and drained
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 (16 ounce) package pad Thai rice noodles
1 tablespoon chopped unsalted peanuts (optional)

Directions:
Whisk together peanut butter, soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, sesame oil, Thai chiles, chile-garlic sauce, ginger, fish sauce, and pepper in a bowl until smooth. Set aside.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large wok or non-stick pan over high heat. Add chicken and stir constantly until almost cooked, about 3 minutes. Pour in 1/4 cup sauce mixture to chicken. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer chicken with its juices to a bowl.
Reduce heat to medium-high. Heat remaining tablespoon olive oil in the same wok or pan used for chicken. Add carrots; cook and stir until just softened but still crunchy, about 3 minutes. Stir in bell pepper; cook until softened, about 1 minute. Add reserved chicken with its juices, remaining sauce, green onions, bean sprouts, and cilantro. Cook and stir until just heated, about 1 minute. Keep warm.
Meanwhile place noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Set aside until noodles are softened, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Stir cooked noodles into vegetable mixture. Garnish with peanuts.

Description: 
This Thai peanut noodle dish is a delicious recipe with just the right amount of heat! It's simple to prepare, but requires a bit of organization while assembling/cooking, because it goes quickly. Preparing your ingredients beforehand is key! For vegetarians, you can make this without the chicken and fish sauce and it tastes just as good! Serve hot. You could also garnish this with chopped unsalted peanuts.
