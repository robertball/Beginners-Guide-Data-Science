Ingredients:
3/4 cup chopped onion
1 1/2 cups chopped celery (with leaves)
1 cup margarine or butter
9 cups soft bread cubes
2 t. salt
1 t. dried sage leaves
1 t. dried thyme leaves
1/2 t. pepper
poultry seasoning to taste

Directions:
Cook and stir onion and celery in butter in large skillet or saucepan until onion is tender.  Put bread cubes in very large bowl. You can make this part a day ahead to save time the day you are making the stuffing and store in refrigerator. Rewarm mixture the next day. Sprinkle the bread evenly with all of the seasonings being careful to not pour in one spot.  This will ensure that you don't have certain parts of your stuffing that is a very strong taste of the spices.  Carefully pour and stir the onion, celery, and butter mixture over the bread cubes.  Mix well.  You can then stuff your turkey or we usually just warm in a 350 degree oven in a covered casserole dish so as to not dry out for around an hour depending if you want it moist or a little crispy around the edges.
