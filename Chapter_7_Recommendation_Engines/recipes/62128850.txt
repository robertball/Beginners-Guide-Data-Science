Description: 
I LOVE the Haagan Daas Bailey's Irish Cream ice cream, so when I got my own ice cream maker I went looking for a recipe to duplicate it. To my horror after an extensive search of the internet I could only fine one, and it was WAY to large for my 2 quart maker. So I came up with one of my own. The result was a surprisingly good substitute for the expencive Haagan Daas! Because of the liqueur it takes a bit longer to harden then recipes without liqueur but the wait is worth it!
