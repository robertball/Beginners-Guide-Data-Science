Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.

On the prepared grill, cook the burgers 3 to 5 minutes on each side, or to desired doneness.

Description: 
These aren't your everyday hamburgers. They taste a little different, but this is the only way I make them. Everyone loves these, and they are fairly simple to make. The brown sugar brings out the flavors of the other spices. Please note that these aren't exact measurements.  I just throw a little of this and a little of that in.
