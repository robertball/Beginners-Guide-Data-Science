Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages fresh pasta of your choice
1/2 cup white wine
3/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons sour cream
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon olive oil
8 ounces medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
8 ounces small scallops
1/2 yellow bell pepper, cut into strips
1/2 orange bell pepper, cut into strips
1/8 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Bring white wine and milk to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in sour cream and Parmesan cheese, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in cilantro.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and scallops, and cook until the shrimp begin to firm and turn pink. Stir in the yellow and orange peppers, season with Cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper; continue cooking until peppers are tender.
To serve, place cooked pasta into a serving bowl, top with seafood mixture, and pour sauce overtop.

Description: 
Easy, quick and creamy. Shrimp and scallops are sauteed and served on a bed of orecchiette pasta with a yummy sauce. The sauce can be used for a variety of things. If a tomboy like me can invent this dish, a guy can cook it!
