Description: 
Spicy, but still smooth and creamy, the dish is a favorite for our family. Basic ingredients + quick to make + one pan to clean = WINNER! I found this recipe in a little cook booklet I picked up from the grocery store checkout years ago. Thank goodness because it's been a lifesaver when I don't know what to make. I buy the sausage when it's on sale and freeze it so I'm always ready to whip this up.
