Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package spaghetti
1/4 cup olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 pounds fresh spinach
20 cherry tomatoes
1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 lemon, zested and juiced
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in garlic and cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir spinach, cherry tomatoes, and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until spinach is wilted and cherry tomatoes start to burst, about 5 minutes.
Toss spinach mixture with cooked spaghetti; stir in lemon zest and juice. Season with salt and pepper.
