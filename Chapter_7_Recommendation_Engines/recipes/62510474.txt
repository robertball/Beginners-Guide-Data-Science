Drop batter by tablespoonfuls into hot oil and flatten with a spatula. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until golden brown, turn over and cook other side for about 3 minutes, or until golden brown.

I'm not Jewish, but I like to celebrate Hanukkah. I love to make these delicious traditional potato latkes during Hanukkah and other times of the year. You will crave these crispy fried potato pancakes topped with sour cream and applesauce for Hanukkah or anytime of the year.
