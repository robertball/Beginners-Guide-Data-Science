Ingredients:
Pastry:
2,5 cups (250g) all purpose flour (or a little more if needed)

1/2 cup (80g) granulated sugar
2 eggs (1½ for the pastry mixture, ½ for brushing the top)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Filling:
2 lbs apples (tart, bit sour)
1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
1/2 cup (70g) raisins
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Mix the flour, softened butter, sugar, cinnamon and 1½ eggs in a bowl. Knead it with your hands to a consistent, smooth dough.
Roll out ¾ of the dough to cover the bottom and sides of a greased round (9 inch) cake tin or spring form tin.
Preheat the oven to 335 degrees F.
Peel, core and slice the apples. Mix this with 50g sugar, sultanas and cinnamon. Put this mixture into the prepared cake tin
Roll out the remaining dough and cut out long strips (1/2 inch wide). Cover the apples with the strips (crossways/lattice) and press the sides down a bit. Brush with remaining (beaten) egg.
Bake for 60-65 minutes, or until pastry is light brown.
