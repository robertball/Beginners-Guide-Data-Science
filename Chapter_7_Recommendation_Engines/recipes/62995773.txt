Ingredients:
1 pkg active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F)
3 cups all purpose flour divided
3 cups white sugar, divided
3 cups warm milk (110 degrees F), divided

Directions:
Before starting, remember: Do not use metal bowls or utensils. Do not refrigerate. The starter will take 10 days to ferment.
Day 1: In a small bowl, soften yeast in warm water for about 10 minutes. Stir well. In a 2-quart glass or ceramic bowl, combine 1 cup sifted flour and 1 cup sugar. Mix thoroughly or flour will lump when milk is added.  Slowly stir in 1 cup warm milk and the dissolved yeast mixture. Cover loosely with lid or plastic wrap. The mixture will get bubbly. Consider this Day 1 of the cycle.
Days 2 through 4: Stir mixture with a wooden or plastic spoon once a day.
Day 5: Stir with wooden or plastic spoon. Then add 1 cup sifted flour, 1 cup sugar and 1 cup warm milk and stir.
Days 6 through 9: Stir mixture with a wooden or plastic spoon once a day.
Day 10: Stir with wooden or plastic spoon. Then add 1 cup sifted flour, 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup warm milk and stir. Remove 1 cup of batter to make your first friendship bread. Reserve another cup to begin the 10-day process all over again. Then give 1-cup portions of starter to your friends in 1-gallon Ziploc bags, along with copies of the recipes for starter and friendship bread
