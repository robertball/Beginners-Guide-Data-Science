Ingredients:
3/4 cup sour cream
1/2 cup low-fat greek style yoghurt
4 tbsp olive oil
1 egg
1 tsp salt (if doing a sweet version, reduce to 1/2 tsp)
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tbsp + 1 tsp baking powder
2 tbsp half-and-half
3 tbsp poppy seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 390 F.
Sift flour and baking powder together. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat the egg with the salt and the olive oil. Add sour cream  and yoghurt. Mix well.
Stir dry ingredients into wet and mix with a wooden spoon until combined.
Spoon dough into a buttered muffin mold - the original recipe will yield around 12 muffins.
Brush some half-and-half on top of the muffins and then sprinkle with poppy seeds. (Hint: You can also sub poppy seeds for sesame, or whatever you prefer)
Using a kitchen knife or scissors, slice into the top crosswise so that they rise prettier.
Bake in lower third of oven for about 20 minutes or until done.

These delightful little muffins are always a treat at Sunday brunch! Top them with cream cheese, cucumber and roast beef, and serve with a side of scrambled eggs - or go for a sweet version with strawberry jam or Nutella... they're very versatile.
