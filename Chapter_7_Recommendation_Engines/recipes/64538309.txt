Ingredients:
4 garlic cloves, chopped
2 cups distilled white vinegar
½ cup olive oil
¼ cup kosher salt
2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley
2 Tbsp paprika
1 Tbsp freshly ground black pepper
1 cup vegetable oil, divided
1 3½–4-pound chicken, halved

Directions:
Purée garlic, vinegar, olive oil, salt, parsley, paprika, pepper, and ½ cup vegetable oil in a blender until smooth. Place chicken in a large resealable plastic bag and pour marinade over. Seal bag and chill chicken 1–3 days.
Remove chicken from marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Let sit uncovered at room temperature 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 400°. Heat remaining ½ cup vegetable oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Place 1 chicken half, skin side down, in skillet, set another skillet or heavy pot on top, and add a couple of cans to weigh it down. Cook until skin is browned and crisp, 15–20 minutes. Transfer chicken to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chicken half.
Roast chicken in oven, skin side up, until cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thigh registers 165°, 20–25 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 15 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
Yes, it is worth the effort. If you have a 14-inch cast iron skillet, you can go straight from stovetop to oven.
