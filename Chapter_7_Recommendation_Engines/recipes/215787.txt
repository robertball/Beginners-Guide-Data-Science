Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 1/2 pounds ground pork
2 cups dry bread crumbs
1 cup finely chopped sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®)
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup barbeque sauce
1/2 cup ketchup

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and scrape the grates clean. Spray grates with nonstick cooking spray.
In a bowl, mix together the ground beef, ground pork, bread crumbs, onion, egg, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, tarragon, sea salt, and black pepper. Divide the mixture in half, and form 2 loaves, each about 4 inches in diameter and 6 inches long. In a small bowl, mix the barbecue sauce with ketchup until well combined.
Place each meatloaf directly on the prepared grill grates, then spread each with about 3 tablespoons of barbecue sauce mixture; grill until the loaves reach an internal temperature of at least 160 degrees F (73 degrees C), about 1 hour.
