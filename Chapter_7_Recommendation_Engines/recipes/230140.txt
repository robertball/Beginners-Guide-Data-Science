Ingredients:
1 cup vegetable shortening (such as CriscoÂ®)
3 cups white sugar
6 eggs
1 cup sour cream
3 cups sifted cake flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon coconut extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch tube pan.
Beat vegetable shortening and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until mixture is creamy. Beat eggs into shortening mixture, one at a time, letting each egg blend in before adding the next. Beat in sour cream until smooth.
Gradually stir cake flour and baking soda into the moist ingredients until batter is smooth; stir in coconut extract. Scoop batter into prepared tube pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean or with moist crumbs, 1 hour and 20 minutes.

Description: 
My mother-in-law always makes this pound cake for holidays. That makes this cake very special, but it really could be made any time of the year! Even people who don't like the texture of coconut love this cake because the only coconut in it is the flavoring.
