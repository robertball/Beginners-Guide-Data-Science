Description: 
My husband's favorite soup of all time and as a chef, that's saying a lot!  It's fast, inexpensive, and easy to make.  If someone has a cold, it really beats the standard Chicken Noodle soup.  Having the specific ingredients on hand is the only caveat, but I find having them means I can also make some other yummy Asian dishes!
