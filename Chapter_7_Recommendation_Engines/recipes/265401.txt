Ingredients:
8 ounces fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced
1 tablespoon sugar
1 center-cut slice of watermelon, about 1 inch thick
1 cup whipped cream, or to taste

Directions:
Mix strawberries and sugar together in a medium bowl until the strawberries are thoroughly coated. Allow the strawberries to macerate for 10 to 20 minutes.
Cut the round watermelon slice into 8 wedges, and keep them together. Pat dry with a paper towel or clean dish towel.
Spray or spoon the whipped cream onto the center of the watermelon round; don't be afraid to pile it on, as the cream will sink under the weight of the strawberries.
Spoon the macerated strawberries and their juices over the whipped cream and serve immediately.

Description: 
For a fun take on a classic summer entertaining dessert, try this simple strawberry shortcake watermelon pizza. You can use either store-bought or homemade whipped cream (or try a vegan whipped cream recipe). Either way, the key is to serve this right away as the whipped cream can melt pretty quickly.
