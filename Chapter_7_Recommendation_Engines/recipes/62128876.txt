Ingredients:
For Mini-Cupcakes:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup whole milk
1 vanilla bean, split and scraped
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
1 large egg
For Cream Cheese Frosting:
3 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
1/4 stick unsalted butter, room temperature
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup powdered sugar
Food coloring

Directions:
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line 3 mini-muffin tins with mini-muffin cups.
Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Stir together milk and vanilla bean seeds in a small bowl.
Beat together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg and beat until just combined. Reduce speed to low, then add flour and milk mixtures alternately in batches, beginning and ending with flour and mixing until just combined.
Divide batter among muffin cups, filling them two-thirds full, and bake until tops are pale golden, about 12-13 minutes. Transfer cupcakes to a rack and cool completely.
Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, butter and vanilla in large bowl until smooth. Add powdered sugar 1 cup at a time, beating until smooth after each addition. Transfer to bowls and stir in food coloring of your choice. Spread 1-2 tsp frosting onto each cooled cupcake.

These tiny bites have a lovely, rich vanilla flavour which comes from using real vanilla bean seeds.
