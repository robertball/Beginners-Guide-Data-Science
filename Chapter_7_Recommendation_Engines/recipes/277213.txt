Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms, stems removed
4 tablespoons Italian-style salad dressing
4 tablespoons butter
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
4 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
4 tablespoons dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Brush both sides of each mushroom cap with Italian dressing. Arrange mushrooms on a baking sheet, gill-sides up.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 12 minutes. Drain any juice that has formed in the mushrooms. Leave the oven on.
Heat butter in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in the hot butter until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir spinach, cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, and 3 tablespoons bread crumbs into the onion mixture until combined.
Divide spinach mixture over mushroom caps; sprinkle with remaining bread crumbs. Return mushrooms to the oven.
Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
