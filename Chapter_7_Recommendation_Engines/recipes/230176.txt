Ingredients:
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 bay leaf
2 pounds leg of lamb

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Mix garlic, salt, pepper, ginger, thyme, sage, add marjoram in a bowl. Stir soy sauce and vegetable oil into the garlic mixture until loosely paste-like; add the bay leaf.
Cut slits into the lamb on all sides. Rub herb mixture over entire surface of lamb, massaging it into the slits. Put lamb in a roasting pan.
Roast lamb until browned on the outside and red in the center, about 50 minutes for rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C). Cover lamb loosely with aluminum foil and cool about 20 minutes before carving.

Description: 
An herb rub makes this leg of lamb so good! I always knew it was Easter when my mom made it, and the whole house smells awesome when it's cooking. It's the only recipe I specifically asked for when I moved out on my own.
