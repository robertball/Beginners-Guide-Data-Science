Ingredients:
4 Salmon fillets
6 Tbs Sour Cream (You can also use plain yogurt)
Powdered Vegetable Dip Mix Packet (Season to taste)
Garlic Salt (Season to taste)
Creole Seasoning (Season to taste)
Cooking Spray
1/2 Cup Chopped Macadamia nuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Mix sour cream, veggie dip mix, garlic salt & creole seasoning in a bowl.  Cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and spray with butter flavored cooking spray and lay salmon fillets on it skin side down.  Spread the sour cream mixture evenly on all four steaks and pop them in the oven for approximately 7-8 minutes, (cooking time will depend on thickness of fillets).  Remove from the oven and sprinkle the macadamia nuts over the salmon.  Increase temperature to Broil and return to the oven for 2-3 minutes until nuts are browned and salmon is fully cooked.

Description: 
In my attempt to find a healthy, yet delicious baked salmon recipe that doesn't include all of the butter and mayonaise that my favorite recipe contains and that also doesn't consist of the vinegar/sugar combo that many of the recipes listed contain, I came up with this savory, creamy and nutty recipe that I fell in love with.  I hope that you love it as much as I do!
