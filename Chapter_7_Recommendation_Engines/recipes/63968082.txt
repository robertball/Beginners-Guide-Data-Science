Ingredients:
1 onion diced
1 carrot diced
1 stalk of celery diced
2 tbsp. fresh diced rosemary
1/2 tsp. oregano
2 tbsp. diced fresh basil
1/2 tsp. turmeric
3 cloves of garlic diced
2 bay leaves
salt and pepper.
1 can tomato paste(5.5 ounces) a small can
2 cans diced tomatoes (28 fluid ounce each) I use my immersion blender for a smoother sauce.
1/4 cup olive oil.
pinch of white sugar.
Pasta of your choosing.

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a medium size pot and add the onion and garlic, carrot and celery. Saute for about 5 minutes, add the turmeric and stir for one minute. Add the tomatoes( I use my immersion blender for a smoother sauce) Add the herbs and bay leaves. Bring to a gentle boil, turn down the heat to semi low and add the tomatoe paste. Add salt and pepper to your taste and a pinch of white sugar. Let the sauce simmer uncovered for about 1/2 hour. Cover if you wish, but tilt the cover to allow steam to escape. Let it simmer for 2-3 hours. Stir every once in a while. Uncover for the last 20 minutes to let any water evaporate.  Or you could put it in the oven at 350 for the same amount of time with cover on slightly tilted. Take cover off the last 20 min. to half hour of cooking.Take bay leaves out before serving.  Toss with your choice of pasta.* SEE NOTES*
