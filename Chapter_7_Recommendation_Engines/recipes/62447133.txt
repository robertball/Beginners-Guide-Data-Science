https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) can tuna, drained
1 egg
1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/3 cup minced onion
1/4 tsp celery salt
1/4 cup minced red bell pepper
1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons lime juice
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
4 hamburger buns
1 tomato, sliced
4 leaves of lettuce (optional)

Directions:
Combine tuna, egg, bread crumbs, onion, celery salt, red bell pepper, mayonnaise, lime juice, dill, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well. Shape into 4 patties (mixture will be very soft and delicate). Refrigerate for 30 minutes to make the patties easier to handle, if desired.
Coat a non-stick skillet with cooking spray; fry tuna patties for about 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until cooked through.  These are fragile, so be careful when turning them.
Serve on buns with tomato slices and lettuce leaves, if desired.
