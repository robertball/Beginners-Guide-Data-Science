Ingredients:
2 pounds halibut
½ teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon cold butter, thinly sliced
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cup sour cream
1 cup cream cheese, softened
2 (4 ounce) cans diced green chiles
2  green onions, chopped
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste
8 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1 cup heavy cream, or as needed
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
¼ cup Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place halibut in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle with seafood seasoning and lemon juice. Dot halibut with butter slices.
Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.
Remove pan from oven and cool halibut slightly. Flake into bite sized pieces in the baking dish.
Combine mayonnaise, sour cream, and cream cheese in a large bowl.
Carefully stir in flaked halibut, diced green chiles, green onions, parsley, salt, and black pepper.
Spoon filling onto tortillas in a line down the center, and roll them around the filling into a cylinder shape.
Grease a 9x15 inch baking dish.
Place rolled tortillas seam sides down in the prepared baking dish.
Pour heavy cream over rolled tortillas, using as much as needed to cover.
Top with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbling, about 45 minutes.
