Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup cornmeal, or as needed
6 green tomatoes, cored and cut into 1/16-inch slices
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat.
Place cornmeal in a bowl; dip and coat each tomato slice until thoroughly coated.
Place coated tomato slices side by side in the hot oil; fry until coating is browned and crusty, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Season with salt and black pepper. Repeat with remaining tomato slices.
