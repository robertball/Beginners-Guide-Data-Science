Description: 
This is a family favorite during Easter Lent.  Growing up we ate fish on Fridays and this stew was a hearty offering from my grandmother.  I have made it my own by subsituting the jalepeno she used for the more smokey chipotle I use today.  I also add mussels or clams when they are on sale and any hearty white fish can be used.  I hope it finds a home in your favorites box. Enjoy!!
