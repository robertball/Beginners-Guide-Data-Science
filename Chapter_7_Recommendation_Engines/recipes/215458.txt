Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup chilled solid vegetable shortening
6 tablespoons ice water, or as needed
3 cups cubed cooked turkey
1/2 small onion, chopped
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of potato soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of chicken soup
1/2 (10.75 ounce) can water
2 (15 ounce) cans mixed vegetables, drained
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Whisk together the flour and 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a bowl. Cut the shortening into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. Drizzle the ice water, about 1 tablespoon at a time, over the mixture and gently work the water into the dough with your fingers. Add more water as needed until you can gather the dough together in a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a saucepan, mix together the turkey, onion, cream of potato soup, cream of chicken soup, water, and mixed vegetables. Bring the mixture to a boil; reduce heat and allow to simmer while you prepare the crust.
Cut the dough in almost equal halves. Roll the larger piece into a circle on a floured work surface and fit into a 10-inch cast-iron skillet. Roll out the smaller piece into a circle to fit the top. Pour the hot turkey filling into the bottom crust. Place top crust over the filling, crimp the two crusts together with a fork, and cut several slits in the top with a sharp knife.
Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes.
