Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, chopped into bite-sized pieces
1/2 pound andouille sausage, sliced
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 medium onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
4 cups chicken broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 1/2 cups sliced okra
2 teaspoons black pepper
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon Creole seasoning
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Add 1 tablespoon oil, chicken, and sausage to the pot and cook for 6 minutes. Remove meat with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add 1/2 cup oil and flour to the pot. Whisk until roux is the color of peanut butter, about 10 minutes. Add onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic. Cook, stirring continually to prevent burning, for 5 minutes. Turn pot off.
Add broth, tomatoes, okra, black pepper, cayenne pepper, thyme, Creole seasoning, and Worcestershire sauce to the pot. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions and set timer for 4 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
