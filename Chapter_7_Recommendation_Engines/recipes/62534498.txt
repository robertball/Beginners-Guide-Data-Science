Ingredients:
1 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees F)
2 packages active dry yeast ( or 4 and 1/2 teaspoons of bread
machine yeast)
1/2 cup (1 stick ) butter (I use oleo)
1/2 cup sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon salt
4 to 4 1/2 cups unbleached all purpose flour
Optional: Additional melted butter to coat rolls as they come out of the oven.

Directions:
Combine the warm water and yeast in bread machine container. Let
mixture stand about 5 minutes (until foamy). Stir in melted butter, sugar, eggs and salt. Add 4 cups flour. (can add additional flour if  needed to the dough later). Turn bread machine to dough setting and let rise in bread machine. After rising time is finished, turn dough out on floured surface. Let rest 5 minutes. Divide  into three equal parts. Roll out into a circle about 1/4 inch thick.
Pour on melted butter and spread to the edges. Using a pizza cutter, cut the dough into 8 or 12 pieces depending on the size of rolls you want. Roll from widest part of dough to smallest. Pinch dough together to stay. Add additional coating of melted butter. Place 10 rolls to a jelly roll pan. Cover with a light towel. Let rise in warm place for about an hour or until they are doubled in size. Preheat oven to 375.  Bake for approximately 15 minutes or until golden brown and not  doughy. DO NOT OVERBAKE!! Add final coating of melted butter. Let cool completely and place in Ziploc bags.
