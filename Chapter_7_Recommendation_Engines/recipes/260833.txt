Pour egg yolk mixture into the saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-low heat, stirring constantly. Boil for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and fish out cinnamon stick.

Description: 
This easy Mexican Rompope recipe is made with sweetened condensed milk, almonds, and rum. Rompope is the Mexican version of eggnog and I like the almond version better than the traditional one.
