2 Teaspoon Cocoa powder
1 Teaspoon Vinegar
1 1/2 Teaspoon Salt

Directions:
WARNING: This cake is fattening - get over it - don't eat it every day. Also DO NOT try to adjust the ingredients or substitute apple sauce for oil. It will not turn out.
Beat eggs and sugar. Add the remaining ingredients and mix well. Transfer batter into a 9x13 pan (metal preferred). Bake at 350? for 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
Allow cake to cool and then top with Cream Cheese Icing. You will need to refrigerate this cake because of the icing. It is best cold anyway!
Cream Cheese Frosting
Cream Butter, Cream Cheese and Vanilla until smooth. Mix in confectioners sugar until smooth.
