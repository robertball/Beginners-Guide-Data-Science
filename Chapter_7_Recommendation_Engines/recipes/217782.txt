Ingredients:
3/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 large clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®), or to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 eggs
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1 pound cod or other firm white fish fillets
1 pinch paprika, or as needed
2 cups sliced onions
2 cups sliced green bell peppers
2 cups stewed tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix together the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic, black pepper, salt, seafood seasoning, and  parsley in a shallow bowl. Beat the eggs in a separate shallow bowl.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip fish fillets in the egg, then the crumbs; brush off any loose crumb mix. Sprinkle fillets with paprika, and cook in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the fish fillets to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cook and stir the onions and green bell peppers in the hot skillet until the onions are tender and translucent, about 10 minutes; spoon away any excess oil, and stir in the tomatoes. Bring the vegetables to a boil, and spread them over the fish. Cover the dish with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbling, about 30 minutes; remove foil, and spread Monterey Jack cheese over the fish and vegetables. Return to oven, and bake until the cheese is melted and beginning to brown, 8 to 10 more minutes.
