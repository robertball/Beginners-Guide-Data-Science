Ingredients:
1 C White Wine
1 C Ginger Ale
1 C Orange Juice
1 C Honey
1/4 C Butter
1 tsp Ground Cinnamon
1/2 tsp Ground Cloves
1/2 tsp Ground Ginger
1/2 tsp Ground Mustard
1 11 oz can of Mandarin Oranges
1 14.5 oz can Pineapple rings
1/4 C Cornstarch

Directions:
In a medium sauce pan, mix the following with a wisk:  Wine, Ginger Ale, Orange Juice, Honey and all 4 spices.
Add the butter and juice from both the Pineapples and the oranges and bring the mixture to a boil.  Allow to boil for 15 minutes, stiring occationally.  (also watching for a bubbling overflow)
Mean while, combine the cornstarch with enough cold water to make a thick slurry.  You should be able to stir with a wisk with medium difficulty, yet there should be no lumps.
Use this slurry to thicken the sauce, a little at a time until you reach your desired consistancy.
Add the Pineapples and Oranges and allow them to heat in sauce.

Description: 
A not too sweet, slightly spicy sauce that'll have your taste buds thinking in 3D.  This sauce goes great on ham, Chicken, duck, capon and turkey..........I bet it'd be perfect on alligator as well.  If you sprinkle a little cayenne pepper on the meat before adding the sauce you just might fall in love.
