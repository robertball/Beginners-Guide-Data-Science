Fresh basil leaves torn for garnish

In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil and add yellow peppers and cook till slightly softened approximately 5-6 minutes.

Add jar of the tomato sauce and let come to a simmer, then toss in zucchini spirals and cook until al dente approximately 6-7 minutes longer.
Garnish with some shaved Parmesan flakes and some fresh torn basil leaves.

Description: 
Bright, colorful vegetable zoodle (zucchini spirals) tomato sauce dish that is simple and packed with flavor and SHRIMP....(of course).  You most likely keep these ingredients  in your pantry and kitchen all the times.  I like hot/spicy foods so, I add that dash of Frank's Hot sauce to give the dish a little kick...Yes, it's a Texas thang.
