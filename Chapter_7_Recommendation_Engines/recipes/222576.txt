Ingredients:
2 zucchinis, cut into 1/2-inch slices
2 eggs, beaten
1 sleeve buttery round crackers (such as RitzÂ®), crushed
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Coat each zucchini slice with egg, then press into cracker crumbs, coating both sides. Shake off excess and place the breaded zucchini onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan fry zucchini until crust browns and zucchini softens, about 3 minutes on each side. Season with salt and pepper.
