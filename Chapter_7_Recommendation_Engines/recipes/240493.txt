Ingredients:
2 cups water
1/2 cup white rice
2 2/3 cups whole milk
3 eggs, slightly beaten
1/2 cup white sugar
1 (4-serving size) package cook-and-serve vanilla pudding mix
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
Stir milk into rice until evenly combined. Mix eggs, sugar, pudding mix, butter, vanilla extract, and salt into rice mixture; transfer to the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the pudding comes out clean, about 1 hour.
