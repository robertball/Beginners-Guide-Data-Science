Ingredients:
1 head green cabbage, shredded
1/2 cup uncooked long-grain white rice
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried sweet basil
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (28 ounce) can whole tomatoes
10 slices American cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread cabbage in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish; sprinkle rice on top.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add onion, oregano, basil, garlic powder, and thyme; cook and stir until onion is transparent, about 5 minutes. Season with sugar, salt, and pepper.
Spoon beef mixture over rice and cabbage in the baking dish. Break up tomatoes in the can with your hand; pour over beef mixture. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until rice is tender, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Uncover and arrange American cheese slices over casserole. Let stand until cheese melts and absorbs juices, 15 to 20 minutes.
