Ingredients:
2 ounces whole-wheat angel hair pasta
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/4 cup fat free, low-sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup evaporated skim milk
2 teaspoons low-sodium tomato paste
10 ounces fresh scallops
1/4 cup fat free, low-sodium chicken broth

Directions:
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes; drain. Divide between 2 plates and keep warm.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in the hot oil until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir curry powder into the onion; cook and stir 1 minute more.
Transfer the onion mixture to a blender; add 1/4 cup chicken broth along with evaporated milk and tomato paste.
Return the skillet to medium heat. Sear scallops on each side in the hot skillet, 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Place scallops atop the angel hair pasta; keep warm.
Pour 1/4 cup chicken broth into the pan; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Pour the contents of the skillet into the blender; blend until smooth and return the mixture to the skillet. Simmer the sauce until warm; pour over the scallops and pasta to serve.
