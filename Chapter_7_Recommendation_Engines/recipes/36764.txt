Description: 
This is a great (easy) recipe that you can use with left over steak. Serve on a hamburger bun. With only a few ingredients you'll have a great sandwich. My family is very picky about what they eat, but when we have this everyone cleans their plate. Shred the cooked steak in a blender.
