Ingredients:
1 stick softened butter
1 yellow cake mix
2/3 c evaporated milk
1 bag caramels
1 c chocolate chips

Directions:
Cut softened butter into cake mix using pasty blender or two forks.   Add 1/3 c evaporated milk.  Mix well.  Pat 3/4 of the mixture into the bottom of a greased 13 X 9 pan.  (save the rest for topping).  Bake 15 min at 350.  Remove from heat when done.
While the crust is baking, remove all caramels from wrappers.  Put them in a microwave safe bowl and top with remaining 1/3 c evaporated milk.  Microwave on 1/2 power about 5-7 min.  Stir at least 1/2 way through.  Do not overcook.  Once caramels are melted, stir mixture thoroughly.  Pour over the top of the baked crust.
Scatter the remaining batter over the top of the caramel layer.  Then scatter the chocolate chips over this layer.   bake for another 15 minutes.  At this point, add 1c chopped nuts if you like. Then bake another 5 min.  For a potluck, I add 1/2 c chopped peanuts to 1/2 the bars and leave the other 1/2 without.   They're a hit every time.

Description: 
The original recipe calls for a chocolate cake mix, but it's very chocolatey so it depends on what kind of mood you're in. I like the yellow cake mix the best.  I assume you could experiment with cake mix flavors.  At any rate, it'a favorite for potlucks and picnics.
