Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups sugar, divided
3 teaspoons baking powder
3 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
2 eggs
1 cup buttermilk
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, 1 cup sugar, baking powder, 1-1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and salt.  In another bowl, combine the eggs, buttermilk, oil and vanilla; stir into dry ingredients just until smooth.  Pour half of the batter into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan.  In a small bowl, combine the remaining sugar and cinnamon; stir in butter.  Drizzle with remaining cinnamon-sugar mixture; swirl with a knife.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.  Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.

Lynda Atteberry Hoskins from Mathis, Texas offers this cinnamony loaf that tastes just like a coffee cake. 'When I worked as an elementary school secretary, I used to take a slice of this cake with me in the mornings for a snack,' she remembers.
