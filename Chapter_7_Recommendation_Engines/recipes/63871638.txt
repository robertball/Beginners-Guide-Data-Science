Ingredients:
3 teaspoons active dry yeast
1-1/2 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
4 tablespoons canola oil, divided
1 tablespoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter, melted
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons dried parsley flakes
1-1/2 teaspoons garlic powder

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add 1 tablespoon oil, sugar, salt and 3 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (dough will be sticky). Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 15-in. square. Cut in half lengthwise; cut each half widthwise into 1-in. strips.
In a shallow bowl, combine the butter, cheese, parsley, garlic powder and remaining oil. Dip each strip into butter mixture, then twist two to three times.
Place 1 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350° for 18-21 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
