Ingredients:
2 cups plus 1 tablespoon cake flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
¾ teaspoons baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 cups (200 grams) granulated sugar
1½ teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 cup buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Generously grease or spray two 6-inch round cake pans.
Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. In another mixing bowl, beat butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy.
Add vanilla extract and mix well.
Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well. You may need to scrape down the bowl a few times.
With mixer on low, beat in buttermilk until just combined (mixture will look curdled).
Add flour mixture in three batches, mixing lightly until each addition is just incorporated. Do not over-mix.
Fill each pan halfway with batter, and then whack the pans on the counter a few times to release air bubbles.
Bake until tops are moist and golden and a toothpick comes out clean, about 30 minutes, but your oven may vary.
Cool cakes in pans for 15 minutes on a wire rack.
Remove from pans and continue cooling on racks covered with parchment paper until completely cool.
