Ingredients:
8 slices prosciutto
5 ounces goat cheese, softened
1/4 cup fig preserves
2 tablespoons chopped pine nuts

Directions:
Lay prosciutto slices on a large cutting board.
Place goat cheese into a small bowl and mix until creamy and spreadable. Lightly spread goat cheese on each slice of prosciutto. Top with a thin layer of fig preserves and sprinkle with crushed pine nuts.
Starting from one end, roll each prosciutto slice up into a tube. Place on a small platter and serve.

Description: 
Impress your guests at your next wine and cheese night with these elegant prosciutto roll-ups. The combination of creamy goat cheese, sweet fig preserves, and savory prosciutto will make these disappear quickly! You'll want to double the recipe, or you can cut the rolls in half for a smaller serving size. I like to serve these over a bed of arugula that has been lightly tossed with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
