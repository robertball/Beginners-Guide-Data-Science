While peppers are cooking, pour a half tablespoon of oil in the bottom of small pressure cooker and heat on medium heat for about one minute.
Lightly brown seasoned chicken breast on each side moving around as so they don't stick, cover breast with 4 cups of water, or if using a large cooker, enough to completely cover the chicken with water.

Once regulator starts rocking, cook for 14 minutes and then remove from heat and cool pan by running cool water over until pressure is released.
Set chicken breast aside and reserve the broth in cooker, once chicken is cool enough cut into bite sized pieces.
In large stock pot melt on tablespoon of butter over medium heat, add in onions and cook until starting to soften about 2 minutes, then add in celery and minced garlic and cook another 3 minutes or until celery starts to soften.
Add in diced green chilies, diced tomatoes, reserved chicken broth, 2 cups of extra broth and water, poblanos and jalapenos, spices, chicken chunks, can of drained beans, and rice.
Bring to boil on medium high, then reduce to simmer and cook for 25 minutes until rice is cooked. Serve with cheese and sour cream.
