Ingredients:
2 cups pineapple juice
2 cups golden raisins
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup honey
5 eggs, beaten
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
4 cups whole bran cereal

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine pineapple juice and raisins.  Set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt.  Stir in cereal.  Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, combine brown sugar, oil, honey, and eggs; mix well.  Add cereal mixture, and mix well.  Fold in the raisin mixture.  Batter will be thin; it will thicken as it chills.  Cover, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight.
Stir chilled batter.  Fill greased or paper lined muffin cups 3/4 full.
Bake in a preheated 400 degree F (205 degree C) oven, for 20 to 25 minutes.  Cool in pan 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.
