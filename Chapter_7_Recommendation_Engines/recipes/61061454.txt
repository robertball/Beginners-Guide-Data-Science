Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
3 pounds boneless pork ribs
1/2 (9 ounce) bottle barbeque sauce
1/2 (9 ounce) bottle mesquite sauce
1 cup carrots, shredded

Directions:
Pour can of beef broth into slow cooker, and add boneless pork ribs. Cook on High heat for 4 hours, or until meat shreds easily. Remove meat, and shred with two forks. It will seem that it's not working right away, but it will.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Transfer the shredded pork to a Dutch oven or iron skillet, and stir in carrots and barbeque and mesquite sauces.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until heated through.

Description: 
This meat is so good for sandwiches. I like to add a little fiber to it with some carrots and cut out some sugar by using mesquite sauce.Modified from: BBQ Pork for Sandwiches
