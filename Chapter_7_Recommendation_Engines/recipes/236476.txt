Ingredients:
1 tablespoon grapeseed oil
1 1/2 cups sweet rice
2 cups coconut milk
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons palm sugar, or more to taste
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup unsweetened coconut cream (optional)
2 mangoes - peeled, seeded, and diced

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat; gently cook and stir rice in the hot oil until toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add coconut milk, water, sugar, and salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover saucepan, and simmer until rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir coconut cream into rice.
Scoop rice into a serving bowl and top with mango.
