Ingredients:
4-5 lb leg of lamb
3 garlic cloves, slivered
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp fresh rosemary, minced
6 slices bacon
1 small onion, minced
1/2 cup dry red wine
1 cup beef stock
1 tsp tomato paste
salt and pepper

Directions:
Remove thin membrane and excess fat from lamb and place leg in roasting pan.  Cut slits all over lamb and insert garlic slivers. Combine oil, lemon juice and rosemary and brush over lamb. Lay bacon slices over top of lamb. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Roast lamb in 325F oven for 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours or until meat thermometer reaches 145F for medium rare or 160F for medium. Remove lamb to platter and cover loosely with foil while you prepare the red wine reduction.
Skim fat from pan and heat pan on stove over medium heat.  Add onion and cook until softened. Pour in wine and bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring to scrape up brown bits. Add stock and return to boil. Whisk in tomato paste and simmer for 7-8 minutes or until reduced to about 1 cup. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Strain if desired.

Description: 
A family favorite for over two decades! Growing up, Mom would always make this for dinner on Easter Sunday or New Year's Day. The bacon adds a wonderful smoky flavor to the outside of the lamb, and the garlic permeates the meat throughout. All topped off with a delectable red wine reduction. Delicious served with mashed potatoes!
