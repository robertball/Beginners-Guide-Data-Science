Ingredients:
3 (1 1/2 pound) Cornish hens
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1/4 teaspoon rubbed sage
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
REMOVE giblets from hens and discard.  Rinse hens under cold running water, and pat dry with paper towels.  Remove skin, if desired. Cut hens in half lengthwise with a sharp knife or kitchen shears, and place on a lightly greased rack.  Place rack in a shallow roasting pan.
COMBINE applesauce and remaining ingredients.  Brush half of mixture over hens, and reserve remaining mixture.
BAKE at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Baste with reserved applesauce mixture, and bake 15 to 30 more minutes or until juices run clear.
