Description: 
If you love making your own sourdough bread, don't toss out the discard every time you feed and refresh your starter. Turn this flavorful, but unused, product into amazingly delicious (and amazingly easy to make) homemade crackers. With just the right amount of crunch and flavor, you won't be able to stop snacking. Fully cooled crackers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
