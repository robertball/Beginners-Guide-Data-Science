Ingredients:
1 lb. pork tenderloin
4 red potatoes
8 carrots
1 medium yellow onion
10 stalks celery hearts (about 8" long each)
1 can (10.5 oz) condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 can condensed cream of celery soup
1 Tbsp. basil leaves (dried or finely-chopped fresh)
1 Tbsp. cumin
1 Tbsp. black pepper
1 tsp. ground mustard
1 tsp. dill weed
2 tsp. crushed garlic

Directions:
Turn slow cooker to high and add a little water to coat bottom of pot.
Peel carrots, cut into 1-1/2" chunks and add to pot.
Cook for 1 hour.
Add celery and mushroom soup, plus one can (about 1 1/4 cup) water. Stir well until broth is all liquid.
Chop potatoes (skin-on) and celery into 1-1/2" chunks, add to pot.
Dice onion, add to pot.
Coat top with basil, cumin, black pepper, ground mustard and dill weed. Stir well, coat top a second time, add garlic and stir again. (Salt to taste, if desired).
Lay pork tenderloin on top of vegetables (may need to cut it in half to fit). Cover and continue cooking on high for 4 hours.
When done, remove pork, cut into chunks and put back in pot. Stir and simmer if desired.

Description: 
This is a tasty and easy-to-make pork tenderloin stew. The black pepper and cumin gives a nice edge to counter the softness of the potatoes and tenderized vegetables, I think, without being too spicy.  You can also use half-and-half or cream instead of water, and add 1/4 cup flour if you want a creamier broth.
