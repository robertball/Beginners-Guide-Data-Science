Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, sliced into small strips
1/3 cup sliced onions
1/3 cup sliced red and/or green bell pepper
1/3 cup tomato sauce
1 tablespoons taco seasoning mix
1/2 cup salsa
3 (1/2 inch thick) slices French bread
1 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken, and cook and stir until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the sliced onions and red peppers, and cook and stir for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.  Stir in the tomato sauce and taco seasoning, and mix well.  Cook mixture until the chicken is well coated, about an additional 7 minutes.
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Toast the bread.
Spread 2 tablespoons of salsa over each slice of French bread.  Evenly spoon the chicken mixture on top of the salsa-topped bread.  Sprinkle each sandwich with cheese.
Place sandwiches under the preheated broiler and cook for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted and beginning to brown.
