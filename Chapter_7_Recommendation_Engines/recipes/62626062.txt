Ingredients:
8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
8 slices Swiss cheese
6 slices ham (use "off the bone ham" - not deli cuts
9 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 teaspoon paprika
2 Eggs
8 tablespoons butter
1 cup dry white wine
2 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 cups heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Pound chicken breasts if they are too thick. Place a cheese and ham slice on each breast within 1/2 inch of the edges. Roll the edges of the chicken over the filling. Mix the flour and paprika in a small bowl, and coat the chicken pieces with egg and then with flour mixture.  Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the chicken until browned on all sides. Add the wine and bouillon. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
Transfer the breasts to a warm platter. Cut chicken into slices (like photo #26).  Blend the cornstarch with the cream in a small bowl, and whisk slowly into the skillet. Cook, stirring until thickened, and pour over the chicken. Serve warm.
