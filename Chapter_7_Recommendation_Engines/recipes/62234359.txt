Ingredients:
1 1/2 tsp oil
1 T ginger, peeled and minced
1 clove garlic
1/2 T sesame oil (I cut from 1 1/2 T)
1 T soy sauce
1 T balsamic vinegar
2 1/4 t sugar
1 T hot chili oil
3/4 t salt
8 oz spaghetti
6 green onions, sliced
1/4 cup peanuts, coarsly chopped
2 T basil, sliced

Directions:
Heat oil in small skillet over medium heat.
Add ginger and garlic (I also added larger chunks of green onions and kept green part out as garnish) and saute 1 minute. Transfer to large bowl.
Add next 6 ingredients; whisk to blend.
Cook noodles according to directions.
Rinse and drain thoroughly and transfer to bowl with sauce.
Add sliced green onions and toss to coat noodles.
Let stand at room temperature until noodles have absorbed dressing, tossing occasionally, about 1 hour.
Stir in peanuts and basil; toss again. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Serve at room temperature.

Description: 
Standard Chinese noodle dish - I'm not crazy about sesame oil, so I cut back by a third.  Great dish served with stir fry and rice.  I also like to add slivered carrots.
