Ingredients:
2 cups maple syrup
1 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons butter
1 pinch salt
2/3 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Line an 8x8-inch baking pan with waxed paper. Butter the paper.
Bring maple syrup, heavy cream, and brown sugar to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. Continue to boil, without stirring, until mixture starts to bubble and registers 240 degrees F (166 degrees C) on a candy thermometer.
Remove from heat. Add butter and salt but do not mix. Let sit until mixture reaches 105 degrees F (41 degrees C).
Add walnuts and vanilla; beat until mixture loses its gloss. Pour into the prepared pan and let cool to room temperature. Cut, wrap, and store in the refrigerator.
