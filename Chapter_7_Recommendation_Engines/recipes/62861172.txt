Ingredients:
16 oz French Bread (although, any firm bread will do)
5 eggs
1.5 C Milk
1 t Vanilla
1 C Salted butter
2 t Light Corn Syrup
3 apples - I like firm, tart apples for this
A dash of freshly ground cinnamon (optional)

Directions:
(These steps can be done the night before)
Prepare a glass baking dish, with a smear of butter/oil, or non stick spray. Slice bread into 1" slices, and place in dish. Whisk egg, milk, vanilla, (and optional cinnamon), and then pour on bread.  Let the bread completely absorb the liquid.
(When you are ready to cook)
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a sauce pan, melt butter. Reduce heat to lower temp. then add the syrup and then the sugar. You should be alright, but be careful not to stir it too much (it may make the sugar crystallize).
After this mixture has been combined and fully melted, pour it over the bread in your baking dish.  Top with apples sliced...and bake for 40-45 minutes.
My Favorite Garnishes:
A dusting of powdered sugar and a sprig of mint.
A dusting of cinnamon with some candied walnuts, and a little whipped cream.
