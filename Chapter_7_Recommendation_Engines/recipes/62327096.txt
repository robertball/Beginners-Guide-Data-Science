Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds green beans, trimmed and cut into 2 inch pieces
1 1/2 cups water
2 T. butter
1 T. extra virgin olive oil
1-2 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 - 1 shallot, minced (optional)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2-3 T chopped fresh basil
1-2 cups cherry or grape tomato halves

Directions:
Place beans and water in a large saucepan. Add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp salt.  Cover, and bring to a boil. Set heat to low, and simmer until tender, about 8-10 minutes. Drain off water, and set aside.
While beans are cooking, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat with the olive oil.  Stir in tomatoes, salt, pepper and basil.  Cook stirring gently just until soft. Add the green beans, and stir together.  Cook an additional minute or two, stirring gently but often.  May be served hot, or allowed to cool to room temperature.

Description: 
I tweaked the original (great!) recipe by adding salt, fresh garlic and shallots, increasing the basil enormously, and changing the sauce base from 1/4 c. butter to 2 T. butter plus 1 T extra virgin olive oil.Modified from: Green Beans with Cherry Tomatoes
