Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (26 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
3 cups cooked rice, cooled
2 eggs, lightly beaten
3/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided
2 1/4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
2 cups cottage cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes;  drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce and garlic powder.
Mix rice, eggs, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Mix 2 cups mozzarella cheese, cottage cheese, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in another bowl.
Spread half the rice mixture in a 3-quart baking dish, followed by half the cheese mixture and half the meat sauce. Repeat layers. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese over the final layer of meat sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes.
