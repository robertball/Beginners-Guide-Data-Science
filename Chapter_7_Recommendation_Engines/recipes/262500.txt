Ingredients:
5 ounces self-rising flour
4 ounces white sugar
1 stick unsalted butter
2 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons lemon curd (heaped tablespoons)
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons superfine sugar
1 tablespoon lemon zest

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a loaf pan with parchment paper.
Combine flour, sugar, butter, eggs, and lemon curd in a bowl or food processor. Mix well. Place into the prepared pan.
Bake in the center of the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, 60 to 90 minutes.
Blend lemon juice, white sugar, and lemon zest together in a bowl while cake is baking.
Let cake cool in the pan, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the lemon-sugar topping over the warm cake to let soak. Allow to cool, about 30 minutes. Turn cake out of the pan.

Description: 
This lemon curd cake is very moist and easy to make. I also sometimes bake them in muffin tins to make it easy for a packed lunch or picnic. Keeps well for a few days if wrapped in grease-proof paper and aluminum foil.
