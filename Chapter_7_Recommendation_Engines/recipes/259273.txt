Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat pasta
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 cup sliced orange bell pepper
1 cup sliced red bell pepper
1 cup sliced celery
1 cup sliced carrots
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 (26 ounce) can reduced-sodium tomato soup
13 fluid ounces water
1 (15 ounce) can diced potatoes, drained and rinsed
1 (14 ounce) can reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; add orange bell pepper, red bell pepper, celery, carrots, and garlic. Cook and stir until slightly tender, about 5 minutes.
Pour tomato soup plus 1/2 can water into saucepan. Add potatoes, chicken broth, basil, onion powder, salt, and pepper; stir to combine. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, about 1 hour. Serve over cooked pasta.
