Description: 
A spicy and delicious soup given to me by my mother. She got the recipe from a friend who grew up in Louisiana. To save effort, a bag of hash brown potatoes may be substituted for the shredded potatoes. You may also add some crumbled up bacon to the soup. Add more or less potatoes depending on your soup preferences. Also, add cornstarch if soup is not as thick as you desire it to be. Great served with bread.
