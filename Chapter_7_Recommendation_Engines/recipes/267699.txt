Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups almond flour
1 tablespoon gluten-free baking powder
1 teaspoon garlic salt
2 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
2 ounces cream cheese, cubed
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix almond flour, baking powder, and garlic salt together in a bowl.
Combine mozzarella cheese and cream cheese in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave for 1 minute; remove and stir. Microwave for 1 minute more; remove and stir until well incorporated. Stir flour mixture and eggs into the melted cheese mixture, working quickly. Knead by hand until a sticky dough forms. Keep kneading and squeezing until dough is completely uniform, about 2 minutes.
Divide dough into 6 equal parts. Roll each into a long log, then press ends together in a bagel shape and place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until bagels are golden, 10 to 14 minutes.
