Ingredients:
SALAD:
1 medium fennel bulb, thinly sliced on mandoline
1 apple, julienned
1 clementine or mandarin orange, sections cut in half.
1/4 cup pitted olives, sliced. (i like kalamatas.)
1 cup mixed leafy greens (swiss chard, beet greens,
dandelion, arugula- whatever you have on hand), thinly sliced.
handful of basil and flatleaf parsley leaves, finely chopped.
VINAIGRETTE:
1 lemon, juiced
2 Tbsp orange juice
1 Tbsp dijon mustard
1/2 tsp celery seed
1/2 tsp dried oregano
big pinch of sea salt and freshly grated pepper
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
*if desired, thinly sliced red onion can be added to salad for a bit more bite.

Directions:
Toss thinly sliced fennel, apple, orange sections, olives and greens together in big mixing bowl.
Finely chop basil and parsley, add to fennel and greens.
For the vinaigrette, combine lemon juice, orange juice, dijon mustard, celery seed, oregano, salt and pepper to taste.
Slowly drizzle olive oil into vinaigrette mixture, vigorously mixing the whole time to ensure that the vinaigrette emulsifies.
Toss the fennel salad with vinaigrette to coat, and serve.

Description: 
A simple, refreshing, savory-sweet salad. Thinly sliced fennel is tossed with apple, orange, herbs and an orange- dijon vinaigrette.  Would pair beautifully with grilled fish or roasted, herb chicken and a crisp white such as a Sancerre.
