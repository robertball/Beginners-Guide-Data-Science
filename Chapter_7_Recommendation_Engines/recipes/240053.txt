Ingredients:
1 (15.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1/2 cup miniature chocolate chips
30 dark chocolate kisses

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Mix cake mix, pumpkin puree, and chocolate chips together in a bowl. Scoop batter using a cookie scoop and place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are set, about 15 minutes. Place baking sheets on a wire rack and gently press a chocolate kiss into the center of each cookie. Allow cookies to cool and set.

Description: 
Intensely fudgy. Can use different seasonal kisses to add a holiday touch. Lower fat and can't be anymore quick and easy to satisfy that chocolate craving. Kids won't know they are eating veggies either! You will not be adding the oil, egg, and water as the box directs. No added fat except for the few mini chips.
