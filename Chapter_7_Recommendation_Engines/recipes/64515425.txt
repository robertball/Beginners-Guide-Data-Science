Ingredients:
8 oz mini pretzels, any shape (enough to cover large cookie sheet)
1 cup butter
1 cup brown sugar, packed
2 cups chocolate chips (dark chocolate is good!)
sea salt (optional)
ground almonds, pecans or coconut (optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 375.
Grease 11" x 17" jelly roll pan.
Spread partially broken pretzels to cover bottom of pan evenly.
Melt butter with sugar in medium saucepan while stirring, until steady (rolling) boil.
Leave alone on med/high heat x 5 min. (candy thermometer reads approx. 260F).
Immediately pour over pretzels (don't worry about gaps).
Bake x 5 minutes.
Remove from oven and immediately sprinkle chocolate chips over top.
Let sit for 5 minutes; then spread over bark.
Sprinkle additional topping(s) over chocolate, if using.
Let cool & set (can speed this process up by putting pan in fridge).
Break apart and store (whatever you don't eat in this step!) in cool place or freeze.
