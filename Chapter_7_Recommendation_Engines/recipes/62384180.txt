Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons hot buffalo wing sauce
1 loaf Italian bread, cut in half lengthwise
3 cups shredded meat from a rotisserie chicken
8 slices pepperjack cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet; cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.
Combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, and hot sauce in a small bowl.  Spread both halves of the bread with the mayonnaise mixture.  Place chicken on bottom half of bread; layer bacon and cheese on top of chicken.   Fold the top half of the bread over the bottom, and wrap with foil.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Cut into slices, and serve.
