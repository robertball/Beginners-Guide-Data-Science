Description: 
This simple drink reminds me of a cross between a smoothie and a slushie. It's a great  treat anytime of day and is also great for those of us watching our waistline. The portion is VERY generous, and No one will ever guess that it is on the healthier side.  Hope you enjoy this as much as I do! :)
