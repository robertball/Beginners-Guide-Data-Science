Brussels Sprouts in a Sherry Bacon Cream Sauce Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
about 1 lb of brussel sprouts, trimmed and halved
* 4 strips of uncooked bacon, diced
* 1-2 medium shallot, diced [can be substituted for 1 med. onion]
* 7-12 crimini mushrooms [+/- according to how much you enjoy mushrooms]
*1 clove garlic, minced
* 1/4 cup sherry(not cooking sherry [I used Harvey Bristols])
* 1/2 cup cream
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
* I sometimes add nuts [pecans] to this recipe.

Directions:
Soak your brussel sprouts in a mixture of water and salt. I did two batches, one of which was an hour and the other overnight + 1 hour before I placed them in the oven.
Preheat oven to 475.
In bowl, toss halved brussel sprouts in olive oil, salt and pepper.
Place halves sliced side down in a baking pan (I used a glass 9x13 one, but use what's available - cooking times may vary for dark or non-stick pans).
Place in hot oven for 15 minutes [or until nicely browned].
Place diced bacon in cold medium skillet, and saute over medium heat until starting to brown a little on the edges. [If adding nuts, I like to put them in to roast just before the bacon browns].
Add chopped mushrooms and shallots/onions to bacon and grease and saute until onion starts to become translucent.
Add garlic, stirring well for about one minute.
Add sherry, stir, then add cream and stir well.
Bring to a boil over medium heat stirring constantly, and as soon as you see it bubbling, reduce heat to low (or med-low, depending on your stove) and simmer until it's reduced by about half, stirring occasionally. Once it's reduced, it will thicken up so that it coats your spoon well, but won't be thick like a white cream sauce.
Salt and pepper to taste, toss roasted brussel sprouts in sauce and SERVE!

Description: 
I had this with friend's at a tapas restaurant in Portland. It is SO delicious and easy to make! The measurements are not exact [but based on another recipe] because I eyeball everything, so adjust as you feel you need to.
