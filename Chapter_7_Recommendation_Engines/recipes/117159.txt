Ingredients:
2 (10 ounce) containers refrigerated pizza crust
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend
1 (15 ounce) can chili without beans
1 (15 ounce) can ranch-style beans or chili beans, drained
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chilies, drained
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
On a lightly floured surface, press pizza dough into two 12-inch squares. Cut each into four 6-inch squares. In a bowl, combine the cheese, chili and beans. Spoon 1/2 cup in the center of each square. Fold dough diagonally over filling; press edges to seal.
Place in two greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pans. Bake at 425 degrees F for 13-18 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine tomatoes and sour cream. Serve with turnovers.
