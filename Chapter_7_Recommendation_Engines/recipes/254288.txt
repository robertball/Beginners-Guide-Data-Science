Ingredients:
PAM® Grilling Spray
3 tablespoons butter, melted
3 tablespoons firmly packed brown sugar, divided
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 large unpeeled banana, cut in half crosswise and lengthwise
1 large fresh peach, pitted and cut into 4 wedges
1 ring (3/4 inch thick) fresh pineapple, peeled, cored
3 large fresh strawberries, hulled, halved
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
3 cups vanilla ice cream
Caramel or chocolate syrup (optional)
Chopped nuts (optional)
4 tablespoons Reddi-wip® Original Dairy Whipped Topping

Directions:
Spray grill grate and 8x8-inch piece of aluminum foil with cooking spray; set aside. Preheat grill for medium-low heat. Stir together melted butter, 2 tablespoons brown sugar and cinnamon in small bowl.
Brush banana, peaches and pineapple with butter mixture. Dip strawberries in balsamic vinegar; roll in remaining 1 tablespoon brown sugar, coating both sides. Grill banana, peaches and pineapple 3 minutes on each side or until grill marks develop. Remove from grill; set aside and keep warm. Place foil on grill; add strawberries. Grill 2 minutes on each side or until hot and slightly tender.
Remove peel from banana. Place grilled fruit in sundae cups; top each evenly with ice cream. Drizzle with syrup and top with nuts, if desired. Top each with Reddi-wip before serving.
