Ingredients:
4 Tbsp unsalted butter (1/2 stick)
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup whole milk
3 cups medium dice cooked turkey (about 12 ounces)
1 Tbsp cider vinegar
1 bag frozen vegetables (16 oz)
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Melt the butter over medium-low heat in a large saucepan or frying pan until foaming. Sprinkle in flour while constantly whisking, and cook until raw flavor is gone, about 1 to 2 minutes.
Slowly add broth, whisking constantly until mixture is smooth.  Add the milk and again whisk until smooth. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, whisking occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.
Remove from the heat, add turkey, veggies  and vinegar, and stir to coat. Season well with salt and pepper. Serve over toast, rice or noodles.

Just like potpies but with the crust on the bottom.  A graet way to use up the that leftover turkey.
