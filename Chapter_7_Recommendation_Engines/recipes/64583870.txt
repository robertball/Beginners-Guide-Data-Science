Description: 
I created this spicy, cheesy vegetable soup one day when I was trying to use up a variety of things in my fridge and pantry!  It turned out so delicious, that I wrote down the recipe.  If you don't want it spicy, omit the banana pepper rings and use mild salsa or diced canned tomatoes.
