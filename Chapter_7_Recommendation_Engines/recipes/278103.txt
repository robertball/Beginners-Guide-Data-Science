Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups unsweetened almond milk (such as Silk®), divided
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 cup agave nectar
1/2 vanilla bean, scraped
1 1/2 teaspoons coconut oil
2 tablespoons vegan whipped cream (such as So Delicious Coco Whip®) (optional)

Directions:
Combine 1/4 cup almond milk and cornstarch in a small bowl and stir until completely blended.
Heat remaining 1 cup almond milk and agave nectar in a saucepan over medium-low heat until mixture barely starts to boil. Stir in cornstarch mixture. Continue cooking and stirring at a slow boil until thickened, 7 to 9 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla seeds and coconut oil.
Pour into two pudding dishes and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Serve topped with vegan whipped cream.

Description: 
I love the way vanilla beans add so much flavor and this is the case with this vegan pudding. The little black seeds scraped from a vanilla bean add not only taste but a nice visual appeal.
