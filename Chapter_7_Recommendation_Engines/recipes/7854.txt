Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon orange zest
3 eggs
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon water
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 10 inch bundt pan.
Measure the flour, 1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar, graham cracker crumbs, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ground cinnamon, softened butter or margarine, orange juice and the eggs. Beat until smooth about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the walnuts and pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (for 45 to 50 minutes) or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cake stand in pan for 20 minutes. Invert cake onto a serving plate and ice with Brown Sugar Glaze.
To Make Brown Sugar Glaze: Combine the confectioners' sugar, water, 1/2 cup brown sugar and the vanilla. Add more sugar or water to make a proper consistency for a barely pourable glaze.
