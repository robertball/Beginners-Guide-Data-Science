Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix
2/3 cup water
12 prepared crisp taco shells
1 tablespoon sour cream
12 (7 inch) flour tortillas
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded lettuce
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Place the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, and add packet of taco seasoning over the meat. Cook and stir the ground beef, breaking it up as it cooks, until the beef is browned and crumbly, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the excess grease.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place the crisp taco shells on a baking sheet, and warm them in the preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes.
To build the tacos, spread sour cream and sprinkle shredded cheese on a flour tortilla shell. Wrap the tortilla gently around a crisp tortilla shell. Spread about 2 tablespoons of ground beef along the bottom of the crisp shell, and sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of shredded Cheddar cheese on top of the meat. Top the cheese with shredded lettuce,and a dollop of sour cream.
