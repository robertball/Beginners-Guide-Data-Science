2 pounds JohnsonvilleÂ® All Natural Ground Italian Sausage, or links, decased
1 pound ground beef

In a large bowl combine sausage and beef. Using your hands, blend the two meats together and form into one large ball. Use a spoon or a small measuring cup to gather up about a 3 oz ball and press into patties.
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, pan fry 4 or 5 sliders at a time. Cook for about 3 minutes then flip and continue cooking for another 3 minutes. Test for doneness. Internal temperature should be 160 degrees F.
Slice the buns and top the sliders with your favorite condiments.
