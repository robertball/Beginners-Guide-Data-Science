Ingredients:
1/2 to 1 LB Hamburger (I prefer less, family likes more!)
1/2 a large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
28 oz can of whole peeled tomatoes
8 oz can tomato sauce
5 Cubes Beef Boullion
3 cups water(use empty cans, easy way to rinse them!)
8 oz Bag Large Elbow Macaroni
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large pot brown the hamburger over medium high heat.
Drain the hamburger in a colander to remove excess grease/fat and then put back into the pot adding the chopped onion and garlic. Cook a few minutes, stirring frequently 'till the onions are softened.
Add in the canned tomatoes and can of sauce, crushing the whole tomatoes in your hand (watch out they really squirt!). Now fill each can a bit with water to make three cups and swish that around and add it.  Add the boullion cubes and bring to a boil.  After a few minutes, stir (to break down the boullion) and add salt & pepper to taste.
Now add the elbow macaroni, bring back to a boil, stir then turn down to a simmer and cover.  Cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally so the noodles don't stick to the bottom.

Description: 
Time tested family recipe uses hamburger, elbow macaroni, and canned tomatoes to make a hearty soup.  You can add other ingredients like canned corn, pinto or kidney beans, or cheese, but I prefer it best when its kept simple.
