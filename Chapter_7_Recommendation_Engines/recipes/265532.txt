Ingredients:
1 cup soy sauce
3/4 cup distilled vinegar
1 medium white onion, coarsely chopped
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
4 green onions, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons dried thyme
2 habanero peppers, stemmed
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
heavy duty aluminum foil

Directions:
Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.
Combine soy sauce, vinegar, onion, olive oil, green onions, thyme, habanero peppers, sugar, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves in a food processor; blend for about 15 seconds to make the jerk seasoning.
Shape foil into a bowl. Add shrimp and pour in enough jerk seasoning to cover. Place the foil bowl on the grill. Seal the top, leaving a small opening. Grill until pink, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Pour shrimp into a medium bowl.
Heat the remaining sauce in a small saucepan over medium heat, 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon sauce over shrimp.
