Description: 
Many food names reflect various occupations or trades. 'Cacciatore' literally means 'hunter' in Italian, and this 'hunter style' dish makes good use of mushrooms (easily available to hunters trekking through forests!), onions tomatoes and herbs.  If desired, serve over hot spaghetti noodles.Modified from: Mom's Chicken Cacciatore
