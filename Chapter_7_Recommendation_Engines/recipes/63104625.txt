Ingredients:
Basil, 25 leaves
Natural by Nature Organic Ricotta, .5 cup
Chicken Breast, package of tenderloins (6)16 ounces
Zucchini, 3 cup, sliced
Pureed Tomatoes, 1 can (29 oz) (401 x 411)
Garlic powder, 4 tbsp
Mozzarella Cheese, part skim milk, 3 oz

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Thinly slice the basil leaves (chiffonade) and mix with the ricotta. Set aside.
Peel the zucchini. With a potato peeler, take off thin slices into long strips until the entire zucchini is cut.
Lay three tenderloins down in a oven safe pan. Top the tenderloins with the ricotta mixture and place the other three tenderloins on top as if the ricotta was in the middle of the sandwich. Wrap each pair of tenderloins with the zucchini so that each one is completely covered.
Place each wrapped tenderloin back in the oven safe pan. Pour over them the tomato puree. Sprinkle the garlic powder on the puree and top with the cheese.
Bake for 60 minutes. Serve hot.
