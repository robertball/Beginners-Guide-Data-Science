Ingredients:
1 (29 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
3 eggs
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 cup butter
1 cup chopped pecans
1 (8 ounce) container Cool Whip

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9 x 13 inch pan with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, combine pumpkin, evaporated milk, eggs, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. Mix until smooth and pour into a 9x13 inch pan.  In a large bowl, stir together melted butter, cake mix, and pecans.  Gently spread batter over the top of pumpkin mixture.
Bake 45 to 60 minutes.
After cake cools, turn out upside down (onto a cookie sheet or other sturdy, flat, portable surface) so the cake part is on the bottom and the pumpkin part is on top. Remove the parchment paper. Top with Cool Whip before serving.
