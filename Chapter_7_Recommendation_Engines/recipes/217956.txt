Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, cut into 1/4-inch cubes
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 (29 ounce) can pear halves, cut lengthwise into 4 slices
1 (1 pound) loaf sourdough bread, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 1/2 cups eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
Evenly distribute the butter cubes into the bottom of a 10x14-inch baking dish. Sprinkle the brown sugar over the butter. Arrange the pear slices into the bottom of the dish. Arrange the bread cubes into a single layer over the pears.
Mix the eggs, milk, sugar, vanilla extract, and almond extract together in a bowl until fully blended; pour evenly over the bread cubes, assuring all pieces are evenly covered. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and chill overnight in refrigerator.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove the casserole from the refrigerator and allow to warm while the oven preheats.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top of the bread is golden brown and the eggs have solidified, 45 to 60 minutes. Top with the sliced almonds to serve.
