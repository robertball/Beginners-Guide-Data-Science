Description: 
A quiche-like dish for a light lunch or brunch, also makes a great side dish. I developed this recipe after having an abundance of zucchini in my garden every summer and trying to find a delicious way to enjoy all of it! You can substitute 2 tablespoons butter for the bacon and drippings if you prefer to leave the bacon out of the recipe.
