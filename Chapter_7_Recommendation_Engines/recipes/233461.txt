Description: 
Many years ago, a southern neighbor taught me to make fried apple pies. I wanted something similar but not fried. I combined several recipes I found on the web along with a gluten-free pie crust recipe I found. Although there are several steps, these hand pies are simple. Kids will enjoy helping with the assembly. Terrific warmed in the microwave with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt on the side!
