Ingredients:
1 ½ teaspoons smoked paprika, divided
½ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon black pepper
4 (8 ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
2 teaspoons olive oil
½ cup chopped green onions
½ large yellow bell pepper, cut into thin strips
4 cups loosely packed torn curly kale
½ cup unsalted chicken stock
1 (8.8 ounce) package UNCLE BEN'S(<sup>&reg;</sup>) <sup>&reg;</sup>EADY <sup>&reg;</sup>ICE(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Spanish-Style <sup>&reg;</sup>ice
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
Salt to taste (optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Combine 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika, garlic powder, and pepper; sprinkle evenly over both sides of chicken.
Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken to pan, skin-side down. Cook until skin is lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn chicken over; cook 3 minutes. Remove chicken from pan (it will not be completely done at this point).
Add green onions and bell pepper to drippings in pan; saute 2 minutes. Add kale and chicken stock; cover and cook 2 minutes or until kale is lightly wilted. Stir rice, vinegar, and remaining 1 teaspoon smoked paprika into kale mixture. Nestle chicken on top of rice mixture. Bake at 400 degrees F until a thermometer inserted into thickest part of a thigh registers 165 degrees F, about 22 minutes.
