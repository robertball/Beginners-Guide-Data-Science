Ingredients:
2 teaspoons McCormick® Gourmet Collection® Crushed Rosemary
1 teaspoon McCormick® Gourmet Collection® Thyme Leaves
1 teaspoon McCormick® Gourmet Collection® Ground Black Pepper

1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup finely chopped onion
1/2 cup orange juice
1/4 cup dry white wine
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
8 loin lamb chops, cut 1 to 1 1/4-inch thick, trimmed

Directions:
Mix crushed rosemary, thyme, black pepper, garlic powder and salt in a bowl.  Add onion, orange juice, white wine and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Whisk together and reserve 1/2 cup marinade mixture for later use.
Place lamb chops in self-closing plastic bag; add marinade.  Turn to coat. Refrigerate 30 to 60 minutes. Remove lamb from marinade and blot dry with a paper towel.  (Do not remove onion pieces from chops).
Heat remaining oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Place lamb in skillet. Sear one side of lamb approximately 4 minutes or until well browned.  Turn chops over and cook 4 minutes longer or until desired doneness. Add reserved marinade and simmer 2 minutes. Remove lamb to a serving plate. Pour reduced marinade over lamb.
