Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
1 cup sugar
1 egg
1/4 cup molasses
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
FILLING:
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 tablespoon grated lemon peel
1 tablespoon butter (no substitutes)
2 eggs
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup flaked coconut

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg and molasses. Combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well. Refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. For filling, in a saucepan, combine sugar, lemon juice, peel, butter, eggs and salt. Cook and stir over low heat until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in coconut. Cool slightly; chill. Divide dough into fourths. Roll each portion into a 15-in. x 3-1/2-in. rectangle. Spread 1/4 cup filling off-center down each rectangle. Bring long edges together over filling; seal edges. Cut into 1-1/2-in. bars; place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool for 2 minutes; remove to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
When I pull these cookies from the oven, everyone gathers to catch a citrusy whiff. The lemony filling, with its chewy coconut texture, squeezes a welcome hint of sunshine into each satisfying bite.
