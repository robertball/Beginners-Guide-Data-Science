Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups aged cheese such as cheddar (about an 8 ouch bar shredded)
1 cup all purpose flour
2 tbsp. cold butter (cut up)
2 tbsp. shortening
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (or to taste and is optional)
2 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons kosher salt

Directions:
Put all of your ingredients (except the milk and kosher salt) into a food processor.  Pulse until all ingredients are well combined and look like fine crumbs.
Add milk and pulse until the dough comes together.
Remove dough from food processor and knead in your hands for a few minutes.  Fold in half, fold in half again and continue until dough is soft and well mixed.
Place dough in a greased bowl, cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
On a floured surface roll out the dough to a 1/8 inch thickness.  Any thicker and the crackers will be soft in the middle.  Cut dough into approximately 1 inch squares.  You can also cut in to strips for "cheese straws" or use small cookie cutters for fun shapes.
Place cut dough on parchment lined baking sheet about 1/2 inch apart.
Using a tooth pick make a small hole in center of dough.
Sprinkle lightly with kosher salt.
Bake crackers approximately 25 minutes or until lightly browned around edges and crackers are firm to the touch.  Some softer centers may occur if the thickness of the dough was not uniform.
Remove crackers to wire rack to finish cooling.
Store in airtight container.
