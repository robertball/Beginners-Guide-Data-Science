Ingredients:
3/4 cup dark chocolate chips

Place chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass measuring cup; heat in microwave, stirring every 10 seconds, until melted and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir yogurt into melted chocolate until icing is smooth.

Description: 
This two-ingredient icing goes together in almost no time, and dresses up plain brownies or a sheet cake. Use less yogurt if you want it to be thicker. This is ready to spread on a cool flat cake or brownies or can be used on a BundtÂ® cake, where it will run down a bit. It will harden in the refrigerator, so it's best to serve immediately or let your dessert reach room temperature before serving, but store any leftover in the refrigerator.
