Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 (1 ounce) squares semi-sweet baking chocolate
3/4 cup butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup packed all-purpose flour
1/2 cup pecans
1/2 cup dried cherries
1/2 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with enough aluminum foil to hang over the edges. Spray the foil with cooking spray.
Melt baking chocolate and butter together in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes. Stir sugar into chocolate mixture until dissolved. Cool mixture slightly.
Mix eggs into into chocolate mixture until well mixed; stir in vanilla extract. Stir flour into chocolate mixture just until batter is moistened.
Process pecans and dried cherries in a food processor until chopped; fold into batter with chocolate chips. Spread batter into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until brownies begin to pull away from the edges and are set in the middle, about 1 hour.
