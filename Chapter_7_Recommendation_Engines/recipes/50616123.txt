Ingredients:
8	boneless skinless chicken breasts
2 tbsp	Dijon mustard
½ tsp	pepper
¼ tsp 	salt
8	thin slices prosciutto ham
16	sheets phyllo pastry
¾ cup	butter, melted
HERBED SABAYON:
4	egg yolks
3 tbsp	chicken stock
2 tbsp	dry vermouth
1/3 cup	finely chopped fresh parsley
2 tbsp	each finely chopped fresh basil and oregano or thyme
1 tbsp	lemon juice
¼ tsp	each salt and pepper

Directions:
Cut chicken in half horizontally almost but not all the way through; open like a book. Brush with mustard; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Lay 1 prosciutto slice on each breast; fold breast over to enclose.
Place 1 sheet phyllo on work surface, keeping remainder covered with damp towel to prevent drying out. Brush with butter; top with second sheet. Center 1 breast on phyllo about 2 inches (5cm) from short edge; fold edge over chicken. Fold sides over and roll up. Place, seam side down, on greased rimmed baking sheet; brush with butter. Repeat with remaining chicken. (Make-Ahead: Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 8 hours).
Bake in 350 F (180 C) oven for about 45 minutes or until golden and chicken is no longer pink inside.
Herbed Sabayon:  In large heatproof bowl or top of double boiler, whisk egg yolks until pale; whisk in stock and vermouth. Place over simmering water; whisk for about 8 minutes or until thickened and frothy. Whisk in parsley, basil, oregano, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Serve with chicken bundles.
Serve with Vegetable Sauté Medley (a combination of sliced carrots, turnips, sugar snap or snow peas) and new baby potatoes.
