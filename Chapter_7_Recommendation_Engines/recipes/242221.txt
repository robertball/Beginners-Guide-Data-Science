Description: 
Sesame whispers sweet-nothings in your ear with this light and tangy adaptation. This recipe avoids vegetable oil while incorporating the complete egg to deliver a healthy-choice alternative spread. Fresh mayo should be used within 2 weeks or less. 

Always serve chilled. Put on sandwiches, in a light crab salad, or use in deviled eggs with a spice injection. Use a pasteurized egg, if possible.
