Ingredients:
9 ounces ground chicken
1/4 cup cooked, diced ham
1 egg
1/2 cup Italian style bread crumbs
8 ounces Swiss cheese, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
1/2 cup Parmesan style bread crumbs
1/2 t. Salt
1/4 t. Garlic Powder
1/4 t. Paprika
1/4 t. Pepper
Canola oil for pan-frying
Sauce:
1 can cream of chicken soup
1/2 cup sour cream
1 tsp. lemon juice or white wine
1 T. Parmesan cheese

Directions:
italian style bread crumbs and added salt and pepper to the meat mixture. I also rolled the meatballs in the italian bread crumbs plus grated parmesian cheese before frying them.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Combine the chicken, ham, and egg in a large bowl until well blended. Gradually add bread crumbs until the mixture loses its stickiness and can be easily formed into balls.
Form the chicken mixture around the cheese cubes, forming 2 inch balls. Roll balls in Parmesan bread crumbs (can add Parmesan cheese to breadcrumbs). Place on a plate.
Heat 1 1/2 inches of oil in a deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry the balls until the outsides are golden brown, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels, and place in baking dish lined with foil.
Bake in preheated oven until cooked through and cheese is soft, about 20 minutes. Cool briefly before serving.
To make sauce:
Mix all sauce ingredients together and heat in small saucepan.
