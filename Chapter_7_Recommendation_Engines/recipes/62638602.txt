Ingredients:
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup brandy or water
1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted
8-10 slices dry bread
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon allspice
3 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 cups milk, scald & cooled

Directions:
Cover raisins with Brandy or water.  Set aside.
Melt butter or margarine.
Break up bread, set aside.
Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, allspice.  Reserve 3 TBLS of this mixture for topping.
Toss bread with remaining sugar mixture.  Pour melted margarine on before you toss the bread crumbs. Your sugar mixture will stick better that way.
Place 1/2 of bread mixture in a lightly greased 1 1/2 qt. baking dish.
Drain raisins, place 1/2 raisins over bread crumbs.  Repeat layers.
Combine egg, salt, & vanilla in a bowl.  Beat for 1 minute.
Add milk slowly. Pour over mix in dish. Let stand for 5 minutes. Sprinkle reserved sugar mix on top.
Bake at 325 for 45 to 50 minutes.

Description: 
Delicious! The first time I've ever made bread pudding and the first one I've ever liked! I replaced one cup of the milk for vanilla flavored milk and that was all I did to tweak it.
