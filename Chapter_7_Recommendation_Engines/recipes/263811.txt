Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter
12 ounces farfalle (bow tie) pasta
9 ounces sour cream
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup milk
1 (6 ounce) can chunk tuna in water, drained and flaked
1 small green onion, chopped
2 tablespoons chopped red bell pepper
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup shredded Gruyere cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking dish with butter.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farfalle pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until halfway cooked, about 7 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Drain again.
Stir together sour cream, cream cheese, and milk in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in tuna, green onion, and red bell pepper. Season with a little salt and pepper. Fold in cooked farfalle and pour into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with Gruyere cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and lightly browned, about 25 minutes.
