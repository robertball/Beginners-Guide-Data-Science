Ingredients:
3/4 cup crushed corn flakes
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 (1 ounce) envelope ranch salad dressing mix
8 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 cup milk
Butter flavored Pam

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter flavored oil spray.
Soak chicken in milk for 15 minutes
Combine corn flakes, Parmesan cheese, and ranch dressing mix in a bowl.
Roll each chicken breast in corn flake mixture until evenly coated. Place coated chicken in the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
