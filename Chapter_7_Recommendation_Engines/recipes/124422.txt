Description: 
Thirty years ago I spent several weeks at a beautiful mountain lodge in Red River, New Mexico. When we arrived, the aroma of this dish greeted us. It was delicious, so I asked for the recipe and it's been a favorite ever since. Nowadays, my married daughter likes to prepare it for her family.
