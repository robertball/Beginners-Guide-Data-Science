Ingredients:
1 - 18 oz jar creamy peanut butter
1 stick butter, room temp or barely melted
1 lb powdered sugar
1 T vanilla
1 - 12 oz bag chocolate chips
1 block paraffin

Directions:
Cream together peanut butter, butter, and vanilla.
Add powdered sugar a little at a time and continue to cream together.  You can do this in a Cuisine Art with the metal blade, or if you do it by hand, you will end up kneading the dough by hand.
When the peanut butter mixture is thoroughly blended there will be no white marks visible.
Roll into balls about an 1.5 inches in diameter.
Melt the chocolate chips together with the paraffin over VERY LOW HEAT.  You can do this without a double boiler only if you are VERY careful to keep it stirred and on a low heat just enough to melt it.
Using a fondue fork or pickle fork, skewer the balls and dip in the melted chocolate
Dip each ball 2 to 3 times to coat with chocolate, leaving a space about as big around as a nickel at the top where the fork is to make it look like a buckeye.
Let cool slightly in between each dip.
Lay out on wax paper on a cookie sheet to let the chocolate harden.  You can put the cookie sheet in the fridge for a few minutes while you dip the next batch to hurry this process along.
Smooth over the holes left by the fork
Enjoy with a big class of really cold milk.
