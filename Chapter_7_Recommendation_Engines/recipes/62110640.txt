Description: 
This makes a great sweet and savory sauce or salad dressing like the ones served at restaurants. It makes a great dip for fresh Thai or Vietnamese spring rolls. It's easy to make and I usually have all the ingredients in my cupboard. Garnish with mint leave and chopped peanuts if desired.
