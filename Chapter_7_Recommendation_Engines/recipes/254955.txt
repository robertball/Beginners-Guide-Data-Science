Ingredients:
Eggplant:
1 large eggplant, cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons garlic powder, divided
1 teaspoon onion powder, divided
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
2 eggs
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
Sauce:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 large onion, chopped
2 teaspoons minced garlic, or to taste
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes
1/2 (14.5 ounce) can chopped tomatoes
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons dried oregano, or to taste
2 teaspoons dried basil, or to taste
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning, or to taste
Filling:
1 (15 ounce) container low-fat ricotta cheese
1 (8 ounce) package fresh spinach
1 egg
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place eggplant slices in a large dish and cover with salted water. Let soak, about 15 minutes. Drain and cover with milk.
Combine flour, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large resealable plastic bag.
Beat eggs lightly in a shallow bowl that is long enough for the eggplant slices to fit in.
Combine panko, remaining 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in another large resealable plastic bag.
Place 1 slice eggplant in flour mixture, shaking to coat. Dip in egg. Transfer to bag with panko mixture, shaking to coat. Repeat with remaining slices.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet. Cook coated eggplant slices in batches until golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a cooling rack. Repeat with remaining eggplant, adding oil as needed.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion softens, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, chopped tomatoes, 2 teaspoons pepper, oregano, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, and poultry seasoning. Reduce heat to low and cover; cook sauce, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, 10 to 15 minutes.
Mix ricotta cheese, spinach, egg, Parmesan cheese, 1 teaspoon garlic, nutmeg, salt, and pepper together gently in a bowl to make filling.
Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons of filling over each eggplant slice. Roll slices into logs and arrange in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking pan. Pour tomato sauce evenly on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly, about 30 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
