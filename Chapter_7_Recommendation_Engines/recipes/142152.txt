Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, trimmed and cut into bite-size florets
3/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon mustard
1 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
3 hard boiled eggs, chopped
1 onion, chopped
3/4 cup frozen green peas, thawed
1/4 cup dill pickles, chopped
3 slices crisply cooked bacon, crumbled (optional)

Directions:
Place cauliflower in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring  to a boil and cook until just fork tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool slightly.
In a large bowl whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, salt, and pepper. Add the cauliflower, eggs, onion, peas, dill pickles, and bacon to the dressing and stir until well coated. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 24 hours. The longer the cauliflower salad chills, the better the flavor.

Description: 
I came up with this one summer when I was on a low carb diet, it is similar to a potato salad but made without the potato.
