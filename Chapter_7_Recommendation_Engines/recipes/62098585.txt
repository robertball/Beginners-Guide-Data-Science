Ingredients:
1 egg, slightly beaten
3/4 cup milk
1 cup freshly grated parmesan (not the kind from the can)
3/4 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs
1.5 pounds ground beef
2 15 ounce cans diced tomatoes, undrained
1 cup Heinz 57 steak sauce
2 tablesoons flour
2 tablespoons sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 and line a 9 by 13 inch baking dish with foil that has been sprayed with nonstick spray.
Thoroughly combine the egg, milk, parmesan, bread crumbs and ground beef in a bowl and shape into 30 meatballs.
Bake the meatballs for 30 minutes in the preheated oven.
In a large saucepan, stir together the tomatoes, Heinz 57 sauce, flour, sugar and salt and bring to a simmer.
Carefully add the meatballs to the sauce and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and being careful not to break up the meatballs.
Serve over your favorite pasta.  We prefer wide egg noodles!

Description: 
This is a recipe my mom has been making since I was a little kid.  I was quite picky and hated canned tomatoes and ground beef, but loved this recipe!  It is still one of my favorites and everyone I've fed it to loves it as well.  Although it looks like normal spaghetti sauce and meatballs, it doesn't really taste like it because of the yummy, tangy steak sauce.
