Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound bok choy
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons freshly ground szechuan peppercorns
zest of 1 lemon
1 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1 pinch brown sugar

Directions:
Trim off the ends of the bok choy and chop, keeping the white parts separate from the green as they will need to cook longer. Rinse and spin or pat dry. Set aside.
Heat the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the bok choy stems first; stir fry for a few minutes or until the pieces start to turn a pale green. When stems are almost cooked, add garlic and ground szechuan pepper and cook for a minute.  Add the bok choy leaves, lemon zest, water, soy sauce, and brown sugar and cook until leaves are wilted.
