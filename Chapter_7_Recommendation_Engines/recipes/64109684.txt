Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup rolled oats
4 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
(or 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1 tsp nutmeg,  and 1/2 tsp allspice)
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups pumpkin puree
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
2/3 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup applesauce (or 1 apple, cored and pureed)
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup rolled oats
2 Tbsp all-purpose flour
2 Tbsp hazelnut flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.
Combine 2 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup oats, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk pumpkin puree, 1 cup brown sugar, white sugar, vegetable oil, applesauce, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a separate large bowl. Stir flour mixture into pumpkin mixture; mix well.
Beat 1/4 cup brown sugar with butter in a bowl until creamy and smooth. Whisk 2 tablespoons oats and 2 tablespoons flour, using a fork, into sugar-butter mixture until streusel topping is crumbly.
Pour the batter into the prepared muffin tin. Sprinkle each muffin with streusel topping.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes.
