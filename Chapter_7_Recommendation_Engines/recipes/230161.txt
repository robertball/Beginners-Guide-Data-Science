Description: 
If you don't cook fish often, or don't like fish, this broiled red snapper recipe may be just what the doctor ordered. Normally we don't want to cover up the delicate flavors of the seafood, but in this case, we have no choice. It's not like you can't tell you're eating fish, but close enough.
