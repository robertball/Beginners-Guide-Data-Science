Ingredients:
2 pounds carrots, peeled and chopped
1/2 cup margarine
3 eggs
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a stockpot of salted water to a boil. Cook carrots until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and drain well.
Place carrots in a food processor with the margarine, and pulse to puree. Add the eggs, brown sugar, flour, baking powder, and baking soda, and process until smooth.
Pour carrot mixture into a 1quart, round baking dish. Place the dish inside a larger dish with 1 inch of water to prevent burning bottom of casserole.
Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven for 1 hour, or until firm.
