Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
6 ounces ground lean pork
3/4 cup chopped onion
1-2 clove minced garlic
1 1-lb can tomatoes
1 15 oz can tomato sauce
2 tbsp parsley flakes
2 tbsp sugar
1 tsp salt
1 tsp basil leaves
3 cups creamed cottage cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tbsp parsley flakes
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp oregano leaves
1 8-oz package lasagna noodles, cooked and drained
3/4 lb shredded Mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook and stir ground beef, ground pork, onion and garlic in large saucepan or Dutch oven until meat is brown and onion is tender. Drain off all fat.
Add tomatoes and break up with fork. Stir in tomato sauce, 2 tbsp parsley flakes, the sugar, 1 tsp salt and the basil.
Heat to boiling, stirring occasionally. Once boiling, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 1 hour or until the mixture is the consistency of spaghetti sauce.
Heat oven to 350F(180C)
Mix cottage cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1 tbsp parsley flakes, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and the oregano.
Reserve 1/2 cup of meat sauce.
In a 13x9 baking pan, layer 1/4 each of the noodles, remaining meat sauce, mozzarella cheese, and the cottage cheese mixture; repeat this three times and spread reserved meat sauce over the top and sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.
Bake uncovered for 45 minutes. For easier cutting, let it stand for about 15 minutes after taking it out of the oven.
