Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
2 medium onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic cloves, minced
2 cups ketchup
1 cup barbecue sauce
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup cider vinegar
2 tablespoons prepared mustard
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon pepper
hamburger buns, split

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook beef, onions and garlic over medium heat until the meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the ketchup, barbecue sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, mustard, Italian seasoning, onion powder and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes.
Serve about 1/2 cup meat mixture on each bun. Or cool and freeze in freezer containers for up to 3 months.
To use frozen sloppy joes: Thaw in the refrigerator; place in a saucepan and heat though. Serve on buns.

In Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, Sandra Castillo simmers up a big batch of this tangy sandwich filling, then freezes the extras. 'Just thaw and reheat it for a quick dinner. It's also good for larger gatherings,' she writes.
