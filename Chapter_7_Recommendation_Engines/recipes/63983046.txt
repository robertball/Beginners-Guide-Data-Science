Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, coarsely chopped
1/2 cup shredded cheese blend
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 egg
1 teaspoon chopped garlic
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place cauliflower pieces through the feeding tube of the food processor using the grating blade; pulse until all the cauliflower is shredded.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer cauliflower to a large bowl and put in an ice bath stirring occasionally, until cooled, about 15 minutes. Press out as much fluid as you can.
Preheat pizza stone in the oven, or your Tragger Grill,  to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Stir cheese blend, parsley, egg, garlic, salt, and pepper into cauliflower until evenly incorporated. Pour mixture onto a sheet of parchment paper; press and shape into a pizza crust. Again, press the crust with a dish cloth to remove as much moisture as possible.
Transfer the crust, on the parchment paper to the pizza stone. Bake in the preheated oven or Tragger until lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
Then top with your favorite pizza topping and return it to the stone for another 15 minutes.
Serve and enjoy!
