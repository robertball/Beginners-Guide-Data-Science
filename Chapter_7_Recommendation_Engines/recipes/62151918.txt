Pastellios [The Puerto Rican Empanada] Recipe

Ingredients:
-Chop meat [About 2 lbs]
-2 packages of Goya Discos [about 10-20 per package]
-1 red pepper
-1 green pepper
-Assorted Seasonings: onion power, garlic powder, sazon, adobo, oregano, salt & pepper
-1 Tablespoon of Sofrito *optional*
-Oil [Vegetable, Olive, Corn... whatever kind you prefer]
-A big frying pan (or two)
-Flour
-Small can (or two) of tomato sauce
-Shredded cheese [again, your call... chedder, mozzerella, munster, etc]

Directions:
First, prepare & cook the meat!Season the chop meat with the assorted seasonings I listed above to your taste [I tend to put a lot of everything, as I like my food spicey and succulent]. Chop up the red & green peppers and toss some of that in, too. Put the meat into a frying pan on medium heat. Add the small can of tomato sauce and the sofrito. Mix all this up very well! When the mean is cooked, drain it out and keep on the side. It's going to smell amazing... don't pick at it!!!
Make sure your Discos are thawed out. You might want to individually moisten them with water to make them more pliable. Pour some flour out on a plate and lay the Disco down in it. Take a scoop of your cooked meat and place it in the center. Sprinkle on some cheese. Fold it in half (be careful not to crack the disco) and seal open side with a fork. It will look like a plump half moon (with ridges).
Now, once all the pastellios have been molded, time to start frying! Fill your pan halfway with oil on medium heat, and once the oil starts to pop, add the pastellios in (be CAREFUL not to get burned... it will be sizzling)! Sometimes, I add them into the oil as I finish making them to make the process go faster. You can usually fit 4 into a pan, maybe 5. COVER the frying pan with aluminum foil, unless you want grease everywhere. After 5-10 minutes, flip them over. Remember, the meat is already cooked, so you're just frying the shell to make it crunchy. After another 5-10 minutes, they should be golden brown and all set! Drain on paper towels, let cool (some of the hot oil will have escaped into the pastellio), and then serve.

My mother taught me this recipe when I was a little girl. When I have dinner parties, I make these and everyone goes wild. Last time, 50 wasn't enough for a group of ten people. Let me know what you think, and feel free to email me if you have trouble. Enjoy!
