Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
6 eggs
1/4 cup hazelnut liqueur
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons almond extract
2 cups hazelnuts - toasted, skinned and coarsely chopped

Directions:
Mix dry ingredients (except nuts) in a large bowl. Mix the eggs and liquids in a separate bowl. Add liquids to the dry ingredients gradually, mixing until dough is stiff.  Do not overmix.  Stir in or work in the nuts.
Shape dough into two rectangles 3 inches wide, 15 inches long.  Place on greased cookie sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove baked rectangles from oven and let stand until cool to the touch.
Using sharp knife, slice rectangles crosswise into 3/4 inch slices. Place back on cookie sheet, sliced side down, and bake again for 15 minutes or until they are golden brown.  Store in airtight container. These store well for weeks.

Description: 
These are so crunchy they should be dunked (Coffee, Latte, Espresso, Vino, etc.).  If you don't have hazelnuts, use almonds instead.
