Banana Coconut Pecan Muffins Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup raw sugar
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
4 ripe bananas, mashed
1/4 cup So Delicious® Dairy Free Original Coconut Milk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 cup whole pecans and/or pecan pieces
1/2 cup coconut flakes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line muffin pans with muffin/cupcake liners. You can also lightly spray the pan if you don't have liners. In a small bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. Stir and set aside. In a larger bowl, mix sugar and oil together then add mashed bananas. Note: I didn't want to dirty another bowl so I peeled each banana and squished them individually with my clean hands right into the bowl. This 'technique' makes for a chunkier banana consistency, which I like for a breakfast muffin. If you do not like that, mash the bananas in a separate bowl then add to the sugar/oil mixture.
To your wet mix also add coconut milk and vanilla, stirring until everything is thoroughly combined. Add flour mixture to wet mixture and stir lightly, then add pecans and coconut. Stir until everything is just combined. Note: the batter will be fairly thick. Spoon batter into muffin tins about 3/4 full.
Bake for 20-25 minutes until muffins are golden brown on top.
