Ingredients:
12 (6 ounce) bone-in chicken thighs, skin removed, if desired
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
2 carrots, diced
2 stalks celery, sliced
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
2 (14.5 ounce) cans CONTADINA速 Diced Tomatoes, undrained
3 tablespoons CONTADINA速 Tomato Paste
1 3/4 cups COLLEGE INN速 Chicken Broth
Cooked polenta, pasta or mashed potatoes (optional)

Directions:
Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a deep  12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. (Omit oil if leaving skin on).
Brown chicken on both sides, about 5 minutes, working in batches, if needed.  Remove chicken from pan and set aside.   Add onion, carrots and celery to pan. Cook over medium heat until softened, about 3 minutes.  Add garlic, thyme and oregano; cook 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
Stir in tomatoes and tomato paste. Add broth; bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer 3 minutes.
Return chicken to pan. Cover and simmer on low heat 25 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink inside (165 degrees F internal temperature).  If desired, remove chicken from pan and simmer sauce on high heat for a few minutes until slightly thickened. Serve over polenta, pasta or mashed potatoes.
