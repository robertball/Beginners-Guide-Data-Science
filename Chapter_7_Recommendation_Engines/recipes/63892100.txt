Ingredients:
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons prepared Dijon-style mustard
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon lemon zest
dash lemon juice
dash balsamic
3 cloves garlic, minced
5 pounds whole leg of lamb
1 teaspoon coarse sea salt

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the honey, mustard, rosemary, ground black pepper, lemon zest and garlic, dash of lemon juice and the balsamic vinegar. Mix well and apply to the lamb. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place lamb on a rack in a roasting pan and sprinkle with salt to taste and 1 cup water in bottom.
Tent with foil.  Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 20 minutes, turning it down to 350 for 1 hour before putting the heat up to 400, removing the foil and continued to cook for a further 10 - 15 minutes. Roast was medium.  The internal temperature should be at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) when taken with a meat thermometer for medium rare. Let the roast rest for about 20 minutes before carving.
Medium is 160 degrees but keep in mind the internal temperature will rise as it is resting about 10 degrees.
145 is medium rare
