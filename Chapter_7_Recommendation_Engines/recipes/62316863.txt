2 to 3 large garlic cloves, minced
1 pound fresh spinach, stemmed and coarsely chopped
1 pound shrimp, peeled, deveined and patted dry

Prepare orzo according to package directions, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid before draining.
Meanwhile, in a well-oiled large skillet, preferably nonstick, saute garlic until aromatic and softened. Add spinach a little at a time, tossing until spinach is cooked down. Remove spinach to a plate.
In the same skillet, add shrimp and cook until just done, turning once or twice. Add the juice of half the lemon and stir to combine. Gradually add orzo, stirring to combine. Return spinach to pan and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper and additional lemon juice, if desired. If dry, add cooking liquid a little at a time until just moistened.
