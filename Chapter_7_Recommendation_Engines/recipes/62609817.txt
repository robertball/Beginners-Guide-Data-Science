Ingredients:
2 cups quick-cooking oats
1 cup dark brown sugar
½ cup canola oil
1 egg
½ cup chopped nuts
½ cup dried fruit: raisins, cranberries or other dried berries
2 teaspoons cinnamon or a mixture of cinnamon, cloves and/or allspice

Directions:
1. Place the oats, brown sugar and oil in a bowl. Stir well. Let sit for 8 hours.
2. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Add remaining ingredients to the oat mixture and mix well. The mixture will be very crumbly and will not resemble batter much.
3. Drop mixture by teaspoonfuls onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Cookies will spread so leave adequate room between each cookie. Bake 15 minutes. Let cool slightly. Remove to rack to cool completely.
