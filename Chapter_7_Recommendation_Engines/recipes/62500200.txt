Ingredients:
5/8 cup warm water
1/2 cup canned pumpkin puree
1/4 cup canola oil
1/4 cup nonfat dry milk powder
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
2 3/4 cups bread flour
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
In a small bowl, whisk together. . .
2 cups brown sugar
1 1/2 Tablespoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice

Directions:
Place in bread machine in order recommended by manufacturer.  Run through Dough cycle.
Melt ½ cup butter in a bowl for dipping dough balls
Take dough when cycle completes and put on a floured board.  Dough will be sticky so keep hands lightly floured.
Roll dough into ½ to 1 inch balls.  Dip each ball in melted butter, use a fork to remove it and roll it in the sugar mixture until thoroughly coated.  Place all coated balls into prepared bundt pan.  Cover pan lightly with plastic wrap and damp cloth, and let rise for 60 minutes or until doubled in size.
350 oven for 25 to 30 minutes.  There will be extra butter and sugar so if you want to roll the  balls first setting them aside, you can pour the extra butter and sprinkle extra sugar into bundt pan before adding the balls.  Can also add lightly toasted pecans to butter and sugar.
