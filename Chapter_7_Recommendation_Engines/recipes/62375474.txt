Ingredients:
2 boneless butterfly porkchops ( or 4 boneless oval chops)
1 large yellow onion - diced
3 cloves garlic - minced
40 baby carrots - chopped
1 tsp salt & pepper
1 or 2:  10 3/4 oz cans Cream of Mushroom soup (depending on how much of a gravy lover you are, if you like your chops served over rice I'd recomend at least a can and a half)
** flavor booster - not needed but every once in a while I'll rub a Montreal Chicken seasoning or Garlic salt with parsley on the pork before braising**

Directions:
In a large skillet, pour vegetable oil - enough to cover the bottom of the pan, warm on medium heat. Let heat form bubbles in the bottom of the pan but not hot enough for the oil to pop. Lay chops in skillet to braise at least 5 min on each side, drain oil.
Pile diced onion, minced garlic, and chopped carrots on top of chops, sprinkle with salt & pepper. Pour cream of mushroom soup ontop of veggies smooth with spatula and cover.
Bring to a boil on medium heat, turn heat down (to a 3 or so on ur stovetop) keep covered and simmer 45 - 60 minutes.. the longer the simmer the softer the chop.
**about every 10 min uncover and lift the edges of your chops, letting sauce and veggies sift down to the bottom. no need to 'stir'. dont take 5minutes to do this, keep covered as often as possible**
