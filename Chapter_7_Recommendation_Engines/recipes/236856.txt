Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1 tablespoon peppermint extract
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 2/3 cups mint chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, peppermint extract, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat eggs into butter mixture until well incorporated.
Whisk flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda together in a bowl; gradually add to creamed butter mixture, beating until dough is well blended. Fold chocolate chips into dough. Drop dough by rounded teaspoons onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are set in the middle, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
These taste like a hybrid of a chocolate chip cookie and a Girl Scouts Thin MintÂ®. I like to make these the week leading up to Christmas as a change from traditional holiday cookies.
