Ingredients:
3 Poblano peppers
3 ounces Goat Cheese
1 cup cooked brown rice
1/2 red onion, diced
2 stalks of celery, diced
1/2 C frozen corn
2-3 cloves of garlic, crushed
PAM cooking spray
cayenne powder to taste
cumin to taste
chili powder to taste

Directions:
First step is to char the peppers. I did this under the broiler- turn peppers until skin is burnt on all sides then remove from oven and wrap in foil- put aside to cool, so skins will peel off easily.
In a saute pan add PAM, onions, garlic, celery-cook until softened. Add corn and rice. Add a sprinkle of cayenne, pinch of cumin and a few sprinkles of chili powder.  Stir to blend spices into mixture and to heat through. Remove from heat and set aside.
Time to peel the skin from the peppers- also cut a slice down one side and remove seeds and stem.
Stuffing the peppers- Be careful- they tear easily! Divide the rice up into the peppers and add in 1 ounce of cheese to each one. I placed mine in the microwave to heat up and melt the cheese. Topped with fresh salsa and sliced tomatoes.
