Ingredients:
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach
8 ounces crumbled feta cheese
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup cubed processed cheese food
1 cup melted butter, divided
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine the spinach, feta cheese, mozzarella cheese, processed cheese food, 1/2 the butter, vinegar, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Mix well and set aside.
Place a layer of phyllo dough into the bottom of a lightly greased 2-quart casserole dish. Spread the spinach and cheese mixture into the dish and top with 4 layers of phyllo dough, spraying each layer with butter-flavored cooking spray. Drizzle the remaining butter over the top.
Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 20 minutes.

Description: 
I use this as a main dish casserole, side dish or as an appetizer--whatever the occasion calls for. If you prefer, you may also add 1 can of rotel tomatoes to the cheese-spinach mixture for a little zing.
