Tacos:
Heat the shredded corned beef on a griddle or in a fry pan without any oil, just toss until warm. Heat tortillas in a dry pan to warm up, don't brown much.  Put a portion of coleslaw in the bottom of each tortilla, then a few ounces of the warmed corned beef and drizzle sauce over top.  Serve immediately.
Sauce Directions:
Mix yogurt and mayonnaise in a separate bowl. Stir in 1 pinch of cayenne pepper, 2 tablespoons of cilantro, lime juice, and salt. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve. Combine 1 1/4 cup of cilantro and onion in a bowl. Set aside.

Description: 
We had these at an Irish Pub, they were to die for.  A combination we thought wouldn't taste too good but all the patrons said it was the best thing on the menu, they were right!  Corned Beef, coleslaw and sauce inside a flour tortilla.
