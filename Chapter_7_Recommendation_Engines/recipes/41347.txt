Ingredients:
3 egg yolks
1 cup sugar, divided
2 teaspoons hot water
1/2 cup orange juice, warmed
1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon grated orange peel
1/4 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 egg whites
3/4 cup reduced-fat frozen whipped topping

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, beat egg yolks until slightly thickened. Gradually add 3/4 cup sugar and hot water, beating until thick and lemon-colored. Blend in the orange juice, vanilla and orange and lemon peels. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt; add to egg yolk mixture.
In another mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Add the remaining sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff peaks form. Fold a fourth of the egg whites into the batter; fold in remaining whites.
Spoon into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 - 25 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Immediately invert pan; cool completely. Cut into slices; serve with whipped topping.
