Ingredients:
•1 chicken (Approx 2.25kg) cut into 10 pieces
•1 garlic (separated into unpeeled cloves)
•2 lemon(s) (unwaxed) cut into chunky eighths
•1 handful thyme
•3 tablespoon(s) olive oil
•150 ml white wine
•1 pinch of black pepper

Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 160°C.
Put the chicken pieces into a roasting tin and add the garlic cloves, lemon chunks and the thyme; just roughly pull the leaves off the stalks, leaving some intact for strewing over later. Add the oil and using your hands mix everything together, then spread the mixture out, making sure all the chicken pieces are skin side up.
Sprinkle over the white wine and grind on some pepper, then cover tightly with foil and put in the oven to cook, at flavour-intensifyingly low heat, for 2 hours.
Remove the foil from the roasting tin, and turn up the oven to 200°C. Cook the uncovered chicken for another 30-45 minutes, by which time the skin on the meat will have turned golden brown and the lemons will have begun to scorch and caramelise at the edges.
Serve straight from the roasting tin: so just strew with your remaining thyme and dole out.
