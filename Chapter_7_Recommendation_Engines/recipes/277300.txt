Ingredients:
Muffins:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup milk
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
Chocolate Sauce:
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
18 candied pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.
Combine flour, sugar, butter, milk, eggs, vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Mix using a rubber spatula until combined; set aside.
Place chocolate chips, milk, and vanilla extract in a microwave-safe bowl. Stir. Microwave until melted, about 30 seconds. Mix together until it is a thick, dark chocolate sauce. Stir into flour mixture until completely combined and light brown in color.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 1/2 to 3/4 full. Place a candied pecan onto the top of each muffin.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a chocolate-pecan muffin recipe that I made for my family after I got home from school. It's easy to make and really warms you up on a cold day! I thought it was a perfect treat right before Thanksgiving. You can sprinkle the muffins with confectioners' sugar when they're done baking, if you like.
