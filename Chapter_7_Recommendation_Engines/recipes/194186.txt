Ingredients:
1 (7.5 ounce) can salmon, drained and flaked
3 tablespoons thousand island salad dressing
1 green onion, chopped
4 slices whole wheat bread, toasted
20 whole fresh spinach leaves

Directions:
Place the salmon and thousand island dressing in a bowl, and mash with a fork to combine. Stir in the green onion, cover, and refrigerate about 15 minutes.
To make the sandwiches, place 5 whole spinach leaves on two toasted slices of bread, covering as much of the slice as possible. Spread half of the salmon mixture on top of each sandwich, and top with 5 more leaves of spinach. Place the remaining slices of toasted bread on top.

Description: 
Simple ingredients make a hearty sandwich using canned salmon (pink or sockeye). The spinach helps keep your toast from getting soggy, especially if you make this in the morning to pack for lunch. Refrigerate the sandwiches up to 24 hours.
