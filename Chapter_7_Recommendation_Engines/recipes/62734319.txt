Ingredients:
Altered Crab Dip
1 8 oz softened cream cheese
1 T mayonnaise
1 7 oz can crab meat
2 green onions sliced including the green stem
1 T prepared horseradish
1/4 t salt (I omit)
Freshly ground black pepper
A couple splashes of tabasco
2 T chopped jalapenos
2 small handfulls of Colby/Jack shredded cheese
Sprinkle of Old Bay Seasoning
Sprinkle of slivered almonds
Sandwich
2 to 4 slices of rye bread
Mayo spread on the skillet sides
1 slice of Colby/Jack sliced cheese per sandwich

Directions:
Prepare the Crab dip by blending all the above ingredients.  Taste as you go.  Bake the crab dip at 375 degrees with the slivered almonds on top in the oven for about 20 to 25 minutes or until golden and bubbly on top.  Let it cool before using as a sandwich spread.  We ate half of it just as a dip.  Mmmmmm.  Spread mayo on the grilling side of each piece of rye.  Spread crab dip on the inside of one piece of rye and then place the sliced cheese on top.  Add the second piece of rye on top with the mayo side up.  Grill till golden brown.  Let sit a bit and then cut in half.

Description: 
This delicious sandwich is a combination of an altered crab dip recipe and a sandwich I saw on a local restaurant's menu.  It turned out to be a match made in heaven!  Oh and it has about 5,000 calories.
