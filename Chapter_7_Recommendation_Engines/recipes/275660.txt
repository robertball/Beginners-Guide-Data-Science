Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup Dutch-processed unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 cups stout beer
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon instant espresso powder
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup butter
2 large eggs
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 (4 ounce) bar dark chocolate, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease three 8-inch round cake pans and line bottoms with parchment paper.
Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and baking powder into a large bowl.
Combine stout, vanilla extract, and espresso powder in separate bowl and stir.
Beat sugar and butter together in another bowl until creamy, scraping sides occasionally. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition. Beat in mayonnaise. Alternate adding the flour and stout mixtures, 1/3 at a time, beating after each addition. Fold in dark chocolate just until combined. Split batter between the 3 prepared pans and level out the tops.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cakes comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 15 minutes, then run a knife around the edge and flip onto a cooling rack. Let cool completely.
