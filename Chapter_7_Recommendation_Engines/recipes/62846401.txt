Ingredients:
3 Racks of pork baby back ribs
1/4 cup       brown sugar
1 1/2 Tbsp.   paprika
1 Tbsp.       kosher salt
1 1/2 Tbsp.   black pepper
1 tsp.        garlic powder
1 tsp.        onion powder
1/4-1/2 tsp. cayenne red pepper
1 Bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce

Directions:
Tear off pieces of aluminum foil big enough to enclose each portion of ribs. Spray each piece of foil with vegetable cooking spray.
Mix all the ingredients together, except for BBQ Sauce.
Remove the membrane on the back of the ribs by slitting with a knife, grip the membrane with a paper towel, and pull. It will rip right off.
Using the mixed ingredients, less the BBQ Sauce, rub the ribs with the ingredients.
Place each portion in its own piece of foil. Wrap tightly and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or overnight.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Bake ribs wrapped tightly in the foil at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 2 1/2 hours. Remove from foil and brush the ribs liberally with barbeque sauce and put in the broiler for 10-15 mins.
