Ingredients:
1/2 (8 ounce) package penne pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®), chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons dried basil
1/2 cup sugar snap peas
1/3 cup chicken stock
1/3 cup Marsala wine
1 splash sweet white wine
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, garlic, and basil in the hot oil until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Stir snap peas into onion mixture and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour chicken stock, Marsala wine, and white wine into skillet. Add penne pasta; cook and stir until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.
Divide pasta and snap pea mixture into 2 bowls and sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese to serve.

Description: 
I was craving some pasta the other night and thought that Marsala wine would compliment it great. This recipe is what I came up with on the spur of the moment with what I had lying around my poor, grad school student's kitchen.  I think it turned out delicious!
