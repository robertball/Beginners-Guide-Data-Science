Ingredients:
2 (15 ounce) cans pitted dark sweet cherries, drained
2 cups vanilla Greek yogurt
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup half-and-half
1/2 cup milk
1 (1.5 fluid ounce) jigger creme de cassis liqueur

Directions:
Pulse drained cherries in a food processor until chopped. Transfer to a large bowl. Add yogurt, evaporated milk, sugar, half-and-half, milk, and creme de cassis liqueur; mix well.
Pour into an electric mixer's ice cream attachment. Follow manufacturer's instructions and mix for 25 minutes on the 'stir' setting.
Pour the chilled mixture into a freeze-proof container and freeze until it reaches "soft-serve" consistency, about 2 hours. Transfer frozen yogurt to a one- or two-quart lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal.

Description: 
I used a Kitchen AidÂ® ice cream attachment to make this frozen yogurt. I call it adult because it has liquor in the ingredients. I hope you enjoy this as much as my family does.
