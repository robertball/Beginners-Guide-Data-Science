Ingredients:
1 (10.5 ounce) can beef consomme (or use 18 oz beef broth w/ no water)
1 cup water
1/4 t garlic salt
1/4 t onion powder
1/4 t rosemary (opt)
onion, green pepper
1 pound thinly sliced deli roast beef
8 slices provolone cheese
4 hoagie rolls, split lengthwise or dense roll

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Open the hoagie rolls and lay out on a baking sheet.
Heat beef consomme, water and spices in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat to make a rich beef broth. Place the roast beef in the broth and warm for 3 minutes. Arrange the meat on the hoagie rolls and top each roll with 2 slices of provolone.
Bake the sandwiches in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, or until the cheese just begins to melt. Serve the sandwiches with small bowls of the warm broth for dipping.
