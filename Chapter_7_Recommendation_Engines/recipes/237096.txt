Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 (16 ounce) packages confectioners' sugar
1 (12 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons pastel multi-colored candy sprinkles, or to taste

Directions:
Beat butter in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Mix cream cheese and vanilla into creamed butter until smooth; stir in confectioners' sugar until incorporated. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until mixture is firm, about 2 hours.
Roll sugar mixture into small egg-shapes; arrange on a baking sheet. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours more.
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Melt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Dip eggs into melted chocolate using a fork or wooden skewer until evenly coated.
Arrange dipped eggs on the prepared baking sheet; garnish with sprinkles. Allow chocolate to harden, about 30 minutes. Place eggs in paper muffin or candy cups and store in refrigerator.

Description: 
My grandmother used to make these every year at Easter. They taste very similar to the 'Mary Sue' butter cream Easter eggs that they used to sell during Easter-time when I was a kid.
