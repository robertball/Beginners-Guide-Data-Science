Ingredients:
2 pkgs. Pillsbury crescent rolls
2 (8 oz.) pkgs. cream cheese (can use low fat)
1 pkg. Uncle Dan Southern Ranch dressing mix
3/4 c. mayonnaise
3/4 c. chopped cauliflower
3/4 c. chopped broccoli
1/2 c. chopped green peppers
1/2 c. chopped red peppers
1/4 c. sliced green onion
4 oz. sliced mushrooms
2 c.  shredded sharp cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  Lay crescent rolls out flat on a large jelly roll pan (approx 7 x 11 x 1).  Pat down, pressing together at the seams.  Bake for 7-8 minutes (do not brown).  Let cool.
Mix together softened cream cheese, mayonnaise, and dressing mix.  Spread over cooled crescent rolls.  Sprinkle chopped veggies, one at a time in above order, over top. Cover with sliced mushrooms and sprinkle cheddar cheese all over. Cover with foil and refreigerate at least an hour so cream cheese can firm up.

Description: 
Got this recipe many years ago from a friend.  I take it to potlucks and am always asked for the recipe. You can use other veggies, but this seems to be the best combination. I buy the broccoli and cauliflower mix in the grocery store to save some time
