Ingredients:
3 russet potatoes, peeled and each cut into 8 wedges
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 slices turkey bacon, or more to taste
1 cup shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend
2 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Toss potatoes with olive oil, salt, and pepper in a bowl until coated. Arrange potatoes in 1 layer in an oven-proof skillet.
Cook potatoes over medium-high heat until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until golden brown on other side, about 4 more minutes.
Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until tender, about 25 minutes.
Place turkey bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and chop.
Sprinkle bacon, Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese, and green onions over potatoes. Return to oven until cheese is melted, about 3 minutes.

These yummy potatoes are like some I enjoyed in a pub once, with a nice cold beer. Top with caramelized onions, sour cream, chili, or whatever you have on hand. Yum!
