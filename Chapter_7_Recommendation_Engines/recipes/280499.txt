Description: 
I love the flavor of green enchiladas, but sometimes I don't love rolling all the tortillas, lol! Here is a casserole that gives that great, tangy flavor, but in much less time. Garnish with sour cream, if you like. Mexican rice and borracho beans are great sides for this Tex-Mex family meal.
