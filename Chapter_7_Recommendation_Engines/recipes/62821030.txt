Ingredients:
1 dried chipotle chili pepper
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup frozen pineapple juice concentrate
1/2 cup olive oil
zest and juice of 2 limes
6 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup cumin seeds
1 small pineapple, peeled, cored, and diced into 1-inch chunks
1/2 head green cabbage, sliced
1/2 head red cabbage, sliced
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
2 red bell peppers, cut into 2-inch strips
salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

Directions:
Toast the chipotle pepper in a skillet over medium heat until fragrant and pliable.  Use scissors to cut open the pepper and remove the stem and seeds.  Boil the water, then place the pepper and water in a bowl.  Cover and let sit for 5 minutes while the pepper rehydrates.
Combine the pineapple concentrate, olive oil, lime zest and juice, and minced garlic in a small bowl. In the same skillet used to toast the chipotle, toast the cumin seeds over medium heat for a minute or two.  Add to the dressing ingredients.  Once the pepper has softened, drain it and mince, then add to the dressing.  Stir to combine and set aside.
In a large bowl, combine the pineapple chunks, cabbages, cilantro and red bell pepper.  Add the dressing mix and toss thoroughly.  Add salt and pepper, or additional lime juice, to taste.  Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour before serving.

Description: 
Adapted from a Yucatan Cabbage Salad recipe from a great cookbook called Lettuce in Your Kitchen, this slaw is a great accompaniment for barbecued meats but has a fruity and spicy zing of its own.
