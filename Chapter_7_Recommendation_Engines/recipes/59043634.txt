Ingredients:
oil for deep frying
2/3 cup hot sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon all-purpose seasoning such as Johnny's
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
10 chicken wings

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). The oil should be just enough to cover wings entirely, an inch or so deep.
In a small bowl mix together the flour, garlic powder, cayenne pepper and all-purpose seasoning. Place chicken wings in a large nonporous glass dish or bowl and sprinkle flour mixture over them until they are evenly coated. Be sure to shake of the excess flour before frying.
Fry coated wings in hot oil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until parts of wings begin to turn brown. Remove from heat, place wings in serving bowl, add hot sauce and stir together. Serve.

Description: 
These spicy wings are quick and easy to toss together for a favorite party snack.  If you buy a pre-made wing sauce you can leave out the costly butter most wing recipes call for without sacrificing the heat!Modified from: Restaurant-Style Buffalo Chicken Wings
