Description: 
Start the day with this healthy, delicious smoothie! With lowfat dairy, fresh spinach, berries, flax, and almonds, you're getting many of your daily needs through a straw first thing in the morning! I wouldn't mind having it for every meal! It's an easy way to get spinach in your child's diet because the berries take over the color and the spinach actually makes it sweeter!
