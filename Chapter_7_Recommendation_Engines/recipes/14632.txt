Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds round steak
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 green bell pepper
1 (29 ounce) can diced tomatoes
4 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cube beef bouillon cube
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
2 cups water
1 cup white rice
2 cups water

Directions:
Trim any fat from round steak and slice meat into thin 2 to 3 inch long strips. Remove the seeds and core from the green bell pepper, and slice into thin 3 inch long strips.
In a large frying pan over medium to high heat add oil and cook meat until medium rare, add peppers and continue cooking until meat is browned.
Reduce heat to simmer and add tomatoes, soy sauce, garlic powder, black pepper  and ginger. Cover and simmer 10 minutes.
Dissolve bullion cube and corn starch in 2 cups water and stir well before adding to simmering beef. Cover and simmer 10 minutes, stirring occasionally,  until sauce resembles the consistency of gravy.  Remove from heat and serve over a bed of rice.
To cook rice: In a saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Stir in 1 cup of rice. Cover and reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer for 20 minutes.
