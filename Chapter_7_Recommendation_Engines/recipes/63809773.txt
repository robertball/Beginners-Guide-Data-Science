Ingredients:
• 1 cup finely ground almond meal
• 2 tablespoons ground flax meal
• 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese, fine
• 1 teaspoon dried rosemary, chopped
• 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
• 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
• 1 teaspoon sea salt
• 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
• 1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil
• 1 large egg white

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350° F
Prepare a large baking sheet and line with parchment paper. Tear another sheet the same size and set aside. Also, take out your rolling pin.
In a medium mixing bowl combine all of the dry ingredients and mix together using a fork. Then add in olive oil and egg white and combine together using a spoon forming into a ball.
Take the parchment paper that is lined in the baking sheet and set on the counter. (this makes the process much easier). Place the ball on top of the parchment paper then top with the 2nd pieces.
Use your rolling pin and thin out creating a rectangle shape to fit the pan.
Gently peel back the top parchment paper and take a pizza wheel or a large knife and shape into squares. (or any shape you desire).
Bake for 12 minutes and let cool for 10 minutes then gently break apart.

Description: 
I just realized I didn’t have any crackers in the house for company we are having tonight. I was about to make another recipe with almond meal and flax meal so I had them handy in the kitchen. Next thing I knew I was shredding fresh parmesan cheese and made cracker! These Rosemary and Thyme Parmesan Crackers are just amazing! They are gluten free.. Enjoy
