Ingredients:
1 pound FRESH green beans
2 Tablespoons minced garlic
1 Tablespoon olive oil
1/4 to 1/2 cup soy sauce

Directions:
Trim and discard ends of the green beans. Wash beans, drain and pat dry thoroughly. Heat olive oil in large stir fry pan, wok or skillet on medium high. Add garlic and briefly saute before adding green beans. Continually stir beans with a wooden spoon to prevent sticking to the bottom. Add soy sauce once the beans have cooked off all of their natural liquid. Continue cooking beans and stirring until soy sauce has evaporated and the beans are wilted with a slight crunch. Beans will be dark, but they should NOT taste burnt if you keep stirring.
Serve warm.
