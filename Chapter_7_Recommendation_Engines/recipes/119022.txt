Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) loaf round bread
8 ounces process cheese (eg. Velveeta), cubed
2 cups sour cream
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup diced fully cooked ham
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon butter, melted
Assorted fresh vegetables

Directions:
Cut the top fourth off the loaf of bread; set top aside. Carefully hollow out bottom, leaving a 1/2-in. shell. Cube removed bread; set aside.
In a bowl, combine the process cheese, sour cream and cream cheese. Stir in the ham, green onions, chilies and Worcestershire sauce. Spoon into bread shell; replace top. Wrap tightly in heavy-duty foil and place on a baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 60-70 minutes or until the filling is heated through.
Meanwhile, toss reserved bread cubes with oil and butter. Place in a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown, stirring occasionally. Unwrap loaf and remove bread top; stir filling. Serve with vegetables and toasted bread cubes.
