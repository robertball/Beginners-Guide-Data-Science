Ingredients:
*1 small/medium white sweet potato with skins (a regular sweet potato works great too!)
*1 Tablespoon Coconut Oil
*1-2 teaspoons Cinnamon (depends on size of sweet potato)
*Salt (to taste)

Directions:
Wash sweet potato and cut into cubes.
Steam sweet potato for 20 minutes or until fork slides through cubes easily.
Put cubes into bowl and mash with a fork (I don't like it completely pureed but a little chunky).
Stir in Coconut Oil, Cinnamon, and sprinkle a little salt.
5. Enjoy!
6. Lick the bowl
