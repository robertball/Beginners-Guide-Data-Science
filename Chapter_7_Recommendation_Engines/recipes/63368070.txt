Ingredients:
8 chicken leg, including thigh and drumstick
kosher salt
freshly cracked black pepper
1/2 cup cumin seeds, or 1/4 cup ground cumin
1/3 cup olive oil
1/3 cup roughly chopped fresh oregano
1/4 cup fresh lime juice, about 2 limes
1 tablespoon minced garlic

Directions:
Sprinkle the chicken legs with salt and pepper to taste, rub with the cumin, and grill over a medium-low fire for 12 to 15 minutes per side.  Watch the chicken particularly carefully when it is fat side down, because danger of flare-up lurks.  To check for doneness:  Cut inside the joint and peek to see that there is no redness next to the bone.
While the legs are cooking, combine the olive oil, oregano, lime juice, and garlic in a small bowl and mix well.  Remove the legs from the grill, drizzle the olive oil mixture over the top, and serve at once.
