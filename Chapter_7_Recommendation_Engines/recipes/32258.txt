Ingredients:
2 (46 fluid ounce) cans fruit punch
1/4 cup grenadine syrup
1 (2 liter) bottle lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage
1/2 cup French vanilla ice cream
1 (16 ounce) jar maraschino cherries

Directions:
Pour fruit punch into a large punch bowl. Stir in grenadine and lemon-lime soda. Add the ice cream in big scoops - it will resemble a big fluffy cloud. Drop cherries on top of the cloud of ice cream and serve.
