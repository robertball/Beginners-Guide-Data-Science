Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package bow-tie pasta
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound bulk sweet Italian sausage
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 1/4 cups dry white wine
1 1/2 tablespoons rubbed sage
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
1 1/2 cups canned pumpkin
3/4 cup half-and-half
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a deep, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Drain and discard grease.
Heat teaspoon oil in the skillet. Add onion and garlic; saute until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain pasta and return to the pot.
Add wine and sage to the skillet. Simmer until wine is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Pour in chicken stock and pumpkin; stir until sauce starts to bubble. Return sausage to the skillet. Reduce heat and stir in half-and-half. Season sauce with cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Simmer until sauce thickens, 5 to 10 minutes.
Pour pumpkin cream sauce over the pasta. Toss over low heat for 1 minute. Taste and adjust seasoning.
