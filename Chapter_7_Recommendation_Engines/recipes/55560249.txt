Ingredients:
1 cucumbers, peeled & finely diced
3 tomatoes, finely diced
1 sweet onion, finely diced
1 green bell pepper, finely diced
1 Anaheim pepper, finely diced
1 clove garlic, minced
4 C V8 juice
2 Tb fresh lemon juice

Directions:
In a large bowl combine all the ingredients, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. This will give the soup time to meld all the flavors together and let the juices from the vegetables mix.

Description: 
Best gazpacho ever - and one of the easiest. I use a vegetable chopper to dice the vegetables evenly and quickly. A great way to celebrate summer's produce. Serve with hearty bread.

Original recipe from Robert Irvine. I made a few variations to suit our tastes.
