Ingredients:
1 pound yams, peeled and cubed

Place the steamed yam cubes into a bowl, and mash them with the sugar and vegetable oil until very smooth.
Clean the steamer insert, and line with parchment paper. Place the mashed yam pudding into the steamer over a saucepan of water as before; bring to a boil, cover, and steam for 30 minutes. Serve hot.
