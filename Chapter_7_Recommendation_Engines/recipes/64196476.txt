Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef, extra lean
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon minced onion (I use a whole onion)
15 ounces tomato sauce, divided
2 tablespoons brown sugar (I use 3 T)
2 tablespoons vinegar (I use apple cider vinegar)
4 tablespoons granulated sugar (I use 3 T)
2 teaspoons prepared mustard

Directions:
Pre-heat over to 350 degrees.
Lightly coat 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pan with cooking oil.
Mix together beef, bread crumbs, salt, pepper and eggs in large bowl. Add onion and 1/2 of the tomato sauce. Form into loaf in pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 50 minutes.
Combine remaining tomato sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, granulated sugar and mustard in small saucepan. Bring to boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally until sugars dissolve. Pour over meatloaf; bake 10 minutes more.
