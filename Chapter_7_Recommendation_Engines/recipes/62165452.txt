Ingredients:
4 Tilapia filets (approx. 1 pound total), thawed if previously frozen
2 T. Sazon Completa or Low-salt all-purpose seasoning blend
1/2 c. grated Parmesan Cheese
2 T. Smart Balance 50/50 Butter Blend, melted.
1-1/2 T. Kraft Free Mayo
Juice and zest of 1 Lemon
1/8 t. dried basil
1/8 t. black pepper
1/8 t. onion powder
1/8 t. celery salt
Pam Olive Oil Cooking Spray

Directions:
Preheat Broiler. Line broiler pan with Aluminum foil and Spray broiler pan rack with Pam to keep fish from sticking.
In a small bowl, mix Parmesan, Smart Balance, Mayo, lemon zest and juice. Add basil, pepper, onion powder, and celery salt, mix until well blended. Set aside.
Sprinkle fish with Sazon. Arrange fish fillets in single layer on broiler pan. Broil 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the fillets over and broil for another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from oven. Using a butter knife, spread parmesan mixture on the top of the filets. Return to broiler. Broil for another 3 to 5 minutes, or until topping turns golden and fish flakes easily.
Makes 4 servings.
