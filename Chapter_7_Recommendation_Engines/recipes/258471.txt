2 large shallots, chopped, or more to taste

2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 baguette
1 clove garlic, halved
5 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Heat butter and 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in shallots. Cook and stir until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool, 20 to 25 minutes.
Combine pears, 1 teaspoon olive oil, thyme, salt, and pepper with the shallots; stir until evenly mixed. Cover and refrigerate shallot mixture for about 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Slice baguette into rounds. Rub with garlic and brush with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place on a baking sheet.
Toast in the preheated oven until golden, 8 to 10 minutes.
