Ingredients:
1 small pumpkin
6 potatoes - peeled and cubed
salt and pepper to taste
garlic powder to taste
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 (15 ounce) can cream-style corn
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn

Directions:
Cut a 4 inch circle off the top of the pumpkin, including the stem; set aside to be used later as a lid. Remove seeds and stringy insides of pumpkin. Place pumpkin in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, and mash. Season with salt, pepper and garlic powder; set aside.
In a skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef until no pink shows; drain. Spoon the ground beef into the pumpkin. Pour in the creamed corn and whole kernel corn. Top with mashed potatoes. Cover with pumpkin lid. Pour 2 cups of water in the baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until pumpkin is tender and can be pierced with a fork.

Description: 
My grandmother made this many years ago. My children love it. The cooked pumpkin around the 'shepherd's pie' is sweet and delicious! What a surprise when the lid of the pumpkin is lifted!
