Ingredients:
1/2 cup hulled millet
2 tablespoons slivered almonds
2 tablespoons pepitas
2 tablespoons shredded unsweetened coconut
1 tablespoon flax seeds
2 cups unsweetened almond milk, divided
3 medjool dates, pitted and diced
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Pulse millet in a blender or food processor until it resembles coarse ground coffee. Set aside.
Heat a nonstick saucepan over medium-high heat. Add almonds and toast until golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add pepitas and continue to stir and toast until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in coconut and flax seeds and toast until golden, about 5 minutes more. Pour mixture into a bowl and set aside.
Pour ground millet into the same pan. Toast until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Pour in 1 1/2 cups almond milk, stirring to ensure there are no lumps. Bring to a boil; add dates. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally.
Add 2 tablespoons of the toasted seed mixture to the porridge. Sprinkle in cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir well. Continue simmering until thickened, 6 to 10 minutes.
Pour porridge into two bowls. Divide remaining seed mixture and 1/2 cup almond milk between bowls and serve.
