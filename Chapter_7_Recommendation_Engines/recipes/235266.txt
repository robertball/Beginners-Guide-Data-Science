Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 ribs celery, chopped
2 carrot, chopped
1 onion, quartered
1 head garlic, halved lengthwise
2 pounds leftover turkey carcass, or as needed
2 bay leaves
4 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
1 sprig rosemary
1 teaspoon ground sage
4 quarts water, or as needed

Directions:
Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium heat. Cook and stir celery, carrots, onion, and garlic in oil until slightly softened and fragrant, 5 minutes. Add turkey, bay leaves, salt, peppercorns, rosemary, and dried sage. Cook until fragrant, 5 minutes more. Pour enough water in to cover turkey and vegetables.
Bring mixture to a boil, cover pot, and reduce heat to low. Simmer, skimming fat occasionally, until flavors are blended, 4 to 5 hours. Strain liquid into a container and discard carcass and vegetables.
