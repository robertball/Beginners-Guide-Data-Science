Ingredients:
4 medium artichokes
1/2 cup butter, melted
3 tablespoons basil pesto
1/4 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs

Directions:
Trim the stems from the artichokes, and remove the small leaves from the bottoms. Slice 1 inch or so off the top so that it is flat. Pour 2 cups or 1 inch of water into a large pot, and insert a steamer basket. Place artichokes into the steamer, cover, and bring to a boil. Allow them to steam for about 15 minutes, or until a fork can easily pierce the stem.
In a cup or small bowl, mix together the melted butter and pesto. Drizzle the mixture over upright artichokes, being sure to dribble into all of the crevices. Then sprinkle bread crumbs across the tops and serve.
