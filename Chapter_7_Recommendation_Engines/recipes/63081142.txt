Ingredients:
SALAD:
1 Large head Romaine lessuce, chopped
1 6oz. Bag dried cranberries or cherries
1 Large apple, cut into small pieces
1 Small container crumbled bleu or feta cheese
1 Cup pecans (toasted or untoasted)
DRESSING*:
1 Cup vegetable oil
1/4 Cup red wine vinegar
1/4 Cup sugar
1 Teaspoon salt
1 Tablespoon parsley (fresh is best - dry works fine)

Directions:
Combine ingredients for dressing together in jar and shake well until well blended.  Drizzle dressing over salad.  Store unused portion of dressing in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to one month.
*Note:  This recipe makes a lot of dressing.  You may wish to cut the recipe in 1/2, or do what I do... Make up a batch and save some for a later date.  It stores well for a long time in the refrigerator.
