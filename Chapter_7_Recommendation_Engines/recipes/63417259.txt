Ingredients:
1 cup frozen corn, drained
1/4 cup roasted peppers, diced
1/2 cup cilantro, chopped, extra for garnish
1 teaspoon cumin
1 green onion, chopped
pinch of salt
pinch of dried chili flakes
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 large eggs, beaten
1/2 cup semolina
1/4 cup feta, crumbled
1 tablespoon olive oil
fresh lime, cut in wedges

Directions:
Mix the corn, roasted peppers, cilantro, cumin, green onion, salt, chili flakes and freshly ground black pepper in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, beat the two eggs. Mix into the corn mixture and stir in the semolina. Crumble the feta into the mixture and carefully stir until all of the ingredients are incorporated.
Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium high heat. Drop 3 tablespoons of the batter into the pan. Cook slowly and flip once the fritter becomes crisp and golden, around 2 to 3 minutes. Once cooked through, about an additional 1 to 2 minutes, remove from the heat and place on a large plate. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm and repeat with remaining batter until all fritters are complete.
Serve with wedges of fresh lime and extra cilantro.
