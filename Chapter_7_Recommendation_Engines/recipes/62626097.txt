Ingredients:
1 - 10 oz. box Lorna Doone shortbread cookies
1/2 cup butter (1 stick)
2 - 4 oz pkg french vanilla or vanilla instant pudding mix
2 cups milk
1 quart vanilla ice cream, softened (can speed process by putting in microwave and use very low power at 40 second intervals, stirring between each cycle till softened)
8 oz Cool Whip, thawed
3 regular sized Heath candy bars (or may use Skor candy bars)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Crush cookies in a heavy baggie using a rolling pin or process into crumbs using a food processor. Melt butter and combine well with cookie crumbs in a bowl. Even press into bottom of 9 x 13 pan (Hint: you may like to use the bottom of a glass to help press crumbs firmly down into pan). Bake crust at 350 for 12 minutes; remove and cool completely. In large bowl whisk together the pudding mixes and milk. Add softened ice cream and whisk or stir with spoon just until well incorporated. Pour pudding mixture over cooled crust. Cover and chill for about 1 hour (It is not absolutely necessary to chill before spreading Cool Whip on top, but I find it helps make it a bit easier). Evenly spoon and spread Cool Whip over filling. Coarsely chop candy bars or place in a heavy baggie and hit with hammer to break into very small pieces. Sprinkle over the Cool Whip. Cover and chill 2 hours.
