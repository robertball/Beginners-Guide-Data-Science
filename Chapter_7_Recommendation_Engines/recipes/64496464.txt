Ingredients:
1 package yellow cake mix (regular size)
2-1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
3/4 cup butter, melted
1 jar (12 ounces) seedless raspberry preserves
1 Tbsp water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a large bowl, combine cake mix, oats and butter until crumbly. Press 3 cups of the crumb mixture into a greased 13"x 9"-in. baking pan. Bake 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack 5 minutes.
In a small bowl, stir preserves and water until blended. Spread over crust. Sprinkle with remaining crumb mixture. Bake 25-28 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into bars.

Description: 
Using a pre-made cake mix hurries along the prep work for these yummy bars. Raspberry jam adds a pop of color and sweetness (although you can use any flavor you prefer), and oats lend a homey touch.
