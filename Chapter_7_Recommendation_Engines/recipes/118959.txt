Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) unbaked pastry shell
1 cup shredded Swiss cheese, divided
1/2 cup chopped sweet red pepper
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups half-and-half cream
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3/4 cup flaked imitation crabmeat, chopped

Directions:
Line unpricked pastry shell with a double thickness of heavy-duty foil. Bake at 450 degrees F for 5 minutes; remove foil. Bake 5 minutes longer. Immediately sprinkle 1/2 cup cheese over crust.
Reduce heat to 375 degrees F. In a skillet, saute red pepper and onions in butter until tender. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, cream, salt and pepper. Stir in the crab, red pepper mixture and remaining cheese. Pour into crust. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 15 minutes before cutting.
