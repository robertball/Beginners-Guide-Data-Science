Ingredients:
2 pounds pork shoulder roast, cut into cubes
1 teaspoon dried rosemary leaves, crumbled
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, diced
1 carrot, peeled and diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup dry red wine
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup chicken stock

Directions:
Season pork with the rosemary, thyme, pepper, and salt.  Heat oil in a large large Dutch over over medium-high heat. Sear pork in the hot oil until well browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.
Stir onion and carrot into pot; cook until onion is soft, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Pour in the wine; stir, scraping the bottom of the pot to release any browned bits from the bottom.  Stir in the tomatoes and stock. Bring to a simmer; cook until meat is very tender and the sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
A perfect make-ahead dish that is served best over Parmesan risotto, but is also great over pasta or potatoes! Lamb or beef can also be substituted and is just as delicious!
