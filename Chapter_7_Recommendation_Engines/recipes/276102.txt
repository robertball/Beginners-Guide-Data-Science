Ingredients:
2 tilapia fillets
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste
10 chives, cut in half
1 1/2 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cut a piece of heavy duty aluminum foil large enough to make an airy foil pouch to hold tilapia fillets.
Place fillets on top of the foil and season with dill, salt, and pepper. Place chives on top of fillets, followed by butter. Seal up pouches loosely.
Cook fillets on the preheated grill until they flake easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes.
