Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) fillets boneless, skinless rainbow trout
2 teaspoons soy sauce
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
4 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Rub trout fillets with soy sauce. Season with salt, pepper, and sugar; set aside.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic, ginger, and green onions; cook and stir until golden brown. Add trout fillets and cook until browned and crispy, about 3 minutes. Turn fillets over, and continue cooking until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes more.

This delicious, simple recipe that I put together after asking various people what to do with rainbow trout!  The soy sauce can be adjusted to taste.  My family loves this with steamed rice and snow peas.
