Ingredients:
•	3 tbsp lemon juice
•	2.2 lbs golden delicious apples
•	1.1 lbs red anjou pears
•	1/4 cup water
•	1 cinnamon stick

Directions:
Fill halfway a large bowl with water. Add the lemon juice and mix. Wash, peel, core, and slice the apples and pears putting them into the lemon water to keep them from turning brown.
Drain the fruit. Do not rinse. Add the drained fruit, 1/4 cup water, and cinnamon stick to an electric multi-cooker. Set the manual setting to high pressure for 3 minutes.(It could take up to 10 minutes to reach pressure, this will depend upon your altitude.) Allow the natural release before opening. (This can take up to 15 minutes.)
Once the pressure has released, open the lid. Remove and discard the cinnamon stick. Pass the cooked fruit through a rotary vegetable strainer (the kind used to make tomato sauce). This will leave the sauce course. If you prefer a smoother sauce, use an immersion blender instead of the strainer.

Description: 
Apples mixed with pears make a sweet dessert or snack without any added sugar. Using an electric pressure cooker cuts down on time and seals in the nutrition.
