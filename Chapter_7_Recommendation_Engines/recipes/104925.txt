Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked rice
2 cups water
2 tablespoons nonfat milk
5 tablespoons raisins
2 teaspoons margarine
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon sugar

Directions:
Bring rice, water, milk, raisins, and margarine to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until liquid has absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes.  Mix together cinnamon and sugar, sprinkle over rice to serve.
