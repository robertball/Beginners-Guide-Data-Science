Ingredients:
3 (15 ounce) cans sliced beets
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 cup water, or as needed
18 hard-cooked eggs, peeled
1 sweet onion, sliced (optional)

Directions:
Drain juice from canned beets into a large container with a lid; stir in apple cider vinegar, sugar, and water until sugar has dissolved.
Mix sliced beets, hard-cooked eggs, and sweet onion into the liquid; add more water so liquid covers eggs completely if needed.
Cover container and refrigerate for 1 to 3 days, stirring the eggs and beets twice daily. The longer they soak, the deeper the eggs' color will be.
