Ingredients:
1/2 small onion, diced
1/2 medium red bell pepper, diced
2 tablespoon EVOO
2/3 cup Arborio rice
3 to 4 cups of chicken broth
1 6 oz can of lump crab meat
1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary

Directions:
Heat the EVOO over medium-low heat. Stir in the onion, bell pepper, and rice.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion begins to turn translucent, about 5 minutes.
Turn the heat up to medium, and gradually stir in 1 3/4 cups of the broth.  Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally.  Cover and cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, 12 to 14 minutes.
Stir in remaining broth, crab, and rosemary.  Add more broth if necessary.  Heat through.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
