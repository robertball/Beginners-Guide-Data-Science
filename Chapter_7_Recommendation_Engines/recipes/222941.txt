Description: 
This recipe quickly becomes the favorite of pretty much everyone that tries it. It's so tasty, it's easy to make, and the ingredients are interchangeable!  You can use the dressing immediately or make it in advance and store in refrigerator up to a couple of days. I have substituted pears and mandarin oranges for the strawberries and feta instead of blue cheese. Be creative! YUM!
