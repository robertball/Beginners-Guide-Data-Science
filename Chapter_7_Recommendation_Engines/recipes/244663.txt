Ingredients:
4 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened baking chocolate (such as Baker's®)
1/4 cup vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance®)
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup pumpkin puree

1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish.
Microwave chocolate and butter together in a large microwave-safe bowl in 10 second increments until chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. Stir sugar, pumpkin, applesauce, stevia, and vanilla into chocolate mixture. Add flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to chocolate mixture; stir in chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in center of dish comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool on a rack for 20 minutes.

Description: 
Anytime I have a chocolate craving, my mind goes to brownies. Thick, rich, gooey brownies. Sadly, my brownie cravings could never be fully indulged by the lower calorie recipes I was using. So, I created my own!

 This egg-free, dairy-free, 100% vegan recipe contains applesauce and pumpkin puree instead of oil and eggs. It tastes just as decadent as the regular version!
