Description: 
I don't know where I got this recipe from, but recipes are only guidelines for me, so I am not sure if this is the real recipe or my variation of the original. I didn't even know what to call it! I love this dish, and so does my entire family. I serve with Spanish rice or ranch beans and a salad.
