Ingredients:
1 loaf thin sliced sandwich bread
6 Tbsp butter, melted
1 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup parmesan cheese, grated
1/3 cup shredded swiss cheese
1/3 cup chopped onion
1/2 tsp Worchestershire sauce
2 drops Tabasco sauce
1 can cooked salad shrimp
1 can cooked crab meat, flaked

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Remove crusts from bread slices. With a rolling pin, flatten slices of bread. Using a three inch cookie cutter, cut one round from each slice. Dip each round into melted butter, coating both sides. Press into medium size tart pans. Bake 8 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oven and cool in pans.
Prepare seafood filling by combining all ingredients except shrimp and crabmeat in a small bowl. Mix until blended.
Carefully add shrimp and crabmeat.
Fill each tart shell with filling. Sprinkle tops with paprika. Place under broiler until golden and bubbly - two or three minutes.
Remove from pans. Serve immediately,

Description: 
I grew up on these - they are one of my Mom's standard Christmas party hors d'ouevres  from about 1980 or so;  but they seem to be timeless - she finally shared the recipe with me, and when I serve them the entire platter is gone in literally ten minutes!
