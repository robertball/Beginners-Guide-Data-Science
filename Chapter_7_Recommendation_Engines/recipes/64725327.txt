Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef, browned and drained
1 12oz bag Frozen Chopped Onions
3 heaping teaspoons minced garlic
4 14oz cans Beef Broth
2 29oz cans Tomato Sauce
2 Green Bell Peppers, chopped
2 Red Bell Peppers, chopped
1 tsp Dried Oregano
1 tsp Dried Basil
1/2 tsp Salt
1/4 tsp Black Pepper
4-6 cups cooked instant rice (I probably added closer to 6 cups when I made it the first time, but I would add less to get more of a soup than a stew.)

Directions:
Put everything except the rice in the slow cooker.
Cook on low for 4-6, high 3-4.
Add cooked rice close to the end so it doesn't soak up too much liquid.
Garnish with cheese.
