Ingredients:
2 slices bread
2 tablespoons margarine, divided
2 slices Swiss cheese
1  cooked chicken breast half
1 tablespoon barbecue sauce
2  slices honey-cured deli ham

Directions:
Spread one side of each slice of bread with margarine, and place a bread slice, margarine-side down, into a nonstick skillet over medium heat.
Place a slice of Swiss cheese, the cooked chicken breast, a layer of barbecue sauce, the ham slices, and the remaining Swiss cheese slice onto the bread slice in the skillet. Top the sandwich with the other bread slice, margarine-side up.
Gently fry the sandwich, flipping once, until the cheese is melted and gooey, and the bread is golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side.

Description: 
A quick twist on a regular grilled cheese sandwich. I made this to use up some leftovers in my fridge, and it turned out great. I seasoned the chicken breast with seasoned salt.
