Description: 
A compound butter is simple a culinary term that refers to any butter to which other flavorings are added. This technique is wonderful for chicken as well. It really keeps the breast moist, adds flavor, and gives the skin a great crisp, shiny finish. The secret ingredient is a small dash of Chinese 5-spice, which contains ginger, cinnamon, and star anise, which gives the turkey a very subtle and delicious aroma.
