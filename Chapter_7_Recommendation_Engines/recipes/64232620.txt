Ingredients:
1 pound baking potatoes,peeled and shredded (3 cups)
1/4 cup grated onion
2 eggs, beaten
6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Mix potato, onion, eggs, crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.
Pour enough vegetable oil into a skillet to fill about 1/2-inch deep; heat over medium-high heat.
Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture into the hot oil; slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so they are evenly thick.
Cook in hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a plate lined with a paper towel.
