Ingredients:
1/2 small eggplant, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 small zucchini, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 small summer squash, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 cup shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced
1 cup grape tomatoes
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon lemon zest

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
Cut eggplant slices into wedges and place in a large bowl. Add zucchini, summer squash, mushrooms, tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, oregano, and salt; toss to combine. Place vegetables in a single layer in the air fryer basket, working in small batches if necessary.
Cook vegetables in the air fryer at 360 degrees F (182 degrees C) for 5 minutes. Stir, and continue to cook until tender and edges turn golden brown, about 5 minutes more. Transfer vegetables to a baking pan and place in the preheated oven to keep warm while cooking remaining vegetables.
Sprinkle vegetables with lemon zest before serving.
