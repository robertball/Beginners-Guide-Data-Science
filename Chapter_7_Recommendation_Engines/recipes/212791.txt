Ingredients:
1 cup margarine
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1/4 cup instant hot chocolate mix
1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Beat the margarine and 1 package of cream cheese with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in the flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, and vanilla. Cover dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Mix 1 package of cream cheese with the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, cinnamon, hot chocolate mix, and chocolate chips. Set aside.
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Divide dough into four equal portions. Roll each portion of dough into a 10 to 12-inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Spread a thin layer of the chocolate filling on each circle. Cut each circle into 8 wedges. Roll each wedge, starting with the wide end. Place the cookie point-side down on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
I took a rugelach recipe and invented my own filling with cream cheese instead of fruit spread. It came out so tasty I had to share it!
