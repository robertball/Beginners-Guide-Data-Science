Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 bay leaf
6 black peppercorns
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup tomato sauce
1 cup chicken broth
1/4 teaspoon anise seed
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon white sugar
3 tablespoons dried red chile pepper
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1 slice white bread, torn into pieces
1 1/2 ounces Mexican chocolate, grated
1 (4 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces

Directions:
Place butter, onion and garlic in a 3 quart microwave safe casserole dish. Cover and microwave on low for 2 to 3 minutes, or until butter is melted and onion is starting to soften.
Mix in the bay leaf, peppercorns, cloves, tomato sauce, chicken broth, anise seeds, cinnamon, sugar, red pepper flakes, sesame seeds, almonds and bread. Cover and microwave on high for 10 minutes, stirring after 5 minutes.
Stir in chocolate until it is melted, then add chicken pieces, coating each piece with mole sauce. Cover and microwave on high for about 30 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear (meat will be starting to fall away from the bone). Note: While cooking chicken, rearrange pieces after 10 and 20 minutes to ensure even cooking.

Description: 
This is a microwave version of Mole Poblano, which consists of chicken in a dark, spicy chocolaty sauce full of nuts and sesame seeds. Most traditional mole recipes require several hours of preparation and cooking time; this version is for those of us who have limited time for cooking! Muy bien!
