Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust
5 red onions, quartered with roots intact
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 egg yolks
5/8 cup heavy whipping cream
4 1/2 ounces goat cheese
salt to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
Line a 9 inch fluted, loose-bottom flat tart pan with pastry.  Chill for 15 minutes.  Cover with foil, and fill with pie weights.  Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove foil and weights, and bake for a further 5 minutes.
Put onions in a roasting tin, and drizzle over the oil.  Season with salt and pepper. Roast for 15 minutes.  Set aside to cool.  Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat together egg yolks and cream, and season with salt and pepper.  Arrange the red onions over the base of the baked pastry.  Pour cream mixture over onions.  Slice the goat cheese thinly, and dot over the top of the tart.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until custard has just set.
