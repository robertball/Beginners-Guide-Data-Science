Description: 
This is kimchi jigeh, Korea's traditional of all traditional dishes. Below is the hands-down, best kimchi jigeh recipe of all times. I know this because it's my grandma's that was handed down to my mom. Serve with white rice, brown rice, noodles, or whatever. I sometimes dig right in and just enjoy the pure goodness of this spicy, tangy, hot pot stew by itself. It's Umma's Original Kimchi Jigeh. Hope you like it.
