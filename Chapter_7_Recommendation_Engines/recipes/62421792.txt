Ingredients:
22 frozen Rhodes Bread Rolls
1 stick margarine
1/2 cup brown sugar (light)
1-2 tsp cinnamon
1 package butterscotch Jell-O pudding mix (NOT instant)
3/4 cup milk

Directions:
Night before you will eat:  Arrange the 22 frozen rolls evenly in a bundt pan.  Cut up the stick of margarine into approx. 10 slices and place evenly over the rolls.
Mix the 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, and Jell-O pudding mix together in small bowl.  Pour the mixture evenly over the butter and rolls in the bundt pan.
Then place a towel over the bundt pan and let sit over night (the rolls will rise.)
In the morning, pour the 3/4 cup milk into the bundt pan (you may have to find a crack in the risen rolls.)  Then bake for 20-23 min at 350* or until the rolls are not doughy.  Let sit for a few minutes, then turn the bundt pan over onto a sheetcake pan and enjoy!
