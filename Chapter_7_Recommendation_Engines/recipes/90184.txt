Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
2/3 cup sugar
3 cups thinly sliced rhubarb
15 seedless grapes, halved
1/2 orange, sectioned
10 fresh strawberries, hulled and halved
1 apple, cored and diced
1 peach, sliced
1 plum, pitted and sliced
15 pitted Bing cherries
1/4 cup fresh blueberries

Directions:
Bring water and sugar to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Stir in the rhubarb, turn heat to low, cover, and simmer until rhubarb is soft, 10 to 15 minutes.  Mash and chill in the refrigerator, about one hour.
To serve, mix the grapes, orange, strawberries, apple, peach, plum, cherries, and blueberries with 2/3 cup of the rhubarb sauce.  Stir gently, but thoroughly to coat.  Refrigerate for at least two hours to allow the flavors to blend.

Description: 
One day I decided to stir some rhubarb sauce into my fruit salad - and LOVED the result.  The rhubarb sauce keeps fruits from turning brown too.
