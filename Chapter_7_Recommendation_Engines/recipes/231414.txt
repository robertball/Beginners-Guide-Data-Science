Description: 
This dish is very spicy, somewhere between sweating brow and teary eyes! Sometimes you just have to wake up your taste buds. Serve over brown rice cooked in chicken broth and butter that is reminiscent of risotto. I have made the rice with water and bouillon instead of broth, with very little change in the flavor or texture. Like so many dishes, this one is better the next day. I adapted this recipe from the chipotle shrimp recipe on this site.
