2 cups reduced sodium chicken broth
2 cups milk

Combine the chicken broth and milk in a saucepan, and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Gradually stir in the grits. Cover the pan and simmer over low heat for about 5 minutes, until the grits are thickened and tender.
Remove the grits from the heat, and stir in the blue cheese, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine, and serve hot.

Description: 
Grits are a staple on the Southern table for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and can be served sweet or savory. Adding blue cheese turns this ordinary side dish into something really special. If you love blue cheese or grits half as much as I do, you'll love this recipe! Please follow the liquid and cooking time indicated on your package, using half chicken stock, half milk proportionally as your liquid. Quick, Instant and Regular grits can all be used by adjusting the cooking time.
