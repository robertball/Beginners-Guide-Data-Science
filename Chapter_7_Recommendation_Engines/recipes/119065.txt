Description: 
'My husband raved about this sweet bean dish after tasting it at a party, so I knew I had to get the recipe,' recalls Jan Biehl, Leesburg, Indiana. 'It's perfect for get-togethers because you can mix it up a day early and toss it in the slow cooker a few hours before your guests arrive.'
