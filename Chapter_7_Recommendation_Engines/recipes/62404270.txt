Ingredients:
1/2 cup semi-sweet chocoate chips
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon light corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Melt the ingredients together over low heat or in the microwave, stirring often. Add extra corn syrup if needed to make a smooth shiny glaze. Dip doughnuts into glaze, removing excess with a spatula; stir glase often while using, to prevent it from stiffing up. Top with the decorations of your choice, coconut ,nuts immediately after glazing, as the glaze hardens quickly. Allow glaze to set before serving...or not :)
