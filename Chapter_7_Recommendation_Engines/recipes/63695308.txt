Ingredients:
12 oz. pasta
2 ripe avocados, pitted and scooped
1 lemon, juiced
2 cloves garlic
1/4 cup olive oil
1 handful fresh basil
1/4 tsp. kosher salt
Freshly grated Parmesan

Directions:
Set a medium-sized pot of salted water to boil. Add pasta, reduce heat slightly and cook until al dente, 8-10 minutes.
In a food processor, combine avocado flesh, lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, basil and salt. Blend until smooth and creamy. Set aside in a large bowl.
Transfer cooked pasta to the bowl. Toss with avocado mixture and freshly grated parmesan. Serve with additional grated parmesan, if desired.
Enjoy!
Please note: This dish must be served same day, same minute itâ€™s made. It cannot be left out, refrigerated, or frozen without turning brown from the avocado.
