Ingredients:
1 pound boneless pork loin chops, about 1-inch thick, trimmed
Dressing*:
1/4 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
15 sprigs flat-leaf parsley
3 sprigs fresh oregano, leaves
1/2 chipotle pepper (from a can of chipotles in adobo sauce)
Salt and pepper
Salad:
6 ounces spring mix greens
1 1/2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
6 ounces soft cheese, like queso fresco, goat or fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/2-inch dice
Oil spray

Directions:
In a food processor, combine olive oil, vinegar, parsley, oregano leaves, and chipotle and puree. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.
Preheat a broiler and arrange a rack 6 inches from the heat. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and spray with cooking oil.
Place pork on the baking sheet and sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. Broil until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Remove pork from broiler and let rest 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine greens, cherry tomatoes, cheese, and chimichurri dressing to taste. Arrange salad on plates or a platter.
Cut chops into 1/4-inch slices. Arrange on top of salad, drizzle with additional dressing, and serve.
