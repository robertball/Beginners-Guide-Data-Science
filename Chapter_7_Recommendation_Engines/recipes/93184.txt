Ingredients:
5 slices bacon, crisply cooked and crumbled
2 ounces Asiago cheese, finely shredded
8 pitted medium-sized ripe olives, chopped
1/4 cup sour cream
1/4 cup ranch dressing
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Stir together bacon, cheese and olives. In another bowl, stir together sour cream, dressing and salt. Spoon into small serving bowl. Refrigerate until serving time.
Unroll dough and separate into 8 triangles; press out slightly. Cut each triangle in half lengthwise from tip end to short side to make 16 triangles. Spread thin layer of tomato paste on each triangle. Spoon 1 1/2 teaspoons olive mixture on short side of each triangle; spread slightly.  Roll up, starting at short side of triangle and rolling to opposite point. Place, point side down, on ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake 13 to 18 minutes or until golden brown. Place bowl of sour cream mixture in center of serving plate. Arrange warm crescent bites around bowl.
