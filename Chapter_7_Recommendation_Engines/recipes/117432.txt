Ingredients:
3 pounds whole chicken wings
2 cups ketchup
1/2 cup honey
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon paprika
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

Directions:
Cut chicken wings into three sections; discard wing tips.  Place wings in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until juices run clear.
In a bowl, combine the remaining ingredients.  Pour 1/2 cup into a 3-qt. slow cooker.  Drain chicken wings; add to slow cooker.  Drizzle with remaining sauce.  Cover and cook on low for 1 hour, basting occasionally.

Description: 
'I got this spicy recipe from a friend but altered the ingredient amounts to adjust the hotness of the sauce,' recalls Jean Ann Herritt of Canton, Ohio.  'Make sure everyone has extra napkins...these wings are messy to eat but oh, so good!'
