Ingredients:
1 cup All-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole-wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup mashed banana (about 2 medium)
1 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
1) Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Whick together the flours and baking soda in a small bowl and set aside (I usually just use a large measuring cup and measure and mix the dry ingredients in there). Using an electric mixer, blend the margarine and sugar in a bowl on medium speed until fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla and mix on low until combined. Stir in mashed bananas. Add the flour mixture and mix until just combined. Stir in oats, chocolate chips and walnuts.
2) Drop cookies by teaspoon onto baking sheets leaving about 2 inches of space. Bake until golden and set, about 10-12 minutes. Let cool for a couple minutes before removing from sheets to wire racks to cool.
