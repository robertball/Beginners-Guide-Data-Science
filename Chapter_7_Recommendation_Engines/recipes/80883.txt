Ingredients:
3 pounds pork spareribs
1 cup applesauce
1 cup pure maple syrup
6 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Place ribs in a large pot with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.
In a bowl, mix the applesauce, syrup, lemon juice, ketchup, paprika, cinnamon, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
Place ribs in the prepared baking dish, and brush with 1/2 the sauce. Bake uncovered, basting frequently with remaining sauce, for 1 1/2 hours, until done.
