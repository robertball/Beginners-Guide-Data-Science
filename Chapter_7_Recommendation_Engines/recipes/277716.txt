Ingredients:
4 cups cubed white sandwich bread
1/4 cup raisins
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg, or to taste
2 tablespoons melted butter
2 cups half-and-half
1 cup white sugar
4 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 9-inch square baking dish.
Spread half of the bread in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with raisins, cinnamon, nutmeg, and remaining bread. Sprinkle with more cinnamon and nutmeg and drizzle with melted butter.
Combine half-and-half, sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl until well mixed and pour over bread. Press down on the bread with a fork to make sure it is saturated with the custard.
Place the baking dish in a large pan of boiling water and bake in the preheated oven until the center is set, about 1 hour.
