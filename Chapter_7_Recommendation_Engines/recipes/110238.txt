Ingredients:
3 tablespoons canola oil, divided
1 clove garlic, minced
2 onions, chopped
2 1/2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons pepper
2 tablespoons caraway seed
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
7 cups beef broth
2 bay leaves
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon nutmeg
3 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
3 large carrots, peeled and chopped
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Stir in garlic and onion, and cook until softened and translucent; remove from pan. Pour 2 tablespoons canola oil into Dutch oven. While this heats, mix the beef with salt and pepper. Sear the beef in batches until browned all over, about 5 minutes.
Stir in caraway seeds and flour, cook until flour is incorporated and the caraway seed is fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in beef broth; add bay leaves, sugar, nutmeg, and onion mixture. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the meat is tender, about 2 hours.
Stir in the potatoes and carrots; continue cooking until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Stir together the cornstarch and water; stir into the stew along with the parsley. Simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is a traditional German Stew served for Halloween. Its hearty flavors go perfect with the chilly nights of the harvest festival. Serve the stew in bowls with a quartered beet egg on top. Beet eggs are hard-cooked eggs prepared in a vinegar and beet juice mixture to add a sweet flavor and purple color to the eggs.
