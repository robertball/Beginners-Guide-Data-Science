1 T. butter
1/3 c. smoked ham, finely diced

For Crust:
In a mixing bowl, combine flour, salt and sugar.  Cut butter into cubes.  Sprinkle over surface of dry ingredients.  Using a fork or pastry cutter, cut butter into dry ingredients until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.
Beat egg and yolk together and stir into flour mixture.  Shape into two round disks and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Crumble dough over the bottom of two 9-inch tart pans or one 9x13 inch baking pan.  Using fingers and hands, press dough over the bottoms and sides of each pan to shape shells.  Bake in a 350* oven until barely brown.
For Filling:
Saute onion in butter until translucent  Divide ham, bacon and onion into two equal portions and sprinkle over the bottom of each tart shell.  Whisk together cream and beaten eggs.  Add salt, pepper, nutmeg, basil and thyme and stir well.  Pour egg mixture over bacon mixture.  Sprinkle cream cheese cubes and grated cheeses over the top of each filled tart.  Sprinkle scallions over cheese, followed by sliced almonds.
Bake in a preheated 350* for 30-40 minutes. Let cool slightly, then cut and serve.  Serves 16
