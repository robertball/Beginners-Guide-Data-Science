Ingredients:
1 cup Butter Flavor CRISCO® All-Vegetable Shortening
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar
4 1/2 cups flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
Buttery Cream Frosting:
4 cups confectioners' sugar
1/3 cup Butter Flavor CRISCO® All-Vegetable Shortening
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
6 1/2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Cream the Butter Flavor CRISCO(R) and sugars together. Add milk. Beat in eggs one at a time; add vanilla. Combine flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt. Mix into creamed mixture until well blended. Chill for one hour.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F.
Roll out 1/3 of the dough at a time, to about 1/4-inch thickness on a floured surface. Cut out with cookie cutters. Place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheet. Sprinkle with colored sugars and decors or leave plain and frost when cooled.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 5-6 minutes, or until edges are slightly golden. Remove immediately to cooling rack.
Buttery Cream Frosting: In medium mixing bowl, combine confectioners' sugar, Butter Flavor CRISCO(R) and vanilla. Slowly blend in milk to desired consistency. Beat on high speed for 5 minutes, or until smooth and creamy.
