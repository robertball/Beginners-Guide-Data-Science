Ingredients:
32 oz. frozen corn
3 lb. yellow squash, trimmed and sliced thin
1/2 - 3/4 c. half and half
1/2 - 1 stick butter
2-3 T. sugar
salt & pepper
15-20 drops tabasco

Directions:
Prepare squash, slice, and place in a large (metal) pan or dutch oven. Add water to cover, boil gently until tender, about 15 min.
Meanwhile, melt 1/2 stick butter in a large nonstick skillet, add frozen corn, heat on low until thawed, then add the cream, sugar, salt & pepper, and simmer on low for 5-10 min.
Drain cooked squash and return to metal dutch oven. Using a hand mixer set on low, mix the squash (in the pan) until it begins to look like a puree, but small chunks are ok.
Add the corn mixture to the squash and stir thoroughly, add tabasco, then taste. At this point you may add additional butter, cream, a little more sugar, and more salt & pepper if desired. Simmer about 10 minutes.
Can be made ahead and reheated in oven or on stovetop.

Description: 
Delicious corn dish that looks like creamed corn, but tastes like something else, totally unique. Has a secret ingredient that creates a wonderful dish, which always gets rave reviews, and is a must on my holiday table. (For a fun surprise, keep the secret ingredient a secret, until guests begin to ask What's in the corn? Who made the corn? How did you make it? Can I have the recipe? No one ever guesses or suspects the secret :-)  Even confirmed 'squash-haters' love this dish - it's that good.
