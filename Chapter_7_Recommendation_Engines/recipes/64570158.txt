In a large bowl, mix ground turkey and turkey sausage together with the egg and chopped parsley and sauteed onion and garlic, until well blended.  use an icecream scoop to measure out your mixture and pat lightly into patties, being careful not to "pat" too much, or your patties will be dense and tough. Refrigerate til later use, or freeze in a single layer on a plastic wrap lined cookie sheet until frozen, then into a ziploc freezer bag for much later use. Pan fry or grill 4-5 mins. per side.  Internal temp should be 165 deg. enjoy with your favourite toppings!
