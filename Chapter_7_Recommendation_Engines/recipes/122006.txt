1 cup quick-cooking oats
1/2 teaspoon salt

COATING:
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup milk
2 cups flaked coconut, finely chopped

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter, sugar, water and vanilla. Combine flour, oats and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Shape a tablespoonful of dough around each cherry, forming a ball. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until bottoms are browned. Remove to wire racks to cool. Combine sugar and enough milk to achieve smooth dipping consistency. Dip cookies, then roll in coconut.
