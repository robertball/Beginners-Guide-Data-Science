Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cauliflower florets
3/4 cup shredded light mozzarella cheese
1 egg
2 teaspoons dried basil
2 teaspoons dried parsley
1 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds
garlic powder to taste
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 tomato, chopped

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower florets, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Allow to cool. Grate cauliflower and measure out 1 cup.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spray a circular or rectangular metal baking pan with cooking spray.
Combine grated cauliflower, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, and egg in a large bowl. Press mixture into the prepared baking pan evenly. Sprinkle with basil, parsley, oregano, fennel, and garlic powder.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove crust from the oven and sprinkle with bell pepper, onion, and tomato. Top with remaining 1/4 cup of mozzarella cheese.
Preheat the oven's broiler. Return cauliflower pizza to oven and broil until cheese has melted and crust is crispy, about 5 minutes.
