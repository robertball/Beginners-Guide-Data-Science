Ingredients:
2 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined with tails attached
1 cup beer
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 clove garlic, minced
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon hot sauce

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a large bowl. Stir well to coat the shrimp. Place in a large shallow dish and refrigerate. Let marinate for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
Heat oven broiler. Drain shrimp. Thread shrimp through neck and tail onto six 14-inch skewers so that shrimp will lie flat. Place skewers on a lightly greased rack of a broiler pan.
Broil 5 inches from heat for 3 minutes. Turn skewers and broil for an additional 1 to 2 minutes, or until shrimp turn pink. Serve warm with cold beer.

Description: 
This recipe combines some of my favorite ingredients; beer, hot sauce and shrimp. Cooking with beer is always cool. Just remember not to waste that 1/4 can of beer that is left over!
