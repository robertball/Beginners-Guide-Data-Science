Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 pound ground turkey
1 onion, chopped
4 celery ribs chopped
4 cups beef broth
2 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes with garlic and onion
2 (15 ounce) can dark red kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (8 ounce) can of tomato sauce
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoons chili powder
1 teaspoon paprika
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)
1 tablespoon sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat and stir in the ground turkey. Cook and stir until the turkey is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in the onion and celery; cook and stir until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes.
Add the beef broth, tomatoes, tomato sauce, kidney beans, garlic, chili powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Sprinkle each bowl with a teaspoon of Cheddar cheese, if desired.
