Alexander's Perfect French Crepes That's Even Better Than In France Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 Cup of flour
¾ Cup of milk
½ Cup of water
3 Tbs of butter, melted
extra melted butter for brushing the pan
pinch of salt for savory crêpes (optional)
For a sweet version (optional)
add 2 Tbs of sugar
1 Tsp of vanilla

Directions:
1. Melt the butter in the microwave and let it cool a little.
2. Then add all the ingredients (minus extra melted butter for the pan) to the blender and blend until smooth.
3. You can put the batter in the fridge for an hour to get more bubbles (this step is optional, or you can start making your crêpes immediately).
4. Place your pan over medium heat and brush with the extra melted butter.
5. Using a ladle pour one ladle of batter on the pan. Lift the pan and slowly swirl around until the crêpe batter covers the entire bottom of the pan.
6. Cook it for about 1 minute.
7. Using a spatula, flip it over and cook for another minute.
8. Remove your crêpe from the pan and repeat the process until you finish your batter.
Notes:
1.  A 10? pan is used in this recipe, however, use any pan you’ve got. You can adjust the amount of batter poured in after a couple of crêpes. Your first crêpe won’t look so great (similar to your first pancake) before they start to look beautiful!
