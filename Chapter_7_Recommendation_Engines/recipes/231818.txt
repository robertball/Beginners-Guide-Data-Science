Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
5 large turnips, cut into cubes
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 green onion, minced
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon parsley flakes
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in melted butter until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir turnips into the butter and garlic; cook and stir until just beginning to soften, 7 to 10 minutes. Add cream and Parmesan cheese to the turnip mixture; bring to a simmer and cook, stirring regularly, until the liquid thickens, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir green onion, oregano, parsley, salt, and black pepper into the turnip mixture; cook until the green onion slightly wilts, 1 to 2 minutes.

Description: 
What I love about this recipe is how affordable all the ingredients are and how easy it is to throw together. For a college student who doesn't like to eat out much, like me, those two things are definitely what I'm looking for. Enjoy! If you're looking for a way to add more vegetables, throw in some diced carrots and chopped celery; add when you toss the turnips in.
