Ingredients:
½ cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1  egg
¼ cup butter
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 cup chicken broth
½  lemon

Directions:
Whisk flour, garlic powder, and paprika together in a bowl. Beat egg in a separate bowl. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat.
Dip chicken in egg until coated. Dredge chicken through flour mixture until evenly coated, shaking off excess.
Fry chicken in the melted butter until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add chicken broth to skillet, cover, and cook until chicken is not longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. Squeeze lemon over chicken.
