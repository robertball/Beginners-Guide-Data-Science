Ingredients:
2 pounds finely ground pork fat
2 pounds finely ground pork
2 onions, finely chopped
4 cups water
1 teaspoon ground cloves
3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Stir the pork fat, ground pork, onions, water, cloves, and nutmeg together in a large pot. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the pork is tender, at least 1 1/2 hours. Use a potato masher to mash the pork mixture every 15 minutes as it cooks.
The longer you simmer the gorton, the better the flavor will be. Add water as needed to keep the mixture from boiling dry. When you're ready to stop cooking, let the liquid reduce as much as possible without letting it burn. Refrigerate the gorton overnight. Remove and discard the fat layer, or stir it into the meat for a creamier spread.

Description: 
French-Canadian pork spread for toast and crackers....This was my memere's recipe and so far I have never had any better.  Very simple to make :) I guess from what I read, Croton and Gorton are almost the same, Gorton being the New Englander translation :) Enjoy
