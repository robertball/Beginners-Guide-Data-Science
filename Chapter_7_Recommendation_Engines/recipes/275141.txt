Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds pork rib tips
1 tablespoon seasoned salt, or to taste
3/4 cup barbecue sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Remove silver skin from underside of rib tips, if it is there. Rub seasoned salt on both sides of the meat.
Line a baking pan with aluminum foil and place seasoned meat into the pan. Cover tightly with another piece of foil and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, up to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven, covered and undisturbed, for 2 1/2 hours.
Remove from the oven and increase oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Uncover and drain the pan, if necessary. Brush barbecue sauce over ribs. Return to the oven and bake for 15 minutes.
Turn ribs and brush with additional barbecue sauce; continue baking for another 15 minutes. Repeat this twice more, for a total of 1 hour baking time at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove from the oven and cut into desired serving size, about 1 1/2 to 2 inches.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Broil in the preheated oven to develop a bit of char, 2 to 3 minutes, watching carefully to make sure they do not burn. Remove from the oven and serve.

Description: 
Rib tips are the parts of the rib that are cut away to make St. Louis ribs. Some butchers call this the pork brisket. This cut has a lot of cartilage, but a low, slow cook softens the cartilage and makes it tasty. I like to cut them into small pieces. These meaty bits are a little easier to manage than ribs, and their meaty, chewy texture makes a great appetizer or a main dish. Serve with additional barbecue sauce, if desired.
