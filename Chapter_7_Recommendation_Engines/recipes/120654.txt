Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. In a small bowl, combine the egg, oil, orange juice and peel; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill greased muffin cups two-thirds full.
Combine topping ingredients; sprinkle heaping tablespoonfuls on each muffin. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.

Description: 
The topping on these muffins reminds me of a crumb cake. I like to bake a big batch and store some in the freezer to serve to guests.
