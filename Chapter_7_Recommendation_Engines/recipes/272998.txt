Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1 cup white sugar, or as needed
1 (17.3 ounce) package frozen puff pastry (such as Pepperidge FarmÂ®), thawed
1 tablespoon corn syrup, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Cut cream cheese into 1/4-inch thick slices; place cut side-down on a board and cut into logs.
Place 1 cup sugar into a small bowl; place cream cheese logs into sugar and roll to coat. Set aside.
Cut each puff pastry sheet evenly into 3 to 4 squares, no bigger than 5 to 6 inches each. Place 1 square in front of you with 1 corner pointing down. Place 1 sugar-covered cheese log about 1/3 up from the bottom corner; proceed to fold pastry around it in the same manner as an egg roll, with the bottom corner over cheese, side corners towards the center, then roll from bottom, up. Brush some water in the last corner to seal roll.
Place quesito on the prepared pan, seam-side down. Repeat with all squares, making sure there is at least 1-inch between them.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes. Brush tops with corn syrup.

Description: 
These exquisite pastries are a guilty pleasure in Puerto Rico, where bakeries boast about having 'the best'. The only hard part of these quesitos would be preparing the French puff pastry, but if you get it frozen then it is a very simple process.
