8 eggs, beaten
4 cups FF half and half

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a medium mixing bowl, combine eggs, milk, sugar (or Splenda Baking Blend), cinnamon, and vanilla. Beat until well mixed. Pour over bread, and lightly push down with your hands until bread is covered and soaking up the egg mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until the top springs back when lightly tapped.
