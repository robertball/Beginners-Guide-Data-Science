Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
2/3 cup white corn syrup
1/4 cup butter
1 cup peanut butter
20 cups popped popcorn

Directions:
Combine brown sugar, corn syrup, and butter in a large saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until mixture comes to a rolling boil. Remove saucepan from heat; stir in peanut butter until mixture is smooth.
Place popcorn in a large bowl. Pour peanut butter mixture over popcorn; toss until evenly coated. Form into about 16 balls using buttered hands. Arrange balls on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet; allow to dry and set, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
My mom made these every Halloween when I was a kid and you could still give this out as a treat. It still is a treat as a moist and chewy fall snack. You can make into balls or leave loose and serve like carmel corn if you prefer.
