Ingredients:
3 Eggs, separated
1 large Kale leaf, rib removed
3/4 and 1/3 cups Sugar
Salt
pinch Cream of Tartar
1 large Lemon, zest and juice
Sprinkles
5 Tbsp Butter, cut into tabs

Directions:
Clean your kitchen. Or at least some area for a workspace.
Tend hearth to maintain 200 degrees F.
Heat a pot with a few inches of water for a double boiler, its ready when there are lots of little bubbles (adjust heat to maintain little bubbles, no bubbles is bad, big bubbles really bad).
Blitz your Kale and 3/4c sugar in a blender, food processor, or other whirly-choppy device.
In 'fire-ok' bowl that fits on top of the aforementioned pot, heat the egg whites and kale-sugar for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Remove from heat and add a soupcon of salt and pinch of cream of tartar.
Using a hand mixer, or Jared Padalecki, whisk vigorously for 10 minutes until stiff peaks form.
Gently fold in lemon zest and scoop into pastry bag.
Dot onto baking sheet and add sprinkles.
Bake 65-75 minutes.
Meanwhile... those egg yolks and lemon insides can't go to waste.
You already composted your egg shells, yes?
Do it now.
Did you feed the rib of your kale to a bunny? Go do that as well.
In a clean 'fire-ok' bowl whisk egg yolks, 1/3 c sugar, 1/3 c lemon juice, and a pinch of salt over the double boiler.
Get Jared to whisk this for 7-10 minutes until it is thickened.
Remove from heat and whisk in butter one tab at a time.
Enjoy these with some kale-tea and kale-sandwiches at your next dinomitea party.
