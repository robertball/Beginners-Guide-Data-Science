Description: 
This is an Asian dish that I've had for a long time, and it can be either an appetizer or main dish when served with rice. It originally was supposed to deep fried in small foil packets, but I found that way too messy. Grilling it is oh so yummy! The longer it marinates, the better it is. Personally I prefer it to marinade for 2 days.
