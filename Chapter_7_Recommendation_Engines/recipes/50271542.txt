Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package linguine pasta
1/4 pound bacon
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
3 roma (plum) tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1 cup half-and-half cream
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 pound cooked shrimp

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic, basil, and oregano in oil for 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes and green onions, and saute for 3 minutes. Add bacon, half and half, Parmesan cheese, and Monterey Jack cheese. Cook until cheese is just melted. Stir in shrimp, and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes.
Serve sauce over pasta, and sprinkle with pine nuts.

Description: 
I created this dish after trying a similar dish (made with crab) at a restaurant.  It's wonderful! If you like, you can garnish with additional chopped tomato and chopped green onion. If you have the time, toasting the pine nuts will enhance the flavor.Modified from: Shrimp Linguine with Tomatoes
