Ingredients:
1 pineapple
1 750ml bottle of white or gold rum
1/4 teaspoon fresh-grated nutmeg
5 allspice berries
2 cinnamon sticks
2 cardamom pods, crushed slightly
1 vanilla bean, with seeds scraped
1/4 cup raisins
1 teaspoon vanilla
4” x 1” peel of orange, white pith removed
3 peppercorns
1 star anise pod

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F and cover baking sheet with parchment. Peel and slice 1 pineapple, and distribute fruit in an even layer on prepared baking sheet. Roast for 45 minutes, then cool.
Add cooled pineapple to a vessel, then top with rum. At this point you can stir, cover and move to a cool, dark shelf for infusing. Or feel free add any combination of the spices, fruits & vanilla.
If using vanilla bean, be sure to split bean and scrape out seeds, adding all to vessel. If using star anise, gently break up  with a mortar & pestle before adding to vessel. Squeeze cardamom pods to open slightly before adding.
Stir your personalized infusion, cover and remove to a dark space. Mix the rum and taste it every day, removing any ingredient that becomes too dominant for your taste (anise, for example). Steep for about 5 days, and up to two weeks. Once the flavor is right for you, strain through a fine-mesh sieve, then strain again through a coffee filter.
Cook’s note: Save the strained fruit to make cake, muffins or boozy jam.
