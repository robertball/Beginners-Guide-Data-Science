Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) loaf French bread, torn into bite-sized pieces
2 1/2 cups whole milk
2 cups pumpkin puree
2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon orange flavoring
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
2 cups chopped pecans
1 cup golden raisins
1 stick butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Put torn French bread into a bowl. Mix milk and pumpkin puree together in a separate bowl and pour over French bread. Let soak until moistened, about 5 minutes.
Mix sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, orange flavoring, and pumpkin pie spice together in a bowl. Pour into bread mixture and stir. Fold in pecans and raisins.
Place butter in a 9x13-inch baking pan and put into the preheated oven, about 5 minutes. Remove pan from oven when butter has melted and spoon in bread mixture.
Bake in the hot oven until pudding is firm in the middle and edges are brown and crisp, 35 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
This pumpkin bread pudding with pecans couldn't be much easier - using canned pumpkin speeds things up, but use fresh pumpkin puree if you have it. Top with caramel sauce and ice cream!
