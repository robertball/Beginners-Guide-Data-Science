Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/2 pound ground beef
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (10 ounce) can enchilada sauce, divided
1 (8 ounce) jar salsa
1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend, divided
4 flour tortillas

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8-inch, 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
Mix cooked beef, black beans, 1/4 cup enchilada sauce, salsa, and 1/2 cup Mexican cheese together in a medium-sized bowl.
Divide beef mixture evenly among tortillas. Wrap tortillas around filling; place seam-side down into the prepared baking dish. Pour remaining enchilada sauce over tortillas and top with remaining Mexican cheese. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and thoroughly heated, 35 to 40 minutes.
