I invented this recipe while camping,so an open fire with a grill,barbecue,stove top,oven,just about anything will work.It was originally used with 20 little brook truot 6-12 inches but i found it works very well with larger fish too.It is a sweet,almond flavor and is incredible tasting skin and all!!.
