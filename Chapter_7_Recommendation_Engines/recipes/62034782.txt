Ingredients:
Fresh ham
broth
garlic powder
onion powder
pepper
rosemary
fresh garlic
boullion cubes

Directions:
This is very easy because the roast almost takes care of itself. I like to put pieces of fresh garlic in the roast. Using a knife make small slits and insert garlic.  Season meat with above ingredients and place in roasting pan. Oven should be about 325 to 350.  Cook approx. 25 to 35 mins. per pound. Internal temp should reach l70 degrees for a loin and l85 for a shoulder cut when done.  Halfway through cooking I like to baste with either a chicken, beef or vegie broth. Doesn't really matter which. If canned, use a low salt version. Once done, remove roast and let rest about 20 mins. In the meantime make your gravy. I use a gravy separater. If you don't have one, they're inexpensive and so worth it.  Pour pan juices into separater. The grease will rise to the top and you can pour out the juices into a bowl.  Use about 2Tbl. of the fat to make a flour roux in a sauce pan. Scrape up any bits from your roasting pan and add to roux.  Slowly add your pan juices and whisk. Continue to add broth or water.  Season with a little gravy master, garlic powder, onion powder,pepper and a couple of boullion cubes. Bring to a boil and let simmer. If you don't feel that your gravy is thick enough at this point you could
add a little cornstarch/water mixture.
You can't go wrong and it's absolutely delicious!
