Ingredients:
3 cups quick cooking oats
1 cup flaked coconut
1 cup roasted peanuts, chopped
1 cup raisins (optional)
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Mix the oats, coconut, peanuts, and raisins together in a large bowl.
Stir the sugar, milk, butter, and cocoa powder together in a saucepan and bring to a boil; boil for 1 minute and immediately remove from heat. Stir the vanilla into the cocoa mixture; pour over the oat mixture and stir to coat. Scoop heaping tablespoonfuls of the mixture and drop into haystack-like piles onto waxed paper; allow to cool completely before serving.

Description: 
My grandpa made these himself quite often, especially at Christmas time. Quick, easy, and no baking required! Also, try walnuts in place of the peanuts for a different version.
