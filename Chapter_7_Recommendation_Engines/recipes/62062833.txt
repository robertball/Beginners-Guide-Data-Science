Ingredients:
1 lb. strawberries, washed, stemmed and quartered
2 Tbsp. sugar
Juice of 1 orange
Pistachio crème:
2 oz. pistachios, shelled
1/3 c. milk (whole)
3 Tbsp. sugar
1 c. heavy cream
Mint sprigs

Directions:
Combine strawberries with orange juice and sugar; mix and coat well, place in refrigerator to chill.
Chop one quarter of the pistachios and set aside.
Finely grind remaining pistachios in food processor. Add ground pistachios to milk and sugar in saucepan and bring just to a boil while stirring constantly. Allow to cool while whipping heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Fold 2/3 of the whipped cream into pistachio-milk mixture, reserve remainder cold for garnish.
Spoon strawberries into serving dishes and top with pistachio-crème. Garnish each with pinches of chopped pistachios, piped whipped cream and mint sprig; serve at once.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite German recipes. People are amazed that something so light, contrasting and wonderful can come from a country which we here know only for leaden food - just goes to show you that not everything is always as it seems! A creative variation on this recipe which was extremely popular during the nouvelle cuisine days of the not too distant past was to omit the actual pistachio cream and instead serve the strawberries with cream whipped with white pepper... not my cup of tea, but the taste contrast was supposedly quite startling and pleasing to some.
