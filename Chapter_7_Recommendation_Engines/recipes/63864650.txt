2 cups milk warmed
2/3 cup of sugar
1/4 cup of melted butter
1 1/2 tablespoons of  instant yeast
1 1/4 teaspoons of salt
6 cups of flower

Directions:
Mix warm milk, sugar, yeast and melted butter in larg bowl.  Let sit for 5-10 min. Next begin mixing in flower and add salt kneed for about 5 min I used a kitchen aid so it may take longer if you kneed by hand. Place in bowl and cover with towel until doubled in size.
Pre Heat oven to 350
Kneed dough by hand for about 3-5 min. Pull off handfuls of dough and roll between hands. Just like you do with play dough. I roll mine out into 6" sections. Place on baking pan and let rise about 10 min.
Brush tops with a egg wash if u desire and cook for 15-20 min
