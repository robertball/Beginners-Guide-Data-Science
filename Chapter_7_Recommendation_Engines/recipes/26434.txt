Description: 
As a busy college student, I don't have much time to eat, let alone cook.  I've been making this soup for myself my whole college career, since it's a soup my mom made when I was growing up.  This soup is illegally easy and incredibly good for you.  Eat it up!  You can add sliced, shredded, or diced cooked chicken to the soup when it is almost ready.  This soup is delicious, but it can be a surprisingly dull color.  You can make it more attractive by serving it with a thin slice of lemon on top and a sprinkle of chopped parsley or chives.
