Ingredients:
2/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup milk
1 good sized apple, pippin or granny smith, peeled and chopped.
1/3 cup of brown sugar not packed
1   teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan.
In small bowl combine brown sugar and cinnamon, set aside.
In a medium bowl, cream together the sugar and butter. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then add the vanilla. Combine flour and baking powder, add to the creamed mixture and beat well. Finally add in the milk until batter is smooth. Pour or spoon half of the batter into the prepared pan.  Add half of the apples and half of the brown sugar with cinnamon mixture. Slightly pat them into the the batter. Add the remaining batter and top with the rest of the apples, patting them into the batter, then the cinnamon and brown sugar mixture. Run your finger through the top to slightly mix the brown sugar and cinnamon into the batter but not all the way.
Bake for 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven.  Cake is done when inserted wooden pick comes out clean.
