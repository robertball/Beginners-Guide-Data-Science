Ingredients:
2 large cloves garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt
1 teaspoon dried sage
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 trimmed pork tenderloins (about 1 pound each), at room temperature
directions

Directions:
Position a rack near the bottom of the oven and preheat to 500 degrees . Mince together the garlic, salt, sage and pepper. In a small bowl, combine with the oil. Rub all over the meat and place the tenderloins side by side but not touching in the smallest roasting pan that will hold them. Roast for 10 minutes, flip over and roast again until the internal temperature registers 155 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, about 8 minutes more. Let rest for about 10 minutes (the internal temperature should reach 160 degrees ). Slice into 1/2-inch-thick slices.
