Ingredients:
1 pound chuck steak, sliced 1" thick
1 teaspoon meat tenderizer
1/8 teaspoon creole or cajun seasoning seasoning
1/4 teaspoon salt
fresh ground pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Place flat iron skillet in an oven preheated to 450 degrees.  I use my all-clad stainless pan, but an iron skillet would also work. It needs to be VERY hot to create a sizzle when the steak is placed in the pan.
Remove steak from packaging, and rinse with cold water. sprinke with meat tenderizer, and stab with a fork repeatedly 20-30 times on both sides.  Let sit until steak becomes room temperature, usually about 30 minutes.
Rinse steak under warm water to remove tenderizer (if you don't, it'll be too salty).
coat evenly on both sides with olive oil, cajun seasioning, salt and pepper to taste.
Remove skillet from hot oven and place on the stovetop on high heat.  Immediately place steak in pan and press with flat iron.  Cook and let sizzle for 1 minute on each side.
Place pan with steak back into oven and let cook for 2 minutes for rare, 3 minutes for medium, 4 minutes for well done.
Take pan out of the oven and immediately cover over with foil.  Let sit for 2-3 minutes or until desired doneness.
