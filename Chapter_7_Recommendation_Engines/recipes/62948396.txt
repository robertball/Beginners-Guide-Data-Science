Ingredients:
For pastry:
2 cups all purpose flour
2 sticks unsalted butter, shilled and cubed
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
4 tablespoon cold water
Cinnamon sugar filling:
1/2 cube soft butter, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 Tablespoons cinnamon mixed together.

Directions:
Sift together flour, salt, and sugar. Gradually cut in butter until mixture resembles small peas. Add in vanilla and cold water one tablespoon at a time until mixture comes together and forms a ball. Split into equal pieces and chill at least one hour.
Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 1/2" thickness. Using a knife carefully cut the dough into rectangles. Drop one tablespoon of filling into one half of the rectangles. Top with remaining rectangles. Seal sides with a fork and poke a few holes in the top of each pastry.
Transfer to parchment paper lined sheet pan.
Bake at 375 degrees 25-30 min.
Top with powdered sugar.

Description: 
These home made Pop Tarts include all the flavor or the original, but don't contain any of the stuff you can't pronounce on the back of the box! They freeze well and can be filled with anything. Try pumpkin butter, cinnamon sugar, nutella, or peanut butter and jelly! Home made fruit preserves are delicious as well!
