Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix, (3 eggs, water and oil per box)
1 (16 ounce) package chocolate frosting
32 ounces chocolate sandwich cookies with creme filling
24 gummy worms or other gummy bugs

Directions:
Make cupcakes per directions on cake mix box.   Line muffin tins with 24 cupcake papers.
Chop cookies very fine in food processor. The white cream will disappear.
