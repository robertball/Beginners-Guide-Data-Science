Ingredients:
3 sweet potatoes
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon hot chili powder
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch salt
1 link spicy chorizo, casings removed and discarded
2 cups grated Chihuahua cheese
1/4 cup finely chopped green onions
1/4 cup green salsa, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Prick sweet potatoes several times with a fork and place onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from oven, leaving oven on. Let potatoes cool 10 minutes.
Cut cooled sweet potatoes lengthwise and scoop out the middle until 1/4-inch of potato skin is left.
Mix olive oil, hot chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, pepper, and salt together in a small bowl. Brush all sides of sweet potatoes with oil mixture.
Bake in the hot oven until crisp, about 15 minutes, turning as necessary.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer chorizo to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
Mix cheese and green onions together in a small bowl and place mixture into the wells of the sweet potato skins. Sprinkle chorizo bits over tops.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Serve warm with green salsa for dipping.

Description: 
This is a slight variation on the classic game day loaded sweet potato skins. This is one of my original recipes, and a favorite for big games in the fall and winter.
