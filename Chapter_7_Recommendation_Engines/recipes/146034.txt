Ingredients:
4 hot dogs
4 cream-filled sponge snack cakes (such as Twinkies™)
4 (4 inch) squirts of pressurized canned cheese (such as Easy Cheese™), or to taste

Directions:
Bring a saucepan of water to a boil over high heat. Add hot dogs, and boil until thoroughly hot, about 5 minutes; drain and keep warm.
Meanwhile, unwrap the snack cakes, and place onto a cutting board, upside-down. Cut halfway through the bottoms of the snack cakes with a small, serrated knife to create "buns" for the hot dogs.
Blot the hot dogs with a paper towel to remove excess water and place a hot dog inside each "bun". Remove the protective top from the can of cheese, and hold the nozzle close to, but not touching, the exposed side of the hot dog. Dispense cheese by decisively pressing the nozzle towards the hot dog and slowly drawing the tip along the hot dog in a straight line, or decorative pattern of your choice.

Description: 
Probably one of the most infamous - or obscure - snacks in the world!  Originally created by 'George Newman' ('Weird Al' Yankovic) in the movie 'UHF' - it has gained an almost cult-like following (as has the movie itself)!
