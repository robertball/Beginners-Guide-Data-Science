Ingredients:
1 side fresh salmon, boned but skin on (about 3 pounds)2 tablespoons Dijon mustard3 tablespoons good soy sauce6 tablespoons good olive oil1/2 teaspoon minced garlic

Directions:
Lay the salmon skin side down on a cutting board and cut it crosswise into 4 equal pieces. Whisk together the mustard, soy sauce, olive oil, and garlic in a small bowl. Drizzle half of the marinade onto the salmon and allow it to sit for 10 minutes.Place the salmon skin side down on foil lined tray; discard the marinade the fish was sitting in. Bake at 450 for about 15-20 min., depending on the thickness of the fish.  Transfer the fish to a flat plate, skin side down, and spoon the reserved marinade on top. Allow the fish to rest for 10 minutes. Remove the skin and serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled.
