Ingredients:
20 frozen wings, thawed and dried on paper towels
1/4 c. olive oil or canola oil
1/2 tsp. garlic salt
3/4 c. Heinz catsup
1/2 c. packed, light brown sugar
2 T. liquid smoke
3/4 tsp. celery seed
2 T. horseradish
1 T. Worcestershire

Directions:
Drop wings in sealable freezer bag along with the oil and garlic salt.  Shake well.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Arrange wings on a foil lined cookie sheet, place on middle rack of oven and bake for 70 minutes or until browned and crispy.  While they are cooking, mix the rest of the ingredients for the sauce, or make it days in advance.  When wings are done, transfer on to paper towels to absorb some oil then toss them in a crock pot.  Cook on low for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.  Don't overcook, they will fall apart.  Sauce is great on ribs, chicken, burgers, pulled pork or beef. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.
