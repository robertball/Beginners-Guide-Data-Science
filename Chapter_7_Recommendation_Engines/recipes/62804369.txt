Ingredients:
Batter:
4 cups Bisquick, Jiffy, or other pancake mix
1 TBS flour
2/3 cup sugar
2 eggs
¼ cup melted butter
1 cup milk
½ cup sour cream
¼ tsp cinnamon
Topping:
1 stick butter (1/2 cup)
1 cup cinnamon-sugar (1 cup sugar + 2 TBS ground cinnamon.  I double it and keep half in a container ready-made to sprinkle on cinnamon toast, scones, etc.)
1 TBS brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.  Grease a 9x13 pan.
Using an electric mixer, blend all the batter ingredients together.   It may be slightly lumpy.  Spoon into the cake pan and spread to make it relatively flat.
In a small saucepan over med-high heat, melt the butter, cinnamon-sugar, and brown sugar together.  When the butter is all melted and the mixture is bubbly, remove from heat.   Drop large spoonfuls onto the cake.   Using a butter knife, marble the cake in both directions (pull the knife through the batter in both directions, then turn 90 degrees and repeat).
Bake 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the white part of the cake comes out clean.  Allow to cool and set for 5-10 minutes before serving.  This cake is best served warm with a big glass of milk!

Description: 
My mom used to make this easy, Bisquick-based coffee cake and we loved the way the melted cinnamon topping would seep down into the cake, creating pockets of warm, gooey cinnamon deliciousness, much like a the warm center of a cinnamon roll.  As an adult, I’ve doctored her recipe to make it more rich and yummy.
