Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
2 teaspoons brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 tablespoon butter
1 Granny Smith apple, thinly sliced
2 teaspoons white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
cooking spray
1 (8 ounce) round Brie cheese, thinly sliced
1 (10 ounce) package flour tortillas

Directions:
Mix pumpkin puree, brown sugar, and pumpkin pie spice together in a bowl.
Melt butter in a pan over medium heat. Ad apple slices, sprinkle white sugar and cinnamon on top, and cook until soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
Place another skillet over medium heat and lightly grease with cooking spray. Place 1 tortilla in the skillet. Spread a generous amount of the pumpkin mixture over the tortilla. Place some brie on one side; cover brie with some cooked apples.
Fold tortilla in half when it turns golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Cook for 1 minute more, then remove from the skillet. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
