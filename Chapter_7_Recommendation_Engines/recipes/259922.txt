Ingredients:
4 eggs, separated
1 tablespoon white sugar, divided
1 (16 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips (such as Nestle® TOLL HOUSE® Semi-Sweet Chocolate Morsels)
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 tablespoon hot water
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 6 glass custard cups; place cups on a baking sheet.
Beat egg whites and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until stiff peaks form, 4 to 5 minutes.
Heat chocolate chips and butter in a pot over low heat, stirring frequently, until melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add in 1 egg yolk at time, stirring continuously. Add water and flour, stirring continuously. Fold in the beaten egg whites until just combined. Fill each custard cup about 2/3 full with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until cakes rise slightly over the top of the cups and cracks form on their surface, 15 to 18 minutes.
