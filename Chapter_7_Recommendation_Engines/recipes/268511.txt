Ingredients:
3/4 cup brine from a can of olives
1/2 cup buttermilk
3 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless turkey breast
1 sprig fresh rosemary
2 sprigs fresh thyme

Directions:
Whisk together olive brine and buttermilk. Put the turkey breast into a resealable plastic bag and pour brine-buttermilk mixture into the bag. Add rosemary and thyme sprigs. Seal bag and refrigerate for 8 hours.
Take the bag out of the fridge and allow to rest until the breast reaches room temperature.
Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook the breast in the air fryer for 15 minutes. Flip over the breast and cook for 5 minutes until turkey breast is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). If internal temperature is lower, keep cooking at 5 minute intervals until the correct temperature is reached.

Description: 
An easy recipe for making a savory, juicy turkey breast in an air fryer. Using olive brine gives the breast flavor and also keeps it tender. I use spicy TabascoÂ® Olive brine for extra kick. Serve with cranberry sauce.
