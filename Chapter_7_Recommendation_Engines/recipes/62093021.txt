Ingredients:
1 Pound hamburger
1 Can Campbells Fiesta Nacho Cheese Soup
1 Can Original Rotell tomatoes
1 Package Taco Seasoning Mix
1 Package Tator Tots
2 Cups shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Brown hamburger and drain.
Add taco seasoning, Rotel tomatoes including the juice, mix well.
Spread this mixture into the casserole pan and spread the Fiesta soup over the top with a spoon.
Place the Tator Tots on top of the cheese, as many as you can fit. (I usually have my Tator Tots somewhat thawed out first to speed the cooking time.)
Bake in 350 degree oven until the potatoes are nice and hot, usually about 30 minutes.
When done cooking add the shredded cheddar cheese to the top of the Tator Tots, let sit a few minutes till cheese is melted and serve.
