Ingredients:
4 tablespoons honey
3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 cup fat-free plain yogurt
1 egg, beaten
1 lemon, juiced and zested
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 12 cup muffin pan.
In a small bowl, mix the honey, applesauce, yogurt, egg, lemon juice, and lemon zest.
In a medium bowl, mix the unbleached flour, whole wheat pastry flour, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg. Make a well in the center, and pour in the honey mixture. Stir until no large lumps remain. Pour into the prepared muffin pan, filling each cup about 2/3 full.
Bake 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.

Description: 
These muffins aren't too sweet, but are quite lemony. I like nutmeg, and tend to put a lot more than a dash in the mix.
