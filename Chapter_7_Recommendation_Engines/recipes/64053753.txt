My Green Protein Smoothie Recipe

Ingredients:
1 banana, cut into chunks
1.5 cups sliced, frozen strawberries
2 cups kale, curly or black, leaves roughly chopped or torn
2 cups baby spinach, stems included
10 oz plain yogurt (I use skim Greek yogurt)
1/2 apple with peel, cored and seeded, chopped into small pieces
1 scoop vanilla whey protein
If you like your smoothies sweeter, add 1/2 tsp Splenda or sugar, or 1 pump Da Vinci sugar-free syrup in strawberry, banana, or raspberry.

Directions:
Toss all ingredients into a blender except the sweetener and liquid syrup (if using), and pulse on a low setting first to get the ingredients broken up and gently mixed without overheating your blender. Then increase to 'puree' function on the blender for 30-60 seconds, checking once and scraping along the sides and bottom of blender. You want to blend until the fiber of the leafy greens is broken down properly.
Taste, and add the sweetener/syrup if you like.

Description: 
You can tweak this to taste, but it's a terrific green smoothie as is, and a very healthy recipe. It gives me energy without the jitters, and it tastes great while packed with health benefits.
