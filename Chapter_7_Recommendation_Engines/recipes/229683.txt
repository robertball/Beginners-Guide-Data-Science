Description: 
A cheese sauce that goes well with Peruvian/Latin American foods. I learned the recipe from an elderly Peruvian woman! Especially good with Peruvian 'Lomos Saltado,' or as a topping for baked potatoes and hard-boiled eggs. If you want it spicier, leave a few of the seeds with the peppers.
