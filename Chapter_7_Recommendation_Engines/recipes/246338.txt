Ingredients:
1/4 cup canola oil
1 yellow onion, diced
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided, or as needed
1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger (optional)
2 large beets, diced
1 cup water, or more as needed
4 large potatoes, diced

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat; add onion and a pinch of salt. Cook and stir onion until softened and translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add beets and stir to combine. Pour water over beet mixture and sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon salt; bring to a boil.
Cover pot and reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, stirring occasionally, until beets are easily pierced with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes. Add potatoes and cook until potatoes are soft but not falling apart, about 15 minutes.
