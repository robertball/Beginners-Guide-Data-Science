Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup rice vinegar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
12 ounces radishes, sliced thinly

Directions:
Mix water, rice vinegar, sugar, and salt together in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave for 1 minute and 30 seconds, stopping to stir every 30 seconds, or until sugar has completely dissolved. Continue warming and stirring for 30 seconds at a time, if necessary.
Place radish rounds into a canning jar. Pour vinegar mixture into the jar and top with a lid. Let pickle for at least 2 hours to develop the flavor.
