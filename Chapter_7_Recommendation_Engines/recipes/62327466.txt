Title:
Aubergines (Egg Plants) a la Dawlish Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
- 1 large Aubergine, sliced lengthwise into around 6 slices, each 5mm (1/4 inch) thick
- 60 ml (1/4 Cup) EVOO, for brushing generously onto the Aubergine slices, which will absorb it like a sponge!
- 1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds, lightly crushed to release the wonderfully subtle orangey scent
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 1 Tablespoon shredded fresh basil leaves
- a little salt

Directions:
Pre-heat the broiler to high.
In a broiler pan, place the Aubergine slices, well "painted" with the EVOO on both sides. Scatter over them, half the cracked coriander seeds.
At a distance of 4" to 6", cook for around 6 minutes, until a nice colour is obtained.
Remove the tray, turn over the slices and scatter the rest of the coriander, before returning the tray to the broiler. This side will be done quicker, say around 4 minutes.
While the second side is doing, in a small bowl, mix the basil leaves, salt and lemon juice, and drizzle this over the Aubergines when they are done.
Eat when warm! I serve it as a side - usually to nicely done Lamb Filets.
