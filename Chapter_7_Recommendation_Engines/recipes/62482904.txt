Ingredients:
Apple Filling:
5 large Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoon lemon juice
Crumble:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup quick cooking oats
1 cup butter, softened
Caramel Sauce:
1 (14 ounce) package individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F (175 degree C).
In a medium size bowl, toss apples with sugar, flour, cinnamon, and lemon juice; spread evenly into a 9x13 inch pan. May need a bit of water.
In a heavy sauce pan over low heat, melt the caramels with the evaporated milk.  Heat , stirring frequently, until mixture has a smooth consistency. Drizzle the caramel sauce over the top of the apples.
In another bowl, mix together flour, brown sugar, oats, and butter; spoon mixture evenly over apples.
Bake in preheated oven for about 45 minutes (apple mixture will bubble and topping will be golden brown).  Broil for last 5 minutes to crisp up topping more.
