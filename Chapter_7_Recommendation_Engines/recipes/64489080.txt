Ingredients:
8 oz. (One Can) of Tomato Paste
32 oz. (One Box) of Chicken Broth or 32 oz. (One Box) of Vegetable Stock
Two Shallots
3 Tbsp Butter
One Cup of Chopped Green Beans
Two Small Tomatoes
1 Tbsp Olive Oil
¾ tsp Marjoram

Directions:
Melt the butter in a pot and once it is all melted, add tomato paste to it. Stir it around until it is well-blended.
Once it is blended, add either chicken broth or vegetable stock.
In the meantime, sauté chopped green beans in olive oil for ten minutes, add the shallots (finely chopped) during the last seven minutes, and then add the tomatoes (chopped into eighths) and marjoram during the last two minutes.
Once the sauté is done, pour it into the pot with the soup, and heat it thoroughly.
After about six minutes of heating, pour it into soup bowls and serve immediately!
