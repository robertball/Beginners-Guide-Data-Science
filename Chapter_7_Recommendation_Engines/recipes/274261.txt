Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
For the Filling:
1 cup pineapple preserves
1 cup chopped macadamia nuts
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 1/2 cups shredded coconut

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine flour, confectioners' sugar, and cornstarch in a large bowl. Mix well. Add butter and vanilla extract and stir until a soft dough forms. Shape into 36 balls. Place 1 ball in each of 36 ungreased mini muffins cups; press lightly into the bottom and up the sides to make a crust.
Spoon 1 teaspoon pineapple preserves into each crust. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon macadamia nuts over pineapple. Beat sugar and egg together in a small bowl to combine; mix in coconut until well blended. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the mixture over each macadamia layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust and coconut are golden brown, 23 to 33 minutes.
Cool in pans for 20 minutes. Hold each pan upside-down at an angle over a wire rack; tap bottoms of cups lightly with a butter knife to release tarts. Let cool completely.
