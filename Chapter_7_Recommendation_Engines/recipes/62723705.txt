Ingredients:
1/2 cup of quick oats
3/4 cup of milk
1/2 of a banana
1/4 cup of coconut milk
1/4 cup of shredded coconut
Sugar, to taste

Directions:
Put the oats and regular milk in a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave until the oatmeal starts to bulge at the top. For newer, powerful microwaves, that's usually a minute. For lower watt microwaves it can take up to 3 minutes.
While it is cooking, mash the banana with a fork.
Making sure it is the correct smooth, creamy consistency, remove from the microwave. If it is too watery, cook for a little longer. If it is overdone, you can always add extra milk.
Add the banana, coconut shreds, coconut milk, and as much sugar as desired. Mix it well and enjoy!
