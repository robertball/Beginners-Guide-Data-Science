Ingredients:
5 small potatoes, scrubbed and cubed with skin
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 cup cream

1 (14.5 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained and rinsed
1 pound turkey kielbasa sausage, sliced 3/4-inch thick
2 tablespoons butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place potatoes into a large saucepan. Add water to cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.
Once tender, drain potatoes, and mash with 2 tablespoons butter, cream, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Place the drained sauerkraut into a casserole dish and top with sliced kielbasa. Spread with mashed potatoes and dot with remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.
Bake in preheated oven until heated through, 20 to 30  minutes.
