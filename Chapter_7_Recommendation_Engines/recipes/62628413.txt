Add enough water to just cover the bottom of the skillet to create steam. Cover the pan, and reduce heat to low. Simmer/steam for 7 minutes. Sprinkle 1/2 to 1 tsp of shoyu on the kinpira, cover, and let cook for 4 minutes longer. The kinpira should be almost dry. remove from the heat, add the ginger juice and sesame oil and toss. Add sesame seeds and parsley, toss again, and serve.

Description: 
A traditional Japanese and macrobiotic dish that should be eaten a couple times a week.  Burdock strengthens & purifies the blood, while carrots are full of phytonutrients. Together they make a really strengthening dish that makes you feel grounded and energized - and it tastes really good. From The Kind Diet by Alicia Silverstone
