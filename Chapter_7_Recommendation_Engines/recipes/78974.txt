Ingredients:
5 pounds potatoes
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cup dill pickle relish
1/4 cup prepared yellow mustard, or to taste
12 hard-cooked eggs, peeled and chopped
2 cups chopped celery (optional)
2 teaspoons paprika
20 buttery round crackers

Directions:
Place the potatoes into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 20 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork. Drain, and set aside to cool.
In a large bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, relish, mustard, hard-cooked eggs and celery. Cut the potatoes into cubes, and add to the bowl. Mix gently until coated. Garnish with a sprinkling of paprika, and arrange crackers around the edge.
