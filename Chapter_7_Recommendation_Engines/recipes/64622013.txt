Ingredients:
4 eggs
2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons fresh orange zest
1 teaspoon five spice powder
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
Pinch of salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly oil and flour a loaf pan.
Beat eggs until lightened in color; add oil, sugar, orange zest, and five spice powder. Fold in flour, baking powder, and salt.
Pour batter into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove cake from the pan and let cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
With just a touch of sweetness, this olive oil cake has a hint of orange zest and five spice powder. If you don't eat it all the first day, cut it into cubes and layer with whipped cream and oranges, or toast and slather with honey.
