Ingredients:
3 ripe bananas, mashed
2/3 cup white sugar
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup frozen cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Mash bananas and sugar together in a bowl; add egg and vanilla extract and mix well. Stir whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into banana mixture just until batter is mixed. Stir oil into batter and fold in cranberries. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 22 to 26 minutes.

Description: 
Moist and easy. I like to wrap cooled muffins in plastic wrap and freeze to pop into lunch boxes. This can also be baked as a loaf.
