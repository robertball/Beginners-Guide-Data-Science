Ingredients:
2 cups and 2 tablespoons of milk
2 tablespoons of vinegar
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups old fashioned oats
3 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract
1/2 cup natural peanut butter
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat griddle to 350 degrees or medium heat.
In a measuring cup combine the milk and the vinegar.  Let it sit for about 5 minutes.
In a large bowl combine wheat flour, all-purpose flour, brown sugar, baking powder and salt.
In a small bowl whisk together oats, eggs, olive oil, vanilla, peanut butter, and curdled milk.
Whisk wet mixture into dry until smooth.  Fold in chocolate chips.
Pour batter, 1/4 cup at a time, onto griddle.  Flip when pancakes appear to dry out around the edges, about 2 minutes.  Continue cooking until lightly browned.

Description: 
All natural peanut butter, oats, and whole wheat flour come together to make the best pancake ever!  You would never know that this was good for you :)  If you use regular peanut butter, than I would reduce the sugar by 1 tablespoon.  Serve with banana slices.
