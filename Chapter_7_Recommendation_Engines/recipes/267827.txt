Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) package ziti pasta
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 medium red bell peppers, diced
1 tablespoon za'atar

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
Pour olive oil and lemon juice in a skillet over medium heat; stir until combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Add red bell peppers and za'atar. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.
Drain ziti and return to the pot. Pour pepper mixture over pasta. Mix until peppers are dispersed evenly throughout.

Description: 
I tried this pasta when I was in Israel--it's perfect for summer! It's really light but filling and super easy to make. If you really like or dislike lemon juice, you can edit the ratio of lemon juice to olive oil to suit your taste.
