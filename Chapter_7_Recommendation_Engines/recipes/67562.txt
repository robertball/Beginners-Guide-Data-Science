Ingredients:
For the meatballs:
1/2 pound lean ground beef
1/2 pound bulk Italian sausage
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 cup milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1 clove garlic, minced
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons minced onion
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
For the soup:
1 tablespoon butter
1 large carrot, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
3/4 cup chopped yellow onion
7 cups beef stock
2 tablespoons Italian-style tomato paste
1 (14.5 ounce) can chopped tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
6 ounces uncooked tri-color wagon wheel pasta

Directions:
Mix together in a bowl the ground beef, sausage, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, milk, egg, parsley, garlic, pepper, and onion. Roll into small meatballs, about 1 to 2 teaspoons each. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown meatballs in batches and drain on paper towels, wiping out pan between batches and adding more oil as needed.
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add carrots, celery, and onion and cook until slightly softened, about 8 minutes. Stir in the meatballs, stock, tomato paste, tomatoes, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer for 30 minutes. Skim fat from surface.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain. Cover and set aside.
