Description: 
These moist muffins may be small, but they're always a big hit on a brunch buffet, as a quick snack or as part of a bread basket assortment. The combination of poppy seeds and a hint of lemon makes them irresistible.                                         --Kathryn Anderson, Casper, Wyoming
