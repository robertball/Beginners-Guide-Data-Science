Description: 
You can start this the night before for an easy to finish brunch or put it with a salad for dinner! When I started from this recipe making my first quiche some 20+ years ago, it was from my old Fanny Farmer Cookbook, I have changed it up a bit over the years, but the orginal concept is still there!
