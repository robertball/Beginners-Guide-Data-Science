Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups (8 oz) semisweet chocolate, chopped
2 tablespoons (1 oz) unsalted butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2/3 cup (4 5/8 oz) granulated sugar
3 tablespoons (3/4 oz) cornstarch
2 tablespoons (3/8 oz) unsweetened cocoa powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup (8 oz) heavy cream, divided
3 large eggs
2 cups (16 ox) milk
1 cup (8 oz) heavy cream
1/4 cup (1 oz) confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
To make the filling:
Place the chopped chocolate, butter, and vanilla extract in a 2-quart mixing bowl; set aside. In a saucepan, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, cocoa, and salt. Add 1/4 cup of cream, whisking until the mixture is smooth. Repeat with another 1/4 cup of cream. Whisk in the egg yolks.
Place the saucepan over medium heat, and gradually whisk in the remaining cream and the milk.
Bring to a boil, stirring constantly as the mixture thickens; boil for 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the mixture over the reserved chocolate and butter, stirring until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth. Pass the filling through a strainer to remove any lumps. Place plastic wrap on the surface to prevent a skin from forming and chill throroughly.
To make the topping:
Whip the heavy cream til it starts to thicken. Add the sugar and vanilla and whip until the cream is as stiff as you like it.
To assemble the pie:
Spoon the cooled filling into a baked crust. Spoon or pipe the whipped cream on top. Chill the pie until ready to serve.
