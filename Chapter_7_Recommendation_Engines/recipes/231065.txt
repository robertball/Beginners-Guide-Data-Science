Ingredients:
Crust:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup shortening
1 egg
1/4 cup cold water
1 tablespoon white vinegar
Filling:
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup brown sugar
16 apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
1/2 cup butter
2 (8.5 ounce) boxes apple crisp mix (such as Concord Foods)

Directions:
Combine 2 1/2 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut 1/2 cup butter and shortening into flour until the mixture resembles crumbs.
Mix egg, water, and white vinegar together in a separate bowl; pour in the crumb mixture and blend with a fork to form a dough ball. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.
Melt 1/2 cup butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Blend 1/4 cup flour into the melted butter. Stir water and brown sugar into the butter mixture until smooth; remove from heat.
Roll chilled dough into a large rectangle on a flat surface dusted with flour; press into the bottom of an aluminum foil roasting pan and up the sides about an inch or more.
Dump the sliced apples onto the crust and gently spread into an even layer. Drizzle the butter mixture over the apples.
Pour apple crisp mix into a bowl. Cut 1/2 cup butter into the mix; scatter over the apples.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 1 hour.

Description: 
I put this together for a family get together! This could be made into three 9-inch pies but I put it in one large heavy-duty rectangular (food service) foil pan. It takes 3 sticks of butter in all but this serves 24!
