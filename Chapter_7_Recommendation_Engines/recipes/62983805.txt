Ingredients:
6 egg yolks
1/4 cup maple syrup
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup canned pumpkin
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon Spice Islands® pure vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
2 teaspoons sugar
2 teaspoons packed brown sugar
1/4 cup chopped pecans, toasted

Directions:
In a small bowl, whisk egg yolks and syrup. In a small saucepan, heat cream over medium heat until bubbles form around sides of pan. Remove from the heat; stir a small amount of hot cream into egg yolk mixture. Return all to the pan, stirring constantly. Stir in the pumpkin, cinnamon, vanilla and ginger.
Transfer to four 6-oz. ramekins or custard cups. Place ramekins in a baking pan; add 1 in. of boiling water to pan. Bake, uncovered, at 325° for 25-30 minutes or until centers are just set (mixture will jiggle). Remove ramekins from water bath; cool for 10 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
Combine sugars. If using a creme brulee torch, sprinkle custards with sugar mixture. Heat sugar with the torch until caramelized. Serve immediately.
If broiling the custards, place ramekins on a baking sheet; let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Sprinkle with sugar mixture. Broil 8 in. from the heat for 4-7 minutes or until sugar is caramelized. Sprinkle with pecans. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours or until firm.
