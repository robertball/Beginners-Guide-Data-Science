Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package lemon flavored Jell-O® mix
1 (3 ounce) package lime flavored Jell-O® mix
4 cups boiling water
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 stalks celery, finely chopped
1/2 cup chopped pimento-stuffed green olives
2 carrots, peeled and grated

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the lemon gelatin mix, lime gelatin mix, and boiling water until gelatin has dissolved. Stir in the apple cider vinegar, cover, and refrigerate for about 1 hour to thicken.
When the gelatin is thick but not set, stir in the celery, olives, and carrot so they are evenly dispersed throughout. Pour into a 1 quart mold and refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours. To serve, unmold onto a plate.
