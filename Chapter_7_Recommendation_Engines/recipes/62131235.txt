Ingredients:
2 tbsp. chocolate syrup
1/3 cup milk
1 cup tonic water (or club soda)
2 to 3 scoops chocolate ice cream (or as needed)
Additional chocolate syrup, whipped cream and cherry for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Mix syrup and milk together in the bottom of a tall glass.
Slowly add about half the tonic water.
Add one or two scoops of ice cream, and slowly add the remaining tonic water.
Top with another scoop of ice cream (or more if it will fit!)
Garnish with a drizzle of chocolate sauce, whipped cream and cherry, if desired.
Note:  Our traditional version uses tonic water, and we actually like the tonic aftertaste in contrast to the sweetness of the syrup.  However you may use club soda if you prefer.

Description: 
Above and beyond shakes and floats and frappes, the Ice Cream Soda reigns supreme as one of our favorite ice cream treats!  Brings back memories of the old-fashioned soda fountains.  Sadly, most places have removed this delectable treat from their menu.  This refreshing, dessert/drink is versatile - coffee or strawberry syrup can be substituted, as well as any flavor ice cream you choose.  But this is our homemade chocolate version - the kind I always ordered!
