Ingredients:
2 cups sifted flour
1 tablespoon ground ginger (add 1 additional teaspoon for extra spicy)
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 - 1/4 teaspoon ground black (or white) pepper
2 teaspoons soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup shortening
1 cup sugar
1 egg
1/4 cup molasses
extra sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Sift flour, ginger, cannamon, pepper, soda and salt in a bowl and set aside.
Cream shortening and sugar.  Add egg and molasses.  Stir in flour mixture.  Shape dough into balls and roll in sugar.  Bake on an ungreased baking sheet until cookies have flattened, browned slightly and have little cracks on the top - about 9-11 minutes depending on the size of the cookies.  Do not overbake or they will be cripsy - unless you want them crispy.

Description: 
A little different twist on gingersnaps - these are soft and chewy, not crispy and hard.  They are sweet, but spicy - with a generous amount of ginger and a little pepper - and delicious!  I have made hundreds of these over the years.  Heaven when served with pumpkin or cinnamon ice cream during the holidays or anytime.Modified from: Chewy Gingersnaps
