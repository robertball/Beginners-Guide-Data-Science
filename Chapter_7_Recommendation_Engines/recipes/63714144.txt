Ingredients:
6 ounces curly egg noodles
5 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
3 tablespoons flour
2 cups skim milk
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
13 ounces canned solid wite tuna in water, drained
3 tablespoons pitted black olives, or green olives, finely chopped
3 tablespoons fresh parsley, minced

Directions:
Heat oven to 350F.  Lightly grease a shallow 2-qt baking dish.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add noodles and cook as package directs.  Drain well in a colander.
Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a 3-Qt saucepan.  Put bread crumbs in a small bowl, add butter and toss to moisten evenly.
Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter in same saucepan over medium heat.  Stir in flour and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Gradually whisk in milk and stirring constantly, bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 2 minutes until thick and smooth.
Stir in cheese, salt and pepper.  Remove from heat and stir just until cheese melts.
While noodles drain, put tuna in a cooking pot and flake with a fork. Add noodles, cheese sauce, olive and parsley; toss to mix and coat.  Spread in prepared baking dish; top with butter crumbs.
Bake 20 to 30 minutes until golden brown and bubbly.

Description: 
I totally agree with the originator of this recipe, who says, This is a very good dish, bearing little resemblance to what school and college cafeterias serve.
