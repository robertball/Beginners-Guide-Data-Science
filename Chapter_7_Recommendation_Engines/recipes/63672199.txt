Ingredients:
Simple Syrup:
2 cups water
1 cup sugar
Strawberry Puree:
1 pint fresh strawberries, hulled (or 2 cups frozen, thawed)
1 cup cold water
Lemonade:
1 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice (approx. 6 lemons)
1 cup cold water
ice
fresh sliced strawberries, optional

Directions:
For simple syrup combine water & sugar in sauce pan. Heat over high heat until sugar dissolves and becomes a syrup. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, make strawberry puree by placing strawberries and water in blender. Blend into a puree, leaving small chunks of strawberries if so desired. In 1/2 gallon pitcher combine lemon juice, ice, water. Add strawberry puree and simple syrup. stir in sliced strawberries , if using. Chill. If you prefer not to have strawberry pieces or seeds in lemonade strain before serving. * I have found that the strawberries tend to separate from the lemonade and settle on bottom of the pitcher/glass. Be sure to stir well before pouring each glass. Serve with a straw in glass so can be stirred if so desired.
