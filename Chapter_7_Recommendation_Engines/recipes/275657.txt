Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup Italian polenta
1/4 cup fat-free half-and-half
1 tablespoon grapeseed oil
4 Italian turkey sausage links
12 ounces marinara sauce
1 medium onion, sliced
1 green bell pepper, seeded and sliced into strips
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 pinch crushed red pepper
1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Combine chicken broth, polenta, and half-and-half in a medium-sized heat-resistant glass bowl, such as Pyrex(R). Set aside.
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Pour in grapeseed oil and allow to get hot. Add sausages and cook until brown, about 2 minutes per side. Pour in marinara sauce, onion, and bell pepper; mix to combine. Place a trivet into the pot and set the bowl of polenta on top of the trivet. Close and lock the lid.
Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Whisk butter, garlic salt, red pepper, and Parmesan cheese into the polenta. Serve immediately.
