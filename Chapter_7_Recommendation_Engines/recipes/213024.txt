Ingredients:
4 slices bacon, chopped
1 pound dry black-eyed peas
6 cups water
1 onion, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chili powder
salt to taste

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
Place the dried peas, water, onion, tomatoes, jalapeno pepper, garlic, and chili powder into a slow cooker, and stir to combine. Stir in the bacon and bacon grease, and set the cooker on High. Cook until peas are tender, about 4 hours. Season to taste with salt, and serve.

Description: 
I serve this traditionally on New Year's Day with a pork roast, but we also enjoy it anytime we want a pot of peas! It is also delicious served over rice.
