Ingredients:
3 1/2 c. vegetable stock
1/2 c. dry red wine
1/2 c. FRESH sliced mushrooms
2 cloves freshly minced garlic
2 freshly sliced green onions
Your choice of dippers (Chicken, Steak, Veggies, etc.)

Directions:
1. Heat the vegetable stock on until it begins to simmer.  If you're using an electric fondue pot, heat the vegetable stock on medium.  If you're using a fondue pot that requires a sterno fuel source, partially cover the sterno can so that the fondue doesn't get too hot too quickly.
2. Add wine, mushrooms, garlic and onions.  Allow it to simmer for 15 minutes so that the aromas combine in the fondue pot.  Fondue will be ready when it is near a boil.
3. While your fondue is simmering, prepare your dippers.  Cut vegetables, potatoes, meats, and any other dippers into bite-size pieces.
4. Place your dippers in the fondue pot using skewers.  If you use shrimp or other seafood, it will cook quite rapidly (i.e. 1-2 minutes) whereas chicken and steak will take a little longer.  We like to just put the vegetables into the broth and fish them out when they're tender.  Enjoy!

Description: 
I first experienced this fondue at a popular chain restaurant.  I've been trying to make it at home ever since.  This is the closest I've come, and it's always a big hit!  Enjoy for a romantic dinner for two at home, or prepare a larger quantity for a dinner party.  Either way, we rarely have left-overs!
