Description: 
A simple chicken chili recipe that makes use of convenience items and a crock pot. This recipe is a staple at my church's Christmas Brunch. I got it from one of the former members so we could continue using it when he left. I changed it slightly to make it a bit easier to remain consistent every time (his was dash of this, bit of that).
