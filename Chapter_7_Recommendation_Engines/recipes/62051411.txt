Ingredients:
Pork Roast (size depends on servings needed)
½ lb. bacon
2 cans chicken broth
1-2 Tb. Cornstarch
12 oz. package fresh mushrooms, sliced
2 tsp. dried rosemary
salt
pepper
water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Salt and pepper pork roast to taste.  Cook pork roast upside-down (fat side up) until it reaches 165-170 degrees (approx. 1-1/2 to 2 hours).  Remove from oven and cover with foil to keep warm.
In a large skillet, fry the bacon until crisp.  Remove from skillet and crumble; set aside.  Drain bacon fat, if desired.
In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with ½ cup cold water to blend.  In the same skillet used for the bacon, heat the chicken broth and gradually add the corn starch mixture.  Simmer to thicken.  Add mushrooms, rosemary and bacon.  Simmer long enough to cook the mushrooms.
Slice roast and serve bacon mixture over the pork slices.
