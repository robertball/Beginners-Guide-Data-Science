https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries
1 cup diced fresh pineapple
3 oranges - peeled, segmented, and chopped
1 honeydew melon - peeled, seeded and cubed
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1/4 cup white sugar
1 (16 ounce) can pineapple juice
1/4 cup vanilla low-fat yogurt (optional)
4 sprigs fresh mint leaves for garnish

Directions:
Combine the blueberries, pineapple, oranges, melon, lemon juice, lemon zest, sugar, and pineapple juice in a large skillet. If desired, stir in the yogurt to make the mixture more creamy. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves and the fruit softens, 3 to 5 minutes.
Place fruit mixture into a blender or the bowl of a food processor; blend or pulse until smooth. Spoon into a freezer dish. Chill until mixture becomes slushy, about 20 to 25 minutes, or until desired consistency. Serve garnished with fresh mint leaves.
