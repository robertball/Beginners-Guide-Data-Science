Ingredients:
2 pounds turnips, peeled and cubed
1/2 cup butter
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup half-and-half cream
1 cup brown sugar
1 pinch ground nutmeg
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place turnips into saucepan and fill with enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Add butter to the hot turnips and mash with a potato masher or whisk. Once the butter has melted in, stir in the sour cream, half-and-half, brown sugar, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mash to your desired consistency. I always undermash for a chunkier outcome. Cover and keep in a warm oven until ready to serve.
