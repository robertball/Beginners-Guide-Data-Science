Ingredients:
1/2 pound fresh okra, cut into 1/2 inch slices
8 cherry tomatoes, halved
olive oil
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
garlic powder to taste
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place the okra and tomatoes in a bowl. Pour in the olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Stir until the vegetables are coated with oil. Add the panko bread crumbs and stir. Spread the vegetables on to a lightly greased baking sheet. Bake for 13 to 15 minutes until the tomatoes are soft and the okra is lightly browned.

Description: 
Roasting the okra with tomatoes keeps it from being slimy, and a dusting of panko adds a touch of crunch to mimick fried okra without the added fat from frying.
