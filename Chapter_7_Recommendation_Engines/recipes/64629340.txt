Ingredients:
4 slices bread
2 slices ham
2 slices cheese
1/4 pc onion
1 tsp curry powder
1/2 pc steamed/boiled corn
1 pc egg
100 mL milk
salt
pepper
1 Tbsp butter
honey (optional)

Directions:
Slice the onion thinly. Shuck the corn using a knife.
Remove the crusts of the bread if you prefer.
Place a slice of cheese on one bread then add some onions on top. Sprinkle it with curry powder then add the ham on top. Add some more onions then sandwich it with another slice of bread.
In a wide bowl, mix whisked egg, milk, and a dash of salt and pepper.
Put the sandwich on the bowl with eggs and milk then let the bread absorb the liquid. Turn over the sandwich once the bottom bread absorbs half of the liquid. This takes about 10-20 minutes.
Preheat the sandwich maker then spread melted butter on the sandwich plates.
Carefully place the soaked sandwich in the sandwich maker then toast until the sandwich has browned. I've toasted for about 7 minutes. Just remember that the toasting time for every sandwich maker may vary.
Remove the monte-Cristo from the sandwich maker, then slice and serve. Drizzle with honey if you want before serving.

Description: 
This is my second version of Monte-Cristo sandwich cooked in a sandwich maker. From the basic filling of ham and cheese, I've made the sandwich toasts more exciting by adding curry, onion and corn. This is so delicious and a must try if you're feeling adventurous in the kitchen.
