Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast
2 cups water
1 can chicken broth
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of celery soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 pkg frozen cut carrots
salt and pepper to taste
1 (12 ounce) package refrigerated biscuit dough

Directions:
In a large pot over high heat, combine the chicken with water and chicken broth, and boil for 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove chicken and allow it to cool, then pull it apart into bite size pieces; return to pot.
Reduce heat to medium, and add the cans of condensed soup and the carrots. Season with salt and pepper. Allow to heat while you pull the biscuit dough into pieces, and add to the soup. Simmer over medium heat for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the dough is cooked through.
