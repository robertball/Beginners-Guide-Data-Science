Ingredients:
5 tbsp butter
1/2 cup chopped shallot
1/2 lb sliced shitake mushrooms
1 lb sliced button mushrooms
1 lb sliced bella mushrooms
1/2 lb sliced crimini mushrooms
4 tbsp flour
3 to 4 cups low sodium chicken broth
2 tbsp sherry
1 cup heavy cream
snipped chives for garnish
1/3 pound brie

Directions:
Place brie into freezer.
Melt butter and add shallots stirring for 3 - 5 minutes.
Add the bella and button mushrooms and saute for 10 minutes until the mushrooms give off most of the moisture.
Remove the bella and button mushrooms and divide into two parts.
Use a food processer and chop 1 part mushrooms (bella and button) very fine and set aside.
Saute the remaining mushrooms until they give off most of their moisture.
When mushrooms are all sauteed, add one part of the sliced bella and button mushrooms back to the remaining mushrooms.
Sprinkle with flour and stir until the flour begins to cook.
Gradually add the chicken broth, whisking the soup until smooth.
Add the chopped button and bella mushrooms into the broth mixture.
Add the sherry and heavy cream until thoroughly heated through (do not boil).
When ready to serve, remove brie from freezer and slice very thin.  Top each bowl with slice of brie and garnish with chives.
