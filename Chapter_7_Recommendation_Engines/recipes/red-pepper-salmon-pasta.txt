Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) fillets salmon
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 cup roasted red bell peppers
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 teaspoons minced jalapeno peppers
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 cup chicken broth
1 (8 ounce) package angel hair pasta

Directions:
In an 8 inch baking dish, arrange filets in a single layer. Sprinkle with lemon juice. Tightly cover dish with foil.  Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).  Cook until fish is opaque, but still moist looking in thickest part, 12 to 14 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a blender, smoothly puree red peppers, parmesan, cornstarch, chili, and garlic.  Add cilantro and chicken broth; whirl to blend.
Pour pepper mixture into a 10 inch frying pan.  Stir over high heat until boiling.  Reduce heat to keep warm.
Cook pasta in 3 quarts boiling water until tender to bite, about 7 minutes.  Drain, and return to pan.
Stir juices from the baked salmon into red pepper sauce.  Mix 1 1/2 cups sauce with pasta.  Spoon pasta onto plates.  Top with fish, and drizzle with remaining sauce.  Serve.
