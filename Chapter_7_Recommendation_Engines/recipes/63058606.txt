Ingredients:
6 large eggs
2 tablespoons nonfat plain Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon light mayonnaise
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons finely chopped sweet onion
2 tablespoons finely chopped celery
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Place eggs in a medium saucepan, cover with cold water by 1 inch and bring to a boil over high. Remove pan from heat, cover, and let sit for 11-14 minutes. Transfer eggs to a large bowl filled with ice water and let cool for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine yogurt, mayonnaise, mustard and salt in a medium bowl; season with pepper. Stir in the onion, celery and chives.
Peel the eggs; discard 2 of the yolks. Coarsely chop whites and remaining yolks and combine with yogurt mixture in the bowl. (Mixture can be made up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated.)
