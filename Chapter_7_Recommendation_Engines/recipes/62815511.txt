Ingredients:
1/2  cup  orange juice
1/4  cup  lime juice
1/4  cup  tequila (here’s the zinger!)
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 teaspoon  salt
1/2  teaspoon  McCormick Smokehouse pepper
6 large skinless bone-in chicken thighs
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons leftover marinade
1/4 teaspoon salt
3  cups cooked rice
1/2   each red and yellow sweet peppers
2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced
1 tablespoon  chopped cilantro

Directions:
Place orange juice, lime juice, tequila, canola oil, salt and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken and seal. Marinate in refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight.
Heat gas grill to medium-high or prep charcoal grill with medium-hot coals and set up one side for indirect grilling. Lightly coat grill rack with oil or nonstick cooking spray.
Remove the chicken from the plastic bag and pour marinade into a small saucepan. Boil for 1 minute and reserve. Place chicken on direct heat and grill for 5 minutes per side. Remove to indirect heat and grill for 20 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Baste every 5 minutes with the reserved marinade.
To prepare the rice salad, in a large bowl, whisk olive oil, 3 tablespoons of the marinade and salt. Stir in rice, peppers, scallions and cilantro. Serve at room temperature with chicken.
