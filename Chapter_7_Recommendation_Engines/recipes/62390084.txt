Ingredients:
3 boneless/skinless chicken breast
1 lb penne pasta
1/4 cup + 1/8 cup hot sauce
2 tbsp melted butter
3/4 cup ranch dressing
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1 carrot shredded
2 stalks of celery diced
4 ozs of bleu cheese

Directions:
Mix the 1/8 cup of hot sauce and the melted butter together and add the chicken to marinate for 1 hr.
Remove chicken and discard the marinade.
Grill or bake chicken for approx 20 minutes until it is no longer pink but moist. Let chicken cool and cube into bite size pieces.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the penne pasta and cook until al dente approx 10 minutes.
DO NOT RINSE THE PASTA!
Let pasta sit until cool stirring occasionally so it does not stick together.
Mix the 1/4 cup of hot sauce with the ranch dressing, mayonnaise,onion and garlic powder.
Place pasta in a large bowl with the diced celery,shredded carrot,cubed chicken and crumbled bleu cheese and mix gently.
Pour the hot sauce mixture over the top of the pasta/chicken mixture and mix well.
Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.

What's not to love about pasta and buffalo chicken?
Put them together and you have created a taste that is not to be taken lightly. This is serious flavor.
