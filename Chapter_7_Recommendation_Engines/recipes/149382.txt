Ingredients:
1 cup instant white rice, uncooked
1 cup warm water
1/2 pound halibut fillet, cut crosswise in half
2 cups baby spinach leaves, coarsely chopped
1/4 cup KRAFT Sun-Dried Tomato Dressing
1 tablespoon KRAFT 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spoon 1/2 cup rice onto center of each of two 18-inch-long sheets of heavy-duty foil. (Or use double-layer sheets of regular foil.) Fold up all sides of foil slightly to form rim. Pour 1/2 cup warm water over each mound of rice; top each with 1 fish piece.
Arrange spinach around fish. Drizzle dressing evenly over fish and spinach. Bring up foil sides. Double fold top and ends to seal each packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Place foil packets in single layer in shallow baking pan.
Bake 15 minutes. Place one packet on each of two dinner plates. Cut slits in foil with sharp knife to release steam before opening each packet. Sprinkle evenly with cheese.
