Description: 
This is a great recipe that I have used for years to utilize left-over ham from holidays and still get my children to eat spinach without them knowing as much.  EASY and can be served as a casserole for a gathering too.  Use frozen spinach for quicker prep time and left-over rice from earlier days of stir-fry cooking.
