Description: 
This recipe for smoked fish dip is world class, puts most others to shame, and is served in several prominent restaurants on the gulf coast of Florida.  We used smoked whitefish, well boned, but any other smoked fish should work.  Serve with crackers, lemon or lime wedges, and capers.
