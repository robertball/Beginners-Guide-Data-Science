Cook bacon then chop into small pieces. Cook the spinach in a pan until wilted,then chop. Melt the butter and let cool slightly.
In a large bowl combine all the ingrediants and stir until everything is mixed together. Poor into pie shell and bake for 15 minutes. Then turn down oven to 350 degrees and bake for 30 minutes. If you like your quiche a bit firmer bake for 5 more minutes or until quiche does not jiggle when you move it. It should be slightly browned on the top.
Take out of oven and let cool for 5 minutes, then enjoy!
