1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 large egg
1 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon lemon extract
1-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon coriander
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg white
2 tablespoons white granulated sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in egg, vanilla extract and lemon extract.  In second bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, spices and salt; gradually beat into creamed mixture
Divide dough in half.  Shape each into a disk; wrap in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate 1 hour or until firm enough to roll
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion of dough to 1/8-in. thickness.  Cut with floured 2-in. square or triangle cookie cutters.  Place 1-in. apart on un-greased baking sheets.  Beat egg white until foamy; brush over cut-outs.  Sprinkle with white granulated sugar and sliced almonds
Bake 9-11 minutes or until light brown.  Remove from pans to wire racks to cool. Yield: about 2 1/2 dozen
