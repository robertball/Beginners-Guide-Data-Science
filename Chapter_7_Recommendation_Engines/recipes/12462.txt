Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 yellow onion, chopped
1 red onion, chopped
2 tablespoons dry white wine
2 leeks, bulb only, sliced into rings
2 eggs, beaten
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill weed
1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1 plum tomatoes, thinly sliced
1 cup fine bread crumbs
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat the oil in a large skillet.  Add the yellow and red onions, and saute over moderate heat for 5 minutes.  Stir in the wine, then add the leeks.  Saute for another 15 minutes, stirring frequently, or until the onions are golden and the leeks are limp.  Remove from heat.
In a mixing bowl, combine the beaten eggs with dill, tarragon, feta cheese, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley.   Stir in the onion mixture.
Oil a 10 inch tart pan, and line the bottom generously with bread crumbs.  Pour in the onion mixture.  Ring the outside edge of the pie with tomato slices, and sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon parsley in the center.  Sprinkle a light layer of bread crumbs over the entire top.
Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the mixture is set and the top is golden.  Let stand for 10 minutes, then cut into wedges and serve.
