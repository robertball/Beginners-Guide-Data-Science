Ingredients:
4 Lbs. Chicken wings, halved at joints, wingtips dicarded
2 Tbs. Baking Powder
3/4 tsp. salt

Directions:
Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower middle positions and heat oven to 250 degrees.  Set wire rack in aluminum lined baking sheet.
Pat wings dry with paper towels and transfer to 1 gallon zip lock bag.  Combine baking powder and salt, add wings, deal bag and toss to evenly coat.
Arrange wings, skin side up, in a single layer on prepared wire rack.  Bake wings on the lower-middle oven rack for 30 minutes.   Move wings to upper-middle rack, increase tempature to 425 degrees, and roast until wings are golden brown and crispy, about 40 to 50 minutes longer, rotating sheet halfway through baking.  Remove sheet from oven and let stand for 5 minutes.
Transfer wings to bowl with your favorite wing sauce and toss to coat.
