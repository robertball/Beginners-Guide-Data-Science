Ingredients:
1/3 Cup    Balsamic Vinegar, divided (2 Tbsp reserved out for dressing at the end)
1/3 Cup    Olive Oil
1   Tbsp   Honey
1   Tbsp   Paprika
Salt, Pepper, Garlic to taste
2   lbs    Baby Yukon Gold Potatoes - halved or quartered
8   oz     Baby 'Bella Mushrooms, halved or quartered
1   Lg     Sweet or Yellow Onion, rough chopped
2-3 slices Bacon, chopped/crumbled
2-3 stalks Scallions, sliced (optional)
1/3 Cup    Fresh Parsley, chopped (optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 400F
Combine balsamic vinegar, olive oil, honey, paprika, salt, pepper, and garlic in a large bowl
Cut up the potatoes, mushrooms, and onion (they should be in roughly 1-1.5 inch pieces) and add them to the bowl with the glaze, toss to coat.
Spread coated veggies out on a lined baking sheet and bake for 30-40 minutes (or until the potatoes are tender).
For the bacon, you can either slice the strips and fry in a pan like lardons (great if you are going to pan seared steak or chop to eat the salad with!) or you can bake it in the oven and crumble it.
When the mixture comes out of the oven, scoop it into a serving bowl and toss with the bacon, scallions,  parsley, and reserved balsamic vinegar (for extra style points - save a little parsley to sprinkle over the top at the end)

Description: 
Super easy, delicious and reheats well!  This (loosely inspired by German potato salad) recipe is tasty hot or cold and great for outdoor dining - no mayo to worry about keeping cold.  Also, you can switch it up and play with different flavor combinations by swapping the vinegar, herbs, and spices.  Enjoy!
