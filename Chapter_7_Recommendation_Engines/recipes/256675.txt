salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 large potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

1 white onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup cooking oil

Directions:
Mix cornmeal, salt, and pepper together in a large resealable plastic bag; add potatoes, okra, and onion. Seal bag and shake until vegetables are coated with cornmeal mixture.
Heat cooking oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking. Place vegetables in the hot oil and cook until potatoes are tender and okra and onion are browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer cooked vegetables to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon.

Description: 
This dish originated in Africa but my mother and her relatives prepared it in Alabama. Kingombo is the name of okra in the African Bantu language and patata is the name of potato in Spain. I combined the two words together to name my dish. This is a wonderful okra and potato dish that can used as a side dish or it can be eaten for breakfast. Enjoy kingombo patatas!
