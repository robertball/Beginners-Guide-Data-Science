Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/8 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
2 medium zucchini, sliced 1/4-inch thick
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Mix together bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl. Place zucchini in a separate bowl and toss with olive oil until coated. Dip each slice of zucchini into the bread crumb mixture to evenly coat. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until zucchini is tender and bread crumbs are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a family favorite. I make these and freeze slices between waxed paper. Put into a freezer bag and winter blahs are lifted when eating summer veggies. This is a great little freezer-friendly appetizer for the holidays or any get-together.
