Ingredients:
3 tablespoons cooking oil
2 dried red chile peppers, broken into pieces
1 tablespoon skinned split black lentils (urad dal)
1 teaspoon split Bengal gram (chana dal)
1 teaspoon mustard seed
1 sprig fresh curry leaves
1 pinch asafoetida powder
4 green chile peppers, minced
1 head cabbage, finely chopped
1/4 cup frozen peas (optional)
salt to taste
1/4 cup grated coconut

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; fry the red chile peppers, urad dal, chana dal, and mustard seed in the hot oil. When the urad dal begins to brown, add the curry leaves and asafoetida powder; stir. Add the green chile peppers and continue cooking 1 minute more. Stir the cabbage and peas into the mixture; season with salt; cook and stir until the cabbage begins to wilt, but remains somewhat crunchy, about 10 minutes. Toss the coconut into the mixture and cook for 2 minutes more. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This a very simple yet delicious Andhra recipe for cabbage koora (sabji). I like it so much that sometimes I eat it all by itself, like a salad with some yoghurt on the side. The spice here comes from the green chilis. Serve with rice.
