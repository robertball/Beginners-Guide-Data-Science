Ingredients:
vegetable oil as needed
1 medium yam, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch cubes
1 medium onion, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 large eggplant, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 tablespoon whole coriander seeds
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups hot water
1 cup red lentils

Directions:
Heat oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Cook and stir yams in the hot oil until 1 side is golden, about 5 minutes. Add onions and saute until softened and golden, about 5 minutes, or longer if you like more color. Stir in eggplant, coriander, cumin, red pepper flakes, and salt. Cook and stir mixture until glaze is just about to burn, 5 to 7 minutes more.
Reduce heat to low and deglaze the pan by pouring in some of the hot water and scraping up browned bits. Add red lentils and remaining water. Cover and let simmer until lentils and vegetables are soft, about 30 minutes.
