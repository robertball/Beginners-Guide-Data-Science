Description: 
This twist on cauliflower casserole combines the traditional green bean casserole-style dish with a tastier, spicier flavor. Fresh cauliflower, bacon, and Italian ingredients make this casserole just delicious. This casserole really celebrates the cauliflower therefore should not be soupy and doesn't overdo the flavorings and cheese.
