Description: 
I just re-found this recipe for making a copycat of the Kraft Garlic Cheese Rolls that the company Kraft has discontinued making.  
I have several recipes that call for a tube of  garlic cheese roll.
One recipe I found says to combine the cheeses after softening, then form into tubes & the other recipe I found (below) say to heat the cheese then cool.  I believe heating the cheeses would meld the cheeses and flavors better.
