Ingredients:
1 1/4 Cup Sugar
1 Cup Orange Flavored Drink (Tang)
1/4 Cup Instant Tea
1/2 teaspoon Ground Cloves
1 teaspoon Cinnamon

Directions:
Mix together above ingredients.
It is fun for kids to see the different colored layers and the way the ingredients swirl when they mix them together.  Great way to teach them about measuring and cooking too since you can't really mess this up!
Use approximately 1-2 Tablespoons per Cup of hot water.
For some, the cloves may be too strong and need to be cut back.
