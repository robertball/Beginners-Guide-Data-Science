Ingredients:
1 lb Italian sausage, browned and crumbled.
1 (32 fluid ounce) cans chicken broth
6 slices bacon, coarsely chopped
6 large russet potatoes, coarsely chopped
3 large leeks, bulbs only
1 cup white wine
1 large bunch of kale
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Slice leeks down the center of the bulbs and wash/soak in bowl of water. Slice thin across.
Cut the thick stalks away from the kale. Wash well in a water bath.
Place the bacon into the soup pot over medium heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon is crisp and  browned, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon pieces and drain on paper towels; set the bacon aside.
Reserve about 2 tablespoons of bacon drippings in the pot. Cook and stir the leeks in the bacon drippings over medium heat until soft and wilted but not brown. Place the sausage and the potato cubes in with the leeks and saute for a few minutes.
Pour in the broth and bring to a boil. Cook till potatos are soft, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat.
Roughly mash the potatos with a potato masher. Roughly slice the kale and place in the simmering soup. Cover and cook for 5-10 min.
Mix in the cream and then stir in the white wine. Heat over medium-low heat until the soup is hot; garnish  each serving with a few pieces of bacon.
