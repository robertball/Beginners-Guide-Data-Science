Ingredients:
1 cup all purpose flour
1 1/4 tsp baking powder
1 1/4 tsp sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 c shredded cheddar cheese
3/4 c cream *or* mix of sour cream & whole milk (see notes)
1 tsp pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425
Whisk flour, baking powder, salt and sugar together in bowl.
Add cream (or other heavy fat liquid) and cheese, mixing just until it barely comes together.
Turn out onto floured surface and fold 4 or 5 times.  Watch liquid to flour ratio depending on humidity you may need more or less.
Pat out, leaving fairly thick for high fluffy biscuits, and cut with a 2 1/2" cutter (making sure not to twist as you cut).
Brush tops with leftover liquid (or butter ... whatever) and sprinkle with fresh cracked pepper.
Bake 11-13 minutes or until golden brown.
