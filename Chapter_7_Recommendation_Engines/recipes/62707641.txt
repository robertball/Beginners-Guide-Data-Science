Ingredients:
1 cup Whole Wheat Flour or Flour Blend* (recipe below)
1 cup quick-cooking rolled oats
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup butter
1 21-ounce can cherry or peach pie filling

Directions:
1) In medium bowl combine flour, oats, brown sugar and baking soda. Using a pastry blender, or food processor, cut in cold butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Reserve 1/2 cup of the crumb mixture.
2) Press remaining crumb mixture into bottom of an ungreased 13x9-inch, 11x7x1 1/2-inch, or 15x10x1-inch baking pan.  Spread desired filling. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture. Bake in 350 degree oven for 30-35 minutes or until the top is golden. Cool on wire rack. Cut into bars.
* For flour blend, recipes as follows:
1 cup all purpose flour
1 cup wheat germ
1 cup whole wheat flour.
Mix until combined and store in an air tight container. I substitute this in place of regular wite all-purpose flour. This ensures me that my children are getting the whole wheat and wheat germ in their daily snacks. I store this in an airtight container.

Description: 
Perfect Lunch Box treats and snacks. Choose your favorite filling to use instead of cherry if you prefer. I make these in a 13x9 pan only because I don't have an 11x7x 1 1/2-inch baking pan. I also use a whole wheat flour blend rather than all-purpose. It's my personal choice.
