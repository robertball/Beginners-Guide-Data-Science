Ingredients:
1 lb minced pork (minced chicken or minced beef will also work well)
½ - 1 tablespoon of chili flakes (Korean markets have this, it is the same chili flake used in Kimchi)
? tablespoon of sugar (just a pinch)
½ tablespoon of fish sauce
1 - 2 limes
3 - 4 small shallots
A few leaves of Cilantro - (I use a LOT)
3 - 5 spring onions (green onions)
About 20 leaves or so of fresh mint (you can leave these out if you're not a mint fan)

Directions:
Add minced pork to a small sized saucepan with a handle. Fry the pork, breaking it into small minced pieces, until it’s fully cooked all the way through. For best flavor, leave all the oils that come out (but if you want to be healthier, you can also drain the pork oil, and add in a splash of water instead). Take the pork off the heat.
Toss in ½ - 1 tablespoon of chili flakes.
Add a pinch of sugar, ½ tablespoon of fish sauce, and squeeze in the juice from 1 - 2 limes (I used about 1 ½ full limes, but I like it quite sour).
Give the pork and the seasoning a quick stir.
Peel and slice the shallots, finely mince about 5 green onions and a few cilantro leaves (if you have them), and just pluck about 20 or so mint leaves off the stem. Throw everything into the saucepan with the pork.
Give the larb moo a good mix, making sure all the spices and dressing coats the pork.
Taste test. See if it needs more fish sauce for saltiness, lime juice, or chili flakes. Get it the way you want it.
Dish it out onto a plate and garnish with more mint leaves, Thai sweet basil, and culantro.
