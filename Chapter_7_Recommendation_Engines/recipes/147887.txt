Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds butternut squash - peel, remove seeds, and cut into 2-inch chunks
2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for pan
6 stems thyme
6 cloves garlic, peeled
2/3 pound chicken Italian style sausage (remove from casing if uncooked)
1 (10 ounce) box frozen spinach, defrosted, and excess water removed
1 pound rigatoni pasta
2/3 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup grated mozzarella, divided
2/3 cup finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, divided
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (15 ounce) can BUSH'S® Great Northern White Beans, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup breadcrumbs
3 tablespoons heavy cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place water for the pasta on to boil. Lightly oil a 9-by-13 inch gratin or baking dish.
On a large baking sheet or roasting pan, toss squash with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Scatter thyme and half of the whole garlic cloves over the squash. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for about 20 to 25 minutes until squash is tender, but not mushy.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet set over medium high heat, heat remaining tablespoon of the oil. Add sausage and cook, stirring frequently until meat is fully cooked and no longer pink.
Lower heat to medium and add remaining whole garlic cloves and spinach, saute  for 1 minute then remove garlic if desired. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
When squash has finished cooking remove from oven and remove garlic cloves and thyme stems if you prefer.  Add squash to the sausage and spinach mixture.
Reduce oven to 375 degrees F.
Boil pasta, and drain about 2 minutes before the package directions suggest, so pasta is still a little firm. Toss drained pasta with sausage mixture.
Add stock, 1/4 cup of mozzarella, 1/3 cup of Romano, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add Great Northern Beans and gently toss.
Transfer to prepared gratin or baking dish and top with breadcrumbs, remaining  1/4 cup of grated mozzarella and 1/3 cup of Romano. Drizzle with heavy cream (or olive oil).
Bake for 25 minutes, until heated through and crusty on top.
