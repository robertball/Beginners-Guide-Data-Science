Ingredients:
2 cups eggnog
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 cup milk

Mix the eggnog, whipping cream, and milk together in a bowl, and pour the mixture into the freezer container of an ice cream maker. Freeze according to manufacturer's directions. Once frozen, spoon the ice cream into a container, and freeze 2 hours more.

Description: 
Knowing that a custard ice cream base uses a cooked custard, and because commercial eggnog is cooked and thick in a similar way, I decided to try making ice cream with eggnog by adding cream and milk. The result is this wonderful light and creamy eggnog-flavored ice cream. It makes one quart plus.
