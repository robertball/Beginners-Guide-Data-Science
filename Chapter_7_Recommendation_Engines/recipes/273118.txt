Ingredients:
6 dry whole wheat lasagna noodles, or more to taste
1 small eggplant, chopped
1 yellow squash, chopped
1 zucchini, chopped
1 portobello mushroom, chopped
1 (28 ounce) jar low-fat marinara sauce
1 (15 ounce) container fat-free ricotta cheese
4 ounces shredded low-fat mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese
3 cloves garlic, diced
1 egg
2 teaspoons dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.
Combine eggplant, squash, zucchini, mushroom, and marinara sauce in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.
Combine ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, garlic, egg, oregano, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
Spread 1/3 the sauce mixture into the bottom of a 8-inch square baking dish. Top with 2 cooked lasagna noodles. Spread 1/2 the cheese mixture on top and cover with 2 more lasagna noodles. Repeat, ending with sauce on top. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbling, about 40 minutes.
