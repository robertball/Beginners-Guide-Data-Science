Ingredients:
1 package dry yeast
1 c. warm water
1/4 c. melted butter, plus more for brushing
3 1/2 c. flour
2 tbs. white sugar
1 1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp thyme
1/4 tsp. dill
1/4 tsp. oregano

Directions:
In a mixer bowl, add packet of dry yeast and dissolve in warm water. Add a pinch of sugar. Let sit until bubbles start to form around the edges, about 6-9 minutes.
Now add melted butter, two cups of flour, remaining sugar, salt, and thyme, dill, and oregano. Turn mixer to speed two and mix for one minute, or until everything is well blended.
Continue at speed two and add one-and-a-half cups flour at half-cup increments, and mix for about two minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic.
Place dough in bowl and cover it; set aside in a warm place and let it rise for about an hour, or until it doubles in size.
Punch the dough down. Flour rolling pin and work surface and roll the dough into a small disk.
Divide disk into six even wedges. Divide each wedge in to six different pieces and roll those pieces into 36 small balls.
Place three balls into each cup of a muffin pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes, or until double in size.
Preheat oven to 400*. Brush with butter. Bake for 15-20 minutes until lightly golden, then cool on a wire rack.
