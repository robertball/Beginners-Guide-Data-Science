Ingredients:
The Bundles:
3 sheets phyllo pastry
1/4 cup of butter, melted
Blue Cheese, Walnut and Roasted Red Pepper Filling
1 cup (250mL) chopped toasted walnuts
8 oz (250mL) blue cheese, crumbled
1/2 cup (125mL) chopped bottled roasted red peppers
Mix ingredients together and refrigerate until needed. Makes enough filling for 20 bundles.
Chevre with Cranberry and Orange Zest
8 oz (250mL) chevre (goat cheese)
1/2 cup (125mL) dried cranberries
2 tsp (10mL) grated orange zest
2 tsp (10mL) chopped fresh chives
Mix ingredients together and refrigerate until needed. Makes enough filling for 20 bundles.

Directions:
Thaw pastry as per package instructions.
Working on a flat surface, generously brush a sheet of the phyllo with butter. Top with a second and third sheet, brushing each with butter. Cut phyllo into 20, 3" (8cm) squares. Place a dollop of the filling in the centre of each square. Pull up the edges, pinch together and place on a parchment lined cookie sheet. If refrigerating, cover with a clean, damp cloth or plastic wrap. If freezing, cover with plastic wrap and seal. Preheat oven to 400 F (200C). Bake refrigerated bundles for 8 minutes, frozen bundles for 10 minutes, or until golden. Serve warm.
