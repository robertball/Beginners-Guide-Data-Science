Ingredients:
5 pounds potatoes, peeled and quartered
1/4 cup butter
6 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups 2% milk
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
While potatoes are cooking, melt butter over medium-low heat in a small saucepan. Add garlic and saute until soft, about 5 minutes.
Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Add garlic-butter mixture, milk, Parmesan cheese, parsley, sea salt, and pepper; mash until smooth.
