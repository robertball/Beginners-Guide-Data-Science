Ingredients:
5 tomatoes
4 green bell peppers
1 large red onion
1 (8 ounce) bottle zesty Italian dressing

Directions:
Slice tomatoes and peppers and set aside.  Slice the red onion and separate the rings.  Using a large bowl with a lid, layer the tomatoes, green pepper and onion until all vegetables are used.  Shake the bottled dressing and pour over the vegetable layers.  Refrigerate for 2-3 hours or, for best results, overnight.  Before serving, turn bowl upside down to make sure all vegetables are coated with the dressing.

Description: 
I got this recipe from my sister-in-law who served this with grilled sword fish. It has been a hit in my family ever since.  I find the 8 ounce bottle of dressing is enough, but some people may want more, which won't hurt the salad.
