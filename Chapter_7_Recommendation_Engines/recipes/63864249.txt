Ingredients:
2 cups firmly packed golden brown sugar
3/4 cup dried cranberries (or golden raisins)
1/2 cup orange juice
1/2 cup minced shallot
3 tablespoons minced ginger
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 lb pears, peeled, cored and cut into 1/2-inch dice
4 cups fresh or frozen cranberries

Directions:
In a heavy nonaluminum saucepan over medium heat, combine all ingredients EXCEPT pears and fresh or frozen cranberries. Stir until the sugar desolves.  Add the pears and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the pears are tender, about 10 minutes.  Increase the heat to medium-high.  Add the fresh or frozen cranberries and boil, stirring frequently, until they begin to burst, about 5 minutes.
If the chutney will be kept for no longer than 3 weeks, simply store in the refrigerator.  For longer storage, proess in canning jars using the hot-water bath method.
