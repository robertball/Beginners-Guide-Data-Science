Ingredients:
3 (1 1/2 pound) pork tenderloins
4 cups chopped onions
1 (18 ounce) bottle hickory smoke-flavored barbecue sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1/2 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle diet pepper-type soda (such as Diet Dr PepperÂ®)
1/4 cup reduced-sodium Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons liquid smoke flavoring
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Cut each pork tenderloin into 4 pieces and place into a slow cooker; set to High.
Stir onions, barbecue sauce, crushed tomatoes, diet soda, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, liquid smoke flavoring, paprika, red pepper flakes, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl; pour mixture over pork tenderloin pieces. Cover and cook until tenderloin pieces begin to shred at the edges, 3 to 4 hours.
Shred meat using 2 forks; reduce slow cooker setting to Low and cook 1 more hour.

Description: 
This makes a massive batch of pulled pork that is great for cook-outs, potlucks, parties for a sizable group, or for lunches and dinners with plenty of extras to freeze and reheat. Substitute any other diet soda; the soda is used as a substitute for brown sugar. Dish can be served by itself or 'sloppy joe' style on hamburger buns.
