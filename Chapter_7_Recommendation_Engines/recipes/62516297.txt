Preheat oven to 375F.
Lightly grease a cookie sheet and spread cubed butternut squash in a single layer. Bake for 20-25 minutes until tender.
Heat up the canola oil and saute the remaining chopped veggies over medium high heat until lightly golden. Turn off the heat and stir in cayenne pepper, curry and butter. Set aside.
Once tender, add the butternut squash into the veggie mix and add the reduced sodium chicken broth.
Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer 20 minutes, or until all vegetables are tender.
