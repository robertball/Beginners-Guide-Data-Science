Ingredients:
2 bunches Mann's BroccoliniÂ®
Sweet-Tart Dressing (recipe below)
4 chicken breasts, boneless, skinned, cut in half
3/4 pound mixed lettuces
2 pears, cored and sliced (may substitute red potatoes)
3/4 cup pecans, toasted, glazed (may substitute walnuts)
2 ounces goat cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Drop Mann's Broccolini into boiling water. After 3 minutes, drain and rinse with cold water to stop additional cooking.
Remove 1/4 cup dressing from jar and toss with chicken breasts. Marinate 1 or 2 hours, if convenient.  Discard marinade when ready to cook. If time is short, you can instead use the 1/4 cup dressing as a basting sauce during cooking.
Grill or broil chicken until done. Slice crosswise. Line 4 plates with lettuces and arrange Broccolini, pear (or potato) and chicken on top. Sprinkle with nuts and goat cheese. Drizzle with dressing.
