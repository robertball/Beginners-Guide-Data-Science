Description: 
After a disappointing canned soup lunch a few weeks ago today I was craving a bowl of potato soup. Depending on how thick you like your potato soup you can adjust the amount of flour, But the measurements below are for a light bechamel sauce. You can add bacon and or cheese to your potato soup if you like your soup a bit hardier.
