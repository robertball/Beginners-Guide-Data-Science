Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups farro
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 head cauliflower, broken into small florets
1 onion, diced
1 carrot, diced
1 celery stalk, diced
salt to taste
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the farro at a boil until tender, about 25 minutes. Drain and set aside.
While the farro cooks, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook the cauliflower and onion in the hot oil until the cauliflower begins to soften and the onion starts to become clear, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir the carrot, celery, and salt into the cauliflower mixture; continue cooking and stirring until the cauliflower is completely tender.
Combine the farro and the cauliflower mixture in a large bowl; stir to mix evenly. Pour the lemon juice over the mixture and stir. Serve immediately.

Description: 
I tried this cauliflower farro side at a cooking booth at my local farmer's market and headed home to reproduce it. It has since become one of my family's favorite side dishes. It's vegan too! For a crunchier taste, use the celery and carrot raw.
