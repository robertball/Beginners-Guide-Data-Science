Ingredients:
1 300 ml can sweetened condensed milk
2 85g packages strawberry or raspberry jell-o powder
1 1/2 cups fine coconut
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
Extra graham cracker crumbs
Whole cloves

Directions:
In a medium bowl combine condensed milk and one package Jello powder.
Gradually stir in coconut and graham crumbs until well blended.
Add as much graham crumbs needed to make a very firm (and very hard to stir) dough.  If necessary use hands to knead the crumbs in.
Form into 1-inch balls.
Pour remaining package of jello powder in a bowl and roll each cookie in it to coat.
Push a clove into each sugar plum to look like a "stem" (be sure not to remove clove if giving these cookies to small children)

Description: 
This is a no-bake christmas cookie that is a must-have in my family during the holidays. Having the clove to suck on at the end is the best part! 
They are delicious and pretty, not to mention simple to make.  Everyone hears about sugar plums at christmas, but nobody knows what they are! Kids LOVE these.
