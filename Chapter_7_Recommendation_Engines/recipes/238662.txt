Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
8 ounces seitan, cut into cubes
8 ounces smoked vegan sausage, cut into 2-inch slices
1/2 large onion, chopped
1/2 large green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
3 stalks celery, chopped
1 cup vegetable broth
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon miso paste
1 1/2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 cup rice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Drizzle the bottom of a 4-quart slow cooker crock with olive oil. Stir tomatoes with juice, seitan, sausage, onion, green bell pepper, celery, vegetable broth, garlic, miso paste, Cajun seasoning, thyme, and oregano into crock.
Cook on Low for 4 hours. Add rice to the crock and cook on High until rice is cooked through, about 30 minutes more. Garnish with parsley.

Description: 
A good meal to freeze and throw in the slow cooker on a busy day. I prefer the rice cooked separately. You can substitute Creole seasoning for the Cajun seasoning and bok choy for the celery, if desired.
