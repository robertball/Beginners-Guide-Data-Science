Ingredients:
PUDDING:
1 cup sugar
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups milk
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 cups day-old white or French bread, torn into small pieces
1 cup raisins
CUSTARD SAUCE:
3 egg yolks
3/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
3 cups milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
For pudding, combine first five ingredients in a large bowl. Add bread and raisins; mix well. Turn into a greased 9-in. x 9-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50 minutes.
Meanwhile, for sauce, combine yolks, sugar and cornstarch in the top of a double boiler. Gradually add milk, stirring until smooth. Cook over boiling water, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and coats a metal spoon. Remove from the heat and stir in vanilla. Serve pudding and sauce warm or chilled.

Description: 
This recipe comes from my grandmother who raised me. Besides looking after my siblings and me, she worked the farm and ran another business on the side. How she did all that, I'll never know! She's a tremendous cook and the goodies from 'Edith's Kitchen' are always welcomed and eagerly devoured - this bread pudding is one of the best!
