Ingredients:
8 red bell peppers
2 tb. extra virgin olive oil
2 tb. butter
1 small onion, finely diced
1 1/2 tsp. minced garlic
1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
1 28-oz. can crushed tomatoes
1 tsp. fresh thyme leaves
1 qt. chicken or vegetable stock
1/2 c. fresh basil leaves
1/2 c. heavy whipping cream
parmesan cheese
croutons

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Place red peppers into a baking dish and roast for 45 minutes until soft and slightly charred.
Let peppers cool, peel off the outer skins and discard stems and seeds (save any liquid that was released during the roasting).
In a stockpot over medium heat, lightly sauté the onion in the olive oil and butter until translucent.
Add the red pepper flakes and the garlic, continue to sauté for 1 more minute.
Add the roasted peppers plus any liquid that was released during the roasting, tomatoes, thyme and stock.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.
Add the basil, then puree the soup with an immersion blender until smooth (can use a regular blender and return to the stockpot).
Stir in the cream.
Serve in bowls garnished with the parmesan cheese and a few croutons.
