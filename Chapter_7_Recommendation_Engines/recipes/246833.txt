Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles
3 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
1 (16 ounce) package small-curd cottage cheese
2 (8 ounce) packages farmers cheese
1/2 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 1/4 cups crushed corn flakes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles; cook, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Beat eggs and sugar together in a bowl until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Add cottage cheese, farmers cheese, sour cream, and melted butter; mix well to combine. Stir in noodles.
Spread noodle mixture in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle corn flakes on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
This is my Gram's recipe for a cheese kugel - hence the name blintz (like cheese blintzes). It is very filling and does not last long at any occasion. You can use low-fat cheeses if you prefer. Serve it with sour cream if you like.
