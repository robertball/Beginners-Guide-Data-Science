Ingredients:
3 Eggs
1 Cup Milk
1 tsp Salt
1 Tbsp Butter, melted
1 Cup + 1 Tbsp Bread flour

Directions:
Whisk eggs, milk, and salt together until well blended;
Then add melted butter and mix until completely incorporated.
With the paddle attachment of a stand mixer, mix in flour until completely smooth.
Strain the batter to catch any clumps to have a smooth appearance (Not totally necessary, but I do to make sure they look smooth)
Grease every other cup of muffin tins and fill cups about half full of batter.
Bake at 425°F for 30–40 minutes. The popovers should look firm and should not be wet. If you remove them too soon, they will collapse.
As soon as you remove them from the oven, remove the popovers from pans immediately.

This was one of the first things I learned how to make in my Breads class during culinary school. They are light and eggy. Great for breakfast!
