Ingredients:
Heart, liver and giblets, chopped fine
1/2 tube of Jimmy Dean sausage
2 1/2 Cups Water o use half water and half Swanson Chicken Broth.
3/4 stick of butter
1 peeled and diced apple
1 medium chopped onion
2 big bags seasoned crouton(I use sage and onion)
4 large pieces of celery, chopped (About 1 1/2 cups)
1 can cream of mushroom soup
Salt & Pepper

Directions:
In a big bring the water and broth just to a boil and then turn down to simmer...then throw in the onion, celery, apple and butter. Fry chopped heart and liver, remove from pan, then fry giblets. Fry the Jimmy dean. Put all of it in the pot with the other stuff, letting it simmer for 20 minutes or 1/2 hour. Add the croutons and stuff the turkey. What won't fit you can put in a a casserole dish and bake 1 hour w/lid on. Just be sure to butter the casserole dish. Only bake that for an hour. I mix that with what I take out of the bird when the turkey is done.
