Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) whole roasting chicken
2 small sprigs fresh rosemary
2 bay leaves
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Dry chicken completely, inside and out, with paper towels.
Gently insert rosemary sprigs and bay leaves under the skin covering the chicken breasts and thighs.
Salt chicken liberally with kosher salt being careful to cover entire surface. Sprinkle with pepper. Cover loosely and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 475 degrees F.
Heat a 12-inch cast iron skillet on stovetop over medium heat.
Wipe chicken dry with paper towels and place in hot skillet breast side up; it will sizzle. After about 15 seconds, put skillet in oven and roast chicken until skin is blistered and brown, about 20 minutes. Turn chicken over and roast another 10 to 20 minutes.
Turn chicken again and roast 5 more minutes to crisp the top.
