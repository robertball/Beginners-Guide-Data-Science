Ingredients:
1 cup raisins
1 cup water
3/4 cup shortening
1 1/2 cups white sugar

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves

Simmer raisins and water over medium heat until raisins are plump, about 15 minutes.  Drain raisins, reserving the liquid.  Add enough water to reserved liquid to measure 1/2 cup.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Mix the shortening, sugar, eggs and vanilla thoroughly.  Stir in reserved liquid.
Blend in the remaining ingredients.
Drop by rounded teaspoons about 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.  Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until light brown.
