Ingredients:
1 cup almond milk
2 spiced chai tea bags
1 1/2 (16 ounce) cans pumpkin puree
3/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon ground flax seeds
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 prepared deep-dish pie shell

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bring almond milk to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove from heat; add chai tea bags. Let tea steep for at least 5 minutes.
Mix pumpkin puree, sugar, ground flax seeds, cinnamon, vegetable oil, and salt together in a large bowl until completely smooth. Pour in chai-flavored almond milk; stir again until smooth. Pour filling into the pie shell.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
I make this nearly every year for Thanksgiving, and it's always a hit. I usually make it dairy-free using almond milk, but it's possible to do with cow's milk as well. Taking a bit of a detour from the traditional pumpkin pie flavor with the added chai spice, this is a great dish for adding an extra bit of spice (pun intended) to your Thanksgiving this year.
