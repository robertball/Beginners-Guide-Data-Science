Ingredients:
1 lb Penne Pasta cooked al dente
1/2 head garlic minced
1 small package sliced baby bella mushrooms
1 head broccoli
1 rotisserie chicken
2 3/4 cups pesto
2 tbs olive oil
Salt
Freshly grated Parmesan cheese
Optional: Sun dried tomatoes and/or kalamata olives

Directions:
Cook the pasta al dente, toss with 1 tbs olive oil and set aside in a large bowl.  Saute the mushrooms over medium low heat with 1 tbs olive oil for 15 minutes.  Add 1/2 head minced garlic and saute for another 2 minutes.  Add garlic and mushrooms to pasta along with 2 3/4 cups pesto.  Mix well.  Cut the white meat from the rotisserie chicken into bite size pieces and add to pasta mixture.  Flash steam the broccoli so that it still retains its bright green color and add to pasta mixture.  Mix well.  Serve with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.   You can also add some chopped sun dried tomato's or kalamata olives to the pasta if you wish.

Description: 
Using a rotisserie chicken cuts down on the prep for this dish.  It is so good; but, we save this for special occasions because it is very high in fat.
