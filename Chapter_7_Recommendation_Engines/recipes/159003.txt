Description: 
No need for a bun with these crispy flakes.  The dogs are rolled in ketchup and mustard, then rolled in cornflake crumbs and baked. This is easy and delicious - kids love them! I grew up with these as my mother was diabetic and needed to cut down on bread (buns) so she made us kids these instead. For something different, try adding some Parmesan cheese to corn flake crumb mixture.
