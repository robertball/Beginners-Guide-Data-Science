Description: 
I first made this salad for my family's Thanksgiving dinner several years ago as a starter, and it was a big hit. This recipe was inspired after I had some pear and walnut salad at a restaurant. Since I'm a busy professional woman and don't have lots of time to cook, I wanted to make something quick and easy, yet tasty, using premade ingredients you can find at regular grocery stores.
