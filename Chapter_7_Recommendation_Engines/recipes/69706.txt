Description: 
When you awake in the morning after a few too many you may very well need to have a Ramos Fizz to get you back on your feet. Henrico C. Ramos created the Ramos Fizz in 1888 at the Imperial Cabinet Saloon in New Orleans, Louisiana. This wonderful pick me up combines all the ingredients to get you up and running again. A little hair of the dog in the form of the gin, protein from the egg white, and cream to coat the stomach.
