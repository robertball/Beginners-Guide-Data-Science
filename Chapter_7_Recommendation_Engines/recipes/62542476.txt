Ingredients:
4 green bell peppers

1 pound ground beef
2 Tsp  dried minced onion
salt and pepper to taste
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Cut the tops off  the peppers, and remove the seeds, and wash. Sprinkle salt inside each pepper, and set aside.
In a large skillet, saute beef and dried minced onion and seasonings to preferred taste, for 5 minutes, or until beef is browned. Drain off excess fat, and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the tomatoes, rice, 1/2 cup water and Worcestershire sauce. Cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until rice is tender. Remove from heat, and stir in the amount of cheese you prefer.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. (175 degrees C). Stuff each pepper with the beef and rice mixture. In a medium bowl, combine tomato soup with just enough water to make the soup a gravy consistency. Pour some of the tomato gravy int he bottom of the baking dish, and place the peppers in the baking dish. Pour the rest of the tomato gravy over the peppers. sprinkle a little cheese on the top of the peppers, and cover with aluminum foil.
Bake covered for 25 to 35 minutes, until heated through and cheese is melted and bubbly.
