Ingredients:
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup canned pumpkin
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp table salt
1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
¼ teaspoon baking soda
1 cup coarsely chopped semisweet chocolate (6 oz.), divided
1 cup toffee pieces, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F. Coat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet (or cake pan) with nonstick spray. Using an electric mixer, beat butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and vanilla in a medium bowl on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Beat in pumpkin until evenly incorporated.
Whisk together flour, salt, pumpkin pie spice, and baking soda in a bowl; add to butter mixture and beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute. Beat in 3/4 cup each of the chocolate and toffee pieces.
Spread batter in prepared skillet and smooth top with spatula. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup each chocolate and toffee over top. Bake until set in the middle and browned around the edge, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in pan 20 minutes.
Cut cookie into 8 wedges, and serve warm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream.
