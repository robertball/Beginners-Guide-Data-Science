Ingredients:
1 cup raw cashews
1 cup water, or more as needed
3/4 cup shredded vegan cheese
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1/2 cup frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained

Directions:
Soak cashews in water for 1 to 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) once cashews are almost done soaking. Lightly grease a small baking dish.
Drain cashews. Place in a blender; puree with water until creamy. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons more water if needed.
Mix the cashew cream with vegan cheese, garlic, basil, garlic salt, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Gently stir in artichoke hearts and spinach. Transfer dip to the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring once halfway through, until hot, about 25 minutes.
