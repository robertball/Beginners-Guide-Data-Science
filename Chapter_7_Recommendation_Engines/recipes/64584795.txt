Ingredients:
1 large peach, cut in half, stone removed, skin on
Â¼ cup sugar
5 mint leaves
2 ounces simple syrup
1/2 lemon
3 ounces bourbon, such as Bulleit
ice
ginger ale

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium high heat and when grill is hot, close lid and heat for 5 minutes.
Place peach halves and lemon in sugar to coat cut sides, then on grill to char until soft, about 5 minutes. Cool on cutting board for 1 minute then add to shaker along with mint leaves and simple syrup. Juice lemon into shaker.
Gently muddle the contents of the shaker, then add the bourbon and ice. (Shaker may be very full). Shake vigorously until chilled. The muddled peach will clog your shaker, so pour through a fine mesh strainer into two ice-filled double rocks glasses (or for more rustic drinks, pour the contents of the shaker directly into glasses. Top off with ginger ale and garnish with grilled lemon and peach slices.
