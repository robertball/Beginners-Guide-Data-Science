Description: 
This Spanish style fish stew from the Basque Region of Spain is a traditional peasant dish popular in all Spanish-speaking countries (where each has given it their special twist). For example, in Mexico it is usually made for Christmas, New Year's Eve and Lent; in Puerto Rico it is a year-round favorite but most enjoyed during Lent. This is one of the Puertorrican versions.
