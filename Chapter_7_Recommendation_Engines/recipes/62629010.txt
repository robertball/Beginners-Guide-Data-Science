Ingredients:
4 onions, chopped
oil or bacon fat for saute

2 tbsps tomato paste
2 tbsps Better than Boullion beef base

Directions:
In a Dutch oven cook onions in 1 tbsp of oil over medium heat until clear and soft.
Stir in paprika and minced garlic, cook while stirring for 1 minute.
Add meat, stir to coat the meat in the onion mixture, add water to cover, add tomato paste, beef base, bay leaf and pepper.
Place covered Dutch oven in a 250 degree oven, cook for 90 minutes, stir, add more water if needed, allow to cook for 1 more hour, add sliced mushrooms and cook for an additional 30 minutes.
Remove from oven, whisk in instant dissolving flour until thickened.
Serve over egg noodles, garnish with a dollop of sour cream and snipped fresh dill over top.
I usually serve sour cream cucumber salad on the side.
