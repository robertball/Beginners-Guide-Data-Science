2 lbs of ground turkey breast
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion
3 cloves freshly chopped garlic

2 eggs
½ cup fresh Parmesan cheese
Breadcrumbs (2-4 tablespoon)
Salt and pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400*F
In a non-stick pan over medium/high heat sauté the onion and garlic till translucent. Then let stand to cool.
Mix all ingredients (except breadcrumbs) in a large mixing bowl with hands including the onions and garlic.
Add breadcrumbs gradually till mixture can be worked into shaping balls, but do not dry out mixture.
Shape into 2-inch balls and space evenly on a non-stick cookie sheet/baking pan.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, until browned on the outside & cooked through.
Do not over cook or you will have some dry meatballs.
Add to your favorite sauce and serve with spaghetti.
