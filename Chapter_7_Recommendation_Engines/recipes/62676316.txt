Ingredients:
2 tablespoons+ apple sauce
1/2 cup butter (whipped)
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 (1 pound) loaf French bread, sliced
5 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine the apple sauce, butter, and brown sugar in a small saucepan and simmer until the sugar has melted.  Pour this mixture over the bottom of a 9x13 inch casserole dish. I like to line my pans with foil.
Place the  bread slices over the sugar-butter mixture in the dish.  In a bowl, beat together the eggs, milk, vanilla, and salt; pour this mixture over the bread.  Cover the dish and let it stand in the refrigerator overnight.
The next morning, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Uncover the pan and bake for 45 minutes.  Serve while hot or warm or the French toast will harden in the pan. It can be reheated.

Description: 
Make this the night before and enjoy brunch with your kids rather than catering to them!  Also great for taking places because the syrup is built-in.Modified from: Overnight French Toast II
