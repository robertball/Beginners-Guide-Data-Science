Ingredients:
3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken meat
1 onion, chopped
6 cups chicken stock
1/4 cup long-grain white rice
3/4 cup tomato - peeled, seeded and chopped
1/2 cup chopped carrots
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
3/4 cup diced ham
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
To a large saucepan, add the chicken, onion, and chicken stock.  Bring to a simmer, and cover.  Cook over low heat until the chicken is tender, about 45 minutes.  Lift the chicken out onto a platter, and set aside.  Strain the stock through a sieve set over a bowl.  Discard the solids, and skim off as much fat as possible from stock.
Rinse out the saucepan, and return the stock to it.  Add the rice, tomatoes and carrots to the stock. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.  Bring to a simmer.  Cook until the rice is tender, about 25 minutes.
When the chicken is cool enough to handle, cut it into strips about 1/2 X 1 1/2 inches.  Return the chicken to the soup with the ham, and cook just long enough to heat through.  Add the parsley, and serve.
