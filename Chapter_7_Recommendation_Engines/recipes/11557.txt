Ingredients:
2 teaspoons instant coffee granules
2 tablespoons coffee-flavored liqueur
1 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). In a small bowl, dissolve instant coffee crystals into the coffee liqueur; set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar. Gradually add eggs and coffee mixture while mixing. Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, stir in the chocolate chips.
Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls onto a cookie sheet. Cookies should be at least 2 inches apart. Bake for 23 to 25 minutes. Immediately transfer cookies to cooling rack after baking. These keep well at room temperature or refrigerated.
