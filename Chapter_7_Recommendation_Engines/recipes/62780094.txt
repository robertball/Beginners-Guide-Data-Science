Ingredients:
1-1/4  cups  all-purpose flour
2  tsp.  baking powder
1/4  tsp.  salt
1/4  cup  chocolate-hazelnut spread (NutellaÂ®)
1    egg
1  Tbs.  sugar
1-1/4  cups  milk
Canola oil

Directions:
In a medium bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside. In another bowl whisk together the chocolate-hazelnut spread, egg, and sugar until combined. Whisk in milk until combined. Add milk mixture to flour mixture and whisk until nearly smooth (it's ok if there are a few lumps).
Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with oil. Pour about 1/4 cup of the batter into the skillet or onto the griddle. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn when edges look dry and bubbles appear across the surface. Cook 1 to 2 minutes more or until browned on the bottom.
Serve with Raspberry Sauce. Makes about 10 pancakes.
Raspberry Sauce: Place 1 12-ounce package frozen raspberries and 2 tablespoons sugar in a medium saucepan, breaking up berries with a wooden spoon. Cook over medium heat until bubbly. In a small bowl stir together 1/4 cup cold water and 1 tablespoon cornstarch until combined. Add to berry mixture. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 2 minutes more. Serve warm with pancakes. Makes about 1 3/4 cups.
