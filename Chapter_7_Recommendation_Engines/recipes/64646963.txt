Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
4 garlic cloves, chopped
3 small eggplants, cut into circles
1 (28-ounce) can Italian plum tomatoes
2 sprigs fresh basil, plus leaves for garnish
1 sprig fresh thyme
1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons sea salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 pound pasta (spaghetti or macaroni)
Freshly grated parmesan cheese
Fresh basil leaves, garnish
Chili flakes, to taste (optional)
Fresh parmesan cheese for serving

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.
In a large sauté pan, heat the olive oil until smoking. Add the garlic and then eggplant and cook stirring regularly, until softened and lightly browned, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, basil, and thyme, and bring to a boil. Simmer for 15 minutes, and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.
Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain well and pour the hot pasta into the pan with the eggplant mixture.
Garnish with basil leaves and chili flakes. Drizzle with olive oil and top with fresh parmesan cheese then serve.
