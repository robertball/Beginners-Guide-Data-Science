Ingredients:
3 thick-cut pork steaks
3/4 cup Italian breadcrumbs
1/2 cup flour
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs beaten
2 gallon sided Ziploc bags

Directions:
Make mushroom sauce (see my recipe for mushroom sauce)
In one bag, mix together the bread crumbs and flour.
Place the 2 beaten eggs in the other bag.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Put pork steaks in bag with egg mixture and toss. Next, pull one pork steak out of the egg mixture at a time and put it in the bag with the bread crumb mixture. Coat the pork steak well with the bread crumb mixture then place in skillet with hot oil. Pull the next pork steak out of the egg mixture and into the breadcrumb mixture, then place in skillet. Repeat with the last 2 pork steaks.
Fry steaks in the hot oil until browned on both sides and cooked through, about 8 minutes per side.
Remove the pork to serving plates and top with  mushroom sauce (see my recipe for German mushroom sauce)
Meal cost: $5.50 ($1.83 per person)
