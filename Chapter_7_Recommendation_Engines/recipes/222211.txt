Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 (16 ounce) can spicy fat-free refried beans
1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion becomes translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.
Cook and stir refried beans into onion mixture until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir cream cheese into bean mixture. Spread mixture into a pie plate; top with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 20 minutes.
