Description: 
What could be better than chicken and Provolone cheese in a wine sauce? This is great for large dinner parties, church dinners, etc. I've also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and it turns out great every time! Increase or decrease the wine to taste, using 1/4 - 1/2 soup can of wine per can of soup.
