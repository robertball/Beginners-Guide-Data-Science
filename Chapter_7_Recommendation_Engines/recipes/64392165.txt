Ingredients:
6-8 Chicken Thighs
1/4 C Olive Oil
1/2 stick butter or margarine
salt and pepper to taste
15-20 cloves garlic
1/4 C sherry or cooking wine
3-4 C beef or chicken broth
2-3 Tbs flour (Wondra is best for sauces)
3 tsp thyme
dash of dried oregano (optional)
4-6 potatoes, cut into 1/2" cubes
1 package fresh mushrooms, sliced

Directions:
In a large pot or dutch oven on the stove, heat the olive oil and butter/margarine over medium high heat.  Salt and pepper the chicken thighs and cook, skin side down, for 6-7 minutes or until skin is crispy.  Turn over and cook another 5 minutes.  Do not worry about chicken being done, because the cooking isn't over!  Transfer chicken to plate in batches until all are cooked.  When chicken is removed, lower heat.  Add one cup broth and wine, be careful it will sizzle!  Scrape pan with wooden spoon to remove all chicken pieces.  Bring to a simmer, and add remaining broth and flour.  Stir or whisk until thickened slightly.  return chicken to the pan, add potatoes, thyme, garlic powder, and mushrooms and cover and simmer slowly for 30-40 minutes.  Do not fuss, a bit more or less, as long as the chicken is cooked through is fine.  More time over a slow simmer will only add to the flavor!
