Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Melt the butter or margarine in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, bay leaves, onion and green bell pepper and saute for about 5 minutes. Add the meat and saute until slightly browned on all sides.
Transfer mixture to a 2 quart casserole dish and pour the tomatoes over the mixture.

Description: 
This is a wonderfully simple dish that I have modified a bit to suit my family's tastes, and I think it's fantastic! Make sure you have a loaf of fresh bread with this to soak up the sauce! Serve over brown rice or noodles.
