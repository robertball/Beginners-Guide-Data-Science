Ingredients:
1 can (8 oz) refrigerated crescent dinner rolls
1/2 tsp dried oregano leaves
1/2 tsp adobo seasoning
1/4 tsp seasoned salt
4 eggs
1 can (14.5 oz)  fire roasted tomatoes, undrained
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, peeled
4 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro
1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained, rinsed
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
Avocado slices, if desired

Directions:
Heat oven to 375Â°F. Spray  cookie sheet with cooking spray. Separate dough into 4 rectangles on cookie sheet. Firmly press perforations to seal. For each rectangle, roll edges toward center and form a 3 1/2-inch diameter round with a 1/2-inch rim. Press rim firmly to seal.
In small bowl, mix oregano leaves, 1/4 teaspoon of the adobo seasoning and the salt. Sprinkle over dough rounds. Break 1 egg in center of each dough round. (Egg may run over slightly.)
Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until egg whites are form and yolks are runny.
Meanwhile, in blender, place tomatoes, onion, garlic, 2 tablespoons of the cilantro and remaining 1/4 teaspoon chipotle chili powder. Cover; blend until smooth. In 2-quart saucepan, heat tomato mixture over medium-high heat 4 to 5 minutes or until hot.
Remove and reserve 3/4 cup mixture from saucepan; cover to keep warm. Add beans to remaining mixture in saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat 5 minutes, stirring frequently, mashing beans slightly with back of wooden spoon until slightly thickened.
For each serving, place about 1/3 cup bean mixture on plate with egg tart. Serve with reserved sauce, cheese, avocado slices and remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro.
