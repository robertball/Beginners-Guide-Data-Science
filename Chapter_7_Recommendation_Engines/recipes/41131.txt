Ingredients:
14 pitted prunes
1/3 cup water
1 cup self-rising flour
1/4 cup honey

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 mini muffin pans, or line with paper liners.
In a food processor, combine the prunes and water. Process for a moment to chop the prunes. Add the flour to the food processor, and mix until it reaches a bread crumb consistency, about 10 seconds. Pour in the honey, and mix until just blended. Spoon the gooey mixture into the prepared muffin cups. One teaspoon per muffin ensures easy removal.
Bake for 20 to 22 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops spring back when lightly touched. Serve alone or with warmed honey or maple syrup.
