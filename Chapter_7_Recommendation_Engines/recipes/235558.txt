1 tablespoon flax seed meal
1 tablespoon almond butter
1 teaspoon honey, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Description: 
The flaxseed meal in this shake is reminiscent of graham crackers, and with the fruit and coconut milk, it really tastes a bit like pie. Hence the name was born. The shake is loaded with healthy fats and fiber to keep you full and energized right through to lunch.
