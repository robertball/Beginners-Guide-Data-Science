Ingredients:
2 pieces of Mahi Mahi or other white fish (grilled shrimp is good too)
preferred fish seasoning (Cavender's is good)
1 stick of (real) salted butter.
1 Tbsp. Lemon juice
1 Garlic clove
Louisiana hot sauce
olive oil or olive oil spray
2 cups cooked rice
1 roma tomato
1 green onion

Directions:
Bake fish with a little olive oil and preferred fish seasoning (I use Cavender's greek seasoning mostly)  @ 450 degrees for about 20 min. please check on fish not to over cook.
In a saucepan melt the butter.
mince the clove of garlic and add it to the saucepan.
Add the lemon juice and a few shakes of the Louisiana hot sauce to taste.
Simmer a few minutes and serve over baked fish and rice.
Steamed vegetables go great with this dish.
(If you enjoy a little extra flavor and color: chop or cube the tomato only using the "meat" of it and chop some green onion placing it in the saucepan at the end of simmering the sauce.)
