Description: 
I came up with this healthy variation of french toast sticks after I couldnt find anything at the grocery store.  Use a good whole grain bread, preferebly from a baker. These are perfect for toddlers.  I like to make these up in large batches and freeze them, then I just reheat in the toaster oven or microwave.
