Description: 
This quick and easy recipe is a great alternative to regular old grilled or fried chicken. The lemon and honey are wonderfully complemented by the earthy mustard and herb scents. Try using a combination of lemon and lime for extra citrus zing. If preferred, use thighs only with bone-in or deboned.
