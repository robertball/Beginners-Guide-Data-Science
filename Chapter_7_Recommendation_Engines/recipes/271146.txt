Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup ground almonds
1/3 cup butter, melted
Blueberry Filling:
2 cups fresh blueberries
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
3/4 cup water
Cheesecake Filling:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
4 cups vanilla ice cream

Directions:
Combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and almonds in a bowl. Pour in butter and mix until incorporated.
Grease a 10-inch springform pan and press crumb mixture over the bottom to make a crust.
Combine blueberries and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat; simmer for 5 minutes. Stir cornstarch into water until dissolved. Pour into the blueberry mixture and cook until thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in ice cream, 1 spoonful at a time, until blended.
Spoon 3/4 of the cream cheese mixture over the crust. Cover with the blueberry filling. Spoon remaining cream cheese mixture on top. Run a fork through the cheesecake to create swirls.
Freeze, uncovered, until firm, about 2 hours. Cover with plastic wrap and keep frozen.
