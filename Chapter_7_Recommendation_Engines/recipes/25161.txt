Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh mushrooms
1 1/2 ounces fresh ginger root
1 lemon peel, cut into strips
1 onion, thinly sliced
4 cups white wine vinegar
3 teaspoons sea salt
1 teaspoon black peppercorns

Directions:
Wipe the mushrooms with a damp cloth to clean them, and trim the stalks so that they are even with the caps.  Place mushrooms in a medium saucepan.
Peel the ginger and cut into quarters.  Add to the mushrooms, along with the lemon zest, onion, vinegar, salt and peppercorns.  Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until mushrooms are tender.
Remove the mushrooms from the cooking liquid with a slotted spoon and pack into sterilized jars.  Strain the cooking liquid and bring it back to a boil.  Pour hot liquid over the mushrooms until the level of the liquid is 1/2 inch above the mushrooms.  Seal the jars and store in the refrigerator.

Description: 
Mushrooms make a great pickle, but they don't keep as long as many other vegetables.
