Ingredients:
4 medium ripe tomatoes, seeded and finely diced
1 tsp. salt
2 Tbsp. thinly sliced green onions
2 Tbsp. thinly sliced fresh basil leaves
1 Tbsp. olive oil
4 2&1/2 oz. fresh salmon filets
vegetable oil
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 500.
Combine the diced tomatoes and salt.
Place in a strainer and allow to drain for half an hour.
Place the drained tomatoes in a bowl and stir in the green onions, basil and olive oil.
Place the pizza stone in the oven for 20 minutes to heat it up.
Brush the salmon on both sides lightly with vegetable oil and season to taste.
Place the salmon, sking side down, on the cooking stone.
It should make a sizzling sound when it hits the surface; if it doesn't, wait a bit longer for the stone to heat up some more.
Cook the salmon for 3-5 minutes, (longer if the salmon is thick, but be careful not to overcook it) then spoon the tomato and basil relish evenly on top of each piece of fish.
Let the salmon cook for another minute; it's done when it is firm to the touch but still has a bit of give.
Drizzle a touch of olive oil over the top and garnish with a few fresh basil leaves and slices of lemon if desired.

Description: 
This is a fast, easy and healthy way to serve salmon. You can use a regular baking sheet for this recipe, but I find it works better with the pizza (cooking) stone.
