Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup shredded coconut
6 teaspoons baking powder
1 pinch salt
1 1/8 cups unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 1/4 cups white sugar
4 teaspoons vanilla sugar
6 eggs
2 1/4 cups finely grated zucchini, excess moisture squeezed out
2 1/4 cups finely grated carrots, excess moisture squeezed out
4 tablespoons milk, or more as needed
1 large orange, juiced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large, rimmed baking sheet with butter.
Combine flour, coconut, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.
Combine butter, sugar, and vanilla sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until very smooth and creamy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, and beating well after each addition. Fold in zucchini and carrots.
Stir in flour mixture alternately with milk until batter is well combined. Spread onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Pour orange juice over warm cake immediately after removing from the oven, so it can soak up the liquid.

Description: 
This sheet pan cake with zucchini, carrots, and coconut is incredibly moist since it is soaked with freshly squeezed orange juice right after baking. Make sure you squeeze out most of the liquid of the vegetables, otherwise the cake will get too moist.
