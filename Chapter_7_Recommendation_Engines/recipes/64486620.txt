Ingredients:
2 onions, finely diced
12 rashers smoky bacon, finely diced
3 cloves garlic diced
30g butter
1/2 cup bourbon

Directions:
In a frying pan over moderate heat add the diced bacon and saute gently for 10 minutes. You don't want the bacon to go crisp so turn down if cooking too quick.
Add the butter, onion and garlic, continue to saute for 20 minutes on a low heat, stir every 5 minutes making sure it doesn't stick.
Add the bourbon and continue to simmer until the liquid has evaporated and the bacon and onion mixture is moist but not wet; about 15 minutes.

Description: 
I have seen this served as both a bacon chutney and a bacon jam but really it is neither. Having said that, any true bacon fan MUST try this recipe! Serve on top of steak, in burgers or eat with a spoon as a decadent treat.
