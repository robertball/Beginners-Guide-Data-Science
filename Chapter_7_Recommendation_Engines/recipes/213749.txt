Ingredients:
1 cup hoisin sauce
1/3 cup white wine
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup tomato paste
1/4 cup chopped garlic
2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or to taste
2 pounds baby back ribs, cut into 1-inch riblets

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine the hoisin sauce, white wine, soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, garlic, and hot sauce in large bowl; mix well.
Place the riblets in a large roasting pan and bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, for 45 minutes.  Pour sauce over riblets and toss to coat. Return the pan to the oven; bake, stirring often, until ribs are tender and sauce has thickened, about 45 minutes.
