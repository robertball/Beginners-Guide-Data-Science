Ingredients:
4 boneless pork chops, about 3/4" thick
1 lbs fresh green beans, rinsed, ends removed
2 large tomatoes, diced (about 2 1/2 cups)
1 onion, thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp salt, or to taste
1/2 tsp black pepper, or to taste
1-2 tbsps vegetable oil

Directions:
1. Mix together cinnamon, cumin, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle over both sides of the pork chops.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add pork chops, and brown on each side, about 3-4 minutes per side. Removed pork chops from pan.
3. Add onion to pan. Cook until onions are translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for another 30-60 seconds. Mix in green beans, and cook an additional 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add in tomatoes and chicken broth, and allow mixture to come to a simmer. Put pork chops back into the pan, cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until pork chops are no longer pink in the center, or they have reached an internal temperature of 145 degrees (F), about 15-20 minutes. Adjust salt and pepper to taste before serving.
Note: You can use a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh ones, if preferred.
