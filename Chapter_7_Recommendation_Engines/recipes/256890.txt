Ingredients:
Spice Rub:
1/2 teaspoon whole fennel seeds
3 cloves garlic, sliced
1 tablespoon finely sliced sage leaves
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons chopped rosemary
1 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 lemon, zested
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (1 1/2 pound) boneless pork tenderloin
8 strips bacon

Directions:
Crush fennel seeds in mortar with a pestle for 1 minute. Add garlic, sage, pepper, rosemary, salt, red pepper flakes, and lemon zest; pound into a thick paste, 2 or 3 minutes. Add olive oil and pound until rub is evenly incorporated.

Cut a slit 3/4 of the way through the center of the tenderloin, leaving 1 inch on each end uncut. Spread 1 tablespoon of the rub inside the slit; close up roast. Spread the remaining rub evenly over the roast. Wrap bacon strips around the roast, trying to keep seams on the bottom.

Wrap roast in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil; place roast in the center.

Roast in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 134 degrees F (57 degrees C), about 25 minutes. Let roast rest for 10 minutes and internal temperature rise to 140 to 145 degrees F (60 to 63 degrees C).
