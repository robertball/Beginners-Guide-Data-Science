Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) cans pineapple slices, drained
2 lemons, juiced
4 tablespoons white sugar, divided, or more to taste
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
3 tablespoons fresh mint leaves
1 (7 ounce) container Greek yogurt

Directions:
Place pineapple slices in a shallow bowl. Combine lemon juice, 2 tablespoons sugar, and ginger in a cup and pour over pineapple. Cover and marinate for 2 hours.
Combine remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and mint leaves in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until finely chopped. Drain marinated pineapple well, reserving marinade.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill pineapple until soft and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Stir 3 to 4 tablespoons of the marinade into the Greek yogurt and sweeten with extra sugar if desired. Sprinkle grilled pineapple with mint sugar and serve with yogurt.
