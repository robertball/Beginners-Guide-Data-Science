Description: 
Vegan, gluten-free, and paleo-friendly veggie burger patties with a nutty taste. 

I came up with this recipe when I had a hard time finding any recipes for veggie burgers or patties that were grain-free and bean-free, and which actually contained vegetables. Both my husband and I love it. He had his on a burger bun with lettuce, avocado, and tomato.
