Ingredients:
3 cups cooked white rice
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups skim milk
2 teaspoons chicken base
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 cups frozen broccoli florets
2 cups cooked, shredded chicken breast meat
12 ounces processed cheese food (eg. Velveeta), cubed
2 cups low fat sour cream
2 sleeve of crushed buttery round crackers

Directions:
Spread cooked rice in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle chicken and broccoli evenly over rice; set aside.
In a large saucepan or skillet, melt butter or margarine and stir in flour until smooth. Gradually add milk, bouillon, seasoned salt, garlic powder and pepper.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Stir all together and bring to a boil. Let simmer and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened and bubbly. Reduce heat; add cheese and sour cream. Stir until cheese is melted. Mix all together and pour over rice.
Sprinkle crumb mixture over casserole. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until heated through.  Be careful not to let the crumb topping burn.
