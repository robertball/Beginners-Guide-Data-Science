Ingredients:
Cream Cheese Frosting...Cream Cheese Frosting:........ 1 - 8 ounce cream cheese, room temperature........... 1 - 8 ounce tub of Mascarpone cheese, room temperature........ 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract....... 1 cup confectioners' sugar, sifted...... 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream.......In the bowl of your electric mixer, or with a hand mixer, beat the cream cheese and mascarpone cheese until smooth. Add the vanilla and confectioners sugar and beat until smooth. Using the whisk attachment, gradually add the heavy cream and whip until the frosting is thick enough to spread. Add more sugar or cream as needed to get the right consistency. .....***The recipe as written is not sweet enough for my taste.... so I added another 2/3 cup powdered sugar and it was outstanding.
