Ingredients:
1 cup grated Asiago cheese
1 teaspoon pressed garlic
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 French baguette, thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat the broiler.
In a mixing bowl, combine the Asiago, garlic, mayonnaise, oregano, thyme, parsley, salt and pepper. If the mixture does not hold together well, add more mayonnaise, if desired.
On a baking sheet, arrange the baguette slices in a single layer. Spread the Asiago mixture on the slices. Broil for 3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and lightly browned. Serve immediately.
