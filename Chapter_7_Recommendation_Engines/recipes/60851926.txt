2 TBS uncooked rice prepared as directed on box
1 tsp lemon juice
4 cashews, whole
1 TBS dried cranberries
3 oz chicken breast, boneless and skinless
1 cup of asparagus
1 serving of cooking spray

Directions:
Rinse and pat dry chicken and asparagus. Cut both into bite sized pieces; and chop cashews.
Spray a non-stick skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat: add chicken and saute until no longer pink inside - about 5-6 minutes. Remove from pan and reserve.
Spray the skillet again with cooking spray; and asparagus and saute until just tender, about 3-4 minutes. Add cooked rice, chicken, cashews, lemon juice and cranberries and heat through, about 2-3 minutes, stirring to mix well.
