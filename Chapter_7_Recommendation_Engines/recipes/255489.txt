Description: 
I needed a way to jazz up some spaghetti squash when I was running out of marinara sauce and just started pulling stuff out of the fridge. It came out great. The amounts are approximate and you can adjust to suit your own style/taste. Garlic and olives would probably be great in this too, even capers. What the heck, throw it all in.
