Ingredients:
2 ears fresh corn in the husk
1/4 cup finely chopped green pepper
3 tablespoons chopped hot green chile peppers
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut off about 1/2 inch of the corn stalk using a large, sharp knife. Do not shuck the corn.
Fill a large bowl with cold water and ice.
Microwave corn on high, about 2 minutes per ear. Carefully peel off husks and silk. Plunge corn into the ice water. Remove corn from water and pat dry.
Stand corn upright and slice off kernels, turning the ear as you go. Transfer kernels to a bowl; add green pepper, green chile peppers, vinegar, sugar, cumin, and pepper. Chill until serving.
