Ingredients:
Day old bread cut into cubes (enough to fill standard cookie sheet).
1 stick of butter (melted).
1/2 T basil
1/2 T Oregano
1/2 T parsley
1 t seasoned salt
1/2 t pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place cubes of bread onto cookie sheet. Sprinkle all seasoning (basil/oregano/parsley/pepper/salt) over the cubes. Pour melted butter over bread crumbs and bake for approx. 15 minutes until crumbs are golden brown and crispy (you may want to mix the bread crumbs after 7-8 minutes for more even cooking). Let cool then place in food processor and blend until fine crumbs appear. Seal in air-tight container and keep in refrigerator or freezer.
