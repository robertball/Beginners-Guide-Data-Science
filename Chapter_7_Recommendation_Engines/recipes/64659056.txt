Ingredients:
6 cups cubed pretzel rolls
2 cups milk
1/2 cup sugar
1/3 cup sweetened coconut - Pulsed 30 seconds in a food processor
1/4 cup room temperature butter
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup raisins
1/4 cup toasted / chopped pecans or walnuts
3 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees, position center rack.
Gently over medium low heat, warm milk, with sugar, coconut, butter, salt, extracts, and raisins.  Stir just until sugar is dissolved, remove from heat.
In a large bowl, beat eggs, add warm milk mixture, nuts and bread cubes.  Stir well to coat evenly.  Let stand, at least 10 minutes.
Use butter or cooking spray to prepare  a medium sized baking dish.  Set it inside a larger baking dish, add hot water "bath" to surround the bread pudding,  approximately 1/2 - 1 inch up the side.
Carefully place into preheated oven on center rack until golden brown and a knife inserted off center comes out clean.
Let cool 10 minutes before serving.   Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
So satisfying you don't need a sauce!  I love the way the pretzel roll crusty bits come out a little crispy on top.  It's an excellent contrast to the creamy bread pudding beneath.  Of course you can use just about any type of bread you have on hand.  But, check out out the day-old rack at the grocery store  (usually in or near the bakery) next time you go.  French bread torn in pieces will work great for this too!
