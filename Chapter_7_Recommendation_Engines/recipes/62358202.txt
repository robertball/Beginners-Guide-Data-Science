Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 recipe "Chicken Seasoning Blend" from allrecipes.com
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 lemon
1 Tbsp. unsalted butter
8 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 tsp. all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
Sprinkle seasoning evenly over chicken breasts on both sides.  Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Place chicken in skillet and cook until browned.  Flip and continue cooking until other side is browned.
Grease a 13"x9" baking pan and place browned chicken breasts in pan.  Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon over all. Slice the rest of the lemon and place a lemon slice on top of each chicken piece. Cover tightly and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes until chicken is done and no longer pink.
In the same skillet, melt the 1 Tbsp. butter. Add the sliced mushrooms. Cook and stir until the mushrooms are brown and have exuded their juices, about 6 minutes. Sprinkle with the flour and blend. Add the chicken broth and wine, stirring to make a medium thick sauce. Allow to reduce, adjusting with a little more broth to make a creamy sauce. Spoon the sauce over the lemon baked chicken breasts. Delicious!
