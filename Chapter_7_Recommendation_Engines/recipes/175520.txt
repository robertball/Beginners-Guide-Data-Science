Ingredients:
2 cups water
2 1/2 cups white flour
1/2 cup salt
1 tablespoon cream of tartar
2 (0.13 ounce) packages unsweetened, fruit-flavored soft drink mix (such as KOOL-AIDÂ®)
3 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Bring the water to a boil in a sauce pan; remove from heat and set aside.
Whisk together the flour, salt, cream of tartar, and soft drink mix in a large bowl; stir the vegetable oil into the flour mixture using a spoon, not a whisk. Pour the hot water into the bowl and continue stirring. When the dough is cool enough to handle, turn it onto a lightly-floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Store unused portions in refrigerator.
