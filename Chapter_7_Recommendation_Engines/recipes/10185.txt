Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup molasses
1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons corn oil
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Melt butter or margarine over low heat until the butter turns light brown.  Add molasses, brown sugar and oil, stirring to melt the sugar. Transfer to a mixing bowl and let cool for 5 minutes.
Add cinnamon, ginger, cloves, allspice and baking soda.  Mix well.  Add flour, 1/2 cup at a time, and beat until just blended.
Put the dough onto a large sheet of plastic wrap; flatten it into a disk and wrap it up. Let dough rest at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours before rolling. NOTE:  Dough can be made up to three days in advance and stored in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before rolling.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).  Lightly grease cookie sheets.
Divide dough in half and rewrap the unused portion.  Roll out the dough on a floured surface as thin as possible, less than 1/16 inch.  Cut out cookies with a small 2-inch cutter and place them about 1/4 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake one sheet at a time for 8 to 10 minutes or until the cookies are crisp and just beginning to brown on the edges. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.  Repeat with remaining dough.  Store the cookies in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks.
