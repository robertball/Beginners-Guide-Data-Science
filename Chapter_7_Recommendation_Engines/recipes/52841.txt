Ingredients:
4 large eggs
1 cup milk
3/4 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon anise extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons butter, divided
Sugar, for dusting

Directions:
Beat together the eggs, milk, orange juice, anise, and flour until smooth.  Refrigerate overnight.
To cook the crepes, melt a little butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat; brush the butter evenly over the pan. Pour in 1/4 cup of the batter, tilt the pan to distribute the batter evenly.  Cook until the batter begins to firm up and bubble, when lightly browned, flip over, and continue cooking until browned on the other side, about 4 minutes total. Repeat with remaining batter. To serve, sprinkle crepes with sugar.
