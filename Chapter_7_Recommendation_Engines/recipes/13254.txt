Description: 
This is a  Polish way of making chicken stock.  It is very rich because of the stewing hen.  A stewing hen is an older chicken, therefore it is much richer tasting than fryers, roasters, etc.  It is a clear, rich broth that I fed to my children.  They still ask for it when they are feeling sick.  It is truly the Polish cure for anything when you're feeling down and out.  You can also use this clarified soup as a base for chicken noodle soup.
