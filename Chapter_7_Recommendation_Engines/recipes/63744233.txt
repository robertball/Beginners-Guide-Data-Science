Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts
1 cup white rice
1/2 cup frozen mixed vegetables
1 and 1/2 tablespoons white vinegar

1/3 cup honey
2 tablespoons Asian or Chinese 5 Spice Powder
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a sauce pot, melt butter on low heat.
Add honey to melted butter and stir until mixed.
Remove honey and butter mixture from heat and add the Asian (sometimes called Chinese) 5 Spice powder.
In a baking dish, add chicken breasts.
Pour the sauce over the chicken breasts and make sure they are completely coated.
Bake chicken breasts for appoximately 50 minutes.
While chicken bakes, add rice to a rice cooker.
Optional:  For best results, rinse rice until the water is almost clear (instead of cloudy).
Add 1/2 cup of frozen vegetables to the rice.
Add 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of white vinegar (or rice vinegar) to the rice.
Optional: Add salt and pepper to taste.
Add 2 cups of water to the rice and start the rice cooker.

Description: 
The sauce has a subtle sweetness dotted with pepper notes - reminiscent of a Thai sweet chili sauce, but with more simmer. It gives an inviting aroma and a golden hue to the chicken which is hard to get from just baking alone. It also ties together a complete meal - from the moist chicken breast, to the Asian-inspired rice, to the firm but melt-in-your-mouth veggies.
