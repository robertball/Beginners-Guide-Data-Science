3 oz fruit juice (I used grape juice & pomegranate juice)
4 tea bags
1 c. boiling water

Pour club soda, fruit juice and 3 oz. green tea concentrate over ice.  Add juice to desired sweetness.

Description: 
I wanted to copycat the Starbucks canned spritzers.  This makes 12 oz, is 25% juice (per the can) and uses green tea instead of green coffee extract.  It's close.  Adjust the juice to your taste.
