Ingredients:
Crust:
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
5 tablespoons white sugar
5 tablespoons butter, slightly softened
Cheesecake:
1 cup peanut butter
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 1/4 cups white sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 large eggs
1/2 cup milk
Glaze:
1 (18 ounce) jar blackberry jam

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix graham cracker crumbs, 5 tablespoons sugar, and butter in a bowl until combined. Press graham cracker crust into a 9-inch springform pan.
Beat peanut butter and cream cheese together in a bowl until soft, about 1 minute. Add 1 1/4 cups sugar and flour and blend until smooth. Whisk in eggs until mixture is just blended; stir in milk. Pour mixture into crust.
Bake in preheated oven until edges are puffed and surface of cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, 45 to 50 minutes. Run the tip of a paring knife around the edges of the pan, set the pan on a wire rack, and allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature, about 1 hour.
Heat the jam in a saucepan over medium heat until melted, about 3 minutes; pour over cheesecake. Refrigerate until completely chilled.

Description: 
Don't let the name fool you into thinking this is a cake for kids. This cheesecake definitely has a richness and flavor that will absolutely appeal to the more mature palate. I've had to change several things to bring out the peanut butter taste and to make the process easier.
 This cake sells out quickly at the cafe where I work.
