Ingredients:
1/4 cup of butter
1 large sweet or red onion
2 zucchini squash
2 yellow squash
2 large tomatoes
1 container of sliced mushrooms
8 oz monterey jack cheese
salt and pepper

Directions:
Wash and slice all vegetables and shred the cheese.
Spray cooking spray on 9x13 pan (probably don't need to but I spray everything!)
Melt butter in small container in microwave and pour in the bottom of the pan.  Wiggle the pan so butter covers most of it.  Start layering: onion, zucchini, yellow squash, tomatoes, and mushrooms putting a little salt and pepper between each layer.  Don't worry if they overlap, it will all sink down when it cooks.  Cover with plastic wrap leaving one corner open for steam and put in microwave.  Cook approx 7 min and check.  Cook until fork inserted in middle feels done.  Remove plastic wrap and cover the top with shredded cheese.  Microwave another 2-3 min or until cheese is melted.    Enjoy!

Description: 
My mom has been making this easy vegetable dish for as long as I can remember.  We eat this at least once a week in the warmer months, it makes a great side or a light meal.  Everything is done by sight so I will try and give measurements!  Enjoy!
