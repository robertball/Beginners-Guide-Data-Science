Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds baby red potatoes
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/4 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 stalks celery, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Place potatoes in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add kosher salt, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until tender, 12 to 14 minutes. Drain potatoes, run under cold water to cool, and cut into quarters.
Whisk together sour cream, lemon juice, and pepper in a large bowl. Add potatoes, celery, and chives; toss to combine. Chill for 30 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Who doesn't love potato salad? This lemony take on a classic is great and light. I say serve with a great NY strip steak, or maybe with Cajun-blackened shrimp ... your possibilities are endless.
