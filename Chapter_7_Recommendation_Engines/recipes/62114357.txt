Ingredients:
2 pounds of extra lean ground turkey
a bunch of fresh basil, finely chopped or processed
2 cups of breadcrumbs made from toasted or stale cheese sourdough bread
1 cup mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup parmesan cheese
1 can of roasted tomatoes, with the sauce/liquid drained and squeezed out
1 tsp salt
black pepper to taste
1 tsp ground mustard (optional)
ketchup (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.  Spray a 9x13 pan with non-stick spray.  line with foil, if you want an easier cleanup (there will be juices!)
Mix together all the ingredients.  If it's too wet, add more breadcrumbs.  If it's too dry, add an egg.  It should be at a consistency where you can mold it into a ball and it'll stick together and hold its shape.
Mold into a rounded oval loaf shape in the 9x13 pan.  Spread ketchup all over the top.
Bake for 1-1.5 hours.  To check for doneness, cut in the middle of the load and spread apart to see if there is any pink.
Remove from oven and cool for 10 mins.  Cut into slices and serve with ketchup or even cranberry sauce.

Description: 
I was never a fan of any kind of meatloaf b/c it tasted like fancy, sweet hamburger to me, but then a friend made some turkey meatloaf which I found acceptable.  I modified it and it turned into a dish that my friends gobble up in minutes.  It's great cold, in sandwiches, chopped up on top of nachos, on pizza, etc. you name it.  With a food processor, it takes no time at all to mix the simple ingredients together.  It also freezes VERY well.
