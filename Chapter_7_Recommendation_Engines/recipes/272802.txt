Ingredients:
Rice:
2 cups uncooked jasmine rice
3 cups water
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1 sweet onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed and minced
1 (16 ounce) package frozen peas and carrots
4 tablespoons butter, divided
2 eggs
4 tablespoons oyster sauce
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 lemon, juiced, divided
salt and pepper to taste
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
Yum Yum Sauce:
1 cup mayonnaise
3 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons paprika
1 teaspoon ginger paste
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring 3 cups water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside and let cool.
Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Mix in cooked jasmine rice and frozen peas-carrot mixture; fry until rice begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons butter and stir to combine. Pour in eggs and cook until firm. Add oyster sauce, soy sauce, and 1/2 lemon juice; stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a separate pan over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and fry until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in remaining 2 tablespoons butter and lemon juice. Combine with fried rice mixture.
Combine mayonnaise, water, paprika, ginger paste, white sugar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl to make the yum yum sauce. Stir well. Serve with the fried rice.

Best shrimp fried rice I've ever made or had! The yum yum sauce tastes better if made the day before, so the flavors can marry.
