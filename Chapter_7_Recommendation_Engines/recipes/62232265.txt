Ingredients:
1 box cornbread mix
1 egg
1/3 c milk
1 small onion, chopped
1 c shredded cheese, divided
30-35 jalapenos cut in half and seeds removed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
Prepare the cornbread mix as directed using the egg and milk listed here.
Add the chopped onion and 3/4 c cheese.
Fill the peppers with a little cornbread mix and place on baking sheet. Use just a little mix because it will expand and fill up the pepper. When filling, I find using a teaspoon or a grapefruit spoon is the easiest.
Sprinkle tops with the remaining cheese.
Bake 15 minutes or until golden brown.
