Ingredients:
1 bay leaf
2 celery ribs (chopped)
1 can(s) chicken broth (14oz)
1 can(s) chunky crushed tomatoes (32oz)
1 1/2 pound(s) cod (2-in chunks)
crab legs
1/4 cup(s) EVOO
4 sprig(s) fresh thyme
6 clove(s) garlic
8 large shrimp
2 can(s) minced clams
1 onion (chopped)
1/2 cup(s) parsley (chopped)
1 teaspoon(s) red pepper flakes
salt and pepper
8 sea scallops
1 cup(s) white wine

Directions:
In a large pot over moderate heat, combine EVOO, crushed pepper, garlic, salt, and bay leaf.
Chop celery and onion and add to pot. Saute for a few minutes, then add wine. Reduce wine a minute, then add chicken broth, tomatoes, thyme, and parsley. Bring sauce to a bubble and reduce heat to med-low.
Season fish with salt and pepper. Add fish and simmer five minutes, giving the pot a shake now and then. Do not stir your soup with a spoon or the fish will break up. Add shrimp, scallops, clams, and crab, and cover pot. Cook 10 minutes, giving the pot a good shake now and again.

Description: 
My Nonno's ciopinno recipe. Absolutely delicious. Can also make this in the crock pot, saving all the seafood until the last 45 minutes of cooking (cook on low for 6 hours then turn on high for the last 45 minutes to cook the seafood). Can add real clams and mussels, but we don't (don't want to scare the kids off).
