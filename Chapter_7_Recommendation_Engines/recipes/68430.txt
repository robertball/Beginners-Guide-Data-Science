Ingredients:
1 cup raisins
1 pound raw, bulk Italian sausage
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup chopped pecans
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ginger
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 cup cold coffee
1 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch Bundt pan.
Place the raisins in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 5 minutes; drain.
In a large bowl, mix the sausage, brown sugar, white sugar, and eggs. Fold in the raisins and pecans. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, ginger, and pumpkin pie spice. Blend the coffee and baking soda in a small bowl, and mix into the flour mixture. Mix the moistened flour mixture into the sausage mixture. Transfer to the prepared pan.
Bake 1 hour and 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
