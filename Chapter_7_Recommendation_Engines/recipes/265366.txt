Fresh Peach Salad with Raspberry Vinaigrette Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
¼ cup balsamic vinegar
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
¼ cup honey
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ cup raspberries
2  peaches, halved and pitted
2  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
1 (5 ounce) bag mixed salad greens, or more to taste
½  cucumber, chopped
½  red onion, sliced
½ cup roasted pecans

Directions:
Combine vinegar, 2 tablespoons olive oil, honey, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper in a bowl and mix until well combined. Crush raspberries in a bowl using a fork and add to the vinaigrette.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Lightly brush the cut surfaces of the peaches with vinaigrette. Cook on the preheated grill until browned, about 5 minutes.
Place chicken on a cutting board and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. Cook on the hot grill until browned, 4 to 5 minutes; brush cooked side with vinaigrette. Flip and cook until browned on the second side and no longer pink in the center, 4 to 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Brush second side with vinaigrette.
Slice grilled peaches and grilled chicken and place in a bowl. Add tomatoes, mixed greens, cucumber, red onion, and pecans. Drizzle salad with remaining vinaigrette and mix thoroughly.
