Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 onions, chopped
1 clove garlic, or more to taste, minced
1 medium head cabbage, cut into squares

1 teaspoon caraway seeds
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 pound kielbasa sausage, cut into chunks
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes (with garlic and olive oil)
1/4 cup salsa
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onions and garlic in hot oil until onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir cabbage, vinegar, caraway seeds, and sugar with the onion mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until the cabbage is softened, about 15 minutes.
Stir sausage, tomatoes, and salsa with the cabbage mixture; season with salt and pepper. Place a cover on the Dutch oven and cook until cabbage is completely tender, 45 to 60 minutes.

Description: 
My mother often served a delicious Polish dish made with cabbage. We always topped ours with a dollop of sour cream and sometimes served this over mashed potatoes. You can make this just using the cabbage, but I add kielbasa or smoked turkey for additional flavour. Delicious.
