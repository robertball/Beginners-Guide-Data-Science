Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds beef top sirloin, trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces
2 tablespoons blackened seasoning (such as Chef Paul Prudhomme's® Blackened Steak Magic®), or more to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Blue Cheese Sauce:
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese
3 tablespoons evaporated milk
8 ounces blue cheese crumbles
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Season sirloin with blackened seasoning to coat on all sides.
Heat oil in a cast-iron skillet on an outdoor grill until the oil is smoking. Cook steak bites in hot oil in small batches, reheating oil between batches, until slightly crusty, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
Stir cream cheese and evaporated milk together in a saucepan over low heat to melt the cream cheese. Whisk blue cheese crumbles, garlic powder, white pepper, and cayenne pepper into the cream cheese mixture; simmer, stirring frequently, until the blue cheese melts into a smooth sauce, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve blue cheese sauce with the beef bites.

Description: 
This recipe is similar to an appetizer served at my favorite Italian restaurant. It is a nice change from the usual appetizers and always gets rave reviews! I have used tenderloin in the past, but have found that a good quality top sirloin works very well and is less expensive. Bernaise sauce is a good alternative if you don't like blue cheese.
