Ingredients:
4T unsalted butter
1 small sweet onion (1/4C), finely chopped
3T all-purpose flour
1 1/2C chicken broth
1 1/2C milk
5 drops hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco
3C shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1lb small pasta, cooked al dente
spray oil
salt

Directions:
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat.
Add the onion and saut√© until the onion is just soft.
Whisk in the flour.
Gradually add the broth and milk, then bring the sauce to a boil. Whisk intermittently, so the sauce does not form a skin.
Remove the sauce from the heat.
Add the hot pepper sauce, then add the cheese 1 cup at a time while stirring to melt the cheese.
Pour the cheese sauce over the pasta and combine.
Salt to taste.
Serve warm.

Description: 
This is a quick and easy version of mac and cheese. You can use any small pasta. Adding complementary ingredients, such as bacon or caramelized onion is another way to have fun with this. Modify the sauce using Worcestershire or mustard instead of hot pepper sauce, use a smoked cheese or any other type of cheese you like.
