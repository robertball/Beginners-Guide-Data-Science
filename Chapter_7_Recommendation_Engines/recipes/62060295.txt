Ingredients:
2 lb hamburger
2 large yellow or vidalia onions, chopped
1 large red or green pepper chopped
17 cloves of garlic, minced(or 12t. of the jarred stuff)
1 cup chili powder (I use CVS store brand)
1 Tbl. cumin
1 Tbl. corriander
1 Tbl. salt
1 tsp. ground black pepper
1 tsp. cayenne (depending on your tolerance)
1 - 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes
1 - 28 oz. can italian style plum tomatoes(I use Tuttrose), crushed with hands
2 15 oz. cans light red kidney beans, drained
2 15 oz. cans dark red kidney beans, drained

Directions:
Marinate Hamburg in spices and garlic while chopping the onions and pepper.  Add onions and pepper to the hamburg/spice mixture, mix well.  Cook on med-low heat for about 40 min. (add 1 T. Veg oil if using ultra-lean hamburg) until onions are very soft. Stir often. Add tomatoes(and all juices).  Simmer for about 25 min.  Add kidney beans and simmer 5 more min.
