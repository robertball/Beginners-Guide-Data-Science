Ingredients:
5-10 plum tomatoes
1 1/2 cups olive oil
1 cup balsamic vinegar
1 tsp. fresh garlic
2 sprigs rosemary, finely chopped
salt and pepper to taste
1 loaf French baguette, thinly sliced
4 tablespoons butter, melted
granulated garlic to taste
20 slices of cheese (provolone, mozzarella or fontina) 1/4 inch slice
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish

Directions:
1. SLice plum tomatoes lengthwise to get about 8 slices per tomato.
2. Mix oil, vinegar, garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Marinate the tomatoes in this mixture for at least 5 hours.
3. Brush bread slices with butter, then season with salt, pepper and granulated garlic. Toast bread in 375 degree oven until gold and crisp, about 5-10 mins.
4. When bread has cooled, place a slide of drained, but still moist, tomato on each crouton. Cover each with a half slice of cheese.
5. Place the croutons back in 375 degree oven until cheese melts.
6. Sprinkle with parsley and serve hot or at room temperature.
