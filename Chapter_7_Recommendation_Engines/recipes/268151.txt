Ingredients:
Cupcakes:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 eggs, beaten
1 cup vegetable oil
2 cups mashed bananas
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple
1 cup chopped pecans
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Frosting:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 (16 ounce) package powdered sugar, sifted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 3 regular cupcake pans.
Combine flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Add eggs and oil, stirring until dry ingredients are moistened. Stir in bananas, pineapple, pecans, and vanilla extract. Pour batter into the pans, filling cups about 1/2 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of cupcake comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Transfer pans to a wire rack and cool for 10 minutes. Remove cupcakes from pans and let cool completely, at least 20 minutes.
In the meantime, beat cream cheese and butter together using an electric mixer until creamy. Add powdered sugar gradually, beating until light and fluffy. Stir in vanilla extract. Frost the cooled cupcakes.
