Image:

Ingredients:
Filling
4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup milk
4 eggs
1 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
~
Different kinds of crusts (I buy 1 package and use about 1/2 of it)
Oreos
vanilla cream filled cookies
Nilla cookies
~
Traditional crust ~ Graham Cracker Crust
15- 20 graham crackers, crushed
2 tablespoons butter, melted
~
You will need Metal Muffin/cupcake cups (approx 50)
~
~
Other flavor options I use
Chocolate ~ 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips and 1 tsp. of cocoa powder.  (extra broken oreos)
Cherry Chip ~ I chop up 1/4 cup of cherry chips in mini food processor.
Butterscotch ~ I chop up 1/4 cup of butterscotch chips in mini food processor.

Directions:
I measure and let set out for 2 hours the cream cheese, eggs, and sour cream.
I make water baths for each by putting 1/8 inch of water into the muffin tin.
I then place the metal cupcake cups into them.
The crust can be done very simply by using cookies.  I usually use oreos.  I spit them apart carefully and remove the filling.  (I will use the broken ones as filler if making chocolate filling)
I place each wafer/cookie print side down in each metal muffin cup.
Try not to over mix.  (causes cracking)
Filling instructions:
In a large bowl (I actually do this in my food processor but I do sometimes get cracks because I over mixed), mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth.
(I usually put the rest of the filler ingredients in at this point since it is the food processor so less mixing.)Orig directions: Blend in milk, and then mix in the eggs one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth.
Pour filling into prepared cups about 3/4 full.
Filling options
I make the big batch above and take out 1 c (makes about 4 - 8) to 2 c (8-12) of the filling in a liquid measuring cup and add the options below.  Mix in until incorporated.  There are so many possibilities when you do it this way.
Chocolate ~ 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips and 1 tsp. of cocoa powder.  (extra broken oreos)
Cherry Chip ~ I chop up 1/4 cup of cherry chips in mini food processor.
Butterscotch ~ I chop up 1/4 cup of butterscotch chips in mini food processor.
Bake in preheated oven to 350.(this is a must)  Place muffin trays in oven and cook for 15 min. Turn the oven off, and let cups cool in oven with the door closed for 1 to 2 hours; this helps prevents cracking.
Chill in refrigerator until servi

Description: 
I don't like the fuss of the larger cheesecake.  I also find people are more willing to try the bite size version.  I also like to have a variety of flavors and use this as a base.
