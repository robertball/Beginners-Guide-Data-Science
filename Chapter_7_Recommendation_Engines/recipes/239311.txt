Ingredients:
Meatloaf:
1 cup milk
2/3 cup dry bread crumbs
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup diced onion
1 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
Topping:
1/4 cup ketchup
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Pour milk over breadcrumbs in a large bowl; soak until crumbs are softened, at least 5 minutes.
Mix ground beef, egg, onion, salt, and black pepper with the bread crumbs and milk. Shape the beef mixture into a loaf and transfer to a baking dish.
Stir ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and nutmeg together in a bowl until smooth; spread over the loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
