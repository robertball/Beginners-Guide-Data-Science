Ingredients:
8 oz cream cheese room temperature
1/2 cup butter room temperature
1 1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
Powdered Sugar

Directions:
Soften cream cheese by sitting out at room temperature for 30 minutes or microwave for 15-30 seconds.
Melt butter in microwave.
Combine all ingredients except powdered sugar.
Put rounded tablespoons of batter on cookie sheet and bake for 10-14 minutes until bottoms are very lightly golden brown and tops are just about to turn color.
Cool and then sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired. Freeze cookies without powdered sugar in sealed container. They are still chewy even when frozen.
