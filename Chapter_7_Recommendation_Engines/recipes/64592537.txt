Ingredients:
2 Red Bell Peppers
3 Tablespoons Apple Cider Vinegar
3 Tablespoons Pressed Canola Oil
2 Tablespoons Honey
2 Cloves Garlic
1 Tablespoon Cilantro
1 Tablespoon Dried Basil
1 Cup Water
1 Tablespoons cracked Sea Salt to taste
1 Tablespoons cracked Black Pepper to taste

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees.
Spray baking sheet with oil and place washed bell peppers on the sheet.
Bake peppers for 39 minutes, turning with tongs every 10 minutes.
Pull baking sheet out of oven and check on the peppers to make sure the skin on all sides is charred. If the skin is not charred, cook in the oven for an additional 5 minutes.
Once peppers are charred, pull out baking sheet and cover peppers with a bowl for about 20 minutes. This will "sweat" the peppers so that the skin is easily removable.
Peel off the skin of the bell peppers, remove the stem and the seeds.
Place bell peppers and all ingredients in a food processor and blend. If the dressing is too thick, add a few tablespoons of water.
Store in the fridge for at least 2 hours before serving.
Note:  Dressing will stay fresh in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
