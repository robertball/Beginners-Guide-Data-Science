Ingredients:
2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup rolled oats
3 tablespoons powdered milk
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup vegetable oil
3 tablespoons butter, softened
cooking spray

Directions:
Place the yeast, sugar, and water in the pan of a bread machine. Allow yeast to dissolve and foam, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, rolled oats, powdered milk, and salt in a bowl; set aside. Add the honey, vegetable oil, and butter to the yeast mixture, and pour the flour mixture on top.
Select the Dough cycle; press start. Allow the bread machine to complete the cycle, about 1 1/2 hours, then transfer the dough to a 9x5-inch loaf pan sprayed with cooking spray. Allow the bread to rise for 1 hour in a warm place.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 35 minutes.
