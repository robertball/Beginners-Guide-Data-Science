Ingredients:
3 cups white sugar
3/4 cup corn syrup
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup water
2 egg whites
1 (3 ounce) package fruit flavored Jell-OÂ® mix
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine sugar, corn syrup, vanilla extract and water.  Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar.  Heat to 250 to 265 degrees F (121 to 129 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball.
Meanwhile, beat egg whites until stiff; slowly add gelatin while beating until stiff peaks form.  Continue beating and pour syrup mixture in a thin stream over the egg mixture.  Beat until mixture thickens and losses its gloss.  Stir in pecans.
Drop by teaspoonfuls onto wax paper.  Cool; store in airtight containers.
