Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons honey
1 1/8 cups water
2 1/2 cups bread flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground mace
1 tablespoon dry milk powder
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 cup dried cranberries
2 dried pineapple rings, finely chopped
2 teaspoons active dry yeast

Directions:
Combine the bread flour, whole wheat flour, ground cinnamon, mace, powdered milk, salt, cranberries, and pineapple. Add this mixture as you would normally add dry ingredients to your bread machine.
Add all the ingredients to the pan of the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer.
Set your bread machine to Basic Loaf, and check to see that the dough forms a ball without excess moisture.  May have to add a little more bread flour, no more than a tablespoon, so that the dough forms a nice solid ball.
