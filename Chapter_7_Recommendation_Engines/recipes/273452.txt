Ingredients:
Sponge:
8 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 cup warm water
1 cup all-purpose flour
Dough:
7 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups lukewarm water
2 tablespoons lukewarm water
6 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed

Directions:
Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand in a warm place until frothy, about 10 minutes. Stir in flour. Cover sponge with plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes.
Place flour in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Pour in sponge. Add 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons lukewarm water, olive oil, and salt. Gradually work in the flour to make a soft and sticky dough.
Knead the dough on a floured surface for 15 minutes. Grease a large bowl with butter and add dough. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
Divide dough into quarters. Cut each quarter into 10 pieces; shape each piece into a ball. Cover balls of dough and let rest for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Shape each ball of dough into a circle by flattening dough and stretching it. Arrange 2 inches apart on the baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed up and golden, about 10 minutes.
