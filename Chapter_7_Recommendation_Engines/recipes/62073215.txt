Ingredients:
6 large Eggs
50g of Sliced Ham (aprox 4-5 slices)cut into small pieces
1/2 cup Shredded White Cheddar

Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Wisk the eggs in a bowl and add all the ingredients. Pour into frying pan and make as you would scrambled eggs. You can use any type of ham that you like and any kind of cheese. I've even used feta and it turmed out great!

Description: 
Easy and delicious scrambled eggs with ham and cheese! I don't recommend using cooking onions as they overpower everything else, but if you must, then only use a sprinkling of them. You can use any type of ham that you like and any kind of cheese. I've even used feta and it turned out great!
