Ingredients:
1 can (16.3 oz) original or buttermilk biscuits
16 frozen (thawed) cooked meatballs
1 block (8 oz) Cheddar cheese, cut into 16 cubes
16 slices bacon
1 jalapeno pepper, cut into 16 slices
Long toothpicks or skewers

Directions:
Heat oven to 375°F.
Separate dough into 8 biscuits. Cut each biscuit in half; press with hands into circle about 3 inches in diameter.
In center of each biscuit round, place 1 meatball, 1 jalapeno pepper slice and 1 cube of cheese. Wrap dough to completely enclose beef and cheese; pinch seams to seal.
Place bacon on foil-lined cookie sheet with sides. Bake about 8 minutes to partially cook bacon.  Wrap each stuffed “bomb” with 1 slice partially cooked bacon slice. Place bacon wrapped dough 2-inches apart on two foil-lined cookie sheets with dough seam side down. Bake 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.
