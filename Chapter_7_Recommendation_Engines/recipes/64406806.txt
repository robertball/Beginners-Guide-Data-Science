Ingredients:
Filling:
4 lbs. ground beef
1 jar La Victoria salsa- hot (Ranchera)
1 jar La Victoria salsa- mild (Suprema)
2 cans refried beans
1/4c milk
1.4c shredded cheese
Toppings:
Shredded sharp cheddar cheese
Sour cream
Chopped Onion
Pickled Jalape√±os
Shredded lettuce
Chopped Roma Tomatos
Shells:
Corn tortillas
Olive Oil

Directions:
In two separate sauce pans brown group beef. When browned, drain the oil and return to the heat. Over medium-low heat mix in salsa, hot salsa in one sauce pan, mild in the other (keep separate). While the meat is browning open the cans of refried beans and empty into a sauce pan over medium-low heat. When the beans are soft, add milk and cheese and stir to incorporate. While the meat is stewing and beans are heating, prep toppings. Set toppings aside.
Heat enough olive oil to coat the bottom of a non-stick skillet and and come up the side about 1/4 inch. Fry each tortilla for approximately 1 minute on each side, leaving them fried but pliable.  Fry some longer (2-3 minutes) for Tostadas.
Build your tacos and/or tostadas whatever way you like! Enjoy!
