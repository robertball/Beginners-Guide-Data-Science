Ingredients:
6 eggs
1 slice bacon
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon finely chopped dill
1 teaspoon honey mustard
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 pinch paprika

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add eggs; cook for 10 minutes. Place in a bowl under cold running water until cool enough to handle. Peel eggs in the bowl of water.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels; crumble into small pieces.
Cut eggs in half lengthwise and scoop yolks into a bowl. Mash yolks with a fork. Add mayonnaise, dill, honey mustard, white vinegar, salt, and pepper; whisk until smooth.
Spoon or pipe yolk mixture into the egg whites. Garnish with bacon crumbles and paprika.

Description: 
Why not try something a little different than your average deviled egg? Dill makes this simple recipe come to life with flavor and the bacon is... Well bacon, do I need to explain any further?
