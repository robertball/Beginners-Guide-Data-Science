Ingredients:
1 stick butter,
1 box powdered sugar,
1/2 cup forzen strawberries(drained),
1/2 cup chopped pecans,
1/2 cup coconut or more to get to desired consistency.

Directions:
Cream sugar, and butter.  Add other ingredients, and mix well.  Spread on a cooled cake.  This icing is so thick you may have to partially freeze cake in order for the frosting to hold, but it is well worth it.
