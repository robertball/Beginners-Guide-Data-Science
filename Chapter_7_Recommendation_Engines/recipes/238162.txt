Ingredients:
1 pound sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch cubes
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
coarse salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
1 (14.5 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 red onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Spread sweet potatoes onto a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over sweet potatoes; season with cumin, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Toss sweet potatoes until evenly coated.
Roast on the lower rack of the preheated oven, stirring halfway through, until sweet potatoes are tender, 25 to 35 minutes.
Whisk remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and lime juice together in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Add sweet potatoes, black beans, onion, and cilantro; gently toss to coat.
