Ingredients:
8 Eggs
1/4 Cup of Milk
1/2 tsp of Baking Powder
1/2 tsp of Oil
Salt & Pepper
Grated Cheese (Your choice, I used Cheddar)
Favorite Omelet fillings (Your choice, I used onions, bell peppers and diced ham)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
In a frying pan, cook up your favorite omelet ingredients. I chose onions, bell peppers, and diced ham.
Spray  a 6 spot muffin tin with cooking spray.
Fill each muffin cup with cooked omelet ingredients.
Top with favorite shredded cheese.
Mix egg, milk, baking powder, oil, and salt & pepper in a bowl.
Pour egg mixture in each muffin cup. You should fill each about 4/5 of the way to the top.
Put in oven and bake for 20-25 minutes.
Take out of oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving or storing.

Description: 
I whip up double batches of the above recipe using my 2 Texas  6 spot muffin tins. I put them in a large plastic resealable bag, store them in the fridge, and enjoy throughout the week. These taste just as delicious the next day. I like them both cold or heated up in the microwave. To make them last even longer, you could also store them in the freezer and reheat them in the microwave for a minute or 2 when you want to enjoy them.
