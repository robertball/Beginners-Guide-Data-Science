Ingredients:
2 (21 ounce) cans cherry pie filling
1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread cherry pie filling over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan. Stir cake mix and butter together into a gooey, clumpy mixture. Break into pieces between your fingers and crumble evenly on top of the cherry filling. Sprinkle pecans on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, 35 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
Amazingly easy and amazingly good... too good! This is my mother-in-law's recipe that was just recently shared. It would be a shame not to share it. Best served warm and with vanilla ice cream (of course).
