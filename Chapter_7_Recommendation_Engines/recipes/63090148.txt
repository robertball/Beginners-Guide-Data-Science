Ingredients:
2 sticks (1 cup) softened butter
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 tablespoon pure vanilla
1 teaspoon peppermint extract
3 1/2 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
10 oz bag chocolate chips
4 candy canes, crushed into chunks (not too fine)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cream butter and sugars together with a mixer until well combined.  Beat in eggs and vanilla and peppermint.
In a separate bowl mix the flour, salt and baking soda.  Slowly add to wet ingredients along with chocolate chips until just combined.  Fold in crushed candy canes.
* This makes slightly "flat" cookies which I like. To combat this, chill dough 1 hour before baking if you prefer "fluffy" cookies *
Take dough and roll into a log.  Cut into 1 inch pieces.  Slightly shape these pieces into rounds. Place onto a parchment or silpat lined baking sheet and bake cookies 9-13 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool for 5 minutes before transferring to cooling rack.

Description: 
I usually make these when I make chocolate chip cookies when candy canes go on clearance.  The peppermint extract is optional, but I think it really adds some kick.  Just don't leave out the candy canes, they give a great crunch.  I made these for my husband serving overseas and they arrived great.
