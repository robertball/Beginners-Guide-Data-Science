Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
2 cloves minced garlic
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 lime, juiced
cracked black pepper to taste
8 boneless pork chops, 1/2 inch thick

Directions:
Whisk together the vegetable oil, apple cider vinegar, seafood seasoning, minced garlic, basil, lime juice, and black pepper in a bowl, and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the pork chops, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 hours, flipping periodically.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the pork chops from the bags. Discard excess marinade.
Grill until the pork is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
Seafood seasoning is used to make a marinade that gives these grilled pork chops the delicious flavor of the Chesapeake Bay.  More seafood seasoning can be sprinkled on at grill time to provide an extra kick.
