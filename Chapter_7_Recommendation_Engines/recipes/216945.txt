Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the beef broth, then add the ground beef. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring and breaking up the ground beef. Mix in the diced tomatoes and tomato juice.
Stir in the mixed vegetables, pearl barley, basil, parsley, and pepper. Simmer until the barley is tender, 40 to 50 minutes.
