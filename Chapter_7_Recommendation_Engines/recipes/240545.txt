Ingredients:
1 very ripe banana, mashed
2 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons ground flax seed (optional)
1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract (optional)
2 tablespoons coconut oil

Directions:
Mix banana and eggs together in a bowl until smooth. Add ground flax seed and vanilla extract; mix batter well.
Heat coconut oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Scoop batter, about 1/4 cup per pancake, onto the skillet and cook until the center starts to bubble, about 30 seconds. Flip pancakes and cook until bottoms are lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes more.
