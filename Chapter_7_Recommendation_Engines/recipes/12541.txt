Description: 
This pie is exactly like a pecan pie with the exception that it has oatmeal in it, rather than pecans. During baking, the oatmeal forms a chewy, nutty crust on top For a delicious variation, try the chocolate version. Just substitute 1/4 cup cocoa for the spices; this makes it taste very fudgy.
