Ingredients:
1 bottle (1/5 liters) dry red wine
1/2 cup sugar
3 (3") cinnamon sticks
1 TBL whole cloves
2 TBL grated orange peel
1 small orange, peeled
1/2 cup raisins
1/3 cup whole blanched almonds

Directions:
In large saucepan, combine wine, sugar, cinnamon sticks, cloves and orange peel. Bring to simmer over medium-low heat; do not boil. Let simmer 5 minutes. Meanwhile, cut orange, crosswise, into thin slices; cut each slice in half; reserve. Strain wine and return wine to saucepan or pour into fondue pot or other pan that fits over warmer. Add raisins and almonds to wine and heat until hot; do not boil. Float orange slices on top.
Ladle into mugs, portioning some raisins and almonds into each one. Serve with a spoon.
Non-Alcohol Variation: 1 bottle (64 oz) cranberry juice cocktail may be substitued for the wine; reduce sugar to 1/4 cup.
