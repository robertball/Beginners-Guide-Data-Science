Ingredients:
3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons honey
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pinch ground ginger
1 pound frog legs
Salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 tablespoon thinly sliced green onion

Directions:
Stir together the soy sauce, honey, garlic, and ginger.  Toss frog legs in marinade to coat evenly, then set aside to marinate for 1 hour.
Drain the frog legs well, reserving marinade.  Season with salt and pepper, and toss with cornstarch to coat.
Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook the legs until golden brown and crispy, about 2 minutes per side.  While the legs are cooking, bring the marinade to a simmer in a small saucepan, and simmer for 3 minutes.
To serve, pour sauce over the frog legs and sprinkle with sliced green onion.
