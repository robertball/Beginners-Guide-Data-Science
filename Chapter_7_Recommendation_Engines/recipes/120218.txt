Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup baking cocoa
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup buttermilk
1/3 cup chopped pecans
CHOCOLATE HONEY BUTTER:
1/2 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons chocolate syrup

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Combine the flour, cocoa, salt, baking powder and baking soda; add to creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk.  Fold in pecans.
Pour into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.  Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
In a small mixing bowl, beat butter until fluffy.  Add honey and chocolate syrup; mix well.  Serve with the bread.

Description: 
I serve this rich cake-like bread and its creamy chocolate honey butter often at Christmastime. It makes a great brunch item, but it also goes well on a dinner buffet. This recipe won me a 'Best in Category' award in a local cooking contest. -Patrice Bruwer, Grand Rapids, Michigan
