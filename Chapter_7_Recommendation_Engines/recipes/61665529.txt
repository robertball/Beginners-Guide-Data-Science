salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup honey
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 packet chicken bouillon granules
2 cups all-purpose flour

DRY each chicken piece. Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper, then coat each seasoned chicken piece with honey.
In a shallow dish or bowl, mix together the garlic powder, chicken bouillon granules and flour. Dredge honey coated chicken pieces in flour mixture, coating completely.
Fill a large, heavy skillet with oil to a depth of one inch.  Heat over medium-high heat.
Fry chicken for at least 5 minutes per side, until no longer pink and juices run clear.

Description: 
You can bake it just as well and less mess.  Be sure to dry each piece of chicken so the honey will stick.  Honey will carmelize making it appear burned, but it will still taste great.Modified from: Honey Fried Chicken
