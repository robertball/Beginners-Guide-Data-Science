Ingredients:
Cranberry Salad:
1 tablespoon creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip®), or as needed
2 oranges
1 (12 ounce) bag fresh cranberries
2 apples, unpeeled and cored
2 1/2 cups boiling water, or as needed
1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin (such as Knox ®)
1/2 cup cold water
1 (6 ounce) package raspberry-flavored gelatin mix (such as Jell-O®)
2 cups white sugar
2 cups halved seedless grapes
2 cups chopped pecans
Dressing:
1 1/2 cups frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3 tablespoons creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip®)
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 sprig fresh parsley

Directions:
Grease a ring mold with 1 tablespoon creamy salad dressing. Zest 1 orange and then peel both oranges.
Place oranges, orange zest, cranberries, and apples together in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped. Strain fruit pieces, reserving juice in a quart-size measuring cup. Add enough boiling water to measure 3 cups liquid.
Dissolve unflavored gelatin in cold water in a large bowl. Pour water-juice mixture over unflavored gelatin. Add raspberry gelatin and 2 cups sugar; stir to dissolve completely. Stir in fruit mixture, grapes, and pecans. Pour gelatin mixture into prepared ring mold; chill 8 hours to overnight.
Mix whipped topping, cream cheese, 3 tablespoons creamy salad dressing, and 2 teaspoons sugar together in a bowl until dressing is smooth.
Dip chilled mold in a few inches of hot water to loosen gelatin from mold. Turn out onto a serving platter, garnish with parsley, and serve with dressing.

Description: 
This is a wonderful fresh uncooked cranberry salad I've enjoyed since I was a child. It has a dressing made with Miracle Whip®, Cool Whip®, and cream cheese. It sounds kind of strange but it really complements the salad.
