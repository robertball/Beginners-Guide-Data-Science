Ingredients:
4 Chicken breasts, bone-in and skin-on
2 bottles good quality beer
5 T. Soy Sauce
1 Large Onion, diced
4 T. Melted Butter
1 Garlic clove, minced
oil for grill

Directions:
1. Place first six ingredients in a water tight, air tight container (I use a gallon sized sealable bag.) Let marinate for 8-24 hours, turning occasinally.
2. Warm grill or broiler to medium high heat, with grill about 5-7 inches away from heat source.
3. Remove chicken from marinade.  Place marinade in a saucepan, then cook at gentle boil until reduced by 2/3. Once reduced and thick and sticky, remove from heat.
4. Place chicken on grill, and grill for 4 minutes, then re-dip in marinade.  (You can do this,even if the marinade is still cooking.)  Place back on gril, turned to opposite side.  Rotate every four minutes, so that each side has had a minimum of 16 minutes towards the heat. It may take longer.  Check for doneness after about 12 minutes  each side.  Stop rotating when juices run clear and meat cooked through.
5. plate then pour any remaining marinade over the chicken.

Description: 
This is a great way to marinate chicken for grilling either in the oven or out of doors. I reccomend you use a a high quality beer, as this is a key flavour component in the recipe.  If you don't want to cook with alcohol, substitute an alcohol free beer, or a good quality apple juice or cider.
