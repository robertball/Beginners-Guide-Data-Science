Ingredients:
3 cups of bread flour
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp yeast
1 1/2 cups warm tap water, 100-110 degrees.
2T flour

Directions:
Place flour, salt and yeast in a deep bowl.
Stir well.
Add the water and stir until blended, don't over mix.
Put plastic wrap on the bowl and a tea towel under the bowl.
Leave this on the counter for 4-10 hours. I prefer to leave this longer to allow the yeast to ferment.
Scrape dough onto a lightly floured counter, about 1-2 tbs.
Fold the dough 10-15 times. It will be very sticky.
Rinse the bowl out and line it with parchment paper. Try and smooth the parchment paper out so it sits flat against the bowl.
Put a dutch oven in your oven and turn the oven on, 400ยบ
With your scraper scoop the dough into the bowl and cover with the plastic wrap.
Set the bowl on a tea towel and set your timer for 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes, remove the dutch oven and carefully lift the dough and parchment paper into the dutch oven.
Place the lid on and place in oven.
Allow this to bake for 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes, remove the lid and cook for an additional 10 minutes.
Remove from oven and very carefully lift the parchment paper/loaf onto a cooling rack.
Remove parchment paper.
Options: replace up to one cup of bread flour with either dark rye or whole wheat.
For a crunchier crust increase oven temp to 425.
