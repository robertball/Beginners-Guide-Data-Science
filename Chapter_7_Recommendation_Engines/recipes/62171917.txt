Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup water
1/3 cup milk
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 egg
CHEESE TOPPING:
2 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
APPLE TOPPING:
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
5 medium apples, peeled and chopped
1/4 cup butter or margarine, cubed
1/2-1 cup water, as needed
STREUSEL:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
GLAZE:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 tablespoon water

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups flour, sugar, yeast and salt.
In a saucepan, heat the water, milk and butter to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat just until moistened.
Beat in egg until smooth.
Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down. Press into two greased 12-in. pizza pans (or make one large & two 9" rounds); build up edges.
In a small mixing bowl, combine the cheese topping ingredients. Spread over dough to within 1/2 in. of edges.
In a saucepan, combine the apple topping ingredients; simmer, uncovered, until apples are tender. Add more than the initial 1/2 cup water, as needed. Spoon over cream cheese layer.
Combine streusel ingredients; sprinkle over apples. Let stand for 15 minutes to rise a little.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until crust is browned.
Combine glaze ingredients; drizzle over warm pizzas. Cool on wire racks.

Description: 
This is less sweet than the original delicious (but overly sweet) Apple Coffee Cake Pizza. ** MAKE IN ADVANCE NOTES: * Each of the 5 components can be made in advance, & put together before baking. * Placing the formed crust  (with or without the cream cheese spread) in the fridge will allow dough to rise very slowly overnight. * The partially baked, unglazed pizza can also be wrapped & frozen, for a ready-made future treat; finish off the baking later while simultaneously reheating it.Modified from: Apple Coffee Cake Pizza
