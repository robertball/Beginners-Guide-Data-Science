Ingredients:
6 slices hickory-smoked bacon
1/2 pound ground venison
1/2 pound lean ground beef
kosher salt
fresh ground black pepper
stout beer (such as GuinnessÂ®)
Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce
4 hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.
Combine ground venison and ground beef in a bowl. Divide into 4 balls, and flatten into patties.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Place the burgers in the heated skillet and sprinkle each burger with salt, black pepper, a dash of beer, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Flip the burgers once a brown crust has formed on the bottom, about 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle the cooked side of the burgers with the salt, pepper, beer, and Worcestershire. Cook burgers another 5 to 10 minutes for well done. Top each patty with bacon and serve on hamburger buns.
