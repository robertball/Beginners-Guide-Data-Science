Ingredients:
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup tomato juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons stone-ground mustard
1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
4 portobello mushroom caps (about 5 inches wide)
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning for steak (such as Chef Paul Prudhomme's Steak Magic)
2 teaspoons olive oil
cooking spray
16 cups gourmet salad greens
1 large tomato, cut into 8 wedges
1/2 cup thinly sliced red onion, separated into rings
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini or other white beans, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese

Directions:
Combine first 7 ingredients in a large zip-top plastic bag. Add mushrooms to bag; seal. Marinate 10 minutes, turning occasionally. Remove mushrooms from bag, reserving marinade.
Sprinkle mushrooms with Cajun seasoning. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat until hot. Add mushrooms; cook 2 minutes on each side or until very brown. Cool; cut mushrooms diagonally into thin slices.
Arrange 4 cups salad greens on each of 4 plates. Top each with mushroom slices, 2 tomato wedges, and onion rings. Sprinkle each with 1/4 cup beans and 1 tablespoon blue cheese. Drizzle the reserved marinade evenly over salads.

Description: 
The meaty texture of the Portobello earns this salad star billing with a supporting cast of greens and white Italian kidney beans.
