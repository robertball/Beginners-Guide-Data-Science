Ingredients:
2 cups Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons blackening seasoning (such as Chef Paul Prudhomme's Blackened Redfish MagicÂ®)
2 pounds sea scallops
1 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup butter

Directions:
Combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and blackened seasoning in a large, resealable plastic bag.
Dip the scallops into a bowl of heavy cream to coat.
Place the scallops one at a time into the plastic bag; shake to coat with the seasoning mixture.
Place the breaded scallop on a plate and repeat with the remaining scallops.
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium high heat.
Pan fry the scallops until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side.
