Ingredients:
1 (14.5 ounce) jar Barilla® Garlic Alfredo Sauce
6 cups bite-size broccoli florets
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 (16 ounce) box Barilla® Linguine
2/3 cup coarsely chopped roasted, salted pistachios
1/4 cup panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup finely shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place broccoli on the sheet and toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil and salt; roast 15 to 18 minutes or until tender; set aside.
In a very large skillet over medium-low heat, add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, the pistachios and breadcrumbs, and cook, stirring constantly, about 4 minutes or until golden brown and fragrant.
Remove from heat and transfer to a small bowl; stir in the Parmesan.
Wipe skillet clean; in that skillet bring the Garlic Alfredo Sauce to a low simmer.
Meanwhile, bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil, add salt to taste, and the Linguine, and stir gently.
Cook pasta according to package directions. Remove from heat and drain well, reserving 1/4 cup of the pasta cooking water.
Add pasta, three-fourths of the broccoli and the 1/4 cup pasta cooking water to the Garlic Alfredo Sauce in skillet; heat through.
Top with the pistachio-Parmesan mixture and remaining roasted broccoli.
