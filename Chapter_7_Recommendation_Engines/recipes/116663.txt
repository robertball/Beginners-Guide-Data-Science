Ingredients:
Pastry for a single-crust 9-inch pie
1 medium onion, chopped
1 tablespoon butter
8 cups torn fresh spinach
1 cup shredded Gouda cheese
6 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
4 eggs
2 cups half-and-half cream
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Line a deep-dish 9-in. pie plate with pastry. Trim and flute edge. Line unpricked pastry shell with a double thickness of heavy-duty foil. Bake at 450 degrees F for 5 minutes. Remove foil; bake 5 minutes longer. Place on a wire rack. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F.
In a skillet, saute the onion in butter until tender. Stir in spinach. Remove from the heat. Sprinkle cheese and bacon into crust; top with spinach mixture. In a bowl, beat eggs. Add the cream, salt and pepper; mix well. Carefully pour into crust.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.

My husband and I have run a dairy for over 3 years and began making cheese 5 years ago. Gouda's distinctive, buttery taste is sensational in this quiche.
