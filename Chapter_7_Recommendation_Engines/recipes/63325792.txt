Ingredients:
CHICKEN AND MARINADE
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup fresh orange juice
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 to 2 garlic cloves crushed
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 1/2 pounds boneless chicken, cut into 1-inch cubes
SATAY SAUCE
3/4 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup fresh orange juice
1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 tablespoon sugar
1/4 cup smooth peanut butter
2 scallions, chopped (optional)

Directions:
For the chicken and the marinade: Whisk all the ingredients except for the chicken together in a medium bowl.
Add the chicken cubes, turn to coat, cover, and marinate them in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 24. (The sauce can be made ahead too and chilled for the same amount of time.)
Heat the oven to 500 degrees. Thread the chicken onto skewers, if you're using them, or just put the pieces on a foil-lined pan. If you plan to use bamboo skewers, be sure to soak them in water for 1 hour beforehand. Bake for 10 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.
Meanwhile, for the satay sauce: Whisk together the broth, orange juice, soy sauce, garlic, and sugar in a small saucepan until the sugar has dissolved.
Over low heat, whisk in the peanut butter (it will be messy at first) until smooth. Whisking constantly, heat the sauce until it has thickened, about 10 minutes.
Add the optional scallions. Serve the sauce as a dip for the chicken along with any cut-up raw vegetables your children might also want to dip.

Description: 
This delicious chicken tastes better the longer it marinates. Consider letting it sit over night for the best flavor.--from Family Fun Magazine
