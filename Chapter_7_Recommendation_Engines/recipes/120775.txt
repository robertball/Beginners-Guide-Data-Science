Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees F)
2 teaspoons salt
3 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir in salt and enough flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Do not let rise. Divide dough into six pieces; knead each for 1 minute. Roll each into a 5-in. circle. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Place upside down on greased baking sheets. Bake at 500 degrees F for 5-10 minutes. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
