Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
7 eggs, separated
1/2 cup orange juice
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup water
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 tablespoon grated orange peel
2 teaspoons grated lemon peel
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
ICING:
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons shortening
1 tablespoon butter or margarine, softened
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, well drained

Directions:
Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt into a large bowl; make a well in the center. In another bowl, beat egg yolks until thicken and lemon-colored. Beat in the orange juice, oil, water, vanilla, and orange and lemon peels. Pour into well in dry ingredients; beat with a wooden spoon until smooth. In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites on medium speed until foamy. Add cream of tartar; beat until stiff peaks form. Gradually fold into batter.
Transfer to an ungreased 10-in. tube pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Immediately invert cake; cool completely. Loosen cake from sides of pan; remove cake and place on a serving platter.
For icing, combine the confectioners' sugar, shortening and butter until smooth. Spread over top of cake. Spoon pineapple over icing.
