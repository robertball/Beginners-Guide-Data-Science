Ingredients:
4 Tablespoons Canola Oil (or Ghee)
1 large onion, peeled and diced
2 carrots, peeled and diced
1 fresh chili, minced (use chili to desired heat level)
1/2 teaspoon sugar
salt and pepper to taste
3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 teaspoon fresh ginger, peeled and grated
3 tablespoons curry powder
2 tins of vegetable broth
1 cup dried lentils
1 handful of chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat medium sized dutch oven and add oil, onions and carrots over medium high heat.
Cook the vegetables, salt and sugar for 15-20 minutes or until the onions are deep brown but not burned (color of dark caramel).
Turn the pot down to medium and add garlic, chili, ginger and curry powder.
Stir constantly for 5 minutes.  The curry powder will stick to the bottom of the pan, this is okay.  Just don't burn it.
Turn the heat back up to medium high and add one tin of vegetable broth.
Using a wooden spoon scrape up any vegetables or curry powder stuck to the bottom of the pot.
Add the lentils and second tin of stock.
Cook for another 30 minutes.
Before serving, stir in cilantro.

Description: 
This recipe can be eaten as a main or side dish.  The key to developing the flavor (and not missing the meat) is carmelizing and developing deep brown of the onions and carrots.  In the Caribbean, cooks call this burning the onions.
