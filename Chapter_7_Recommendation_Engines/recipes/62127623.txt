Description: 
This is a whole grain blend of 8 gluten free grains and seeds which are ground in a coffee grinder and cooked.  Since going gluten and casein free I have been unable to find any hot breakfast cereals that we enjoy.  So I created this one and the whole family loves it.  It is high in fiber, protein and is very satisfying.
