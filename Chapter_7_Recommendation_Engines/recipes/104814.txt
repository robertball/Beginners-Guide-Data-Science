Ingredients:
1/3 cup olive oil
1/4 cup minced onion
1/2 cup diced celery
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 cup all-purpose flour
6 cups vegetable broth
4 cups cooked wild rice
1 cup grated carrot
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)
2 cups half-and-half
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in garlic, onion, and celery, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour, and cook for 3 minutes more. Pour in the vegetable broth, then bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
Stir in wild rice, carrot, almonds, and red pepper flakes; return to a simmer, and cook until the carrots are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in half and half, and cook until warmed through. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
