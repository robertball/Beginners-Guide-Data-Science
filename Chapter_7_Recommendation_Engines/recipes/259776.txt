Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless chicken breasts, diced
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 large tomato, diced
1 green bell pepper, cut into strips
1/2 large onion, cut into strips
3/4 cup water
2 (1.27 ounce) packets fajita seasoning
10 (6 inch) corn tortillas, cut in quarters
1 (16 ounce) can pinto beans, rinsed and drained
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (16 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup green onions, chopped
1/4 cup chopped cilantro

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add chicken; cook and stir until browned on all sides, about 6 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate.
Heat oil in the hot skillet. Add tomato, bell pepper, and onion; cook and stir until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix in cooked chicken, water, and fajita seasoning.
Line the bottom of the prepared pan with 5 tortillas; pour pinto beans on top. Spread 1/2 of the chicken mixture over the beans; cover with Cheddar cheese. Layer the remaining tortillas, black beans, and chicken mixture on top. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until tortillas are lightly browned and chicken juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. Top with green onions and cilantro.

I made this recipe at the fire hall and it was a big hit! It is somewhat healthier as well.
