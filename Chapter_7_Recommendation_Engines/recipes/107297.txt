Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
6 tablespoons cold butter, cut into small pieces
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
5 teaspoons cold water

Directions:
Place flour in a large bowl. Sprinkle in the chopped butter; rub butter into the flour until it resembles bread crumbs. Stir in the grated cheese. Sprinkle water over the flour mixture, a teaspoon at a time, stirring lightly with a fork. Add just enough water to allow the dough form a ball and cleanly leave the sides of the bowl. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Roll out dough, and place in a 9 inch pie/quiche pan. Use a fork to prick holes over the bottom of the pastry.
Bake crust in preheated oven for 10 minutes before filling with quiche custard of your choice.

Description: 
I love this recipe, the cheese adds to the usually bland flavor of the the quiche crust to make it rich and tasty.
