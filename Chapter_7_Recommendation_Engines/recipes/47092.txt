Ingredients:
1 turkey (12 to 14 pounds)
2 cups water
2 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 1/2 cups orange juice, divided
4 tablespoons soy sauce, divided
1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
1 teaspoon dried minced onion
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
ORANGE GIBLET GRAVY:
3/4 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup orange juice
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Place turkey on a greased rack in a roasting pan. Add water, giblets and neck to pan. Combine 1-1/4 cups broth, 3/4 cup orange juice and 2 tablespoons soy sauce; pour over turkey. Combine bouillon, onion and garlic powder; sprinkle over turkey.
Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees for 3-1/2 hours, basting every 30 minutes. When turkey begins to brown, cover lightly with foil. Remove giblets and neck when tender; set aside for gravy.
Combine remaining broth, orange juice and soy sauce. Remove foil from turkey; pour broth mixture over turkey. Bake 30 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees.
For gravy, remove meat from neck; discard bones. Chop giblets and neck meat; set aside. In a saucepan, combine 2 cups pan juices, broth, orange juice and Worcestershire sauce; mix well. Stir in thyme, sugar and pepper. Combine cornstarch and water until smooth. Whisk into broth mixture; bring to a boil. Cook and stir for 2 minutes. Stir in reserved giblets and neck meat.
Carve turkey; serve with gravy.
