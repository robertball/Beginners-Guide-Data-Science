In a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat and stir in the flour, stirring constantly until smooth, about 2 minutes.
Slowly whisk in the milk, stirring vigorously to blend. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil for 1 minute and continue stirring. Allow to cook until floury taste is gone for approximately 5 minutes.

Description: 
Bchamel sauce has to be one of the most versatile sauces. My favorite way of serving it is on top of stuffed artichoke hearts. Its a delicious sauce served with pastas too. All the ingredients you'll find in your kitchen.
