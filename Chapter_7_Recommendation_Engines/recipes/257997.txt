Title:
Sweet and Sour Mango Chicken with Sesame Rice Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
½ cup honey
¼ cup soy sauce
¼ cup rice vinegar
1 tablespoon sambal oelek (Indonesian red chile paste)
1 (1 inch) piece ginger, grated
½ teaspoon sesame oil
2 cups water
1 cup uncooked short-grain white rice
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, grated
2 large mangoes, peeled and cubed
¾ cup roasted salted cashews
freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Combine chicken, honey, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sambal oelek, ginger, and sesame oil in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal and place in the refrigerator to marinate, about 2 1/2 hours.
Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in rice. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle sesame seeds over the surface of the rice. Continue cooking until water is completely absorbed, about 5 minutes more. Fluff rice with a fork to fully incorporate sesame seeds.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Cook and stir onion until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add chicken mixture, including marinade, and garlic; saute until chicken is no longer pink in the center and sauce coats chicken pieces, 5 to 8 minutes.
Stir mangoes and cashews into the skillet until just warmed through, about 2 minutes. Serve over rice. Garnish with black pepper.
