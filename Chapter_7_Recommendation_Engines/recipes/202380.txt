Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) box sweet rice flour (mochiko)
1 cup canola oil
2 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
3 eggs, beaten
1/2 (18.75 ounce) can sweetened red bean paste
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.
Mix rice flour, canola oil, milk, sugar, and baking powder in a large bowl. Stir in the beaten eggs. Pour the mixture into the baking pan. Drop small spoonfuls of the red bean paste into the flour mixture about 1 to 2 inches apart, making sure that the red bean paste is covered by the flour mixture. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
A sweet dessert made with glutinous rice flour (also called sweet rice flour) and red bean paste. This recipe was given to me by my Chinese sister-in-law.  It is a favorite of my family.  It has a firm custard-like texture which is different to many western palates.
