Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 cups bread flour
1 teaspoon salt
9 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons clarified butter

Directions:
Place yeast, flour, salt, water, and clarified butter in bread machine pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer.  Select dough setting.  At the end of the first kneading, remove the dough from the machine.  Allow to rest for ten minutes.
Place a 13 x 9 inch baking pan on the bottom of the oven.  Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
On a lightly floured work surface, cut dough into four equal parts.  With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll each piece to a 1/4 inch thick free-form circle.  Cover with a clean kitchen cloth, and let rest 20 minutes.
Lightly sprinkle tops with flour, and roll out as thin as possible.
Place one naan face down on preheated baking pan.  Bake 60 seconds.  Remove from oven.  It will still be white, although it may have a couple brown spots like a flour tortilla.  Place on a large plate, and cover with a clean kitchen cloth to keep warm.  Continue baking remaining naan.  Serve warm with clarified butter for dipping.
