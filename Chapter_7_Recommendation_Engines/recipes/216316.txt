Reduce the heat to medium.  Add the garlic to the skillet and cook and stir for 1 minute.  Stir in the soup, tomatoes with liquid, olives, capers, red pepper and anchovy paste, if desired, and heat to a boil.  Cook for 10 minutes or until the soup mixture is reduced to 2 cups.
Return the chicken to the skillet.  Reduce the heat to low.  Cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.
