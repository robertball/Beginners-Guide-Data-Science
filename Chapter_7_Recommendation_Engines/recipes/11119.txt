Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon lemon juice
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease your baking sheets.
Cream the butter, sugar, 2 eggs, egg yolk and lemon juice together until fluffy.
Combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg. Add the flour mixture to the creamed mixture and stir in the chopped nuts.
On a lightly floured cloth-covered board roll the dough, 1/3 at a time, to 1/16 inch thick. Cut with a 1 inch star shaped cookie cutter. Place cookies on the prepared baking sheets. Brush the tops of the cookies with the remaining egg white, beaten until frothy.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 6 to 8 minutes.
Variations: Food coloring may be added to the egg white used to brush the tops of the cookies. Two cookies may be put together to form snowflakes with dabs of confectioners' sugar icing made with 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons cream.
