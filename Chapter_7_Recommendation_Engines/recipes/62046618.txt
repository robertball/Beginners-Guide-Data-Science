Ingredients:
2 cups cooked chicken breast, chopped
1 cup broccoli, chopped
1/2 cup red pepper, chopped
1 cup (4 ounces) shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1 clove garlic, pressed or minced
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 (8 ounce each) refrigerated crescent rolls
1 egg white, slightly beaten
2 tablespoons slivered almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Mix chicken, broccoli, bell pepper, cheese, garlic, mayonnaise, dill, and salt. Unroll one package of crescent rolls; do not seperate.  Arrange longest sides of dough across width of a 12 x 15 greased baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining crescent rolls.  Roll dough to edges of baking sheet, sealing perforations.  On longest sides of the baking sheet, cut the dough into strips 1 1/2 inches apart, 3 inches deep (there will be 6 inches in the center for the filling).  Spread filling evenly over middle of the dough.  To braid, lift strips of dough across mixture to meet in center, twisting each strip one turn.  Continue alternating strips to form a braid.  Tuck ends up to form a rim at the end of the braid.  Brush egg white over dough.  Sprinkle with almonds.  Bake 25-28 minutes or until deep golden brown.
