Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup diced onion
1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce, or more to taste
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 (8 ounce) container sour cream
cooking spray
1 (12 ounce) package wide egg noodles
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet until beef browns and onion softens, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
Add spaghetti sauce, cream cheese, and sour cream to the skillet. Mix well.
Spray a 5-quart slow cooker with cooking spray. Layer noodles, beef mixture, and cheeses in the slow cooker. Repeat layers as necessary until cooker is full.
Cover and cook on High for 2 hours. Switch to Low and cook until noodles are soft and cheeses are melted, about 2 hours more.

Description: 
I'm not sure where this recipe originated, but it's been in my family a long time, and we just love it! It's simple and quite tasty for the amount of effort it requires. We try lots of new recipes, but this one is definitely an old favorite that we keep pulling out.
