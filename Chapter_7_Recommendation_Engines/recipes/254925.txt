Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 tablespoons chia seeds
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon water
1/2 cup agave nectar
1/4 cup sucanat

1 teaspoon gluten-free vanilla extract

3/4 cup carob powder
3/4 cup brown rice flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish with cooking spray.
Place chia seeds in a blender; grind into a meal. Mix in 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon water; let stand until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add agave nectar, sucanat, olive oil, and vanilla extract; blend until combined.
Mix walnuts, carob powder, brown rice flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Pour in chia seed mixture; mix until batter is smooth.
Spread batter in the greased baking dish. Wet hands and pat down evenly.
