Ingredients:
1 cup GOYA® Organic Quinoa
1 tablespoon GOYA® Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 tablespoon GOYA® Minced Garlic
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon GOYA® Ground Cumin
1 teaspoon GOYA® Oregano Leaves
1 (8 ounce) can GOYA® Tomato Sauce
2 (15.5 ounce) cans GOYA® Low Sodium Black Beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 large green bell pepper, seeded and diced
1/2 large red bell pepper, seeded and diced
1 tablespoon GOYA® Chipotle Peppers, in Adobo Sauce, finely chopped
1 (15.5 ounce) can GOYA® Corn Kernels, drained and rinsed
Fresh cilantro

Directions:
In a medium pot, bring quinoa, 1 1/2 cups water and 1/2 of olive oil to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and let simmer for 20 minutes, until water is absorbed and quinoa is tender. Set aside.
Meanwhile, in a large pot, heat remaining olive oil on medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic, and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chili powder, cumin and oregano, and stir for about 1 minute. Stir in tomato sauce, black beans, green and red peppers, chipotle peppers and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil; then reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes, stir in reserved quinoa and corn. Cook for another 5 minutes. Serve and top with fresh cilantro sprigs.
