Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
4-6 slices bacon
Olive Oil
Kosher Salt
Freshly ground pepper
2 tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee
1 cup coconut milk
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 1/2 cups all natural cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon dried mustard
1/4 cup parmesan cheese
1/2 cup bread crumbs (your favorite)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Place cauliflower florets and bacon on a baking sheet.  Drizzle the cauliflower with olive oil and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Let roast for 20 minutes.  Add cauliflower to a 8x10 baking dish and set bacon aside on a plate.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.
In a sauce pan melt butter then add in coconut milk and cream.  Bring to a simmer then add in cheese and dry mustard.  Stir occasionally until cheese is melted and mixture is creamy.
Crumble 1/2 of the bacon and top over the cauliflower in the baking dish.  Pour cheese mixture.
Top with parmesan cheese and bread crumbs.  Drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil.  Bake for 20 minutes.
Top with remaining crumbled bacon and bake for an additional 5-7 minutes.  Remove from oven, let sit for a minute and enjoy.

It's end of summer and cleaning out the kitchen before we head back to Florida.  I spotted a head of cauliflower  and thought this recipe would go great with the BGE Ribs we are making today!

PS - We always have bacon!!!
