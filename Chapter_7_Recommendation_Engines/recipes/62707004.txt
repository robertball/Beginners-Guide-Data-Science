Ingredients:
10 Whole Strawberries (Frozen)
1/2 cup Blueberries (Frozen)
1 cup Pancake Mix
3/4 cup Water
Brown Sugar (Optional)

Directions:
Preheat a griddle or large pan to medium-high heat.
In a food processor, add the whole strawberries and pulse until all berries have become flakes. If a more even flavour (and colour) is desired, blend strawberries rather than pulsing.
In a medium bowl, mix the pancake mix and water together until it becomes a smooth batter.
Add flaked or blended strawberries to the medium bowl of batter. Add frozen blueberries and mix all together until evenly distributed.
Grease griddle/pan and pour preferred amount of batter onto it. If desired, sprinkle brown sugar on the uncooked side.***
Flip pancake over when the facedown side has become golden brown. Cook through.
Serve alongside maple syrup, butter, fresh strawberries, blueberries, banana, etc. and enjoy!

Description: 
This is a great way to sneak in some extra fruit into your breakfast - whether it be for yourself or for the kids! The strawberries add beautiful colour to the pancakes and an extra sweetness. Also great if half a banana is added to the mix. And the topping options are endless!
