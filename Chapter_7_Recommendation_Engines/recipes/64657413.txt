Ingredients:
Ingredients for the cake:
1½ cups (210g/7.5 oz.) all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
¼ teaspoon baking soda
¼ teaspoon salt
½ cup (1 stick /113g) butter, softened
¾ cup (150g/5.3 oz.) granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
¾ cup (180ml) sour cream
For the Cinnamon Filling:
? cup (65g/2.2 oz.) granulated sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
½ cup toasted* pecans, coarsely chopped, optional
For the Glaze:
½ cup (60g/2 oz.) powdered sugar
1-2 tablespoons whole milk or heavy cream
¼ teaspoon vanilla extract, optional
1½ tablespoons cream cheese, optional

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350F/180C. Grease an 8½ x 4¼-inch loaf pan.
To make the cake: In a medium bowl sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
In a mixer bowl fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as necessary. Beat in vanilla extract. Reduce mixer speed to low and mix in sour cream. Add the flour mixture and mix just until combined. Do not overmix.
To make the cinnamon filling: In a medium bowl, toss together sugar, cinnamon, and pecans until combined.
Pour ? of the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle half of the cinnamon sugar mixture into pan. Repeat with remaining batter, then cinnamon sugar, then ending with batter.
Swirl gently using a knife, but don’t overdo it to the point that the cinnamon mixture is completely mixed with the batter. Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow cooling completely on a wire rack.
To make the icing: Whisk together powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon milk, vanilla, and cream cheese until combined and smooth. If the icing is too thick, add more milk; if it’s too thin, add more sugar. The consistency should be thick but pourable. Drizzle icing over the cake.
Store cake at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days or refrigerate for up to 5 days. Cake can also be frozen for up to 2 months. To thaw, leave on the counter, still covered, or overnight in the fridge.
* To toast the pecans, place them in an even layer on a pan lined with parchment paper. Bake in a preheated oven at 350F/180C for about 8 minutes.
