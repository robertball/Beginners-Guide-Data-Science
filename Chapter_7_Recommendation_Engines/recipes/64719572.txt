Limoncello Recipe

Ingredients:
1 750 mL bottle of grain alcohol (Everclear)
Zest of 8 lemons
4 cups of water
2-1/2 of sugar

Directions:
Wash the lemons thoroughly. A produce brush works well
Zest the lemons using a micro plane.  (Smaller bits of zest will give you more surface area, and allow the lemon oils to dissolve into the alcohol.
Pour the alcohol over the zest and wait a month or so. Keep the jar in a cool, dark place, and shake it daily to mix the lemon zest with the Everclear.
When the month is up the alcohol should have taken on a very bright yellow color.  (Showing us that the lemon oils have left the zest and entered the liquid.)
Strain the lemon zest out of the alcohol.
On the stove heat the water and stir in the sugar. You don't need to boil the water, but you do need to get it hot enough so the sugar dissolves. Stir it frequently until it turns clear.
Combine the alcohol mixture with the syrup.
You can drink it right away but it is tastier if you wait a month.
