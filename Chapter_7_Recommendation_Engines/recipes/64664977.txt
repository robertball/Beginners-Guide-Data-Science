Description: 
A very moist and satisfying fudgey cake. My go-to if I'm going to make chocolate cake! During World War II, certain foods were rationed, and eggs and butter were very hard to get. This cake is the result of that work-around. My mother had the recipe since Dad was in the US Army Air Corps (predecessor of the US Air Force).
