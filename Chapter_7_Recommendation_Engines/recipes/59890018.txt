4 ounces butter
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef broth

ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and brown the ground beef quickly, then push the beef off to one side.
Stir the flour into the juices on the empty side of the pan. Pour in beef broth and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower the heat and stir in mustard. Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is tender.
Five minutes before serving, stir in the mushrooms and sour cream. Heat briefly then salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
I love this stroganoff recipe but my kids are pretty picky so I used ground beef for the meat and cut the mushrooms really small (my kids don't even know they are in there). Still tastes great and kids will love it too. My little one thinks it is white spaghetti. I like to serve over noodles shaped like their animal or character of choice.Modified from: Beef Stroganoff III
