Ingredients:
1 cup Chocolate Sweet Potato Pudding
1/3 cup rolled oats
1 cup Almond, Soy or Oat Milk
1 Tablespoon chia seeds
1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
stevia or sugar to taste
1/2 - 1 cup thawed mixed berries or raspberries

Directions:
Before bed - Mix the rolled oats, milk, chia seeds, unsweetened cocoa powder and sweetener together in a jar (or other container) Cover it and stick it in the fridge. (Make pudding if needed)
When you wake up the overnight oats will be nice and thick. Layer them with the chocolate pudding and thawed berries. I did it like this : 1/3 overnight oats, 1/2 chocolate pudding, 1/2 berries, 1/3 overnight oats, the rest of the chocolate pudding, the rest of the overnight oats and then top with the rest of the berries.
