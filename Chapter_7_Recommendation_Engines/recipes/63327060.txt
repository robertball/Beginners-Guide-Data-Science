Ingredients:
1/4 cup Sweet chili pepper sauce (such as Mae Ploy)
1/4 cup Peach preserves
1 tablespoon low sodium soy sauce
dash of your favorite hot sauce (or a couple if you like heat)
Juice of one lime or lemon
2-3 cloves minced garlic
1 teaspoon ground coriander spice (or 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro)*
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together. Place meat or fish into zip-lock bag or bowl and coat well with half the marinade. Reserve some sauce for basting while grilling. Fish only needs 30-60 minutes to marinade, but meat at least 4 hours, the longer the better. Baste meat or fish towards the last few minutes of grilling time.
