Ingredients:
1 cup dried cranberry beans
1 bay leaf
1 vegetable bouillon cube, divided
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, diced
75 grams bell pepper, diced
1 Tbsp strong dijon mustard
1 cup tomato sauce
3 Tbsp tomato paste
1.5 Tbsp cane sugar
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
1 tsp chipotle flakes
1/2 tsp smoked paprika

Directions:
1. Cover the beans with water and allow to soak for 6-8 hours.
2. Drain and rinse. Cover with water about 3 inches above the top of the beans and bring to a boil. Add the bay leaf and one half bouillon cube. Reduce the heat and simmer the beans until al dente, about forty-five minutes.
3. Drain the beans, reserving the liquid. Discard the bay leaf. Saut√© the onion and bell pepper in the olive oil. When the onion is soft and translucent, add the drained beans and stir. Add the remaining half of the bouillon cube, mustard, tomato sauce, tomato paste, cane sugar, vinegar, chipotle flakes, and paprika. Stir and simmer until the sauce has cooked down and the beans are soft but not mushy, about 20 minutes. Add some of the reserved bean stock if necessary to keep it from burning but not too much to make it soupy. Serve warm.
