Ingredients:
3 cups broccoli florets
3 cups cauliflower florets
2 Tbsp. olive oil
1/4 tsp. sea salt
1/8 tsp. black pepper
1/4 tsp. paprika
1/2 tsp. garlic powder

Directions:
1. Set air fryer to 400 degrees before you start preparing the recipe.
2. In a large microwave safe bowl cook broccoli florets for 3 minutes. Drain.
3. Add all remaining ingredients and mix well to combine.
4. Pour the veggie mixture in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 12 minutes, tossing halfway through cook time for even browning.
5. Note: The broccoli is the only thing that needs a jump start with the cooking process. The cauliflower does just fine without it.
