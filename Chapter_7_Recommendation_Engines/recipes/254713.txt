Ingredients:
1 cup unsweetened coconut
1 cup almond meal
1/3 cup coconut oil, melted
1 egg white
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon Himalayan sea salt
1/3 teaspoon stevia powder, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine coconut, almond meal, coconut oil, egg white, water, vanilla extract, Himalayan sea salt, and stevia powder in a large bowl. Let sit until coconut softens, about 10 minutes. Roll into generous tablespoon-sized balls; place on baking sheet. Flatten gently with a fork to prevent edges from crumbling.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
This is a slightly sweet cookie with a texture that reminds me of a pecan sandy. It is a perfect dessert for those on a low-carb or keto diet. For best taste, refrigerate before serving.
