½ cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced

1 tsp ground cumin
½ tsp salt
½ tsp pepper

Preheated oven to 375F.
In large non-stick ovenproof skillet, sauté beef over med-high heat, breaking up with spoon, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain off fat.
Add onion, garlic, green pepper, cumin, salt, pepper and oregano; cook over medium heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Add black beans, tomatoes and tomato paste; bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir in corn.
