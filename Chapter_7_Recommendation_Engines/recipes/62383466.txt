Ingredients:
8 oz Ziti pasta
1 T Olive oil
3/4 lb ground beef
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
28-oz can crushed tomatoes in puree
16-oz can tomato sauce
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried basil
pinch dried red pepper flakes
3 T chopped parsley
Salt, if needed
1 cup grated mozarella cheese
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to boil for the pasta.  Add salt and cook the ziti at a rapid boil for about 8 minutes until al dente. Drain well.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet.  Add the ground beef and the onion and cook over medium-high heat, stirring and breaking up the meat with the side of a spoon, for about 8 minutes until the beef loses its color.
Stir in the garlic, tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, and 2 tablespoons of the parsley.
Cook gently, uncovered, over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes.  Spoon off any excess fat.  (The sauce may be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days).
Combine the cooked pasta with the sauce.  Taste for seasoning, adding salt if necessary.
Transfer to a 2 1/2 - 3 quart baking dish.  Toss together the mozzarella, Parmesan, and remaining parsley in a small bowl.
Sprinkle cheese mixture evenly over the top of the casserole.  Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
Bake the casserole uncovered for 25 minutes until the cheese is melted and flecked with brown and the sauce is bubbly around the edges.
