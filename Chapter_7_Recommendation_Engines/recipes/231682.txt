Ingredients:
2 tablespoons dark sesame oil
1/2 pound New York steak, cut into 1/4-inch strips
1 cup frozen broccoli florets
1 cup frozen sugar snap peas
1 cup baby carrots, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
1 green bell pepper, cut into chunks
1 cup Chardonnay wine
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir steak in hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer meat to a plate and return skillet to stovetop. Cook and stir broccoli, snap peas, carrots, and bell pepper in the same skillet used to cook beef until vegetables start to become tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer vegetables to the plate with the meat; return skillet to stovetop.
Stir wine, honey, dark soy sauce, and red pepper flakes into skillet, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Stir beef and vegetables into wine mixture; simmer and stir until wine sauce is reduced, about 10 minutes.
