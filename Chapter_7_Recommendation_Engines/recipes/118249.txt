1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped green pepper

1 cup diced fully cooked ham or Polish sausage
6 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a 10-in. nonstick skillet, saute potatoes, onion and green pepper in butter until tender. Sprinkle with ham. In a bowl, beat eggs, milk, pepper and salt; add to the skillet. As the eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. When eggs are set, remove from the heat. Sprinkle with cheddar cheese; fold omelet in half. Cover; cooked for 1-2 minutes or until cheese is melted.
