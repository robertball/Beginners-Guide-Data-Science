Ingredients:
¼ cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 ½ teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
½ teaspoon chile powder
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, or as needed
2  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
3  carrots, peeled and thickly sliced
2  potatoes, peeled and diced
1  leek, trimmed and thinly sliced
1 small onion, cut into 8 wedges
1  habanero pepper, seeded and minced
2 cups water, or as needed

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, gochujang, brown sugar, garlic, sesame oil, ginger, and chile powder in a bowl for the marinade.
Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a stockpot over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to bowl with marinade and toss to coat.
Heat remaining vegetable oil in stockpot. Stir in carrots, potatoes, leek, and onion. Cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir in habanero pepper and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
Pour water into stockpot, stir in chicken and marinade, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, adding more water as desired, until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
A flavorful, spicy dish with chicken. I learned how to make this from a Korean exchange student who stayed with my boyfriend's family. Serve with white sticky rice spooned on top to dilute spiciness.
