Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped (reserve marinade)
2 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into chunks
1 large onion, quartered and sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
8 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes in juice
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/3 cup sliced black olives, drained
1/2 cup Madeira wine
8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place half the artichoke marinade into a large skillet over medium-high heat, and brown the chicken pieces until the liquid has almost evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the chicken pieces with a slotted spoon, and place into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Pour the remaining marinade into the same skillet, and cook and stir the onions, garlic, mushrooms, oregano, basil, salt, rosemary, and black pepper until the onions are translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Mix in diced tomatoes with their juice, tomato sauce, black olives, and chopped artichoke hearts. Stir the sauce well, and pour over the chicken in the baking dish. Cover the dish with foil.
Bake the chicken until the sauce is bubbling, about 45 minutes. Uncover, and drizzle the Madeira wine over the dish; top with mozzarella cheese. Return to oven, uncovered, and bake until the cheese is melted, about 10 more minutes.

Description: 
The key flavor of this guest-worthy dish is the marinade from the artichoke hearts.  Feel free to add extra veggies such as spinach, zucchini, or yellow squash. Serve over fettuccine or spaghetti noodles.
