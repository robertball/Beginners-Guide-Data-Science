Ingredients:
1 cup self-rising flour
1/2 cup butter, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
5/8 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup chopped raisins
1 1/2 cups grated apple
3 eggs
1/4 cup pineapple juice
1 tablespoon grated lime zest

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Place the flour in a bowl and mix well; rub in the butter until the pieces are the size of small peas. Stir in the cinnamon and nutmeg.
Stir in the walnuts, raisins, and apples. Add the grated lime rind, eggs, and pineapple juice. Beat well until thoroughly combined. Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the top.
Bake in preheated oven for about 1 1/4 hours, or until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Turn out and cool on wire rack.
