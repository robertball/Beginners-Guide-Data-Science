Ingredients:
1 pound boneless skinless chicken (breast or thigh)
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes w/Mexican spices
1/3 cup red enchilada sauce
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups water
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 (15 ounce) can golden hominy
3 tablespoon chopped cilantro
1 bag corn tortilla chips
Avocados (optional) for garnish
Sharp cheddar (optional) for garnish
Lime wedges (optional) for garnish

Directions:
Place tomatoes, enchilada sauce, onion, and garlic into a large pot on the stovetop. Pour in water and chicken broth, and season with cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper, and bay leaf. Cover, and bring to a simmer.  Simmer for 10 minutes.
While the broth simmers, prepare bowls of garnishes- tortilla chips, avocado tossed with a bit of lime, chopped cilantro, shredded cheese, and lime wedges.  Set garnish bowls aside.
Stir the diced chicken into the simmering broth, cover, and cook over a bare simmer for 5 more minutes.  Do not over cook!  The small pieces of chicken will poach beautifully in the broth and do not need to be dried out to be considered cooked.
Take off heat and allow to stand covered for 10 minutes.
Add the lime juice to taste and adjust salt and pepper.  Ladle into warm bowls and serve immediately with garnishes.
