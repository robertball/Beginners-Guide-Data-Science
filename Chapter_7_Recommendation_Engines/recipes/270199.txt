Ingredients:
1 cup freekeh
2 cups chicken broth
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon tahini
1 teaspoon honey
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup pomegranate seeds
1/4 cup red onion, minced
2 tablespoons minced fresh mint
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1/2 cup crushed pistachios

Directions:
Stir freekeh in a medium-sized saucepan over medium-high heat until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add broth and bring to a simmer. Cover pan and cook until water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes. Transfer freekeh to a bowl to cool.
Meanwhile, whisk vinegar, tahini, and honey together in a small bowl. Slowly drizzle in olive oil and whisk until combined. Season with salt and pepper.
Add pomegranate seeds, onion, mint, and parsley to the bowl with the cooked freekeh. Drizzle in the dressing and toss to coat. Season with additional salt and pepper, if desired. Refrigerate 30 minutes. Top with pistachios right before serving so they don't soften.
