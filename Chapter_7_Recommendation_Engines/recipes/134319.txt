Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons lard
1 cup whole milk
1 egg, well beaten
1 cup queso chanco (or Swiss cheese or Havarti), cut into 1/2-inch cubes

Directions:
Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a large mixing bowl. Combine the lard and milk in a saucepan, and heat until the milk is hot. Pour the hot milk into the flour mixture, and stir until a dough forms. Turn out onto a floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic. Cover, and allow to rest for 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Roll the dough out on a floured surface 1/4-inch thick. Cut into 4-inch rounds. Brush the outer edges of each circle with beaten egg, and fill with a small mound of cheese. Fold each circle in half to form a half-moon; press the edges with your fingers or a fork to seal. Place the empanadas onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Brush the tops with remaining egg.
Bake in preheated oven until golden-brown, about 20 minutes.
Alternatively, the empanadas may be deep fried in 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oil. If deep frying, do not brush the outsides of the empanadas with egg. Drain on paper towels.

Description: 
These empanadas use queso chanco, but a good substitute is a mixture of Swiss and Havarti. I usually bake mine, but they are really good fried. I serve these with a chile-Chile sauce.
