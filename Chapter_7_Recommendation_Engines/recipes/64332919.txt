Ingredients:
Nonstick cooking spray
Salt
4 oz Whole-wheat Macaroni
1/2 cup Onion-garlic Puree (see recipe below)
1/2 tsp Mustard
Pinch Cayenne Pepper
1 cup Shredded 50% Reduced-fat Cheddar
1/3 cup Nonfat Greek Yogurt
1/4 cup Whole-wheat Panko Bread Crumbs
1/4 cup Grated Parmesan

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Mist an 8-by-8-inch baking dish with cooking spray; set it aside.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook according to package directions, drain.
Meanwhile, bring onion-garlic puree, mustard, and cayenne to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring often. Whisk in cheddar until melted. Remove from heat and whisk in yogurt.
In a medium bowl, toss the macaroni with the cheese sauce. Season with salt to taste. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and sprinkle panko over the top. Top with Parmesan.
Bake until Parmesan is melted and macaroni is hot throughout, about 10 minutes.
