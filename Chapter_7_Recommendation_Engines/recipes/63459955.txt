1 tablespoon salt
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 cup Daisy Brand Sour Cream
1 cup sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded
2 tablespoons fresh chives, chopped
1 teaspoon salt

Place potatoes in a 3-quart saucepan; cover with cold water. Add 1 tablespoon of salt. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and cook for 20 minutes or until fork-tender. Drain the potatoes. Put pan back on burner for 1 minute, shaking the pan until the potatoes are dry. Mash the potatoes with potato masher or mixer. Add the butter, sour cream, cheese, chives and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mash or stir until mixed well.
Spoon the mixture into a casserole dish. Bake the potatoes for 20 to 25 minutes or until hot. Remove from oven and sprinkle with cheese and cooked bacon pieces. Return the dish to the oven and bake for an additional 5 minutes.
