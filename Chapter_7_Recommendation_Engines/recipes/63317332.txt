Ingredients:
2 cups rolled oats (not quick cooking)
1/2 cup flaxseed meal
1/2 cup sliced almonds
1/2 cup shredded coconut (unsweetened)
1/2 cup sweetener (agave, honey, or maple syrup, or combo)
1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
2 tbsp coconut oil or butter, plus more for greasing pan
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp coconut extract
1/2 tsp salt
5 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tsp cinnamon
1/4 cup chia seeds, optional

Directions:
Grease a 9x9 glass pan and set aside.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Combine oats, flaxmeal, almonds, coconut, and chia seeds and spread on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake in oven for 15 minutes stirring every 5 minutes.
While oat mixture is browning, in a saucepan combine sweetener, extracts, coconut oil, brown sugar, and salt. Heat on medium low while stirring until sugar has disolved, about 3 minutes.
Once disolved add in the cocoa powder and whisk until combined.
Once oat mixture is done remove from oven.
Reduce temperature to 300 degrees.
Pour browned oat mixture into large bowl and add the hot sugar mixture and mix. Pour into prepared glass baking dish and press down until it's even in pan.
Bake for 18-20 minutes.
Allow to cool for 10 minutes then cut into squares and remove from pan immediately or it will glue to the pan.

Description: 
Crisp, chewy, and chocolately granola bars straight from your own oven! Why buy mediocre-tasting packaged ones full of junk and unknown ingredients? These contain my two favorite ingredients, chocolate and coconut. This recipe is easy to customize and swap out for your favorite ingredients.
