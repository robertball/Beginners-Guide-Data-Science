Ingredients:
3 egg whites
1 tbs. white sugar
2 cups whole milk
1 cup half and half
1 pint heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2/3 cup white sugar
2 tbs. vanilla extract
1/8 tsp. salt
1/8 tsp. nutmeg (optional)

Directions:
Beat three egg whites with one tablespoon of white sugar until white and foamy.  Don't let peaks form!
Add the rest of the sugar, making sure it's thoroughly mixed with the egg whites.
Stir in the cream, half and half, and whipping cream.
Stir in the salt, vanilla, and nutmeg if desired.
The mix can be used immediately, or left to age in the refrigerator overnight.
Enjoy!
