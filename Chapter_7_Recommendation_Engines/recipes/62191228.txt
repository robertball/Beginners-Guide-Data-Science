Description: 
Smoked bacon adds zest to this bean bake, a recipe I got from my mother. I must confess that lima beans have never been among my favorite foods. But I actually like them in this casserole, and their color brightens up the mixture. -Jill Evely, Wilmore, KentuckyModified from: Picnic Bean Casserole
