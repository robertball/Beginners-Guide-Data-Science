Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package Betty Crocker ® Supermoist ® holiday swirl cake mix
1 1/4 cups water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1 cup flaked coconut
1 black gumdrop
1 green gumdrop
3 red shoestring licorice
4 chocolate chips
2 chocolate wafer cookies

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees (metal or glass pan). Grease (or lightly spray with cooking spray) bottoms only of two 8-inch or 9-inch round pans, or one 8-inch and one 9-inch round pan.
Beat cake mix, water, oil and eggs in large bowl on low speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl constantly (do not overbeat); or stir 2 minutes by hand. Pour into pans.
Bake 8-inch pans 30 to 35 minutes, 9-inch pans 25 to 30 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes; remove from pans. Cool completely, about 1 hour.
Arrange cake rounds as pictured on large aluminum foil-covered tray or cutting board. Frost with frosting. Sprinkle with coconut, pressing gently so it sticks.
Carefully cut black gumdrop for nose and eyebrows, cut green gumdrop for eyes, use licorice for mouth and muffler and chocolate chips for buttons. Place cookie on each side of head for earmuffs; attach with licorice. Store loosely covered.
