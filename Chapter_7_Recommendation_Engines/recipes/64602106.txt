Ingredients:
5 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast
3 pkg taco seasoning (Kroger Brand)
2 cans diced tomatoes with jalapenos (Kroger Brand)
1 bag of frozen diced onions (Kroger Brand)
2-3 tbsp dried Cilantro

Directions:
Layer chicken, taco seasoning, onion, tomatoes, and cilantro in crock-pot.  Cook on low for 8-10 Hours.  Shred chicken and keep warm to serve.  (I drained about a cup or so of the liquid out of the crock-pot before shredding the chicken, but left plenty for the chicken to absorb but not be too wet.)
