Ingredients:
1 lb button mushrooms
1 small chili pepper
1 medium carrot
½ red bell pepper
½ white onion

1 pinch of salt

Directions:
Wash the button mushrooms (clean them if you normally do it).
Peel the white onion, wash the red bell pepper and chili, take away the seeds out of both of them.
Finely chop the onion, red bell pepper and chili. Peel the carrot, wash and shred it.
Now: preheat the frying pan, add the cooking oil, throw in the mushrooms, season and braise at the medium heat for 5 minutes covered with lead.
Add the chili pepper and red bell pepper with onion and fry for additional 5 minutes at the medium heat without the lead.
Serve on a leave of romaine lettuce separately or with a brown rice.
Enjoy!

Description: 
It is mushroom season, and I wrote a lot about (button) crimini mushrooms lately.

Button mushrooms have an excellent amount of selenium, zinc and manganese; all three are great antioxidant minerals. Also daily intake of crimini mushrooms for 1-2 months can reduce levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and TGs.
