Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon ground paprika
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
12 chicken wings, thawed if frozen
1/3 cup hot pepper wing sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with cooking spray.
Mix flour, paprika, salt, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl.
Pat chicken wings dry with paper towels. Dip in the flour mixture until thoroughly coated. Transfer floured wings to the baking sheet; spray lightly with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven, without turning, until browned, about 48 minutes. Preheat the oven's broiler. Broil wings until crisp and browned, about 5 minutes.
Combine hot wings and hot sauce in a large bowl; toss until evenly coated.

Description: 
Father-son teamwork over the summer of 2012 produced our favorite wing recipe after many fun weeks. The wings are baked to a crispy perfection with just the right amount heat and maintain a robust flavor that will make this a recipe a favorite. Serve with sliced carrots and celery for cool crunching and blue cheese or ranch dressing for those who need it.
