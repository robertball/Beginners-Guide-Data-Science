Ingredients:
1/2 cup coconut oil room temperature
1 dark brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup plus 2 TBS flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes
1/2 cup sliced toasted almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350º and generously butter a 7 x 10 inch baking dish [8 x8 will also work]
•In a mixing bowl, cream together coconut oil and brown sugar
•Beat in eggs until fluffy
•Beat in extracts [1/2 teaspoon of almond extract is going be pretty strong, so use less if you are sensitive to the flavor]
•In a medium bowl, mix the flour, baking powder and salt.
•Mix in the dry ingredients, and then the coconut and almonds.
•Spread dough evenly in the prepared baking dish.
•Bake for 20 to 22 minutes, until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out with no more than a moist crumb or two on it.
•Cool completely, cut into 12 bars to serve.
•Store tightly sealed at room temperature for up to a week - they are even better after sitting a day or two, becoming more chewy and deeply flavored.
