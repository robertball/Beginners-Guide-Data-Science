Ingredients:
12 medium tomatillos, peeled
3 Anaheim chile peppers
2 large onions, peeled
2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
5 cloves garlic, peeled
1 bunch fresh cilantro, stems removed
2 tablespoons lemon juice
salt to taste (optional)

Directions:
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Lay tomatillos, Anaheim peppers, onions, jalapeno peppers, and garlic on a large rimmed baking sheet.
Broil in the preheated oven until tomatillos release their juices, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove tomatillos and garlic from the baking sheet; flip Anaheim peppers, jalapeno peppers, and onions and return to the oven. Continue to broil until peppers are blackened, about 5 minutes more. Remove from the oven and let cool until safe to handle, about 5 minutes.
Peel away blackened parts from vegetables without taking off too much flesh. Transfer tomatillos, Anaheim peppers, onions, jalapeno peppers, garlic, cilantro, lemon juice, and salt to a food processor and pulse until well combined and chopped. Refrigerate salsa until cold, at least 30 minutes.
