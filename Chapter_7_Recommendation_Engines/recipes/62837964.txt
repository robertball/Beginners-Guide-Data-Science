Ingredients:
1/2 Tbsp garam masala
2 Tbsp shredded coconut
1/4 tsp curry powder
1/3 cup lime juice
1/2 cup coconut milk
3-4 Tbsp coconut oil
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
4-5 garlic cloves, crushed or minced
1 lbs shrimp, raw, peeled and deveined
1 1/2 cups pineapple chunks
1 box baby bella mushrooms, whole

Directions:
1) Mix garam masala, shredded coconut, curry powder, lime juice, coconut milk, coconut oil, cilantro, and garlic cloves in large bowl.
2) Add shrimp to marinade; cover and marinate for at least 2 hours.
3) Fill a pan with water, and soak skewers (if using wooden skewers) so they don't burn when you grill.
4) Preheat grill to medium-high.
5) Lightly oil the grate, or spray with cooking spray.
6) Make skewers: alternate shrimp, pineapple, and mushrooms.
7) Brush with marinade, then grill for 2-3 minutes per side, until meat is no longer pink in the center.
(NOTE: use 2 skewers per kebab, about 1/2 inch apart, so you can turn the skewers easily while grilling.)
