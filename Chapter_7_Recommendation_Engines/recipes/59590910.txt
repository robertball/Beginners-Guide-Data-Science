Description: 
Purchase the 3 lb bulk roll of ground beef at your local grocer and double this quick and easy recipe, use one for dinner and put one in the freezer for a last minute meal.  I also caramelized my onions before placing into the meatloaf mixture, the onions seem to melt into the finished loaf.  The steak sauce in the baked on topping gives this loaf a little extra zing!Modified from: Easy Meatloaf
