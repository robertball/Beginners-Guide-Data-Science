Ingredients:
4 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup mushrooms, diced
1/4 cup shredded cooked chicken (optional)
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon chile-garlic paste (sambal oelek)
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 ounces firm tofu, drained, cut into 1/4-inch cubes (optional)
1/3 cup canned bamboo shoots, cut into matchsticks (optional)
1/4 cup white vinegar
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper, or to taste
2 tablespoons cold water
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 egg
2 green onions, diced
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil

Directions:
Bring chicken broth to a simmer in a 2-quart saucepan. Add mushrooms, chicken, soy sauce, chile paste, and garlic. Simmer for 5 minutes. Add tofu, bamboo shoots, vinegar, and white pepper. Simmer for 5 minutes more.
Combine water and cornstarch in a cup; stir until smooth. Add mixture to the soup and stir well. Let simmer until soup thickens, about 5 minutes more.
Beat egg in a cup and slowly pour, in a fine stream, into the soup. Stir well and heat through for 30 seconds. Mix in green onions and sesame oil. Remove from heat; serve hot.
