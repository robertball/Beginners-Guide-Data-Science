Ingredients:
The recipe is for marinating 2 pounds of lamb, 2 large onions quartered and separated, 2 large tomatoes, quartered and 2 medium green peppers, quartered, de-seeded and de-ribbed.
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons dry red wine
1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed and strained lemon juice
1 large clove garlic, finely chopped
1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoons salt (with a handwritten note from me saying use less)
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Mix the above ingredients and pour over the lamb and vegetables. Turn the pieces about to coat them thoroughly with the marinade. Cover and let stand at room temperature 2-3 hours or in the refrigerator 5-6 hours, turning the meat and vegetables from time to time.
Dad's notes say that a 12 lb boneless piece of lamb made 30 4-piece shishes (i.e., 120 chunks of lamb) He's pretty ruthless about cutting out ligaments and tendons
