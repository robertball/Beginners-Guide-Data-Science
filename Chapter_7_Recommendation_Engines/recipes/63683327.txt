Ingredients:
8 TB butter
3 garlic cloves, crushed
1 TB chopped parsley
----
1 1/2 lb. canned red kidney beans
1 1/2 cups white breadcrumbs
2 tb butter
1 leek, chopped
1 celery stick, chopped
1 tb chopped parsley
1 egg, beaten
salt and pepper to taste
vegetable oil, for frying

Directions:
To make the garlic butter, puyt the butter, garlic, and parsley in a bowl and blend together with a wooden spoon.  Place the garlic butter mixture on a sheet of greaseproof paper, roll into a cigar shape and wrap in the crease proof paper.  Leave to chill in the refrigerator.
Using a potato masher, mash the beans in a mixing bowl and stir in  3/4 cup of the breadcrumbs.
Melt the butter in a frying pan and saute the leek and celery for 3-4 minutes, stirring.
Add the bean mixture to the pan together with the parsley, season with salt and pepper to taste and mix well.  Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly.
Shape the bean mixture into 4 equal sized ovals.
Slice the garlic butter into 4 and place a slice in the centre of each bean patty. Mould the bean mixture around the garlic butter to encase it completely.
Dip each bean patty into the beaten egg to coat and then roll in the remaining breadcrumbs.
Heat a little oil in a frying pan and fry the patties, turning once, for 7-10 minutes or until golden.
