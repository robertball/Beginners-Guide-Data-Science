Description: 
A gooey caramel sauce made with ice cream coats the tender rolls in the breakfast treat from Sharon Donat of Kalispell, Montana. Instead of using a loaf of bread dough, thaw frozen dinner rolls and divide in thirds for faster assembly. For a little crunch, top with chopped pecans before serving.
