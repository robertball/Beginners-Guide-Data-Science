Ingredients:
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
1/4 cup very hot water
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 (8 ounce) package Neufchatel cheese, softened
3 drops green food coloring
1 limes, zested and juiced
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust

Directions:
Dissolve gelatin in hot water in small bowl.
Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form.
Mix Neufchatel cheese and green food coloring in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer on low until smooth and even in color. Add gelatin mixture and continue mixing to incorporate. Reserve a pinch of lime zest for garnishing the fishing pie; beat lime zest and lime juice into the cheese mixture. Fold the whipped cream into the cheese mixture using a spatula; spread into the prepared pie crust. Garnish with the reserved lime zest.
Cover pie loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, about 4 hours.

Description: 
This is my no-bake answer to traditional Key lime pie. It is quite rich with a more delicate lime flavor.
