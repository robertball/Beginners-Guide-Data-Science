Ingredients:
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can water
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 small carrot, diced
1 cup shredded cooked turkey breast
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 bay leaf
1/3 cup dry sherry
1/4 cup half-and-half cream
1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
2/3 cup frozen peas
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Stir the cream of chicken soup into the one soup can of water in a bowl.
Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, stir in mushrooms and carrot, and cook and stir until mushrooms start to give up their liquid and carrot begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add shredded turkey, onion powder, salt, pepper, bay leaf, and sherry to the pan and cook, stirring, another 5 minutes to reduce pan juices and cook away the alcohol from the wine.
Pour the soup over the turkey mixture and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and add the half-and-half, parsley, and frozen peas.  Simmer 5 to 10 minutes to reduce the sauce and heat the peas through.  Remove bay leaf and stir in butter just before serving.

Description: 
My boyfriend and I made a rather large turkey breast and it was just the two of us, which meant a lot of leftover turkey meat!  A few days later, I had to come up with something quick for dinner, and used things I had on hand.  It's not exactly gourmet but a good take on the nostalgic dish and everyone at work the next day said it smelled GREAT! Serve over hot buttered rice.
