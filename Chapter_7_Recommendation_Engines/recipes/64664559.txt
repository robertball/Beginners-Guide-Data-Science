Ingredients:
4 ounce – cream cheese (or can use feta cheese spread instead)
1 medium – cucumber
1/2 medium – bell pepper, yellow (or varied colors)
1/2 cup strips or slices matchstick – carrot
optional herbs

Directions:
Soften cream cheese to room temperature and mix with a spoon to soften.
Wash and dry cucumber. Using a vegetable peeler, slice into really thin strips.
Cut bell pepper into matchstick pieces. I used a quarter each of red pepper and yellow.
Spread a thin layer of cream cheese down each cucumber slice. On one end, place a handful of carrots and bell pepper, along with fresh herbs if desired.
Roll up, toothpick to hold. Chill for approximately 30 minutes in refrigerator then serve with desired dressing (Ranch, Tzatziki Cucumber or even Caesar)!
