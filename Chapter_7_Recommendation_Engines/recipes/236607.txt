Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup frozen peas
1 small onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup milk, or as needed
2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Saute peas, onion, and garlic in hot butter until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour mushroom soup over the peas mixture; add enough milk to the mixture to thicken the soup to the point of there being no lumps. Flake tuna and add to the skillet; season with salt and pepper. Cook until the mixture is warm and bubbly, about 10 minutes.
