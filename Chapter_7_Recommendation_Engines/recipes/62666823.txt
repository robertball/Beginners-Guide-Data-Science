Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
1 1/4 cups buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Add butter and mix until texture of small peas.  Add buttermilk; stir until a soft dough is formed.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and press dough into a rectangle about 3/4 inch thick and 4 inches wide. Cut into 8 even sized pieces.
Place the scones on a lightly greased baking sheet and bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown.

Description: 
Light and flaky, this scone is just fine as is, but I added chili powder, garlic powder, a little cumin and some diced chiles from a can.  Might add a little cayenne, next time, for an extra kick.  Someone said they thought there was too much baking powder but it worked perfectly for me, as written.Modified from: Buttermilk Scones
