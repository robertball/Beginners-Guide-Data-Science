Ingredients:
1 (15 oz.) box yellow cake mix
2 eggs, beaten
5 tbsp. butter, melted
1 bag (12 oz.) semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F degrees.
Spray a 9x13 baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
I love to use the kind that has flour in it.
In your mixing bowl, combine dry cake mix with melted butter and beaten eggs.
This is easier if you have an electric or stand mixer because batter will be very thick.
Stir in bag of chocolate chips.
Spread batter into greased baking dish.
What I like to do is spray my hand with some nonstick cooking spray and then spread the batter around using my hand since the batter is very thick.
Once it is evenly spread out, put in the oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes.
It will puff up as it is cooking and be golden brown around the edges when it is done.
Allow to cool.
