Grilled Steak Fries Recipe

Ingredients:
5 yukon gold potatoes, large
1 Yam or Sweet potato
2 tsps Hickory Smoked Salt or Salt
2 cloves garlic
Black pepper to taste.
Equipment:
Steamer
BBQ Grill

Directions:
Put the garlic cloves in about 1-1/2 Water in the bottom of a steamer. Set to boil. Warm up your grill. Wash the potatoes. Leave the skins on all, including the yams.
Cut the potatoes in sixths to make wedges. Easiest way: Cut the potato in half, then cut the half into triangle wedges.
Put the potatoes in a steamer for 8-15 minutes. Set the boil to low.  You want them par-cooked, not mushy.  When they still have some spring, but the end of one will break off, you're ready to put them on a tray.
On the tray, salt the potatoes.
Take the tray to the grill.  Turn the heat to med/low. You can spray a little PAM if you're worried they'll stick.  Lay the potato wedges across the grate of the grill and cook about 5 minutes a side, or until they have grill marks. Flip to the other side.
Remove and serve.

Description: 
A very light, healthy potato side dish that is steamed and grilled, not fried. I use a combo of Yukon Golds and Yams. Don't use Russets. They don't hold their integrity well and they'll dissolve on your grill.
