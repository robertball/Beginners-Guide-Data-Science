Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons curry powder
2 pounds boneless stewing beef, cut into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces
8 potatoes, cut into chunks
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 carrots, shredded
2 tablespoons minced gingerroot
1 (5.5 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 1/2 cups reduced-sodium beef broth
8 ounces green beans, chopped (thawed if frozen)
1 cup 10% cream
Salt
1/2 cup plain yogurt
Chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
Coarsely chopped almonds or peanuts (optional)

Directions:
In a 5- to 6-1/2-quart (5 to 6.5 L) slow cooker, combine flour and curry powder; add beef and toss to coat. Stir in potatoes, garlic, carrots and ginger. Whisk tomato paste into beef broth and pour over beef mixture.
Cover and cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours or on High for 4 to 6 hours or until beef is fork-tender.
Stir in green beans and cream, cover and cook on High for 15 minutes or until beans are tender-crisp. Season to taste with salt. Top each serving with a dollop of yogurt and sprinkle with coriander and almonds (if using).
