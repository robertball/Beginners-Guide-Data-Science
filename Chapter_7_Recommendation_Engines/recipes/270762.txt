Ingredients:
2  whole boneless chicken breasts, quartered lengthwise
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup water
½ cup white sugar
2  lemons, zested and juiced
1 cup sweet rice flour (mochiko)
3 tablespoons cold water, or as needed
2 cups oil for deep frying
3 tablespoons cornstarch
6 tablespoons water
1  egg yolk, beaten
2  lemons, sliced

Directions:
Season chicken with salt and pepper. Roll in flour to coat.
Mix 1 cup water, sugar, lemon zest, and juice in a saucepan. Set aside.
Mix sweet rice flour with enough cold water to make a runny, pancake-like batter. Add a pinch of salt and pepper.
Heat oil in a wok to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Dip chicken into the batter. Deep-fry, a few pieces at a time, until light golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Drain oil and keep chicken warm on a serving platter.
Place lemon mixture over medium-low heat. Dissolve cornstarch in 6 tablespoons water and pour into the saucepan. Stir until mixture reaches a syrupy thickness. Add egg yolk; stir quickly until completely combined. Remove from heat.
Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces and serve with the lemon sauce. Garnish with lemon slices.

Description: 
This is an extremely popular dish with many versions. This is my original version. It is easy to prepare. Just remember that the batter should resemble runny pancake batter and that the lemon sauce should have the consistency of maple syrup.
