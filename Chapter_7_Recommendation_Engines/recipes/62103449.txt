Description: 
These wings are sooo good!  Not spicy at all, they are definitely a favorite with kids, too.  A nice change from buffalo wings, and a perfect appetizer.  This recipe adjusts nicely for just a few people or a crowd.  I highly recommend preparing the night before to let the marinade soak in.  Enjoy!
