Ingredients:
4 boneless beef loins or New York Strip Steaks
2 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
Fresh rosemary sprigs (optional)

Directions:
Score the steaks in a diamond pattern on both sides. Mix the fresh rosemary, garlic, oil, lemon peel, and black pepper in a small bowl. Rub the mixture onto the surface of the steaks. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Grill the steaks until a thermometer inserted in the center registers 145 degrees F (for medium-rare). Cut the steaks diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices. Garnish with the rosemary sprigs, if using.
