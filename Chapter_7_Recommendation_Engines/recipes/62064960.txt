Ingredients:
Enough chicken wings to cover 2 baking sheets (single layer)
3 tbsp. Carribean Jerk Seasoning
3 tbsp. cooking oil
3 cloves garlic, diced
1 inch of peeled fresh ginger, diced
1 bunch scallions, sliced (use white part and about 2 inches of the green part)
12 jalapeno slices from jar

Directions:
Put all ingredients in blender and run it on a low speed until all the solid stuff is chopped up. The end result will be fairly thick.
Dunk the wing sections in the marinade and then put them on a baking sheet. When there's not enough marinade left for dunking, scrape out the rest and spread on remaining wings.
Cover wings with foil and let them refrigerate overnight and until you're ready to put them in the oven. Bake at 300 degrees for 2-3 hours or so.
