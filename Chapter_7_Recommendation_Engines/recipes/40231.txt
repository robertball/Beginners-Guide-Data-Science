Ingredients:
4 tablespoons McCormick® Gourmet Collection® Greek Seasoning, divided
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 whole (3-4 pounds) chicken
2 lemons, cut in half
1 medium red onion, cut into wedges
6 small Yukon gold potatoes, each cut into 6 wedges
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/3 cup pitted black olives, preferably kalamata
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon McCormick® Gourmet Collection® Coarse Grind Black Pepper
6 ounces fresh spinach, rinsed
2 ounces feta cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Mix 2 tablespoons Greek seasoning with butter.  Rub 3/4 of butter mixture under chicken skin (breasts and legs) and remaining mixture on the outside of chicken. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon Greek seasoning over outside of chicken and stuff 3 lemon halves inside the chicken cavity.
Combine onions, potatoes, olive oil and 1 tablespoon Greek seasoning.  Place chicken in a roasting pan and arrange vegetables around chicken. Roast 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 hours.
Remove chicken from oven; let rest 10 minutes.  Transfer vegetables to a large skillet.  Add olives, salt and pepper.  Cook 1-2 minutes over low heat.  Toss in spinach just before serving.  Cook 1-2 minutes or until leaves wilt. Remove from heat; gently stir in feta and juice of one-half lemon. Remove vegetables to a large platter. Carve chicken and serve over vegetables.
