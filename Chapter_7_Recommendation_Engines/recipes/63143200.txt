Ingredients:
3 pounds small whole okra pods
6 hot red or green peppers
6 large peeled garlic cloves
1 tbsp mustard seeds
1 quart white vinegar
1 1/3 cups water
1/3 cup salt

Directions:
Sterilize 6 each 1 pint canning jars.
In a large saucepan, bring vinegar, water & salt to a boil.
Wash okra & trim stems but do not cut into pods.
Pack okra, 1 pepper & 1 garlic clove tightly in each jar while dividing mustard seeds between the okra.
Pour hot vinegar mixture into each jar to within 1/2 inch of top. Wipe jar rims clean & add jar lids & rings.
Process in a hot water bath for 10 minutes. Start timing when water comes to a boil. Place several inches apart on a wire rack or kitchen towel to cool completely. Wait patiently 4 - 6 weeks!
