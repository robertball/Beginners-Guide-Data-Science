Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped
1/2 cup evaporated milk
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups quick cooking oats
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, melted
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.
In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the caramels with the evaporated milk, stirring frequently until smooth. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, oats, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt. Stir in the melted butter. Press half of the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan.
Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from the oven, and sprinkle the crust with chocolate chips and walnuts. Drizzle the caramel mixture over all. Crumble the remaining oat mixture evenly over the top, and pat down lightly.
Bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, or until the top is golden. Cool before cutting into bars.
