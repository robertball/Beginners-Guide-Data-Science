Ingredients:
3 slices bacon, diced
2 chicken breasts, diced into 1/2" cubes
1/4c diced onion
1-2 cloves garlic, minced
1/3c celery, diced
3-4 mushrooms, sliced thin
3 tbsp cream cheese
1 1/2c half & half or milk
1 tsp Italian seasoning, crushed
1 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan cheese
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
In medium frying pan, cook chicken over medium heat until nearly cooked through - about 5 minutes.
Add bacon & continue cooking until bacon is just about crisp & chicken is fully cooked, about another 4 minutes.
Add vegetables & sweat down until onion is just turning golden.
Stir in spice, salt & pepper, and blend well.
Add cream cheese, lower heat to medium-low and stir until cheese is melted.
Add 1/2c half & half, stir well.
Stir in Parmesan cheese, and add remaining half & half.
Heat through, stirring often.
If the sauce thickens too much, add more half & half, a couple tablespoons at a time.
Serve over hot pasta or rice.
*If you serve it over rice, you might want a thinner sauce - add up to 1/2c extra half & half.
