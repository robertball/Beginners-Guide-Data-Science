Ingredients:
2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed
1/4 cup roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
1/2 red onion, minced
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon light brown sugar, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 cups shredded lettuce, or to taste

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add green beans, cover, and steam until crisp-tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Drain and place into a bowl.
Combine olive oil, roasted red peppers, red onion, balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, parsley, brown sugar, salt, and pepper in a small jar with a lid. Seal and shake vigorously until dressing is well blended.
Pour dressing over green beans and mix to combine. Refrigerate for a minimum of 2 hours for flavors to combine. Remove about 1 hour before serving to allow to come to room temperature. Serve over shredded lettuce.
