Ingredients:
1/4 cup steak sauce
2 Tbsp plus 1/3 cup seasoned coating mix, divided (I use "Homemade Shake and Bake Mixture" off this site).
1/2 pound ground beef
1 pound ground turkey

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the steak sauce and 2 tablespoons of coating mix. Crumble meat over mixture and mix well. Shape into 6 even sized patties. Dip both sides of patties in remaining coating. Place on an un-greased baking sheet.
Bake at 350° for 20 minutes or until a thermometer reads 160° and juices run clear, turning once. Serve on buns with garnishes.

Description: 
A crispy coating mix is the secret ingredient that dresses up these burgers you bake in the oven instead of grill or fry. I like to use a spicy steak sauce for the best flavor. The combination of beef and turkey keeps the cost and fat content down.
