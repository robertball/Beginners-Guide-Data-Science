Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1/2 small red or green pepper, diced
1/2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and finely diced
1 clove garlic, minced
2/3 cup diced ham
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
4 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 teaspoons butter
4 small whole wheat or regular flour tortillas, warmed
1/2 cup shredded Tex-Mex or Cheddar cheese
2 green onions, chopped
Topping:
salsa (optional)
chopped fresh coriander (optional)

Directions:
In medium non-stick skillet, heat oil over medium heat; saute red and jalapeno peppers and garlic for 2 minutes or until softened. Add ham and chili powder; saute 2 minutes or until heated through. Remove to bowl; cover to keep warm.
In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk eggs, salt and pepper.
Melt butter in the same skillet on medium heat; add eggs and cook, stirring gently, until set but still soft, about 2 minutes.
Spoon eggs on each tortilla, top with ham mixture, cheese and onion. Serve with salsa and/or coriander, if desired.
