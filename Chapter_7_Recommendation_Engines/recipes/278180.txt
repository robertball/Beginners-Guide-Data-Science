Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup vanilla-flavored almond milk
1/2 cup low-fat vanilla Greek yogurt (such as CabotÂ®)
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 lemon, zested and juiced
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
1 cup blueberries

Directions:
Whisk flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl.
Mix almond milk, yogurt, egg, lemon zest and juice, and almond extract together in a separate bowl; stir in butter. Add to the flour mixture; stir just until smooth and gently fold in blueberries.
Preheat a lightly oiled griddle or large skillet over medium-high heat. For each pancake, pour approximately 1/4 cup of batter onto the hot griddle.
Cook until the pancakes start to lightly bubble and edges begin to dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until lightly browned and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes.
