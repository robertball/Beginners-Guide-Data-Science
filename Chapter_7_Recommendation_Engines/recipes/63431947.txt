Description: 
My paternal grandfather came to America from Kalamata, Greece in 1917; this recipe is based on how he taught grandmother to make his version of chicken and sauce to serve over pasta. They had a large family so this serving amount was standard for them but I stick to this amount because the leftover chicken and sauce freezes beautifully for future meals. Serve with a Greek salad and don't forget a side of feta, Kalamata olives and wedges from the oranges you used to grate the rind from ;-)
