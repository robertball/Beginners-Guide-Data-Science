1/2 cup coconut flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 tablespoon granulated garlic
1 tablespoon ground paprika

1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 1/2 pounds bone-in center-cut pork chops
2 tablespoons coconut oil, or as needed

Directions:
Mix coconut flour, cornstarch, granulated garlic, paprika, flaxseed meal, parsley, baking powder, sugar, onion powder, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl.
