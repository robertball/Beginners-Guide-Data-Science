Description: 
Amy Fecher from Beavercreek, Ohio shares the colorful taco salad that is her husband's favorite meal. 'Because it is simple and he looks forward to it so, I find myself fixing this at least once a month,' she says. 'And for those brisk fall days, spicier chili beans can add some welcome heat.'
