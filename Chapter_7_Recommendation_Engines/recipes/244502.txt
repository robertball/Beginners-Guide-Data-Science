1 cup frozen peas
1/2 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Pour whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 3 cups of cold water into the pan, ensuring that the water covers the pasta. Add peas and turn the burner to high, then set your timer for 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste).
Once liquid has evaporated by half, add cream and continue to cook.
When most of the liquid has evaporated, remove skillet from heat and stir in bacon, garlic powder, and cheese. Serve immediately.
