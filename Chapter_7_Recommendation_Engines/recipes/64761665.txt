Ingredients:
Filling:
2 small tart apples, cored and sliced thinly
2 tbsps pure maple syrup
1/2 tsp lemon juice
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/8 tsp ground nutmeg
1/8 tsp ground allspice
Pinch of salt
Topping:
2 tbsps rolled oats
2 tbsps whole wheat flour
1 tbsp pure maple syrup
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
Pinch of salt
1 tbsp unsalted butter, softened

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease 2 8-oz ramekins and place them on a baking sheet.
2. In a medium bowl, combine all the filling ingredients. Toss to combine, and thoroughly mix. Divide mixture between the two prepared ramekins.
3. In a small bowl, combine rolled oats, flour, maple syrup, cinnamon, and salt until thoroughly combined. Cut in the softened butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Divide topping mixture evenly between the two ramekins.
4. Place baking sheet with ramekins into preheated oven and bake 25-30 minutes, or until apples are tender and the topping is slightly browned. Cool 10-15 minutes before serving.
Note: The apples I used for this recipe were not very juicy. If your apples are on the juicier side, you may want to add 1/2-1 tsp of flour or cornstarch to the filling to help it set up better. Also, make sure to slice your apples approximately 1/8" or smaller to ensure they cook properly.
