Ingredients:
4 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 cup milk
1/2 cup margarine
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large bowl combine 2 cups flour, sugar, salt, and yeast.
Heat the milk with the butter or margarine until it reaches 115 degrees F (43 degrees C). Beat together with the eggs and vanilla. Then add the liquid mixture to the flour mixture. Beat at low speed with an electric mixer until flour is moistened. Increase speed to medium, and beat for 2 minutes. By hand stir in the remaining flour to make a medium stiff batter. Cover, and let rise for 1 hour.
Punch dough down, and place it in a greased 10 inch tube pan, cover and let rise for 45 minutes.
Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool in pan for 5 minutes, then remove.
