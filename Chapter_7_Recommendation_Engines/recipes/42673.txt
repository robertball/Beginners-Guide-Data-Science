Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups white sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup corn syrup
1 1/3 cups water
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (0.13 ounce) package unsweetened, fruit-flavored soft drink mix

Directions:
Butter 2 large baking sheets, and set them aside.
In a medium saucepan, stir together the sugar and cornstarch. Add corn syrup, water, butter and salt, and stir to blend. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and cook until the mixture reads 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) on a candy thermometer. Remove from heat, and immediately stir in the drink mix powder. Quickly pour out onto the prepared baking sheets, and let stand until cool enough to handle.
Grab a few helpers, and butter everyone's hands. Stretch (pull) the taffy until it lightens in color, and becomes firm. Roll into bite size pieces, and wrap in small squares of waxed paper.

THE SCONE
Description: 
This recipe is soft and can be made in a wide variety of flavors.  I think the secret to the softness is the corn starch.  I hope it works out for you.
