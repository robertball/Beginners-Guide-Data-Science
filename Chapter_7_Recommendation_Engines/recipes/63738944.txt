Title:
Lemon Cream White Wine Reduction for Seafood or Chicken Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 Tbls Olive Oil
1 Onion (Coarsely Chopped)
1/2 Cup White Wine
1/2 Cup Heavy Whipping Cream
2 Tbls Butter
2 Tsp Fresh Lemon Zest
1 Lemon (juice)
2 Tbls Parsley (Finely Chopped)

Directions:
With medium heat, add olive oil to your favorite skillet.
Add onion and saute for 2 min (until translucent)
Add white wine (you get what you pay for)
Add heavy whipping cream
Increase heat to high until mixture is boiling.  (Note: This boiling process burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor of the white wine, so no need to worry about the kids)
When the mixture has reduced to about half of its original volume (5-6 min), strain the mixture into a bowl to remove the onions and return the sauce back to the skillet. (Note: This is a good point to pause if you need to focus on other things)
Return the skillet to the stove on medium heat.
Add butter and remove the skillet from heat once the butter has melted.
Add lemon zest
Squeeze lemon juice from 1 lemon (Note: Watch for seeds/pulp if you don't have cheesecloth)
Add parsley and serve immediately (Note: Sauce can be reheated if your timing isn't perfect, but reheat before you add the parsley)
