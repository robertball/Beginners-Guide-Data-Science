Ingredients:
2 slices of bread
1 tbsp butter
1 large egg
1 ounce smoked gouda cheese
1 Tbsp bacon bits
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat skillet or griddle over medium-low heat.
Butter all four sides of the bread.  Set bread slices on hot skillet.
While bread is toasting on the skillet, beat egg in a bowl and cook for one minute on high in microwave.
Flip bread slices over and cover both sides with cheese slices.  Sprinkle with bacon bits and place cooked egg on one slice.
Close sandwich and cook both sides until golden brown.

Description: 
Fast, easy egg and cheese sandwich for breakfast or anytime.  Use any cheese you like.  Smoked gouda just happens to be my favorite.  I like the smokiness it adds to the sandwich.
