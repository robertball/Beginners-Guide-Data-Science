1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard

Description: 
This recipe uses cultured coconut milk as a substitution for buttermilk and mayonnaise in a dill-flavored, creamy salad dressing. Enjoy! I found an alternative to dairy-based yogurt. Cultured coconut milk is not as thick as yogurt, but it works as a sub for buttermilk and mayonnaise in a traditional ranch-style salad dressing or dip. It's not a perfect sub, but for anyone who is avoiding dairy, it's worth a try. Look for this product in the yogurt section of your grocer. It's also great in smoothies!
