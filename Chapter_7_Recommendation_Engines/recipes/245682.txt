Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped
2 small jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
4 cups water
2 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped into 2-inch pieces
2 (15 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, drained
2 (15 ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup peanut butter
1 (15 ounce) can sliced green beans, drained

Directions:
Place onion, jalapeno peppers, garlic, ginger, cumin, salt, coriander, cinnamon, and red pepper flakes in a large slow cooker. Pour in water and stir to combine. Mix in sweet potatoes, tomatoes, chickpeas, and peanut butter.

Description: 
I came across an African sweet potato stew recipe a few years ago, and adapted it to suit our taste. It is very flavorful and just a bit spicy - just right for cold days! This recipe makes a lot of stew, so it may be halved for a smaller portion, but also freezes very well.
