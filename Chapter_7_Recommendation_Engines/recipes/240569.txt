Ingredients:
2 tablespoons bacon grease
2 pounds venison, cut into chunks
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon anchovy paste
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup red wine
1 cup beef broth
1 cup chicken broth
1 teaspoon ground thyme
2 bay leaves
1 pound small red potatoes, chopped
4 carrots, chopped
1/2 cup sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup frozen peas
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Heat bacon grease in an oven-proof pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir venison in the hot grease until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer venison to a plate using a slotted spoon. Add onion to hot grease; cook and stir until tender, 4 to 5 minutes.
Mix garlic, tomato paste, and anchovy paste together in a small bowl; add to onions. Stir flour into onion mixture until dissolved.
Pour wine, beef broth, and chicken broth into the pot; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Add thyme and bay leaves to pot and bring liquid to a simmer. Return venison to pot. Cover pot.
Simmer stew in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Add potatoes, carrots, and mushrooms to stew and simmer in the oven until potatoes are tender, about 1 hour more. Add peas and stir.
