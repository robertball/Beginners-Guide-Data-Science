Place pan on a square of heavy-duty aluminum foil; wrap foil around sides of pan to create a watertight jacket. Place pan in a larger pan and fill larger pan 2 inches deep with water. Bake 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until center of cake begins to feel firm to the touch. Remove from oven. Remove foil and place pan on a wire rack to cool about 45 minutes. Cover cake, leave on wire rack (so that air circulates) and chill at least 5 hours before serving. To finish; Decorate with fresh berries.
