Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup sugar
1 egg
1 cup finely shredded zucchini
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
LEMON GLAZE:
2 cups confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg, zucchini and lemon peel. Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Stir in raisins and walnuts.
Drop by tablespoonfuls 3 in. apart onto lightly greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.
For glaze, combine sugar and enough lemon juice to achieve a thin spreading consistency. Spread or drizzle over cooled cookies.

Description: 
When we lived on the East Coast, a nearby fruit and vegetable stand had a bakery featuring these soft cake-like cookies. We missed every bite when we moved away, so I developed this recipe.
