Ingredients:
2/3 cup light molasses
1/2 cup margarine, softened
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 egg
2 teaspoons lemon zest
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 (8 ounce) container low-fat sour cream

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two 24-cup mini muffin pans.
Combine molasses, margarine, white sugar, brown sugar, egg, lemon zest, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves in a large bowl. Beat using an electric mixer at medium speed until well mixed. Add flour and sour cream; continue beating until well mixed.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 10 to 12 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before removing from the pans.
