Ingredients:
1 medium head green cabbage
1/2 cup long-grain white rice, uncooked
1 pound hamburger
1 small onion, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoon dried (leaf) oregano
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried sweet basil
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 (28 oz) can whole tomatoes
10 slices American cheese or 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Slaw the cabbage into a 9x13 inch pan. Sprinkle with rice.
Brown hamburger and drain.  Add onion, oregano, garlic powder, basil, and thyme. Cook until onion becomes transparent. Add salt, pepper and sugar.
Sprinkle seasoned hamburger over the cabbage-rice layer.
Break up the tomatoes and pour over the hamburger-cabbage-rice.
Bake covered 1 hour and 15 minutes.
Remove from oven. Place slices of cheese over the top. Let it sit uncovered to melt the cheese and absorb the juices, about 15-20 minutes.

My mom made this many times for Saturday dinner when we were growing up. It is quick to prep and makes a satisfying meal with fresh bread.
