Ingredients:
2 cups whole milk
2 cups water
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 cup polenta or yellow cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 ounces grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Whisk polenta or cornmeal with cold water.  In a large pot over medium-high heat, bring milk, polenta, mixed w/water, and salt to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, and cover. Cook 20 minutes, until creamy, lifting the lid and stirring every 3 or 4 minutes to prevent sticking. Remove pot from stove, stir in pepper and butter. Gradually stir in cheese. Serve.
