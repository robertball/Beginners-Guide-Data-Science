Fry corn tortillas into a taco shape. when you take the taco out of the oil roll it in the parmesan cheese until fully coated and then set aside on a paper towel lined plate. Continue until you have the amount of shells you need (this recipe makes 12 for me). In a seperate pan heat up beans and add 1/4 cup of cheese to them. Place tomatoes and avocados in seperate bowls for topping tacos. Take a flower tortilla and put the parmesan taco inside of it. Layer the beans on the bottom of the parmesan taco, then the ground beef and top with cheese, sour cream, avocado and tomato and serve.
