Ingredients:
1 pound bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces
2 onions, chopped
5 pounds ground beef
5 pounds spicy ground pork sausage
3 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach , thawed, drained and squeezed dry
3 (4 ounce) cans sliced black olives, drained
3 cups pistachio nuts, chopped
1 cup ketchup
3 eggs
1 (1.25 ounce) packet meatloaf seasoning mix
1 pound pepper jack cheese, cubed
1/2 cup ketchup, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place bacon in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions, and cook, stirring frequently, until bacon is crisp and onions are transparent. Drain off excess grease, and set aside to cool.
In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, pork sausage, bacon and onions, spinach, olives, pistachio nuts, 1 cup of ketchup, eggs, and meatloaf seasoning until well blended. Pat meat into a loaf shape, and place in a large baking pan. A roasting pan will work well. Poke cheese cubes into the top of the loaf so they are completely covered. Brush remaining ketchup generously over the top.
Bake for  1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven, or until the internal temperature of the loaf is 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).
