Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups sifted whole wheat flour
1/2 cup dry milk powder
1 cube beef bouillon, crumbled
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup cooked ground pork
1 cup grated carrot
6 tablespoons shortening
1 egg
1/2 cup cold water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil two cookie sheets.
In a medium bowl, stir together the whole wheat flour, milk powder, beef bouillon, and salt. Add the ground pork, carrot, shortening and egg; mix in to the flour mixture while gradually adding water to form a stiff ball of dough.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters, and reroll scraps until no dough is left. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bottoms of the cookies are browned. Allow cookies to set for a few minutes on the cookie sheet before removing to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
Although my dog died three years ago he loved these and I still make them for neighbors dogs.  Bacon grease or meat drippings can be used in place of shortening, and any type of cooked meat may be used in place of pork.
