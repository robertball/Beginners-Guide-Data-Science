Ingredients:
1 cup self-rising flour
1 cup granulated sugar
1 stick salted butter, softened
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
4 medium Grannysmith apples, cored and sliced

Directions:
1)  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease a 9x9 casserole baking dish with butter or vegetable shortening.
2)  Place sugar, flour, softened butter, and cinnamon in a medium-sized bowl.  Use a pastry blender or a fork to blend the ingredients until they are crumbly, but will loosely maintain its form when squeezed together in the palm of your hand.
3)  Reserve 3/4 cup of the mixture to use as a topping.
4)  Sprinkle a light layer of the flour mixture on the bottom of the baking dish.  Then alternate layers of apples and the flour mixture ending with a layer of apples on top.
5)  Sprinkle the top layer of apples with the reserved 3/4 cup of topping mix.
6)  Bake at 350 degrees F. for 30 to 35 minutes.  If topping begins to brown too soon (before apples are tender), loosely cover with aluminum foil.  Allow cobbler to cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This super-easy cobbler is great for unexpected company or spur-of-the-moment cravings.  The juice from the fruit cooks out to produce enough moisture to make this cobbler delicious.  You can also use fresh peaches instead of apples.
