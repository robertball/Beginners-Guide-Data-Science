Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1-1/2 cups sugar, divided
2 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup sour cream
1 cup chopped pecans, toasted
1 tablespoon grated lemon peel
1/4 cup lemon juice

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream butter and 1 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with sour cream, beating well after each addition. Fold in pecans and lemon peel.
Transfer to a greased 9-in. x 5-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350Â° for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
In a small saucepan, combine lemon juice and remaining sugar. Cook and stir over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Pour over warm bread. Cool completely on a wire rack before removing from pan.
