Ingredients:
Ingredients:
3 large sweet potatoes, cut into wedges
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp cumin
dash cayenne pepper
1/4 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp salt or seasoned salt

Directions:
Preparation:
Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees.
In a large bowl, toss together all ingredients until potatoes are evenly coated with oil and spices.
Place potatoes on a single layer on a baking sheet and bake for about 30 minutes, or until done.
I really like to eat these plain, but you could serve with ketchup, a ranch dressing dip or barbecue sauce. Enjoy your baked sweet potato fries!
