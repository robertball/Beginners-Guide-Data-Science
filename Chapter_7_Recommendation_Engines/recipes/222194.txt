Ingredients:
1 French baguette, cut into diagonal 1/2 inch slices
extra virgin olive oil
4 ounces high-quality dark chocolate, broken into 1-inch pieces
1 tablespoon flaked sea salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
Arrange baguette slices in a single layer on the baking sheet. Place under broiler until golden, 2 minutes. Turn each slice over and broil 2 minutes. Turn off broiler.
Turn each slice over again; drizzle with olive oil. Push chocolate piece into the center of each slice and return baking sheet to oven for 2 more minutes. Remove from oven and lightly sprinkle each chocolate piece with sea salt.

Description: 
For this to work as a savory bite, the chocolate must be very dark, bittersweet, and world-class. Look for names that are hard to pronounce. Labels with percentage symbols are always a good sign (the higher the percent, the better).
