Ingredients:
2 cups quick cooking oats
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup honey
4 egg whites
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup fresh blueberries or frozen blueberries

Directions:
Combine oats, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Set aside. Mix honey, egg whites, milk, coconut oil, vanilla extract in a separately bowl. Stir the oat mixture into the egg mixture and mix well.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and top with blueberries. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
