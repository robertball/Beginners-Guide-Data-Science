Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
2 medium size vine ripened tomatoes
2 ripe avocados
Alfalfa and Clove Sprouts
Salt and pepper
Chimichurri Sauce:
1 cup (packed) fresh Italian parsley
1/2 cup olive oil
1/3 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup (packed) fresh cilantro
2 garlic cloves, peeled
3/4 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Chimichurri Sauce:
Combine all ingredients for Chimichurri sauce and blend until smooth.  I adapted this recipe from Epicurious.com and used 1.25 cups of parsley in place of the 1 cup parsley and 1/4 cup cilantro.  Either way will work.  You can cover and save any extra chimichurri sauce.
Chicken:
Salt and pepper both sides of chicken breasts.  Place on a grill over medium heat and cook until internal juices run clear.  Remove and allow to sit for a few minutes before slicing.
To plate:
Cut avocados in half and remove pit.  Thinly slice avocado and arrange 1/2 in the middle of each place.  Add a layer of sliced tomato and then a handful of alfalfa and clove sprouts.
Top 1 sliced chicken breast per plate (1 inch thick pieces) and then spoon Chimichurri sauce over the top.
