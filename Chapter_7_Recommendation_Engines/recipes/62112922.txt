2 1/4 cups flour
2 1/4 tsp. baking powder
1/3 cup softened butter
2/3 cup white sugar
3 eggs
3 squares semi-sweet chocolate, melted and cooled
1 tsp. freshly grated orange peel
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees.

Beat butter and sugar with mixer until smooth. Beat in eggs, then chocolate, orange peel, and vanilla. Add in flour mixture and hazelnuts until well-blended.
Divide dough in half and wrap in plastic; refrigerate 3 hours or till firm.
Beat egg white until broken up. Lightly grease, or spread parchment paper over, a large cookie sheet. Put both pieces of dough on sheet, 4 inches apart. Shape into 12"x3" logs. Brush with egg white.
Bake 25-30 minutes, till firm in the center. Remove and cool for 10 minutes. Cut logs on cutting board with large serated knife. Arrange slices on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 8-10 minutes, turning slices over once, till dry and toasted.
