Description: 
This cocktail was invented in May 2013 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Its name, ingredients, and colour are inspired by the eponymous Ikea® product. The recipe is the outcome of a rhetorical question posed while assembling Ikea® furniture 'If the Lekman were a drink, what would be in it?.'
