Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground turkey (or beef)
1/2 cup crushed oatmeal
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese or velveeta
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons steak sauce
2 tablespoons yellow mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir the ground beef, oatmeal, cheese, and onion soup mix in a large bowl until well combined.  Whisk the eggs, ketchup, mustard and steak sauce in a separate bowl until smooth.  Mix the eggs into the meat until evenly combined, if the mixture seems too dry, add a little milk (or water). Press into a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Bake in preheated oven until the meatloaf reaches 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) and is no longer pink in the center, 45 to 60 minutes.
