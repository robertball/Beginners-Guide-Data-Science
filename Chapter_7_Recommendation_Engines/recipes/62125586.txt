Description: 
This is great for entertaining.  It can go right in the center of the table with some crusty french bread.  The eating experience starts with sipping the butter sauce off the shrimp, then shelling, then eating the luscious shrimp and dipping the bread in the sauce.  It is served in my parts for all occasions.
