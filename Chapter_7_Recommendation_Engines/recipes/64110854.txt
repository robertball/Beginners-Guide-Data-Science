Ingredients:
4 large yellow or Vidalia onions, sliced
6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon sugar
2 quarts beef broth
1/2 cup brandy
1 French baguette, sliced and toasted
Gruyere and Emmenthaler cheese

Directions:
Slice onions in thin slices.  In a large Dutch add enough olive oil to coat the pan and then add the onions.  Cook over medium heat for 12 minutes, until they are tender and golden.  Stir often.
Add the brandy if desired and let the alcohol burn off.
Add sugar and beef broth, cover and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 12 minutes.
To serve, ladle soup into a bowl.  Place a slice of baguette on top.  Cover with shredded Gruyere and place slices of Emmenthaler over that.
Place the bowls on a baking pan and broil until the cheese is melted.
