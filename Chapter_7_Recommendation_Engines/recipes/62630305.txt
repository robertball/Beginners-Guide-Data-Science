Ingredients:
½ Cup non-fat powdered Milk
1 egg, beaten
1½ cups rice flour
¾ Tablespoon Honey
½ Cup + 2 Tablespoons Water
3.5 oz Package of Organic Roasted Apple and Blueberry Baby food.

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease two baking trays (I use my Pampered Chef large size stone ware bar pans).
Combine all ingredients (reserving the 2 Tablespoons water) and mix well.  If required add the extra 2 tablespoons of water (I always find that my dough does need this water).
Kneed dough on a floured board for at least 1 minute.  Roll to ½
inch thickness and cut using your desired cookie cutter.
Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes.  Once you have reached this time turn off the oven, but leave the biscuits in the oven for a further 30 minutes for extra crispness.
Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.  Store once cooled in an airtight container.

Description: 
For this simple and easy fruity recipe, I used the sprout brand of Organic Baby food, available at most retailers.  Or simply use any similar size baby food to make numerous flavored doggy treats!
