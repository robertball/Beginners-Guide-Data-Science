Ingredients:
salt to salt water
1/2 pounds peas, snow strings removed
2 1/2 teaspoon oil, canola divided
2 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce, less sodium divided
1/2 tablespoon ginger, fresh minced
3/4 pounds chicken, breast, boneless, skinless
1 medium scallion(s) (green onions) sliced
1 teaspoon oil, dark sesame

Directions:
Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. Fill a medium mixing bowl with ice and water. Boil snow peas for 2 minutes, drain, and place in ice water for 1 minute to chill. Drain and pat dry.
Combine 1 teaspoon of the canola oil, 1 teaspoon of the soy sauce, and ginger in a shallow bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat.
Heat remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons canola oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden and no longer pink inside, 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and slice.
Combine snow peas, scallions, sesame oil, and remaining 1 teaspoon soy sauce in a medium bowl; toss together. Divide snow pea mixture between two plates and top each with half of the sliced chicken.
