1 tablespoon sugar
1 onion, finely chopped
1 large apple - peeled, cored and diced

1/2 cup vegetable broth
4 tablespoons cider vinegar
salt to taste
fresh-ground black pepper
2 tablespoons lingonberry jam (optional)

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pan. Add sugar and stir until it has a light caramel color, about 5 minutes. Add onion and apples; cook and stir until the onions start to soften, about 5 minutes. Add cabbage and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Stir in broth, apple cider vinegar, and salt. Cover and simmer until flavors are well combined, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and stir in lingonberry jam towards the end of the cooking time if desired.

Description: 
Red cabbage with apples is a traditional German side dish for pork roast and other roasts, Christmas goose, turkey, and game. It tastes even better when reheated so I usually make it the day before. It is a staple on most people's home for Christmas dinner.
