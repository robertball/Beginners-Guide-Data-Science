Ingredients:
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 pounds venison roast

2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups water

Directions:
Mix half the taco seasoning with the flour and cayenne pepper to taste and coat the meat with this mixture. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Place the roast in the oil and brown well on all sides.
Place the meat in a slow cooker with the water and cook on low setting for 8 hours or on high setting for 5 hours. When meat is done, shred with a fork and season to your taste.

Description: 
I use a venison roast with taco seasonings to make shredded venison tacos. It's a great alternative to beef and my family just loves them. Serve with the taco shells, lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, taco sauce and anything else you like on your tacos.
