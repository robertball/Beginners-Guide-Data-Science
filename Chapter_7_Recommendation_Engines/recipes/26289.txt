Ingredients:
1/2 pound dry kidney beans, soaked overnight
1 (16 ounce) package uncooked spaghetti
salt to taste

Directions:
Rinse beans and place in a large pot.  Cover with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until beans are tender, about 1 hour; add more water as necessary to prevent drying out and scorching.
When beans are tender, add spaghetti and cook until al dente.  Season with salt to taste.

Description: 
This dish has been in my family for as long as anyone can remember. Since I am from Louisiana people eat red beans with rice, not with spaghetti; needless to say none of our friends enjoy this meal.  Do not add meat.
