Ingredients:
3 cups margarine, softened
2 1/2 cups white sugar
2 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 eggs
8 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
4 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together margarine, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, and salt.  Add to egg mixture, and mix well. Stir in chocolate chips. Instead of just dropping them onto the cookie sheet, I roll the cookies into balls - it makes them all look very uniform and nice!
Bake in preheated oven for 12 to15 minutes, or until light brown. Cool on a wire rack.

This recipe was such a hit when I was at college, my roommates still call and ask for it. You may add more chocolate chips if you really like chocolate!
