Ingredients:
MEAT FILLING:
2-1/2 lbs. your choice of meat:  Southern sausage, ground beef, and/or ground chicken
1 box uncooked Spanish rice (Rice-a-roni) & the seasoning packet
1 beaten egg
¼  green pepper, chopped
½ cup chopped onion (OPTIONAL)
½  can of Rotel - diced tomatoes & green chili peppers (save the other half for the sauce, below)
1 Tbsp. Montreal steak spice
½ Tbsp. salt
1 head of cabbage (having been frozen then thawed, and the leaves gently removed)
COOKING SAUCE (this will be discarded after cooking):
1 medium can of tomato sauce
Enough water to submerge the cabbage rolls
SERVING SAUCE:
½ can Rotel (tomatoes and green chiles)
1 jar of marinara or spaghetti sauce

Directions:
Combine all the ingredients except the cabbage.
Spoon about 3 tablespoons of the meat mixture into the base of one cabbage leaf, roll once, turn the sides in, then keep rolling; place loose end down in pan or crock-pot.
Continue until you either run out of meat or run out of leaves!
Pour a medium can of tomato sauce over all the cabbage rolls and then add enough water so that they're all submerged.
Cook in the crock-pot on high for two hours or on the stovetop (low) for one hour.
Now, discard the cooking liquid (it's too fatty to eat).
Add the “serving sauce” over the cabbage rolls and cook another half hour.
Serve with mashed potatoes.

Description: 
This is, to me, a “comfort food”  something mom used to make regularly.  But my sisters and I have added a zesty twist, and that is, we make it with Spanish rice and Rotel.  This makes a large dinner and you’ll still have enough left over to freeze.  It’s great served with mashed potatoes.  A tip:  Whenever you find a head of cabbage on sale, buy it, wrap it up and freeze it until you're ready to make this wonderful recipe.  Thaw it out, and the leaves will be perfect for use.
