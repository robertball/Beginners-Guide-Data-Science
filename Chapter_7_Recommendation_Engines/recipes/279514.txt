1 ½ cups freshly squeezed lemon juice, divided
4 (3 ounce) packages unflavored gelatin
4 ½ cups white sugar, divided

Description: 
These homemade citrus marshmallows are sorta like what might happen if store-bought Peeps wanted to give adulting a try. Fresh-squeezed juice provides an upgrade in the flavor department (very fancy-pants), but dusting them in granulated sugar gives you that subtle familiar crunch you love about biting into the original. Make these for Easter--or for a Tuesday!
