Ingredients:
3 small russet potatoes, peeled
1 head garlic, peeled and crushed
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/3 cup lemon juice
1/2 cup canola oil

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl; mash until smooth. Set aside to cool.
Put garlic, salt, and lemon juice in a blender or food processor; pour in enough olive oil to lightly coat garlic cloves. Blend mixture on high; slowly stream remaining olive oil through the top opening of the blender or food processor until mixture is smooth. Add mashed potatoes, about 2 to 3 tablespoons at a time, to the garlic mixture while blender is still running. Continue adding potatoes until all are incorporated. Transfer sauce to a bowl and refrigerate until chilled, 1 hour to overnight.

Description: 
Heavenly spread for meat, fish, sandwiches, and burgers. They serve this at my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant. Finally got the recipe! This is heaven as a dip with pita bread, but everyone in your party has to have some. Serious garlic!
