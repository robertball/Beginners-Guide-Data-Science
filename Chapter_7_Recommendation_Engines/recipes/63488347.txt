Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound ground beef
1 can Ro-tel tomatoes, drained, with...
enough salsa to equal 2 cups
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper
1 (8.5 ounce) box dry corn muffin mix (such as JiffyÂ®)
1 egg
1/3 cup milk
3 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
2 ounces shredded Monterrey Jack cheese, divided
4 ounces frozen corn, thawed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spray a 8X8-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
Cook and stir ground beef in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until meat starts to brown and release juices, about 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium and stir in Ro-tel, salt, salsa, Italian seasoning, and chipotle powder; cook and stir until seasoned beef is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Mix corn muffin mix in a large bowl with 1 egg and 1/3 cup of milk. Whisk to combine. In a separate large bowl, mix half corn muffin mix with 1/2 cheese.
Spread the prepared corn muffin mixture without cheese into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle corn over the muffin mix, followed by remaining half of the cheeses, then the beef mixture.
Spoon the corn muffin mix with cheese on top of the beef and carefully spread over the top with a fork, leaving about half an inch from the edges of the pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, until golden brown.

Description: 
While this tamale pie has very little to do with its south-of-the-border namesake, it's a really delicious recipe all the same.Modified from: Hot Tamale Pie
