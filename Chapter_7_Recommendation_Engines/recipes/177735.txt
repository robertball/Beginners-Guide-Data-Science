1 (10 ounce) package Pepperidge Farm® Puff Pastry Shells
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 mango, peeled, seeded and diced
2 tablespoons packed brown sugar

1/4 cup toasted shredded coconut
Mango slices or mint sprigs (optional)

Directions:
Bake, cool and remove the 'tops' of the pastry shells according to the package directions.
Place the cream cheese, mango, brown sugar and lime zest into a food processor.  Cover and blend until the mixture is smooth.  Spoon the cream cheese mixture into a medium bowl.  Fold in the whipped topping.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Divide the cream cheese mixture among the pastry shells.  Sprinkle with the coconut and top with the mango slices, if desired.
