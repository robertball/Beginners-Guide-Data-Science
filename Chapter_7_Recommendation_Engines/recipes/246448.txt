Ingredients:
12 ounces penne or fusilli pasta
4 cloves garlic, sliced
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 cups broccoli florets
2 cups cauliflower florets
½ teaspoon salt
⅔ cup low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth
2 tablespoons butter
1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
¼ teaspoon black pepper
½ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Cook pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water 2 minutes less than directed on package. Drain.
Meanwhile, cook garlic in oil in a large lidded pot over medium heat until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Add broccoli and cauliflower and cook 1 minute. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon salt, and cook, covered, 3 minutes. Add broth, butter, beans, pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and cook until beans are warm and sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.
Add pasta and cook, stirring, until heated through, about 1 minute. Sprinkle with cheese.

Description: 
Many children, especially picky eaters, love pasta loaded with plain butter--a dish that clearly earns low marks on the health scale. This great alternative adds fiber and protein with beans, which kids actually love!
