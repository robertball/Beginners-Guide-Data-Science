4 Ears of corn, shucked and cleaned
1/2 cup unsalted butter sticks
4 teaspoons salt
4 teaspoon pepper (optional)

Directions:
Shuck the corn and clean of all fibers.
Place each corn in aluminum foil (enough to roll and cover completely).
Place 1/4 tablespoon butter slice on one side of corn.  Gently spread along base of corn careful not to tear foil.  Repeat on other side of corn.
Add 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper (if desired).
Carefully roll corn in foil to completely cover (careful not to tear foil).  Twist ends of foil to contain butter.
Place on top rack of BBQ grill for 15 to 20 minutes, turning 1/4 turn every few minutes.
Remove and let cool for 5 minutes before tearing away foil.

Description: 
There is nothing better than buttery, grilled corn on the cob.  This recipe never fails to please, and it is super easy to make.  As long as the foil doesn't tear, the corn comes out hot, juicy, buttery, and salty.
