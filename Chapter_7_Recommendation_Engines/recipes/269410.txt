Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
5 large egg yolks
1 cup milk
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (such as Hershey'sÂ®)
5 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups half-and-half
1 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (10 inch) prepared graham cracker crust

Directions:
Cream sugar and yolks together in a large saucepan. Add milk, cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt; whisk until no lumps remain. Add half-and-half and heat over medium heat, whisking constantly until filling is thickened, about 20 minutes.
Turn off heat when filling starts to bubble; continue to stir for 1 minute. Remove thickened filling from the warm burner. Add butter and vanilla extract, stirring well until melted and well incorporated. Let filling sit to cool slightly, about 10 minutes.
Stir filling well and pour into graham cracker crust, smoothing the top with a spatula. Chill, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 4 hours.

Description: 
My grandmother's chocolate cream pie was a staple of my childhood. Homemade custard filling with a dense texture. Very rich, not too sweet, and oh-so-satisfying. For convenience, I make this with a store-bought graham cracker crust and top with whipped cream, but she used to make hers with a prebaked pastry crust topped with meringue. Either way, it's delicious. Hope you enjoy!
