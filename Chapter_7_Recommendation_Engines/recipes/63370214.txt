Ingredients:
5 lbs, medium to large sized red potatoes
2 leeks, diced
2 carrots, peeled and diced
1 stalk of celery, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 TBSP butter
1/3 c. unsalted butter, cut into pieces

1/2 TBSP kosher salt
1/2 tsp white pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Wash and dry potatoes, poke several times with a fork. Bake for 1 hour or until soft when pierced with a fork. Cool, dice, remove and discard extra peel when necessary.
Heat 2 TBSP butter over medium-low heat. Saute carrots and celery for 8 min, being careful not to brown. Add garlic and leeks and saute for an additional 2-3 minutes or until soft.
In a 5 quart slow cooker, place cut up butter on the bottom and add potatoes, leek mixture, chicken broth, salt, and pepper. Heat on high for 3 hours, adding evaporated milk during the last 30-40 minutes.
Serve with sour cream, cheddar, green onions, and bacon.
