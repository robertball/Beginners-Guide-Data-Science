Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 cups chopped celery
1/2 large onion, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 1/3 cups tomato ketchup
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce
1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
1 1/2 cups cooked quinoa
2 eggs
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add celery, onion, and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat.
Mix ketchup, balsamic vinegar, and soy sauce together in a small bowl.
Combine turkey, quinoa, eggs, parsley, sage, black pepper, and salt in a large bowl. Add celery mixture and 1/3 cup of the ketchup mixture; mix until well-combined.
Spread 1/3 cup of the ketchup mixture on the bottom of two 9-inch square baking dishes. Form turkey mixture into meatballs with damp hands. Pour remaining 1/3 cup of the ketchup mixture over the meatballs.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are no longer pink in the center and ketchup mixture is thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
I developed this recipe with turkey and quinoa, but have since used it successfully with just about every type of ground meat and variety of grain. The addition of grains not only adds nutritional value and keeps the texture light, but also helps those on a budget stretch a small amount of quality meat into a bigger meal. It's simple, clean, nutritious eating but will please even the pickiest of meatloaf lovers. Make extra grains and serve those alongside a green salad, steamed asparagus, or roasted vegetables. Enjoy!
