Ingredients:
12oz smoked cod filet
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 bay leaf
4 whole black peppercorns
3 3/4 cups whole milk
2 tsp corn starch
2 tsp cold water
1 cup frozen corn kernals
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Skin the fish with a knife and put it in a large stock pan with the onion, bay leaf, peppercorns, and milk.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer very gently for 12 minutes.
Using a slotted spoon, lift out the fish and flake it into large chunks.  Remove and discard the bay leaf and peppercorns.
Blend the corn starch with the water until it forms a smooth paste and add to the milk.  Return to a boil and reduce heat.  Simmer and stir until slightly thickened.
Return the fish to the pan and add the corn and parsley.  Heat through.  Do not overcook, or the fish will disintegrate.
