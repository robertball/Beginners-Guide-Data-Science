Ingredients:
1 cup Barilla® Ditalini
1 cup Barilla® Tomato & Basil Sauce
2/3 cup water
1/3 cup quinoa
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 carrot, minced
1 celery stalk, minced
1 small onion, minced
2 cups cooked chickpeas, liquid reserved
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced (optional)
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
2 cups boiling water, or more if needed
18 cooked shrimp, shelled
3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. If all water has not been absorbed, drain.
Heat oil in a large pot. Add carrots, celery, and onion; cook and stir until vegetables soften and onions begin to turn translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chickpeas with liquid and cooked quinoa. Stir in jalapeno pepper. Add tomato sauce, salt, and nutritional yeast; stir to combine.
Slowly pour in 2 cups boiling water; add ditalini. Continue to stir; add more water only if needed. Cook until ditalini are al dente, 9 to 10 minutes. Mixture should have a stew-like consistency. Add shrimp; cook and stir until shrimp are heated through, 1 more minute.
Divide among serving bowls; top with fresh, chopped parsley and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.
