Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (6 ounce) can frozen limeade concentrate
1/4 cup tequila (optional)
2 tablespoons triple sec (optional)
75 scoop-style tortilla chips (such as Tostitos® Scoops!®)
1 cup heavy whipping cream
2 teaspoons lime juice
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Beat sweetened condensed milk and cream cheese together using an electric mixer on low speed until smooth and creamy. Add limeade, tequila, and triple sec; beat on medium-high speed until cheesecake mixture is creamy and thickened, 5 to 8 minutes. Spoon about 1 tablespoon cheesecake mixture into each scoop-style tortilla chip. Arrange mini cheesecakes on a platter; refrigerate until chilled and set, 2 hours to overnight.
Beat cream and lime juice together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and thickened; gradually add sugar and continue beating until soft peaks form. Top each cheesecake with about 1 teaspoon lime-flavored whipped cream.
