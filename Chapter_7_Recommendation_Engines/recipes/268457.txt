Ingredients:
2 tablespoons bacon grease
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, finely chopped
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
1 quart heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 pinch white sugar
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 pound fresh crabmeat
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon water, or as needed
1/4 cup dry sherry (optional)

Directions:
Heat bacon grease and butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion, celery, and parsley until onion is browned, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and pour in stock. Slowly stir in cream, salt, seasoned salt, pepper, chili powder, dill, sugar, and cayenne pepper. Add crab and simmer until flavors combine, about 15 minutes.
Mix flour with water in a small bowl and pour into the soup. Stir to thicken slightly. Add sherry just before serving.
