Ingredients:
3 chicken breasts with bones (
1 cup mayonaise
2 cans cream of chicken soup
2 tsp lemon juice
1 tsp curry
salt and pepper to tast
2 small jars of marinated artichoke hearts
1 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese
4 cups cubed bread
4 T butter or margarine

Directions:
Boil the chicken breasts until cooked through, usually about 30 minutes.  While the chicken is boiling, combine the mayonaise, soup, curry, lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Mix well and set aside.
Cut up the chicken into bite size pieces and place in bottom of 9 x 13 casserole dish.  Drain most of the juice from the artichokes, but keep some of it.  Cut the artichokes into bite size pieces and put in the dish with the chicken.  Pour about a tablespoon of the artichoke juice over the chicken for moisture and mix around.  Then add the sauce and cover the chicken and artichokes.  Sprinkle the cheese over the top - add more or less for your taste.
Cube the bread (I like to use day old french bread, but have used loaf bread also).  Melt the butter and then add the bread.  Coat the bread and stir until the bread is browned. Sprinkle the croutons over the entire casserole.
Bake for 30 minutes at 350
