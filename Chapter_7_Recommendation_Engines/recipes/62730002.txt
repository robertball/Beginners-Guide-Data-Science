Ingredients:
1 Cup oatmeal flour*
1 Cup all purpose flour
1 Cup whole wheat flour
2 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. salt
4 mashed bananas
1 cup Splenda
2 eggs, separate whites from yolks
2/3 cup canola oil
2 cups pecans, roughly chopped
1 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup diet lemon-lime soda
1/4 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line large muffin tins, or regular sized muffin tins, with cupcake papers.
In large bowl, mix flours,(*make oatmeal flour by putting slightly more than one cup oatmeal into the food processor until it is a flour consistency), baking soda, baking powder, salt and Splenda. In separate bowl, combine egg yolks, canola oil, vanilla, applesauce and bananas. Beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Gently combine dry ingredients with the eggs, oil, applesauce and banana mixture just until mixed. Stir in pecans. Gently add lemon-lime soda. Gently fold in beaten egg whites.
Fill muffin cups so as to allow for 12 large muffins or 24 regular muffins. Bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes. Cool completely to avoid muffins sticking to paper cups. 33 carbs per large muffin.

Description: 
A low-carb muffin developed with a lot of input from AR members. I made these for my diabetic son when he was in college and needed something quick to grab on his way to class in the morning.
