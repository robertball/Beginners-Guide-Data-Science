Ingredients:
2 cups brown rice
1 teaspoon butter
3 cups chicken broth
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 pinch cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Toast rice and butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until rice gives off a nutty fragrance, about 5 minutes. Transfer rice to a Dutch oven or lidded casserole dish.
Bring chicken broth, olive oil, salt, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne pepper to a boil in the same saucepan; pour over rice and stir to combine.
Cover and bake in preheated oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes.
