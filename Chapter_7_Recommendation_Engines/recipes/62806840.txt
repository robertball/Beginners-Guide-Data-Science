Ingredients:
-4.5 pounds of lean pork tenderloin (I used 3 packs Farmland Pork Tenderloin barbecue chipolte-1.5 pounds each)
-1 bottle hickory smoke barbecue sauce
-6 ounces Diet Dr. Pepper (substitute any other diet soda but Dr. Pepper works well as the soda is used as a substitute for brown sugar)
-4 cups cupped onion
-1 can crushed tomatoes
-2 tablespoons fresh minced garlic
-1/4 cup low sodium Worcestershire sauce
-6 teaspoons liquid smoke
-1 teaspoon paprika
-1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
-1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Slice each pork loin into 4 sections and put all pieces into crock pot on high.
Combine all other ingredients in another bowl and mix well. Cover meat and stir. Place lid on crock pot and let cook on high for 3-4 hours.
Check pieces for tenderness and that they are fully cooked after 3-4 hours. If cooked and starting to shred at the edges then you can begin to shred the pork. Meat can be shredded by using two forks, or can place in a bowl in the freezer for 10-15 minutes in order to cool and be shredded by hand.
Once shredded, place pork back in the crock pot, stir well and let simmer on low heat for an additional hour.
Dish can be served by itself or "sloppy joe" style on a hamburger buns.
This dish makes 24 3/4-cup servings.
