Ingredients:
2-8oz. containers of Philadelphia Whipped Cream Cheese, room temperature
2-8oz. blocks of Philadelphia Cream Cheese, room temperature
1-16oz. container of sour cream, room temperature
1 1/2 cups of white sugar
1 tsp. of vanilla
1 tsp. of fresh lemon juice
2 Tbsp. of cornstarch
1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter plus some extra to butter spring form pan
5 whole eggs, room temperature

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375'
In your kitchen aid (because it's easier on your arm) use the wire whisk attachment to cream together the 2 containers of cream cheese, the 2 blocks of cream cheese, the container of sour cream, the 1 1/2 cps. of sugar, vanilla, lemon juice, cornstarch and unsalted butter. Mix together for two minutes then add your 5 eggs one at a time. Continue to mix for another 2 minutes. Butter a spring form pan heavily with unsalted butter, pour cheesecake mixture into pan and smooth it out. Take your spring form pan and place it in a larger pan( I use a roasting pan) and pour warm water 1/3 -1/2 of the way up on your spring form pan to create a water bath. Bake your cheesecake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes. Time may vary depending on your  oven. When done take cheesecake out of the water bath and let it cool completely. Store in fridge, and enjoy. This cheesecake can also be made with a graham cracker crust without altering original recipe.
