Ingredients:
2 quarts apple juice
1 gallon cold water
1 cup kosher salt
6 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
5 pounds ice cubes

Directions:
Line a cooler with a large food safe bag. Combine the apple juice, water, and salt in the bag; stir until the salt is dissolved; add the garlic.
To use: Lie your turkey into the brine with the breast-side down; add more water to submerge turkey completely if needed. Pour the ice over the turkey. Seal the bag and close the cooler; allow to sit overnight.
