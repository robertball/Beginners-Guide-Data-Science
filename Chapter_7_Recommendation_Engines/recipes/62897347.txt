Ingredients:
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 vanilla bean, split (optional)
Sweetening options:
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons erythritol, powdered, or 1/2 cup xylitol, powdered plus 1/8 teaspoon NuNaturals pure stevia extract
OR
3/4 cup Splenda
4  eggs (whites and yolks separated)
2 cups  heavy cream
1/8 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
In first bowl, beat sugar and egg yolks until mixture is a light creamy yellow, beat in vanilla extract and bean scrapings.
In second bowl, beat heavy cream until soft peaks form. In third bowl, beat egg whites, add a pinch of salt, and then keep beating until you have stiff peaks.
Fold together cream and egg yolk mixture gently. Then fold in egg whites thoroughly, but with as few strokes as possible to keep the airiness.
Spread into loaf pan lined with plastic wrap, or a metal mold.
Freeze, covered loosely in plastic wrap, for at least 4 hours.
Scoop out with an ice cream scoop. Alternatively, run water over the bottom of the pan for a few seconds, unmold, and slice.
