Ingredients:
1/4 cup grated hard salami
1 1/2 cups frozen peas
1/2 cup frozen corn
1 small yellow onion, chopped
1 16oz package elbow pasta
1 tbsp basil
1 tbsp rosemary
1 tbsp oregano
1 tsp ground red (cayenne) pepper
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 tbsp minced garlic
2 tsp salt
1/2 cup of olive oil
3 hard-boiled eggs
1 15oz can garbanzo or kidney beans
1 4oz can sliced or diced olives
3 tbsp sundried tomatoes

Directions:
Start the noodle-water boiling in a large pot.
In the meantime, chop the onion and put it in a microwave-safe bowl.
Add the frozen peas and corn to the onion and put the mix in the microwave on high for 3 minutes.
When the noodle water is boiling, add the pasta and cook as directed on the package, adding the rosemary, basil, and oregano to the water for flavor.
Take the grated hard salami and mix it in a large salad bowl with the peas and corn and onion once they are done in the microwave.
Drain the beans, olives, and sundried tomatoes, and add them to the salad bowl mix.
Get a small bowl out and mix the olive oil, salt, garlic, black pepper, and red pepper together for an olive oil dressing.
When the noodles are done cooking, drain them thoroughly and swiftly get them in the salad bowl, mixing with the other ingredients already there thoroughly.
Crack the hard-boiled eggs and slice them, yolk and all, and mix them gently with the pasta and other ingredients in the salad bowl.
Top the salad off with the olive oil dressing, mixing it gently but well.
