Directions:
Slice chicken into small pieces and cook with 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Add taco seasoning and water; simmer for 15 minutes over low heat.
In a medium bowl, stir together the salsa, cream of mushroom soup, cream of chicken soup, and olives. Mix in most of the cheese, reserving 3/4 cup for later.
Place a layer of  tortillas covering the bottom of a slow cooker. Scoop a layer of the ground beef over that, and then spoon a layer of the cheese mixture. Repeat the layers until you run out of stuff, ending with a layer of tortillas on the top. Top with remaining cheese.
Cover, and cook on High for 1 hour 15 minutes.
