Ingredients:
For cake
3 c flour
1 tsp salt
1 c baking cocoa
2 1/2 tsp baking soda
2 c white sugar
3 eggs
2 c milk
2 T white vinegar
1 T vanilla
1 1/3 c oil
For syrup
1 c sweetened condensed milk
3/4 c evaporated milk
3/4 c baking cocoa

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Liberally grease and flour a bundt pan and set aside. Mix together dry ingredients. Add vinegar and vanilla to milk and set aside. Add oil to the dry mix and incorporate. Add milk mixture and mix, and then add eggs. Beat gently and then pour into bundt pan. Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until a knife inserted comes out almost clean. Remove carefully from pan and let cool.
For the  syrup, combine condensed milk, evaporated milk, cocoa and then heat over medium until just bubbling. Drizzle warm syrup over cake (I drizzle some for looks before cutting and then really pour some on each piece once it's sliced.)
Enjoy!

Description: 
My husband lived in Argentina and loved their torta mojada. We had a hard time finding a great recipe in English, so we translated one that he was given and just love it.
