Ingredients:
1 teaspoon beef bouillon granules
1 cup boiling water
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/3 cup soy sauce
1 pound boneless sirloin steak, cut into thin strips
1 garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1 large green pepper, julienned
1 cup sliced carrots or celery
5 green onions cut into 1-inch pieces
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
Dissolve bouillon in water. Combine the cornstarch and soy sauce until smooth; add to bouillon. Set aside. Toss beef with garlic, ginger and pepper. In a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat, stir-fry beef in 1 tablespoon oil until cooked as desired; remove and keep warm.
Heat remaining oil; stir-fry vegetables until crisp-tender. Stir soy sauce mixture and add to the skillet; bring to a boil. Cook and stir for 2 minutes. Return meat to pan and heat through. Serve over rice.

Description: 
'No one would guess this elegant entree is a snap to prepare at the last minute,' remarks Janis Plourde from Smooth Rock Falls, Ontario. 'To save even more prep time, use frozen mixed veggies instead of fresh. Sometimes I substitute chicken, chicken bouillon and curry for the beef, beef bouillon and ginger.'
