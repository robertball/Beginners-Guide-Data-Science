Ingredients:
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons Korean barbeque sauce
2 tablespoons Korean hot pepper paste
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon minced ginger root
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, thinly sliced
1 onion, sliced

Directions:
Whisk soy sauce, barbeque sauce, hot pepper paste, sugar, ginger root, red pepper flakes, sesame seeds, and black pepper together in a small bowl.
Place pork in a large bowl. Pour soy sauce mixture over pork; toss to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator, at least 3 hours and up to overnight.
Preheat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Add pork, discarding marinade. Cook, stirring frequently, until pork begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in onion; cook until soft, about 10 minutes.
