Ingredients:
1 pound golden raisins
1/2 cup chopped pitted dates
1/2 pound red candied cherries
1/2 pound candied cherries
4 cups chopped pecans
1/4 cup grape juice
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 cups brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 egg yolks
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
3 egg whites

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the golden raisins, dates, red and green candied cherries, pecans and grape juice. Set aside to soak. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, vanilla, and egg yolks until light and fluffy. Combine the flour, baking soda and baking powder; stir into the creamed mixture.  Mix in the dried fruit mixture. Beat egg whites to stiff peaks; fold into the dough. Scoop cookies with a small ice cream scoop onto prepared cookie sheets.  Pat down slightly.
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from baking  sheets to cool on wire racks.
