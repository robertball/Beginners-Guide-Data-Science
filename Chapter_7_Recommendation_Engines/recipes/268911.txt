Ingredients:
2 cups penne pasta
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup half-and-half
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 cup shredded Gruyere cheese
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup Oaxaca cheese, shredded
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in cream, half-and-half, and garlic salt. Add Gruyere cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and Oaxaca cheese. Stir into cream until melted. Drain pasta and add to the sauce; stir to coat.
Spray a casserole dish with cooking spray and pour in pasta mixture. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and slightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is a rendition of a macaroni and cheese dish a local restaurant makes. It's so rich and decadent I only make it once per year. It's not a “dieter's friend”. You can use any pasta shape you like.
