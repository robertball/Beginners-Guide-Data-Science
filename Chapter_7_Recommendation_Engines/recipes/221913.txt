Description: 
This is my Grandma Valma's recipe that I bring to any holiday/party/shower or gathering, and it is always gone well before anything else. I have friends and relatives call and request that I bring this because they have been craving it since the last party. This is incredibly easy, but the mix of ingredients make this such an awesome appetizer. It may not actually be 7 layers, but that's what Grandma called it so I never argued! I have found that ridged or wavy potato chips are the best to go with this dip. Enjoy!!!
