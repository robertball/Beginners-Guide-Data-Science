Ingredients:
1-1/2 pounds ground beef
3/4 cup dried bread crumbs
1/2 cup milk
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
1 tsp onion powder
1/8 tsp each nutmeg, allspice, and ginger
1/2 tsp dry mustard
2 tsp vegetable oil
Gravy:
1 Tbsp flour
1 cup water
1 tsp Gravy Master
Salt and pepper to taste
1 small can of mushrooms (optional)

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in a large bowl.
Roll mixture into small balls (1-2 Tbsp).
(If meat begins sticking to your hands, wet them.)
Heat oil in a large skillet.
Brown about 20 meatballs at a time, turning them so they brown evenly. Remove to a paper towel-lined colander when browned. Continue browning meatballs and removing until all are browned.
Make gravy:
In the skilet, make a roux of flour and oil, stirring and heating until bubbly and smooth. Add water. Stir and heat until it thickens. Season with salt, pepper, and Gravy Master.
Drain mushrooms and add, if desired.
Serve over noodles.
