Ingredients:
1 Â½ lb pizza dough, thawed
12 hotdogs
1 jar roasted red peppers, drained
1 egg, beaten
2 Tbsp grated parmesan cheese
24 currants or raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Divide dough into 12 balls; roll each into 12-inch long rope. Wind each around hotdog to encase, allowing about 2 inches overhang at each end. Place on 2 large greased baking sheets. Snip 1 end of overhang with scissors to make slit for mouth.
Cut red pepper into 12 long strips, insert each into mouth for tongue. Press opposite end of dough with tines of fork to resemble rattle.
Brush dough with some of the egg; sprinkle with cheese. Let rise for 30 minutes. Press in currants for eyes. (Make-ahead: Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 4 hours; bring to room temperature before baking, about 30 minutes). Bake in top and bottom thirds of oven, rotating and switching pans halfway through, until golden, about 30 minutes.
Trim off any charred ends of red pepper; cut to resemble forked tongue.
