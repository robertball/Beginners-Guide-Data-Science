Ingredients:
3/4 cup vegetable oil
4 yellow onions, cut into matchstick-size pieces
1 1/2 cups minced garlic
1 cup butter
2 1/2 cups warm water
1/2 cup olive oil
6 1/2 cups bread flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast
1 tablespoon coarse kosher salt
3/4 cup minced fresh parsley
1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed (optional)
1 1/2 cups crumbled blue cheese
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
2 tablespoons water, or as needed

Directions:
Heat 3/4 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions until golden brown and very tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Add garlic and butter; cook and stir until butter is melted and garlic is fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and cool onion mixture to room temperature.
Combine warm water and olive oil in the bowl of a stand mixer.
Combine bread flour, white sugar, yeast, and kosher salt in a bowl; sift into the bowl with oil and water. Attach dough hook to mixer; add parsley, rosemary, and marjoram and mix on medium speed until dough holds together and is no longer sticky, 5 to 8 minutes.
Turn dough onto a floured work surface and knead, adding flour if needed, until dough becomes somewhat firm. Divide dough into six 10-ounce portions.
Roll each portion of dough into a 12-inch rectangle, dusting with flour if sticky. Fill each rectangle with equal quantities onion mixture and 1/4 cup blue cheese. Roll each rectangle into an oval baguette-shape stromboli, pinching the edges to close.
Grease 2 baking sheets with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil.
Generously brush the bottoms of each stromboli with water and transfer to the prepared baking sheets; cover with plastic wrap. Allow stromboli to rise for 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, rotating the stromboli as needed for even browning, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
