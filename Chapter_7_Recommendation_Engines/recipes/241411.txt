Ingredients:
1 cup whole oats
1 cup oat flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon allspice

2 large apples - peeled, cored, and chopped
3/4 cup plain yogurt
2 eggs
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Combine oats, oat flour, cinnamon, allspice, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Add apples, yogurt, eggs, brown sugar, butter, and vanilla extract to oat mixture until batter is well mixed; fold in walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
