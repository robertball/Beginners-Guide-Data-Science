Ingredients:
1 Tbl olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
1 bell pepper, thinly sliced
8 large mushrooms, thinly sliced
1 cup baby spinach chopped
4 Indian flatbreads (or pocket pitas)
1 cup hummus
4 tsp Parmesan cheese
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tsp dried oregano
2 Tbl balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat.
Heat oil in skillet over medium heat, add garlic, onion, pepper and mushrooms.  Cook for about 8 minutes, stirring frequently until veggies are soft.  Remove from heat and add spinach.  Set aside.
Place flatbread on grill over direct heat and cook for several minutes until slightly browned, turning once.  Place flatbreads on baking sheet for assembly.
Assemble flatbreads by spreading surface with hummus, sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top, then topping with veggies.  Finally top off with mozzarella cheese and sprinkle with oregano.  Put flatbreads back on grill, this time with low heat and indirect grilling with lid closed.  Heat for about 5 minutes or until cheese melts.  Drizzle with balsamic vinegar.
