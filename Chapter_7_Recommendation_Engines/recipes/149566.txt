Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 yellow onion, minced
1 green bell pepper, diced
6 crimini mushrooms, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 (12 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon ground mustard
1/2 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 pound ground beef
1/2 pound ground veal
1/4 pound bulk hot Italian sausage
1 egg
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup ketchup
3 tablespoons prepared spicy mustard
3 tablespoons teriyaki sauce
1 cup Italian-style bread crumbs
4 slices thick sliced bacon
1/3 cup ketchup
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon yellow mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms in the butter for 2 to 3 minutes; stir in the garlic, diced tomatoes, oregano, basil, ground mustard, curry powder, and red pepper; continue to cook until the onions are translucent and the mushrooms are golden brown, about 5 minutes; set aside.
Combine the beef, veal, sausage, egg, 3 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup, mustard, and teriyaki in a bowl; mix gently with your hands. Fold in the mushroom mixture and breadcrumbs. Shape the resulting mixture into a loaf and move to a baking dish. Lay the bacon slices on top of the loaf.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes.
While the meat loaf bakes, prepare the glaze by whisking together the 1/3 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce, and yellow mustard in a bowl. Pour the glaze over the loaf and return to oven for another 10 minutes. Allow meat loaf to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
