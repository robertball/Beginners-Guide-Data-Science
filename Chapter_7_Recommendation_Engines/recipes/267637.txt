Description: 
This is a super-simple peach salsa that tastes great as a dip or as a side to grilled meat or chicken. I like to use Espelette pepper (piment d'Espelette), which is a special French ground red pepper that can be found online or in specialty stores. I listed cayenne pepper as a substitute.
