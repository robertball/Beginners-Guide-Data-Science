Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
1 egg, slightly beaten
2 cloves minced garlic
1/2 cup italian style bread crumbs 1/2 cup grated parm (not the good stuff, you want the stuff in the green can)
1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
1/2 tsp onion powder
S & P to taste (I'd start with about 1/4 tsp of each)

Directions:
Dump it all in a bowl and mix (don't be a girl, use your hands!) just until combined. If it's too dry you can add a tablespoon of sauce (or water), if too wet add a tablespoon of bread crumbs. Don't overmix it or compact the meatballs to tightly. You just want the stuff evenly distributed and to start to come together. Roll those bad boys up...big, small, whatev. And now you can do all kinds of stuff with them. If you are having them with red sauce I HIGHLY recommend you throw them into the sauce raw and let them cook in the sauce. It makes the meatballs and the sauce so good. If I don't feel like making sauce I will sometimes get a big jar of sauce to a slow boil and throw the meatballs and let them simmer for a couple hours. If I'm using them for Italian Wedding Soup I cook them in the soup as well. Of course, if you want to be a good girl you can brown them in olive oil first or bake them in the oven to get rid of some of the fat but I never have. Or if you want to make a big batch without sauce to freeze for later then you can bake them at 350 for 15-20 minutes.
