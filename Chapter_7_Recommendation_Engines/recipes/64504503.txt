Ingredients:
4 potatoes, chopped into large pieces (any kind of potato will work- I usually leave the skin on)
3 carrots, sliced (I actually used baby carrots and chopped them into thirds)
1/2 onion, sliced
Olive Oil
1 packet dry Italian dressing mix

Directions:
Spray slow cooker with non-stick spray and place chopped vegetables inside.
Drizzle vegetables with olive oil.
Sprinkle packet of dry Italian seasoning over the vegetables.
Lightly toss so that all the vegetables are covered in oil and seasoning.
Cook on low for 5-7 hours or high for 3-4 hours.
Sprinkle with fresh Parmesan cheese and enjoy!
