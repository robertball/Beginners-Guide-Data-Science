Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 cups chopped onion
2 cups chopped celery
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 packages Pepperidge Farm cornbread stuffing (I use Pepperidge Farm)
1 tablespoon poultry seasoning
2 teaspoons dried sage
1 teaspoon ground black pepper (or to taste)
4 1/2 cups chicken broth, or as needed
2 cup eggs

Directions:
Melt butter or margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion, celery, mushroom, and parsley in butter, stirring frequently.
Spoon cooked vegetables over bread cubes in a very large mixing bowl. Season with poultry seasoning, sage, and pepper. Pour in enough broth to moisten, and mix in egg substitute. Transfer mixture to slow cooker, and cover.
Cook on low for 3 - 4 hours.
