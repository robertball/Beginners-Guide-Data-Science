Ingredients:
2 (9 ounce) packages refrigerated cheese tortellini
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 (8 ounce) package sliced baby bella mushrooms
2 cups heavy cream, divided
1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (optional)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in tortellini and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the tortellini float to the top and are tender yet firm to the bite, 2 to 3 minutes; do not overcook. Drain, reserving some pasta water.
Meanwhile, melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet. Add mushrooms, and saute until tender and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low, pour in 1 1/2 cups of cream, and simmer, stirring occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes.
Remove the skillet from the heat and add drained tortellini; toss to combine. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup of heavy cream, 1 1/2 cups Parmesan cheese, lemon zest, nutmeg, sea salt, and pepper; toss until well incorporated.
Place the skillet over low heat and cook until Parmesan has melted and sauce has thickened slightly, 1 to 2 remaining Parmesan and parsley.

Description: 
Refrigerated tortellini is good quality, and oh so suitable for a quick and easy weeknight meal. Alfredo sauce is rich, velvety, and indulgent, but it's worth the splurge occasionally, and you'll look like a super chef.
