Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
Pinch salt
1 1/4 cups milk
2 eggs
2 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled
(plus more unmelted for cooking)

Directions:
Combine the flour, salt, and milk and beat until smooth (you can do this in a blender if you like, but do not overblend).  Beat or blend in the eggs and stir in the melted and cooled butter.  If time allows, refrigerate for an hour and beat again.
Place a small non-stick skillet with shallow sides, over medium heat.  When a drop of water skitters across the surface before evaporating, add 1/2 tsp of butter.  Ladle about 1 TBSP of batter into skillet and swirl it around until it forms a thin layer on the bottom of the pan.  Pour excess batter back into the bowl or blender.
The batter will dry before your eyes; when the top is no longer liquid, less than a minute, turn the crepe and cook the other side for about 15 seconds.  The crepe should brown only very slightly and not become at all crisp.  Repeat the process, adding butter to the skillet (if you use non-stick you won't need any at all) and adjusting the heat as needed.
