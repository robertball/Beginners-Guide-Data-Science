Ingredients:
2 leaves green lettuce
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon diced onion

2 eggs
1 teaspoon milk
2 slices cooked bacon, crumbled

Directions:
Place lettuce leaves on a plate and set aside.
Heat a small skillet over medium heat. Add butter and swirl to coat the skillet. Add onion and cook until soft, 3 to 4 minutes.
Place American cheese on hamburger halves. Microwave for approximately 20 seconds to melt the cheese.
Whisk eggs and milk together in a small bowl until slightly frothy. Pour egg mixture into the skillet. Cover skillet with a lid and cook until eggs are just set, about 5 minutes. Place hamburger halves on one side of the eggs. Top with onion, bacon, tomato, and pickle. Fold the other half of the eggs on top.
