Ingredients:
* 2 lbs of firm, fresh red snapper fillets (or other firm-fleshed fish), cut into 1/2 inch pieces, completely deboned
* 1/2 cup of fresh squeezed lime juice
* 1/2 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice
* 1/2 red onion, finely diced
* 1 cup of chopped fresh seeded tomatoes
* 1 serrano chili, seeded and finely diced
* 2 teaspoons of salt
* Dash of ground oregano
* Dash of Tabasco or a light pinch of cayenne pepper
* Cilantro
* Avocado
* Tortillas or tortilla chips

Directions:
In a non-reactive casserole dish, either Pyrex or ceramic, place the fish, onion, tomatoes, chili, salt, Tabasco, and oregano. Cover with lime and lemon juice. Let sit covered in the refrigerator for an hour, then stir, making sure more of the fish gets exposed to the acidic lime and lemon juices. Let sit for several hours, giving time for the flavors to blend.

Description: 
The first time I made ceviche, I was amazed. I could actually see the lemon and lime juice turning the color of the fish from translucent pink to opaque white. The acid from the limes and lemons change the structure of the proteins in the fish, essentially cooking the fish without using heat. I love ceviche rolled up in a freshly cooked, still warm corn tortilla with lettuce and salsa.
