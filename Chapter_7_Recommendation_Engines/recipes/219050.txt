Description: 
Our whole family loves this quick and easy side dish. I serve it with tacos, sloppy joes, or picnic meals... Great for potlucks because you serve it cold. Easily adjusted to your individual taste by using your favorite salsa. I often double this for church potlucks or company - it makes a lot to serve as a side and stretch a meal. I usually skip the onions and peppers when making it for guests. I rated this myself for ease and because it is a go-to recipe in my house.
