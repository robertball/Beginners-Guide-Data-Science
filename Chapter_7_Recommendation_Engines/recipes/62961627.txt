Ingredients:
•	1/2 cup orange juice
•	3 tablespoons lime juice
•	2 tablespoons olive oil
•	1 cup diced peaches
•	6 tablespoons diced red pepper
6 tablespoons minced red onion
6 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 24 ounces raw)
1 teaspoon olive oil

Directions:
1.	First start the marinade: Add orange juice, lime juice, and olive oil to medium sized bowl and stir.
2.	Put peaches, red pepper, red onion and cilantro in a small bowl and toss to blend. Add half of this mixture to a small food processor and pulse briefly (4 seconds) to chop and blend. Add the pureed mixture to the orange-lime marinade.
3.	Add balsamic vinegar to the remaining peach mixture in the small bowl. Cover and place in refrigerator until chicken is ready. This will be your peach sauce.
4.	Add the chicken breasts to the orange-lime marinade, cover well with the marinade. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up to 8 hours.
5.	Preheat grill. Lift chicken from marinade and grill until cooked throughout. Place on serving plate to rest a few minutes.
6.	Meanwhile, preheat a small, nonstick frying pan over high heat. Brush the bottom of the hot pan with a teaspoon of olive oil. When the oil is good and hot, add the peach mixture from the refrigerator and saute for exactly 1 minute. Serve each chicken breast with a spoon of the peach sauce over the top.
