Ingredients:
1 3 oz package of cream cheese, cut up
1/4 lb butter, cut up
1 cup all purpose flour
2 eggs
2 cups shredded swiss cheese or extra-old cheddar
2 Tbsp grated onion
1/4 tsp Tobasco sauce
1/8 tsp salt
1 egg white, slightly beaten
Sesame seeds

Directions:
In a food processor, mix cream cheese, butter and flour until blended.  Form mixture into a flat ball.  Wrap in wax paper and refrigerate until cold enough to roll.
In a bowl, whisk eggs and then add cheese, onion, Tobasco and salt.  Set aside.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out cold dough - make sure it is very thin or you will run out of pastry.  using a plain round cookie cutter, cut out 2 1/2 inch rounds.  Re-roll scraps of dough and continue until all dough is used.
Place a tsp of filling on each round.  Fold rounds in half over filling.  With your fingers, press edges together.  Seal with tines of fork and brush the tops with the beaten egg white.
Place sesame seeds in a small bowl.  Dip the top of each turnover into seeds.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees and bake turnovers on an ungreased baking sheet for 20 to 25 minutes, or until lightly browned.  Serve hot/warm.
