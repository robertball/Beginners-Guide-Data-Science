Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
Dash pepper
1 cup milk
1 cup grated Cheddar cheese
3 egg yolks, whisked
3 egg whites, beaten until stiff

Directions:
Melt butter in a 4-cup measuring cup or a medium bowl in the microwave. Stir in flour, salt and pepper.
Whisk in milk, then cheese, until combined. Cook in microwave for 2 minutes on High; stir. Cook for another 1-1/2 to 2 minutes until mixture becomes a smooth, thickened sauce.
Whisk egg yolks until blended. Add a little of the sauce to the yolks; stir thoroughly. Stir yolk mixture back into the sauce.
Beat egg whites until stiff. Fold egg yolk/sauce mixture gently into beaten egg whites just until combined. (Mixture does not have to be completely blended.)
Spoon or pour into four lightly greased 1-cup straight-sided ramekins or souffle dishes.
Bake in a preheated 325 degrees F (160 degrees C) oven until puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes.
Serve immediately.
