Ingredients:
2 eggs
2/3 cup white sugar
3 very ripe bananas
1/4 cup applesauce
1/3 cup milk
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a bread pan with non-stick cooking spray, and lightly dust with flour.
In a large bowl, beat eggs and sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in bananas, applesauce, milk, oil and vanilla.
In a separate bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir flour mixture into banana mixture, mixing just until blended.
Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated pan until golden and a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf or muffins comes out clean, about 1 hour for a loaf and 30 minutes for muffins.
Turn bread out onto a wire rack and let cool.
