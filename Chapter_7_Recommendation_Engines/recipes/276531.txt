Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup pumpkin
1 cup honey
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Walnut Filling:
1/2 cup crushed walnuts
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 teaspoon honey

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Mix whole wheat flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl.
Whisk pumpkin, honey, melted butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Pour over the flour mixture and mix until combined.
Drop cookie dough onto the baking sheets using 2 spoons or a cookie scoop. Use a floured finger to press a dimple into the center of each cookie.
Mix walnuts, butter, and honey together for the filling. Evenly distribute the walnut filling among the cookie centers.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are firm and start to brown, about 15 minutes.
