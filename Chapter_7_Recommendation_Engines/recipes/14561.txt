In a medium bowl, mix together beef, tarragon, and parsley.  Season with salt and pepper.
Form mixture into twelve 3/8 inch thick patties.  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons cheese over one patty, and cover with a second patty.  Seal the edges.  Repeat with remaining ingredients..

Description: 
Instead of a slice of cheese on top, I like to stuff these burgers with blue cheese. I serve these on a bun with blue cheese dressing, lettuce, and tomato.
