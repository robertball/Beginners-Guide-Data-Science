Ingredients:
2 orange roughy fillets
1 c. skim milk
1 c. flour
1 tsp. fresh ground pepper
1 tsp. kosher salt
1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
2 T. margarine, divided
1 1/2 c. cold pineapple orange juice
1/2 T. cornstarch

Directions:
Soak orange roughy in milk for 10 minutes.
Combine flour, salt, pepper & cayenne in a shallow dish.
Melt 1 T margarine in skillet over medium to medium high heat.
Dredge orange roughy in flour mix and place in heated skillet.  Allow to cook uncovered for 2-3 minutes per side.
In a small dish combine pineapple orange juice with cornstarch.
Remove orange roughy from skillet to serving plates.
Bring orange juice / cornstarch mixture to boil in skillet (this will happen almost immediately when cooking the recipe as is for 2) and cook 1-2 minutes, occasionally stirring to scrape up the "goodness".  Then continuously stir to melt in remaining 1 T margarine.
Remove sauce from heat, pour over fish and serve!
