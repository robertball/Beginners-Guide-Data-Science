Make a well in the center and pour in the eggs, sugar, oil, yogurt, applesauce and vanilla. Mix well and pour into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.

Description: 
Super easy. Dust with powdered sugar when cool, if you like, or it's great by itself. You can also add 1 cup of chopped nuts.Modified from: Applesauce Cake VI
