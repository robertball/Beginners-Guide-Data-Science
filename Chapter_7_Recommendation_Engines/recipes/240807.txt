Description: 
I once worked with a chef who made an amazingly delicious roasted tomato vinaigrette. He would roast a whole pan of Roma tomatoes until the sugars and acids would condense and caramelize and concentrate into a delicious mass. I thought I could duplicate it by using a really good, double-concentrate tomato paste and nicely aged balsamic vinegar. It worked.
