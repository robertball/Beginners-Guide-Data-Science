Ingredients:
1/3 cup ketchup
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup bacon bits
1/4 cup crushed pineapple, drained
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
1 pound ground beef
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup crushed saltine crackers
1 egg, beaten
1/2 clove garlic, minced
1/4 onion, minced
2 dashes Worcestershire sauce
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir ketchup, brown sugar, bacon bits, pineapple, and 1 dash Worcestershire sauce together in a small bowl; reserve.
Combine the ground beef, bread crumbs, saltines, egg, garlic, onion, 2 dashes of Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper in a large bowl; mix well. Pat meat mixture into a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Bake meatloaf in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven; pour reserved pineapple mixture over loaf. Return to the oven; bake until no longer pink in the center, about an additional 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
