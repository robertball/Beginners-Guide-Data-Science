Easy Pretzel Turtles Recipe

Ingredients:
small pretzels
Rolo candies  one bag has about 55 candies
Pecan halves  or optionally peanuts, cashews, and m&m;’s
Optional: almond bark or white chocolate for drizzling

Directions:
This is easy as can be! Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Place pretzels on a parchment lined baking sheet. I like to use parchment paper for easy handling, but you can also put them on foil, a silpat, or directly onto the cookie sheet.
Unwrap your Rolo candies and place one on top of each pretzel like a cute little hat.
Place pan in the oven for 3-4 minutes. Any longer is probably too long. You just want the chocolate on the outside to look glossy and melty, but they should still hold their shape.
Remove pan from oven and take a pecan and gently press it right into the center of the chocolate candy.
Keep going and be filled with joy each time you feel that gooey caramel squish out underneath your fingers.
Here’s where you can be creative. You don’t need to stick to pecan halves. I also love cashews and peanuts (I used honey roasted peanuts here). And for kiddos and those who can’t eat nuts or don’t like them, M&M’s make a great little topper, or those mini Hershey’s kissables are cute too. I always throw a few of those in for color and because the kids like them. And if it’s not Christmas time, use the colorful ones- they’re adorable!
If you want to get fancy you can give them a little drizzle of almond bark or white chocolate. Just melt some in a plastic baggie and nip the corner off to drizzle. A little goes a long way; I used a half a square of almond bark for half a batch and had plenty left over
