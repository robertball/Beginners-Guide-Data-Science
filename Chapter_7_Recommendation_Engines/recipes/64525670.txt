Ingredients:
1 cup flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 egg
1/3 cup milk (2% or greater)
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 cup fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and grease a cookie sheet.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Rub the butter in with your fingers until it reaches the consistency of wet sand.
In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, and vanilla extract until fully combined.
Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture and combine. Fold in blueberries very carefully with a rubber spatula, being careful not to break any.
Scoop batter onto your prepared baking sheet into 12 equal sized scones. Bake for 25 minutes, rotating half way.

Description: 
Blueberry scones that are anything but dry! These scones are the softest and lightest you will ever taste, and have been developed over the past few months to be just that.
