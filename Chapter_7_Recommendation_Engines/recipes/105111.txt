Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
1 medium carrot, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
2 (14.5 ounce) cans low-sodium tomatoes, undrained and cut up
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup long-grain brown rice
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning, crushed
4 cups shredded fresh spinach
1 (15 ounce) can reduced-sodium navy beans or white kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 medium zucchini, quartered lengthwise and sliced
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
Grated reduced-fat Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
In a 4-quart Dutch oven heat extra-virgin olive oil over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the onion, carrot, and garlic in hot oil about 3 minutes or until onion is tender. Stir in the broth, undrained tomatoes, water, uncooked rice, and Italian seasoning.
Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, about 20 minutes or until rice is tender. Stir in the spinach, beans, zucchini, and pepper. Cook, covered, for 5 minutes more. If desired, sprinkle each serving with Parmesan cheese.
