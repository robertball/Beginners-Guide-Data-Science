Ingredients:
4 cups	chicken broth
1 1/2 tsp	olive oil
1 tbsp	butter
2	shallots - chopped
1 cup	arborio rice
2 tbsp	white wine
1/4 cup	parmesan cheese - grated
1/2 tsp	kosher salt
1/4 tsp	ground pepper
1/3 cup	fresh parsley - chopped

Directions:
Heat the broth.
In a 2 or 3 quart beavy-bottomed pot, heat the oil and butter until the butter melts. Cook the shallots until golden, about 3 minutes Add the rice and cook, stirring all the while, until the grains are shiny with oil. Pour in the wine.
Add about 1 cup of the broth, bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and stir until almost all of the liquid is absorbed. Pour in 1/2 cup of broth and stir and cook until the broth is absorbed. Continue to add the broth, 1/2 cup at a time, until all of the liquid is used up and the rice is creamy on the outside, but still a bit firm to the bite. This will take about 20 to 25 minutes.
Stir in the cheese, salt, pepper, and parsley and serve.
