Ingredients:
3 cups of loosely packed spinach, large stems removed
2 garlic cloves
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 toasted walnuts
1 tsp dried basil
1/4 cup finely grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Pulse garlic in food processor until finely chopped. Add spinach, walnuts, and lemon juice and process on low speed until finely chopped. While motor is still running, slowly add olive oil until it becomes a coarse paste. Do not overprocess. Transfer mixture to a bowl and add dried basil, grated cheese, and salt to taste. Let sit for several hours for the flavors to incorporate. If serving as a spread, garnish with more olive oil and walnut halves.

Description: 
This a delicious and nutritious version of pesto that uses spinach and walnuts rather than their more expensive cousins, basil and pine nuts. Toss it over hot pasta, as a spread for crusty bread, or as sauce for homemade pizza. I promise it won't last very long so go make a double batch!!
