Ingredients:
2 Tbs. olive oil
1 large or two medium leeks, split and washed and cut into 1 inch pieces leaving on most of the green
1 medium/large onion, sliced
6 cups chicken stock
1 ½ pounds potatoes, peeled and cut into 2 inch pieces
2 tsp salt or to taste
½ tsp. freshly ground white pepper
2 Tbs unsalted butter
2 – 3 tsp. fresh thyme or to taste
1 cup light cream or half and half

Directions:
Heat oil in pot and add leek and onion when hot. Cook over a medium heat for 5 minutes or until softened and just turning brown. Add the stock, potatoes, salt and pepper, bring to a boil. Boil until potatoes are soft, or about 30 minutes. Add the thyme and the butter and stir until melted. Take off the heat and with an immersion blender, blend until smooth. Add the cream or half and half and serve.

This is an adaptation of an old standby from Jaques Pepin. Not sure if he'd approve of my changes though. Use at your own risk!
