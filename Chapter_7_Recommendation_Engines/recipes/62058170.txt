Ingredients:
2 eggs
2-3 cups olive or corn oil
5 Tbls anchovy paste or Sriracha hot sauce
3-4 Tbls Real Lime juice
1 Tbls salt
1 Tbls pepper

Directions:
-Beat the eggs in a food processor until they are almost white.  Add the salt and pepper.
-Slowly pour the oil in about 1/4 cup at a time.  Wait about 1.5 minutes between each 1/4 cup to let the mixture thicken.  I like my aioli thick so that one can turnover a spoonful and the aioli will not fall off.
-Add the anchovy paste or hot sauce.  I prefer the Sriracha because it adds color and more spicy flavor.
-Pour the lime juice in and let the mixture mix for about 1 minute.
-Store and refrigerate unitl use.
