Ingredients:
2 large zucchini, cut into 1/4-inch thick rounds
Nonstick cooking spray
Kosher salt and freshly cracked pepper
1/4 cup marinara sauce
1/4 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella
1/4 cup mini pepperoni pieces, optional
Italian seasoning, for sprinkling

Directions:
Spray both sides of zucchini rounds lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil or grill the zucchini rounds (I used a grill pan set to medium-high) for 2 minutes on each side.
Place cooked zucchini rounds on a large lined baking sheet. Top with small amounts of sauce, cheese and pepperoni pieces, if desired. Broil for an additional 1-3 minutes, or until cheese is melted, careful not to burn. Sprinkle with Italian seasoning and serve warm.

These zucchini pizzas are incredibly addictive, perfect for parties and taste so much like a real (little) pizza that you won’t even miss the crisp crust. The bubbly sauce rests under molten, gooey mozzarella, and topped with mini pepperoni and a pinch of Italian seasoning, each bite is a little bit of bliss!

Now go surprise your friends and turn up to your next get-together with a plateful of these adorable, scrumptious pizza bites. They’re gonna love ‘em, I guarantee it!
