Ingredients:
- 1 (6oz.) box Jello (any flavor you desire)
-1 (12oz.) can unsweetened Pet Brand Condensed Milk (any brand is fine)
-1 (8oz.) Cream Cheese (softened to room temperature, NOT MELTED)
- Fruit (if desired)

Directions:
Boil 2 cups of water and add the jello mixture to the water. Set aside.   GRADUALLY cream the condensed milk into the cream cheese (add a little bit of pet milk, and cream until well blended, add more, etc.) Keep adding until the mixture is begining to get watery like consistency (usually about 9oz. worth of milk) but not too watery.   Then add the cooled jello mixture and stir. (it's normal for there to be some cream cheese lumps in the mixture, just for looks you can pick them out if you desire).   Put them in your mold, or even just a plastic or glass bowl and let set for 4-6 hours at least, uncovered. (after 6 hours, cover it).

Description: 
A smooth and creamy desert that my Aunt Muriel used to always make and the great thing is you can use whatever flavor you want!!!   We usually make the strawberry one, or we make a lime jello with crushed pineapple in it!
