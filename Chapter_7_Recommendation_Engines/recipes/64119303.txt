Ingredients:
1/2 cup egg whites (or 3 egg whites)
1/2 cup oatmeal (uncooked)
1/2 medium banana
1/2 cup blueberries
2 tsp baking powder

Directions:
Place raw, uncooked oatmeal in a blender or food processor and blend until it becomes fine flour.
Add eggs, banana, and baking powder and pulse blend until smooth.
Toss blueberries into batter and mix using a spatula or spoon.
Place a skillet on medium-high heat and measure out about 1/8 cup or 2 tbsp of batter per pancake.
Cover the pancakes while they cook to help the inside cook faster. Cook them for about 45 seconds to 1 minute on the first side, and then about 30-45 seconds on the other side
