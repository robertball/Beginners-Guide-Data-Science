Description: 
After being disappointed by commercial GF flours, I finally sat down and researched what it takes to make a good flour one day. This was my first attempt, but after trying it out, I never even tweaked it! This is an all-purpose flour that I have used for gravies, cakes, cookies, fried food coatings, and more. Substitute 1:1 in any recipe calling for wheat flour. The only use I haven't tried is yeast breads.
