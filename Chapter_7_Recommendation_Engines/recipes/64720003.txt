Ingredients:
3 beets, scrubbed and greens removed
1 head of garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil plus extra for drizzling
½ cup goat cheese, crumbled and divided
½ teaspoon dried rosemary
½ teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
To serve:
2 tablespoons toasted slivered almonds
3-6 fresh basil leaves, chopped
Additional olive oil and balsamic vinegar, if desired

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Rub beets with olive oil and salt and wrap in foil.
Cut the top off garlic and drizzle with olive oil and salt.
Wrap tightly in foil and place alongside beets on a rimmed baking sheet.
Roast for 45 minutes, or until garlic is deep golden and soft, and beets are completely fork-tender.
Let cool for 15-30 minutes and use a strong paper towel or sharp knife to peel the beets.
Cut the beets into large chunks and put them in a food processor with garlic, ¼ cup goat cheese, 2 tablespoons olive oil, rosemary, thyme, sea salt, black pepper and balsamic vinegar.
Process until mixture is very smooth, about 1 minute, scraping bowl as needed.
Taste and adjust seasoning, and spoon into a shallow serving dish.
Sprinkle with slivered almonds and basil leaves, balsamic vinegar, olive oil and remaining tablespoon goat cheese.
Serve with crackers, pretzels, and sliced fresh vegetables as desired (we served ours with gluten free pretzels and it was a hit!).
