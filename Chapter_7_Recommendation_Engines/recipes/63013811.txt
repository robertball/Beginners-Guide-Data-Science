Ingredients:
* 12 medium carrots, peeled and sliced 1/4" thick
* 1/3 cup butter
* 1 small/medium minced onion
* 3 cloves of garlic
* 1/4 cup flour
* 1/4 tsp. dry mustard
* 1/4 tsp. white pepper
* 1/4 tsp. celery seed
* 2 cups milk
* 1/2 tsp. salt (really, salt to taste)
* 1.5-2 cups Cheddar or Swiss cheese (cut into small chunks)
* 2 Tbsp. butter
* 1 cup soft bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cook carrots in boiling salted water 4-6 minutes or until until just tender. Drain and set aside.
Melt 1/3 C butter in heavy saucepan over low heat. Add onion and garlic, lightly salt, and cook until tender. Add flour, wisk/stir until smooth. Cook 3-10 minutes, stirring constantly.
Increase heat to medium, and gradually add milk...stirring constantly, until thick and bubbly.
Add cheese incrementally, stirring each time until cheese melts. Then combine carrots and sauce; and transfer into a lightly greased 2-quart casserole.
At this point you can cover and refrigerate the casserole. If so, before you're ready to eat, take out of the fridge and let it warm warm a bit (10-20min)sprinkle with breadcrumbs, and bake for 40-50 minutes, or until bubbly and browned. Otherwise combine 2 Tbsp. melted butter and breadcrumbs in small bowl; sprinkle over casserole. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until sauce is bubbly and topping is browned.
