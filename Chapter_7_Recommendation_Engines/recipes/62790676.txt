Ingredients:
1 lb. chicken breast
4 cans/8 cups Chicken Broth, preferably low-sodium/fat-free
1/2-1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup carrots, chopped
1/4 cup onion, chopped
1/4 cup celery, chopped (leaves included if desired)
4 cups shredded green cabbage, approx. 1/2 a head
1/2 cup leeks, sliced and rinsed to remove grit (white & light green parts only)
1 cup zucchini, sliced
1 cup mushrooms, sliced
1/2 teaspoon basil, dried
1/2 teaspoon oregano, dried
1/2 teaspoon rosemary, dried
1 teaspoon garlic, minced
1/8 teaspoon ground pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt, optional
1 (14.5 oz) can diced fire-roasted tomatoes
1 cup spinach, coarsely chopped
2/3 cup dried orzo
Parmesan cheese, optional

Directions:
Boil chicken breasts whole in all the chicken broth till cooked through.
In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high. Add carrots, saute while you chop the onion & celery, about 2-4 minutes, till they begin to soften. Add onion & celery. Chop cabbage and add. Stir well.
Chop leeks, rinse thoroughly. (The best way to do this is by cutting the leeks in half and slicing into thin half moons. Place in a bowl of cold water and break apart. Let sit for a minute or 2 to allow the grit to fall to the bottom of the bowl.) Add to the sauteing vegetables. Chop and add the zucchini. Continue to saute for about 5 minutes or until cabbage begins to soften.
Remove chicken from broth and set aside. If needed, if needed skim the top of the broth. Add roasted tomatoes, mushrooms & all spices. Continue to boil.
While the veggies continue to saute and the broth mixture boils. Shred the chicken using two forks to pull apart on a plate. Return the chicken to the broth mixture and add all veggies to broth mixture also. Lower heat to medium or lower for a light simmer.
Cook orzo according to package directions. (I just use the skillet I cooked the vegetables in to save me a dish to wash.) Drain and put in a bowl. (Not recommended to put in the soup itself or it will continue to cook and soak up all the liquid in leftovers).
To serve, put about 1 1/2 tablespoons of orzo into a bowl. Spoon soup over it. If desired, sprinkle with a pinch of Parmesan cheese.
