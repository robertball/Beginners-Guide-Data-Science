Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup crushed fish-shaped crackers (such as GoldfishÂ®)
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 eggs
3/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound with the smooth side of a meat mallet to 1/2-inch thickness.
Combine flour, crackers, 1 1/2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a resealable plastic bag.
Beat eggs in a shallow bowl. Dip chicken breasts into eggs to coat; place in flour mixture and seal bag. Toss chicken in the flour mixture until well covered.
Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add chicken breasts; cook until underside is browned and crispy, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip; sprinkle 1 teaspoon Parmesan cheese over each chicken breast. Spoon hot oil over cheese until melted. Drain on paper towels for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Crunchy chicken Parmesan that your family will love. Everyone I have made this for has told me it's the best chicken Parmesan ever. Serve over your favorite pasta with your favorite sauce (I use marinara). Sometimes I sprinkle mozzarella cheese over my chicken as well as the Parmesan. I also garnish with chopped fresh basil.
