Ingredients:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 stalks celery, thinly sliced, plus 3 tablespoons
chopped celery leaves
3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
1 1/2 limes
1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 Hass avocados, diced
1 5-ounce package salad mix; choose the kind you like
1 small bunch radishes, thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium high.
Make the dressing. Combine the mayonnaise, celery leaves, 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, 1 tablespoon water, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl. Grate in the zest of 1 lime and squeeze in the juice.
Toss the shrimp with the vegetable oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a bowl. Arrange the shrimp on the grill and cook until pink and just firm, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to the bowl with the dressing; squeeze in the juice of the remaining 1/2 lime.
Add the sliced celery, avocados, salad mix and radishes to the bowl with the shrimp; toss to coat. Top with the remaining 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro.

Description: 
Wonderful salad for a hot night.  Serve with bread on the side--We love garlic Texas Toast--just pop it on the grill after flipping the shrimp.
