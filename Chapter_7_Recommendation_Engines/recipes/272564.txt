Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 cup chopped onions
1 cup diced celery
1 cup diced carrots
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, crushed by hand
1 teaspoon dried basil

64 ounces water
8 teaspoons vegetable soup base
1 cup diced zucchini
1 cup diced summer squash
1 cup eggplant
2 cups cooked mini shell pasta (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a large soup pot over low heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in celery and cook for 5 minutes. Add carrots and cook for 5 minutes. Mix in garlic and cook until white, about 2 minutes. Add diced tomatoes and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes.
Season soup with basil, oregano, and pepper. Add water and vegetable soup base and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes more.
Add zucchini and summer squash to the soup and cook until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in eggplant and cook until tender, about 5 minutes more. Fold in cooked pasta and adjust seasonings.

Description: 
This is a good way to use my sister Jeanne's eggplant that her garden produces all summer. The vegetables are all cut the same way, so your kids will eat it too! Just don't say it is eggplant soup! My sister has been hounding me for this recipe ever since she tasted it at my summer job in Wolfeboro, NH. Bon appetit!
