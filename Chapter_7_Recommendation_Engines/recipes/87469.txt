1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

Meanwhile, place butter, olive oil, garlic, basil, fish sauce, and salt into a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped.
Stir garlic and basil mixture into cooked spaghetti until evenly coated. Sprinkle half of the provolone on top, then stir until the cheese has melted. Sprinkle the remaining cheese, and stir.
