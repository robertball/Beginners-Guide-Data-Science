1/3 cup butter
8 eggs
1 cup coconut milk
1/3 cup arrowroot
1/4 cup chestnut flour
1/2 tsp sea salt
1 tsp lemon extract
1 packet stevia (or 6 drops lemon flavored liquid stevia)

Directions:
preheat oven to 425 degrees.  as oven is preheating, melt butter in a 9x13 glass baking dish until it just starts to brown. (careful!  it goes from brown to burnt quickly!)
blend remaining ingredients in a blender, beginning with eggs, then adding remaining ingredients.  blend for approximately 45 seconds to one minute total.
carefully pour batter over browned butter in the baking dish, and bake at 425 degrees for approximately 23 minutes.
top with spiced fruit compote and sprinkle with finely chopped, toasted nuts (we love hazelnuts!).
