Ingredients:
optional: REPLACE 1/2 cup of flour with flaxseed meal
1 cup all-purpose or cake flour
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 cup quick-cook oats
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
2 cups dark brown sugar, packed

2 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp salt
3 tsp baking soda
1 cup chopped walnuts
2 cups chopped dates
1/2 cup shredded toasted coconut (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 C). Grease 4 7x3 inch loaf pans, dust with sugar and cinnamon if desired.
In a LARGE bowl, cream butter and sugar. Mix in eggs, mashed bananas, sour cream, vanilla and cinnamon. Stir in nuts and dates. Mix in salt, baking soda, flours and oats. Divide into prepared pans.
Sprinkle more brown sugar, dates, walnuts, and toasted coconut over the loaves. For a shiny glaze, top with a small amount of butter.
Bake for 1 hour, until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
Don't let everyone steal it all.
