Ingredients:
1 (12 inch) whole wheat tortilla
1 cup mixed baby salad greens
4 cherry tomatoes, chopped
2 tablespoons crumbled goat cheese
2 tablespoons diced roasted red peppers
1/2 tablespoon shredded mozzarella cheese
balsamic vinegar to taste
olive oil to taste

Directions:
Lay the tortilla out flat, and arrange the baby greens across the tortilla. Sprinkle the cherry tomatoes, goat cheese, roasted red pepper, and mozzarella cheese evenly across the greens. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.
Fold the bottom of the tortilla up about 2 inches to enclose the filling, and roll the wrap tightly.

Description: 
These wraps are delicious! Use as much or as little oil and vinegar as you like -- I think it's great with only a small drizzle, but some prefer more. A vinaigrette dressing also works great.
