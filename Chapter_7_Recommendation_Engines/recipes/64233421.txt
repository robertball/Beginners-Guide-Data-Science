Ingredients:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard
Dash of Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup finely diced green onions
1 tsp. salt
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 lb. picked over crab
1/4 cup (or more) fresh breadcrumbs
Tabasco sauce
2 Tbsp. vegetable oil
2 Tbsp. butter
Flour for dredging
Coleslaw made with threads of carrot, red bell pepper and parsley

Directions:
1.  In a bowl combine the mayonnaise, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, green onions, salt and egg.  Add to crab and fold in enough breadcrumbs so crab cakes just hold together; season with Tabasco sauce.  Refrigerate this mixture for at least 30 minutes so that it is easier to handle.
2.  Shape mixture into 8 small cakes.  Heat oil and butter in a nonstick skillet.  Dip cakes in flour on both sides and shake off excess.  Cook gently, on low heat for about 5 minutes on each side or until cooked through.
3.  Drain and serve over or with the coleslaw.
