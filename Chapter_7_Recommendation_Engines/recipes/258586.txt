Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package tempeh, grated
1/4 cup tamari
3 cloves garlic, crushed, or more to taste
2 1/2 teaspoons dried sage
1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
1/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Combine tempeh, tamari, garlic, sage, paprika, black pepper, and red pepper flakes in a saucepan. Simmer, stirring tempeh frequently, until completely reduced, about 7 minutes.
Stir flour into tempeh mixture. Let cool in the saucepan until safe to handle, about 15 minutes. Shape into 2-inch patties.
Heat a skillet over medium heat and grease with olive oil. Pan-fry the patties until well-browned, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
