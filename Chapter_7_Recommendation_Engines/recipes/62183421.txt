Ingredients:
1/2 lb. butter (room temperature)
1/2 c. sugar
2 1/2 c. flour

Directions:
In large bowl, add all ingredients. Using hands mix or knead (about 5 minutes) until mixture is dough-like consistency. Form two equal balls and press into two eight inch greased pans evenly. Using fork gently poke holes about half way down over entire surface of shortbread. Bake at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes (maybe less time depending on oven, check) until lightly browned. Remove from oven and immediately cut into squares. Let cool, remove from pan and enjoy.
