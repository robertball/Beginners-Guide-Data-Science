Ingredients:
1 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp granulated garlic
1/2 paprika
1/2 tsp ground pepper
1/4 salt
1/4 ground turmeric
1 1/2 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 3/4" cubes
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice, plus wedges for serving
1 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish

Directions:
8 skewers (if using wooden/bamboo skewers soak for 30 minutes before using).  Whisk ginger, garlic, paprika, salt, black pepper and turmeric in a large bowl.  Add the chicken and toss to coat evenly.
Alternate the chicken and grapes as you thread them on skewers (there should be about 6 pieces of chicken and 5 grapes on each; you may have grapes left over). Brush with oil.
Preheat grill to medium.  Working in batches as needed, cook the skewers about 10 minutes per side, turning once or twice until grill marks have formed, the grapes have softened and the chicken is cooked through.
Sprinkle with lemon juice and cilantro; serve with lemon wedges.

Description: 
These skewers turn basic grilled chicken breast into an irresistibly flavorful and fragrant dish. The meat is tossed with a mix of dried spices --- no marinating time needed Â— then skewered with fresh green grapes that take on a deep, mellow flavor once grilled.
