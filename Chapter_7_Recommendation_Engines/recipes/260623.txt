Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/4 cup white sugar
3 1/2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 egg
1 tablespoon apricot jam
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Spray a small fluted tube pan with cooking spray.
Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and creamy. Add egg and jam; mix until combined. Sift in flour, cocoa powder, and salt; mix thoroughly. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Level the surface of the batter with the back of a spoon.
Place pan in the air fryer basket. Cook until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out cleanly, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is a chocolate cake I make in my air fryer, I like to use a ring tin as it makes the cooking time even shorter, perfect for a couple or small family. Top with icing sugar.
