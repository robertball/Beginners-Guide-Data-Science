Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
5 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
Mix flour and brown sugar in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture until small crumbs form. Stir pecans into the crumbs. Set 3/4 cup of the mixture aside for topping the bars; press remainder of the mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
Bake crust in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes; remove from oven and set aside to cool slightly.
Beat cream cheese, white sugar, pumpkin puree, eggs, vanilla extract, allspice, and cinnamon together in a bowl until smooth; pour over the cooled crust. Sprinkle reserved topping over the cream cheese mixture.
Return dish to oven and continue baking until the topping browns, 30 to 35 minutes.

Description: 
Incredibly easy and tasty. Neufchatel can be substituted for the cream cheese for a lower-fat but equally scrumptious alternative.
