Ingredients:
1 (6 pound) pork loin crown roast
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
MUSHROOM STUFFING:
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup diced celery
1/4 cup butter or margarine
3 cups day-old cubed bread
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/3 cup apricot preserves
1 cup whole fresh cranberries, optional

Directions:
Place roast, rib ends up, in a shallow roasting pan; sprinkle with seasoned salt. Cover rib ends with foil. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours.
Meanwhile, saute mushrooms and celery in butter until tender. Stir in bread cubes, salt and pepper. Spoon into the center of the roast. Brush sides of roast with preserves. Bake 1 hour longer or until a meat thermometer inserted into meat between ribs reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C); remove foil.
If desired, thread cranberries on a 20-in. piece of thin string or thread. Transfer roast to a serving platter. Loop the cranberry string in and out of the rib ends.

Description: 
It looks so elegant that everyone thinks I really fussed when I serve this roast. But it's actually so easy! The biggest challenge is to remember to order the crown roast from the meat department ahead of time. My family loves the succulent pork and savory bread stuffing.
