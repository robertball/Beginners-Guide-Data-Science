Ingredients:
1 lb lean hamburger
2 beef bouillon cubes crushed
1 Tbl. minced onion
1/2 tsp. garlic
1/2 tsp. lea and perins steak sause
1 tps. water
couple dashes of salt
4 slices of swiss cheese

Directions:
Mix hamburger, beef cubes, onions, garlic, steak sause, water and salt. These burgers will be more moist if handles less. Pat out into 4 patties and make as thick as you would like. I like mine about 1/2 inch thick. Grill 7 minutes per side over medium heat. Turn grill off and add swiss cheese. Remove immediately
