Ingredients:
2 heads cauliflower, separated into florets
3 cloves garlic, chopped
2 shallots, chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cups chicken broth
1 cup water
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon dried thyme
2 cups heavy cream
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a large bowl, toss cauliflower pieces with olive oil, garlic and shallots. Spread out in a roasting pan or baking sheet with sides.
Roast in the preheated oven until toasted and tender, about 30 minutes.
When the cauliflower is done, transfer to a soup pot and pour in the chicken broth and water. Season with thyme and the bay leaf and bring to a boil. Cook over medium heat for 30 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaf.
Puree the soup in the pot using an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender and puree in batches, then return to the pot. Stir in the cream and season with salt and pepper. Heat through before serving but do not boil.
