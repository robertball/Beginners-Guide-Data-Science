Ingredients:
1 (0.6 ounce) cake fresh yeast
1 cup warm water
1 cup flat beer, at room temperature
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups hot water (optional)
1 cup raisins (optional)
1 cup peeled and finely chopped Granny Smith apple (optional)
vegetable oil for frying
2 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Tear yeast into small pieces; stir into warm water until dissolved. Add beer; let stand for 5 minutes.
Stir hot water and raisins together in a bowl; let stand until plumped, about 5 minutes. Drain any excess water.
Combine flour and salt in a large bowl; stir in yeast mixture and beaten eggs. Mix in raisins and apple. Cover with plastic wrap; leave dough in a warm place to rise, 8 hours to overnight.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Shape scoops of dough into golf-ball-size balls using 2 metal teaspoons; drop carefully into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
