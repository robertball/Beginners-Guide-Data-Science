Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked basmati rice, rinsed and drained
1 3/4 cups water
3 shallots, thinly sliced
1 cup unsweetened coconut cream
1 (3/4 inch thick) slice fresh ginger root, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon salt to taste
6 shallots, chopped
15 dried red chile peppers, or to taste
1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, minced
1 tablespoon shrimp paste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 cup tamarind juice
salt to taste
1 onion, sliced
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined

Directions:
Bring the rice, water, sliced shallots, coconut cream, ginger, and salt to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, place the chopped shallots, dried chile peppers, minced ginger, and shrimp paste in a blender and process to a thick paste.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chile paste until fragrant. Stir in sugar, tamarind juice, and salt, then toss in onion and shrimp and simmer until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes. Serve over the hot rice.
