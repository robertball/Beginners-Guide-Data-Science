1/2 large cucumber, diced
1/2 avocado, diced
1/3 cup shredded lettuce

8 green olives, quartered
1/4 cup feta cheese crumbles
1/4 cup shredded carrots

2 spinach-flavored wraps

3 slices deli turkey (optional)
1/2 cup grilled chicken (optional)

Directions:
Place tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, lettuce, black olives, green olives, feta cheese, and carrots in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in Italian dressing. Seal bag and toss to coat ingredients with dressing.
Microwave spaghetti squash on high for 5 minutes. Cool until easily handled.
Scrape spaghetti squash with a fork and spread onto wraps. Lay turkey and chicken on top. Use a spoon to scoop out ingredients from the dressing onto the wraps. Roll up wraps and slice each one in half.
