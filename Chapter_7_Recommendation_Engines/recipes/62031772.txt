https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 T. olive oil
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 large egglant, peeled and diced
2 T water
1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped fine
1 cup seasoned bread crumbs
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated

Directions:
In a large saucepan, heat oil and saute the garlic until golden.  Add the diced eggplant, the 2 tablespoons of water and cover.  Reduce heat and steam gently
until the eggplant is very soft, about 10 min or so.  Allow to cool slightly.
In a mixing bowl, combine eggplant, bread crumbs, parsely, eggs and grated cheese.  Mix well and let stand for 20 minutes (You want a consistency that is sticky enough to hold together, so if it is too dry, add some more water, or if too wet, add more bread crumbs).
Form into balls.  Fry on all sides in oil until nicely browned, or bake on a greased cookie sheet for 30 min at 325 degrees.
Add to your sauce during the last 10 minutes of simmering.  Enjoy!
*tip* If your hands get too sticky forming the balls, wet them thoroughly and form the balls using wet hands.  No sticking!
