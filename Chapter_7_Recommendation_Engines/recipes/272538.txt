Ingredients:
3 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped onion
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
14 ounces andouille sausage, cut lengthwise and sliced crosswise into 1/4-inch slices
2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning
1 teaspoon hot sauce
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chiles (such as RotelÂ®), drained slightly
1/2 cup unsalted chicken stock
1 (16 ounce) package frozen riced cauliflower
1 pound frozen raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt ghee in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add bell pepper, celery, and onion. Cook until vegetables begin to soften and onion turns soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add chicken, sliced sausage, Cajun seasoning, and hot sauce. Cook and stir until everything is well combined, 2 to 3 minutes. Add drained tomatoes and stock and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove lid and add riced cauliflower, breaking up any clumps while stirring. Add frozen shrimp and increase heat to medium high. Push each shrimp below the surface of the hot tomato sauce and season with black pepper. Bring to a boil and cook until shrimp curls and turn pink in color, 6 to 8 minutes.
