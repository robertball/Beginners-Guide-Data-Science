Ingredients:
8-10 Roma tomatoes (or equal amount of another fleshy tomato)
2 pie crusts (store-bought works excellently)
1 egg
1 tbsp water
3-4 cups shredded mozzarella
2 cups shredded cheddar
1.5 cup crumbled feta
1/2 cup of parmesan (optional)
1/2 Â– 1 cup mayonnaise, as needed
10 oz frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
2 tsp dried basil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Seed and slice tomatoes into 1/4 -1/2 inch slices.
(Optional).  For best results, lay tomatoes in a single layer on newspaper or paper towels.  Lightly salt the slices to draw out excess moisture.  Let sit for about 2 hours.
Beat egg and water lightly into an egg wash.  Brush mixture on pie crusts.  Prebake pie crusts according to directions on package.  Let cool.
Sprinkle a thin layer of mozzarella at the bottom of both pie crusts (about 1/4 cup of mozzarella per pie).  Sprinkle a pinch of dried basil over cheese.
Add one layer of tomato slices in each pie.  Add a layer of spinach (1/2 of package per pie).  Salt and pepper to taste.  Note: you may want to further chop the spinach with a knife or kitchen scissors to get it ever finer.
Add a second layer of tomatoes.  Sprinkle with a pinch more dried basil.
In a bowl, combine remaining mozzarella, cheddar, feta, and (optional) parmesan.  Begin adding mayonnaise a tablespoon at a time, until the cheeses begin to adhere to each other (usually 3-5 tablespoons of mayo).
Mix cheese/mayo mixture.  Top each pie with mixture until covered all the way to the crust.  (The best way to do this is by hand, flattening the mix a bit at a time).
Sprinkle top of pies with another pinch of basil.  Optional: lightly spray the top of pies with cooking spray or brush with oil or melted butter for better browning.
Bake pies in a preheated oven at 350 F for 25 minutes, or until the cheese begins to bubble and brown.
Let pies cool for about 10 minutes before cutting and serving.

Description: 
Tomato pie might sound strange, but this savory dish is a Southern favorite that always surprises.  The best part: you can easily add anything you like or mix up the cheeses.  Try an all white cheddar topping or adding red onion, mushrooms, or ham for some fantastic variations.  This recipe makes 2 pies.
