Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 (6 ounce) filets arctic char
1 teaspoon kosher salt
freshly ground black pepper
lemon juice
1 (8 ounce) package mixed salad greens
1 mango - peeled, seeded, and sliced
6 strawberries, sliced
1/4 cup roasted pecans
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Season arctic char with kosher salt and black pepper. Cook fillets on grill pan skin side up until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip fillets and continue to cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes more. Pour lemon juice over fish; remove from heat.
Divide salad greens over two plates and arrange mango, strawberries, and pecans on top; season with salt and black pepper. Carefully place an arctic char fillet on each portion and drizzle pan juices and remaining 2 teaspoon olive oil over salads.

Description: 
Arctic char is a close cousin of the salmon, with a much milder and sophisticated flavor. It might be too pricey and hard to find when not in season depending where you live, so feel free to substitute salmon. This is a delicious, light, and satisfying meal.
