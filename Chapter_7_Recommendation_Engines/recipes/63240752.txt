Ingredients:
1 large bunch of fresh cilantro
1 full clove of garlic (or a half if you are a wuss)
2 screamin hot salsa pepers (ie. cayenne, pablano jalapeno)
2 large green bell peppers
1 large onion (Vidalia or red)
Two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
Two tablespoons of orange juice (squeeze it fresh unless you are lazy like me)
One can of black olives
2 fresh limes
2 tablespoons of kosher salt (note regular salt doesn’t work and you will be a laughin stock if you choose to disregard my warning)
Seven or eight medium size tomatoes (make sure they are fresh even if you have to pay extra you cheapskate!)

Directions:
Take 6 of the tomatoes, bell peppers, hot peppers,  garlic, and onion and place on grill to score. Usually takes 5-7 minutes maximum.
To a blender, add the olive oil, salt, orange juice and fully squeezed lime/s.
Then shuck the garlic and add entire clove.
Add about ½ of the cilantro and one of the hot peppers.
Core the tomatoes but leave the skin on. Slowly
add the scored tomatoes as you pulse the blender. Don’t overdo the pulsing as it will not have the desired consistency.
Continue to add the scored tomatoes and the remainder of the salsa (save some for the end you impatient jerk!).
Taste the puree to see if you need to add the second hot pepper...then add it anyhow!
Chuck the puree into a large bowl.
Dice the onions, green peppers, and olives and add to the puree.
Then dice the unscored tomatoes (again, core but leave skin on) and add to the puree.
Enjoy with a margarita on the rocks (splurge and get the Grand Marnier if you have any class whatsoever...)
