Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons water
RAISIN FILLING:
1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 cup water
2 cups raisins
ICING:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Combine flour, oats, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture with water. Beat until crumbly. Firmly press half into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan; set the remaining oat mixture aside.
In a saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch and water until smooth; stir in raisins. Cook and stir over medium heat until thick and bubbly. Cool to room temperature; spread over crust. Top with reserved oat mixture and pat down. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.
In a small bowl, combine confectioners; sugar and cinnamon; stir in enough milk to reach drizzling consistency. Drizzle over bars. Cut and store in an airtight container.

Although these bars keep well, they don't last long with my husband around. As soon as the house fills with their wonderful aroma, he comes running!
