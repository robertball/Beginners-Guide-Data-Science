Ingredients:
1 whole chicken
2 tbsp butter
8 cups water
1 tsp salt
1 3/4 cup flour
2/3 warm broth
1/3 stick butter
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 evaporated milk, cream, or milk
Additional butter as needed

Directions:
Boil chicken in the water and butter until done.
Remove from broth, allow to cool.
Debone chicken pulling chicken into bite size pieces, set aside.
Strain broth if needed.
Return broth to pan, bring to a boil.
Cut butter into small pieces.
Mix butter, flour salt, and broth together.
Mix until it comes together.  Mixture will be slightly sticky!  This is OK!!
Turn out onto a well-floured board and roll to desired thickness, adding flour as needed to prevent sticking.
Cut into 4-6 inch strips and drop into boiling broth.
If broth tastes weak, add an additional tbsp of butter.
After all dumplings have been added, lower the heat to a simmer.
Simmer 10 minutes, add the evaporated milk and return the chicken to the pan.
Simmer until chicken is heated through.

Description: 
This is my mom's recipe for classic chicken and dumplings.  It is simple, hearty, and delicious!  I often do the chicken in the slow cooker, and do the rest on the stove when I get home from work.  I can have this on the table in 30 minutes using this method.  Also, if you really love dumplings, you might want to double the recipe.
