Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup chopped onion
4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 cup Parmesan and Romano cheese blend (such as Sargento's®), divided
1 pound large shrimp - peeled, deveined, and tails removed
1/4 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 (9 ounce) package fresh fettuccine (such as Buitoni®)

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic. Cook until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Add chicken broth and cornstarch; mix until smooth. Cook until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes more. Add 2 tablespoons Parmesan-Romano cheese blend, stirring until smooth. Add shrimp, sun-dried tomatoes, parsley, and lemon juice. Cook until shrimp turns pink, about 5 minutes more.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine in the boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, 1 to 3 minutes; drain. Toss pasta with shrimp mixture. Garnish with remaining Parmesan and Romano cheese blend.
