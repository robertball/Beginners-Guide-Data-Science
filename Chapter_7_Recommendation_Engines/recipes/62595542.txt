Ingredients:
* 1  tablespoon  ground pasilla, New Mexico, or ancho chile pepper
* 1  teaspoon  ground coriander
* 2  cloves  garlic, minced
* 1  teaspoon  snipped fresh oregano
* 1  teaspoon  finely shredded orange peel
* 1/2  teaspoon  ground black pepper
* 1/2  teaspoon  salt
* 1  2-pound  boneless pork shoulder roast, cut into 2-inch pieces
* 2  large  onions, cut into wedges
* 1  14-ounce can  chicken broth
* 3/4  cup  orange juice
* 1  tablespoon  honey
* 12    4- to 6-inch corn tortillas
*     Coarsely chopped fresh cilantro
*     Finely chopped green onion
*     Bottled green salsa
*     Lime wedges (optional)

Directions:
1. In a large bowl, stir together ground pasilla pepper, coriander, garlic, oregano, orange peel, black pepper, and salt. Add pork to bowl; toss to coat with spices.
2. In a 3 1/2- to 4-quart slow cooker, place pork mixture; top with onion wedges. In a medium bowl, whisk together broth, orange juice, and honey until honey dissolves. Pour liquid over all.
3. Cover; cook on low-heat setting for 10 to 12 hours or on high-heat setting for 4 1/2 to 5 hours.
4. Use a slotted spoon to remove meat from slow cooker. Using two forks, coarsely shred meat; discard any fat. Drizzle meat with some of the cooking liquid.
5. Wrap tortillas in foil. Heat in a 350Â°F oven for 10 minutes or until warm. To serve, top each tortilla with 1/4 cup of the meat, cilantro, and finely chopped green onions. Serve with salsa and, if desired, lime wedges.
