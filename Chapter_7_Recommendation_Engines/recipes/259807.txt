Description: 
Tired of overpaying for gluten-free or vegan foods, but you don't want to spend hours cooking? This was what I came up with in very little time from various ingredients in my cupboard. That my children eat them was a testimony that kids love healthy foods, especially if they're part of the cooking process. A home run: Easy, healthy, and delicious.
