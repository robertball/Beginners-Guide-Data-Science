Description: 
My twist on Oregon Salmon Patties by JONNYLEN. My mother, Dorthy, served patties that tasted just like these when I was a child. It's the only way she could get us to eat salmon. Simple and easy, I serve these with roasted red potatoes and lemon wedges. D'Lish!Modified from: Oregon Salmon Patties
