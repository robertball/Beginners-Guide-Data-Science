Ingredients:
2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of chicken soup
2 (4 ounce) cans diced green chiles
5  pitted green olives
1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese
½ (1 ounce) package taco seasoning
1 pound shredded cooked chicken meat
8 (10 inch) flour tortillas
½ cup vegetable oil
1 (8 ounce) package shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 cup chopped green onion
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream

Directions:
Pour the cream of chicken soup into a blender along with the green chiles, olives, jalapeno, and lime juice.  Puree until smooth, then pour into a saucepan, and warm over medium-low heat while proceeding with the recipe.
In a large bowl, stir together the cream cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, and taco seasoning until well blended.  Fold in the chicken.  Evenly divide mixture among the 8 tortillas.  Fold each tortilla into a rectangular packet around the filling.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Fry 4 chimichangas at a time until golden brown, then drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
To serve, place a chimichanga on a plate, and ladle the warm sauce overtop.  Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese and green onions.  Finish with a dollop of sour cream.
