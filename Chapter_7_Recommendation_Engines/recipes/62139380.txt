If using wooden skewers, soak them in a sink full of water for approximately 10 minutes. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Skewer the veggies and meat until all the ingredients have been used. Discard excess marinade. Grill for approximately 15 minutes or until cooked thoroughly. Make sure to turn the skewers a couple times while cooking. Remove from grill and enjoy.
