Ingredients:
1/4 cup canola oil
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root
1 (16 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 teaspoons ground coriander
2 teaspoons ground cumin

1 head cauliflower, cut into 2-inch florets

Blend coriander, cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, turmeric, and cardamom into the sauce in the skillet. Add cauliflower and stir until coated with sauce. Cover and cook for 4 minutes.
