Ingredients:
1 TBSP bacon grease
5 unpeeled large red potatoes, diced
3 celery stalks, diced
white part of 4 green onions - sliced
3 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams with juice
1 (1.8 ounce) package dry leek soup mix
1 pint half-and-half
1 can chicken broth
salt and pepper to taste
green part of 4 green onions - chopped for garnish

Directions:
Melt the bacon grease in a large pot over medium-high heat, stir the potatoes and celery and onion into the bacon fat. Season with salt and pepper, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
Pour the juice from the clams into the pot, and add enough chicken broth to just cover the potatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are just tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Gently stir the leek soup mix into the potatoes until no lumps of soup remain. Stir in the clams, and half-and-half cream. Cook and stir until the chowder returns to a simmer and thickens, about 10 minutes more. If you prefer a thicker soup - add instant potato flakes to bring to desired consistency.
