Description: 
At some other festivals, cooks may substitute dried herbs for fresh or use store-bought shortcut ingredients, but not at Hafli.

Parsley must be fresh and leaves should be handpicked off the stems. No food processors for her tabouli. Only a knife and chopping block will do.

The way we cook at home is exactly how we cook for the dinner, she said.
