Ingredients:
1 pound salmon fillets, skin on
MARINADE:
1/3 cup strawberry preserves
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 TBLS toasted sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon ginger
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon pepper
STRAWBERRY-PINEAPPLE SALSA
1 cup fresh strawberries, chopped
1 cup fresh pineapple, chopped
1/3 cup vidalia onion, finely chopped
Large handful of fresh parsley, chopped

Directions:
In a bowl, mix together all the ingredients for the marinade. Set aside 1/3 cup of the marinade and use the remaining to marinate the salmon for at least 1 hour. Before cooking.
While salmon is marinating, prepare the salsa in a bowl, cover and refrigerate.
When ready to cook, heat grill. Oil a stainless steel flat grill basket, or whatever you might use for cooking fish on the grill, and cook the salmon fillets, skin side up, for 6 minutes, and another 6 minutes skin side down.
Place salmon on individual plates. Using the 1/3 cup marinade you had set aside, drizzle it over the fillets and then top with the salsa.

Description: 
My inspiration for this splendid recipe came from a dish on the menu at Longhorn Steak House.  I've guessed how it's made and decided to add strawberries to the salsa, but I am sure it will be fine with just pineapples.  Strawberry preserves serve as the marinade base, mixed with soy, vinegar and sesame oil.
