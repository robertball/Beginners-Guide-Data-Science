Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1  red onion, coarsely chopped
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - chopped
1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
½ head garlic
⅓ cup water
1 (15.5 ounce) can hominy, drained
1 cup uncooked long grain white rice
1 cube chicken bouillon
salt to taste
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat, and saute the onion until tender. Place the chicken in the pot, and cook until lightly browned.
Puree the cilantro, garlic, and 1/3 cup water in a blender or food processor. Mix into the pot with the chicken and onions. Cook and stir about 5 minutes, until mixed and heated through. Pour enough water into the pot to cover all ingredients.
Mix the hominy, rice, and bouillon into the pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer 20 minutes, or until rice is tender. Increase the amount of water as needed to attain desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Don't let the color scare you! It's bright green! This is an extremely easy and tasty family recipe. Variations can definitely be made to taste...sometimes I use chicken (boneless or not)...sometimes I use shrimp...sometimes I use both. My family makes it with chicken innards (gizzards, heart, etc.) which I'm not too keen on eating. Hey, but with this soup it's to each his or her own.
