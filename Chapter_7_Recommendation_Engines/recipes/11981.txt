Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 (3.5 ounce) links sweet Italian sausage
1/2 pound cubed flank steak
8 links pork sausage
3 onion, chopped
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
2 (28 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
2 bay leaves
1 pinch ground cinnamon
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
2 pounds lean ground beef
2 eggs
4 slices white bread, cut into cubes
1/2 cup grated Romano cheese
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch dried parsley
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 (16 ounce) packages macaroni

Directions:
In a large stock pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add Italian sausage, beef chunks, sausage links, onion, and garlic: cook and stir until meat is thoroughly done.  Stir in tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, bay leaves, and cinnamon.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Simmer sauce over low heat for 1 hour.
In a large bowl, combine the ground chuck beef, eggs, bread, Romano cheese, salt and pepper, and a pinch of parsley flakes.  Shape into golf ball size meatballs.
Pour vegetable oil into a large skillet.  Add meatballs, and cook over medium heat until lightly browned.  Place meatballs in spaghetti sauce, and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
Cook pasta in boiling, salted water until al dente.  Drain well, and transfer to a large bowl.  Stir 1 cup sauce into the noodles to help prevent sticking.
Serve sauce with meatballs over pasta.
