Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/3 cup butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup all-purpose flour
5 medium eggs
1 1/2 cups grated gouda or edam cheese
1 cup finely chopped cooked ham
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

Directions:
Combine water, butter and salt in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  Add the flour all at once, stirring vigorously until batter leaves the sides of the pan and a ball of paste forms.  Remove from heat.  Allow to cool about one minute.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating vigourously after each addition until dough is smooth.  Stir in cheese, ham and mustard.
Drop teaspoonfuls of the mixture onto lightly greased baking sheet and bake at 400F for 15-20 minutes.  Makes four to five dozen.  Cool then wrap, label and freeze.
To serve, place frozen puffs on cookie sheet and bake at 350F for about six minutes.
