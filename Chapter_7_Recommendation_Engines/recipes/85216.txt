Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 cup chopped onion
1 butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 3/4-inch chunks
1 medium golden delicious apple, cored and cut into 1-inch chunks
1/2 cup chopped pecans, toasted
1 tablespoon brandy (optional)
1 (14 ounce) can chicken or vegetable broth
1 teaspoon McCormick® Ground Ginger
1/2 teaspoon McCormick® Ground Nutmeg
3/4 cup whipping cream
sour cream

Directions:
Melt butter over medium heat in a large saucepan. Add onion and saute about 3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add squash, apple, pecans, and brandy. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 1 minute.
Stir in broth, ginger, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes or until squash and apple are tender. Cool slightly.
Working in batches, blend squash mixture in a blender or food processor until smooth. Return squash mixture to saucepan. Stir in whipping cream. Heat through, but do not boil. Top each serving with a dollop of sour cream, if desired.
