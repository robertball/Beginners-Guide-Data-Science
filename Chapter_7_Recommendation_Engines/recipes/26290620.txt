Ingredients:
2 cups chicken, cooked and cut up
1 cup sour cream
1/8 tsp. salt
dash pepper
12 5-inch corn tortillas
4 oz. canned chopped green chiles, drained
2 cups grated Monterey Jack Cheese
lettuce, shredded
tomatoes, chopped

Directions:
Combine chicken, sour cream, salt and pepper. Quickly fry 1 tortilla at a time in hot oil to soften. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of chicken mixture onto each tortilla, spread down the center and roll up tortilla. Place seam side down in greased 13x9x2 inch baking dish. When all tortillas are filled and rolled, sprinkle the green chiles over all and top with cheese. Bake at 400 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes or until cheese is melted and enchiladas are hot. Serve 2 to 3 enchiladas on a plate and surround with lettuce and tomatoes. Top with your choice of guacamole or sour cream or both.
