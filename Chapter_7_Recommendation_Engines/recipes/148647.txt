Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds beef top sirloin, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon dark sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 teaspoon dark sesame oil
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon peanut oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon finely shredded orange zest
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Combine the beef, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, and baking soda in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate 1 to 3 hours.
Heat peanut oil in a wok or large, nonstick skillet over high heat. Stir in garlic, ginger, orange zest, and red pepper flakes, and cook until the garlic begins to brown, 20 to 30 seconds. Add the beef; cook and stir until the beef begins to brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Whisk together 1 tablespoon soy sauce, orange juice concentrate, rice vinegar, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon cornstarch in a small bowl. Stir into the beef, and cook until the sauce has thickened and turned clear, about 30 seconds.

Description: 
I came up with this by attempting to duplicate a dish at a local Chinese restaurant. An Asian friend told me that Asian chefs often use baking soda as a meat tenderizer. My family thinks it tastes even better than the original.
