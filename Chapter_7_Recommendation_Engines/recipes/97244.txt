Ingredients:
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons sugar
1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs
1 (14 ounce) can low-fat sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup cranberry sauce
1 cup cold whipping cream

Directions:
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the sugar and cook until bubbling, about 1 minute. Add the graham cracker crumbs; stir until the color deepens, about 3 minutes. Turn out onto a plate to cool.
Combine the condensed milk and cranberry sauce in a mixing bowl, blend together with a hand mixer until the mixture thickens. Place the whipping cream in a separate bowl and beat with an electric mixer until firm peaks form; fold into the cranberry mixture.
Layer 1/4 cup of the cranberry mixture into each of six (8 ounce) wine goblets or glasses; top each with 1 tablespoon of the crumbs. Repeat layering. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, up to 4 hours.

Description: 
I found a recipe for lime parfaits online. This recipe has gotten me a lot of praise. I was racking my brain for a Thanksgiving dessert and tried several different ways to create a variation of the lime parfait. I tried pomegranate and cranberry juice first, both 100%. They were too wet. So, I had a light in my head go off and thought I should try cranberry sauce instead. It worked so well! I even added it to the real whipped cream I whipped up and it was delicious.
