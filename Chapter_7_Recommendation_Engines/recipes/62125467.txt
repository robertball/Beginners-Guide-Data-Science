Ingredients:
1 cup cornmeal
1/3 cup flour
2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
2/3 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
3 Tbsp. vegetable oil
1 tsp. to 4 Tbsp. sugar
*honey

Directions:
Mix ingredients in bowl. Pour into an 8 inch cake pan. Cook at 450 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes or until toothpick entered comes out clean. Add honey to the top of the cornbread half way through cooking time. I have also waited and added the honey until it was completely done, but still hot.
My grandmother cooks this in an iron skillet and swears by it. I do not own one, so I use a cake pan.
