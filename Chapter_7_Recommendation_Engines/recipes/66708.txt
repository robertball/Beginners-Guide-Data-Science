1 small Bosc pear, peeled and thinly sliced

Mix on medium speed for 4 minutes. Pour batter into prepared pan. Top the unbaked cake with pear slices; sprinkle evenly with the pecans and chopped chocolate.

Description: 
This cake is moist and delicious especially when served warm with whipped cream. It is a very attractive cake. It looks and tastes as though you went to a lot of trouble, but it is really so easy and quick to throw together. Serve warm cake with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and a dollop of whipped topping.
