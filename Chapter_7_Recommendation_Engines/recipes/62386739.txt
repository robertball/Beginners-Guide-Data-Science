Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups sugar
1/2 cup cocoa
1/2 tsp baking soda
3 tbsp. baking powder
5 cups flour
2 tsp. cinnamon
2 tsp. ground cloves
2 tsp. nutmeg
1 tsp. salt
1 cup chopped walnuts
3 cups (18 oz) semi-sweet chocolate chips
3 eggs, slightly beaten
1/2 cup corn or canola oil
2/3 cup milk
For Icing:
2 cups confectioner's sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp. milk (approximately)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a large bowl, mix together granulated sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, flour, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and salt.  Stir in walnuts and chocolate chips.
In a separate bowl, combine eggs, oil and milk.
Add egg mixture to the dry ingredients and mix together until a firm dough is formed. (Start mixing by spoon, but switch over to using your hands - you will almost have to "knead" the dough to get the wet and dry ingredients to thoroughly combine)
With lightly oiled hands, roll dough into 1 1/4" to 1 1/2" balls.
Place on a greased cookie sheet and bake 10 to 12 minutes; let cool 3 to 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool thoroughly. Dip or drizzle with icing.
Icing instructions:
Combine 2 cups confectioner's sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract and enough milk to make a thin (but not too thin) icing - start out with about 2 tbsp.  Mix until smooth then drizzle over cooled cookies or dip tops of cookies into icing.  Let stand until dry.

Description: 
My trademark Christmas cookie! Cocoa, chocolate chips and spices make the house smell wonderful while baking. This is my translation of our friend's Italian grandmother's unwritten (and unmeasured) recipe!
