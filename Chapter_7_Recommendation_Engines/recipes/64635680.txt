Ingredients:
Two 6 to 8 ounce boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 cup crumbled blue cheese (approximately 1/3 pound)
8 ounces cream cheese
1/4 cup whole milk or half and half
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
Chopped chives or green onion for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 F
In a food processor blend blue cheese, cream cheese, milk, Worcestershire sauce and black pepper until smooth. Add a little salt if needed, but be careful because blue cheese is quite salty without added seasoning.
Place chicken breasts in an 8-inch square (or slightly smaller) baking dish. Pour blue cheese sauce on top, smoothing it out evenly in the pan over and around the chicken.
Bake 35 minutes uncovered then turn oven temperature down to 325 F and cook ten minutes more. The sauce should be bubbling and browned around the edges.
Remove from the oven. Let sit 5-10 minutes before serving. For the prettiest presentation, slice the chicken breasts and spoon sauce on top and around the chicken on a plate. Garnish with chives or green onions. You have more blue cheese, crumble it on top of the dish.
