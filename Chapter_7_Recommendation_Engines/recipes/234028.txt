Ingredients:
1 (12 inch) flour tortilla
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard, or to taste
2 ounces thinly sliced Montreal smoked meat
1/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
1/4 cup vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Warm tortilla in microwave on high until soft, about 20 seconds. Stir together mayonnaise and mustard in a small bowl. Spread mayonnaise mixture in the center of the tortilla to within 1 inch of edges.
Place Montreal smoked meat along the center of the tortilla, 2 inches from top and bottom and 4 inches from  sides. Sprinkle Mexican cheese blend over meat. Fold in bottom and top of tortilla, then fold in sides.
Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat; cook wrap, seam side down, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Press wrap with a spatula to flatten while cooking. Remove from pan and cut in half.

Description: 
This wrap tastes just like the one made at a Canadian restaurant, named after one of the biggest names in hockey. I used a Cheddar jalapeno wrap and it was very good.
