Ingredients:
1 pound pasteurized crabmeat (preferably lump or back fin), picked over for stray shells
1 1/2 cups mangoes, peaches or nectarines, diced
1/4 medium red onion, cut into small dice
1/4 medium red bell pepper, cored and cut into medium dice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro or parsley
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1/2 teaspoon Salt and pepper, to taste
3 ripe avocados

Directions:
Gently mix all ingredients except avocado in a medium bowl. (Can be covered and refrigerated several hours.)
When ready to serve, halve, pit, peel and slice avocado. Fan half an avocado on each plate and serve crab salad alongside.

Description: 
My crab salad with fruity-salsa flavorings is simple and appealing. Sliced avocados anchor and enrich this lively, colorful dish. If possible, select lump or backfin crab. The larger the crab chunks, the fewer shell fragments to pick out.
