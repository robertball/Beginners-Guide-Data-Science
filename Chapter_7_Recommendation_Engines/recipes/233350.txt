Ingredients:
7 slices bacon, diced
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup chopped green onion
5 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped
Topping:
1 cup crushed buttery round crackers
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook and stir bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
Stir bacon, cream cheese, mayonnaise, Cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese, green onion, and jalapeno peppers together in a bowl; spread into a 9-inch round baking dish.
Mix crackers, Parmesan cheese, and butter together in a bowl; spread over the top of the cream cheese mixture.
Bake in preheated oven until bubbly, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
This has all the flavor of jalapeno poppers in an easy to make dip! I have mixed the Parmesan cheese in with the dip and omitted the cracker and butter topping, but baked as usual, too.
