Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups diced peeled potatoes
6 strips bacon
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 bulbs fennel, chopped
5 cups vegetable stock
1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until barely tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, place bacon in a deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and reserve about 2 tablespoons of the drippings in the skillet. Drain potatoes.
Melt butter in the skillet with the bacon drippings. Add fennel; cook and stir over medium heat until browned, about 12 minutes. Crumble the bacon and add to the pan along with vegetable stock, potatoes, and Chinese five-spice. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and season with salt and pepper.
Transfer 1 1/2 cups of the soup to a blender. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Return to the pot and continue simmering until flavors combine, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Season with five-spice, salt, and pepper.

Description: 
A glorious soup for cold winter nights. The addition of Chinese five-spice makes this soup unique and magical...like eating a unicorn jumping over a rainbow. Enjoy! If desired, add a dollop of sour cream and some green onion or a splash of cream just before serving.
