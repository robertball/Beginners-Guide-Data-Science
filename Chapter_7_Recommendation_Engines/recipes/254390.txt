Ingredients:
cooking spray
20 fluid ounces lemon-lime soda
1 pound halibut, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 onion, diced
1/4 cup diced zucchini
1 carrot, diced
1 rib celery, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon seasoned salt (such as Johnny'sÂ®), or to taste
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 egg
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Fill a large pot with water and lemon-lime soda; bring to a boil. Add halibut chunks, a few at a time, and cook until they float to the top, 30 to 45 seconds. Transfer to a colander to drain.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion, zucchini, carrot, celery, and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle seasoned salt on top.
Flake halibut chunks into a large bowl. Stir in onion mixture, bread crumbs, mayonnaise, egg, parsley, and cayenne pepper.
Scoop halibut mixture onto greased baking sheet with a cookie scoop; flatten into cakes.
Bake halibut cakes in the preheated oven until golden, 10 to 12 minutes.
