Ingredients:
Crust:
cooking spray
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, cubed
1/4 teaspoon Georgia peach spice (such as Savory Spice Shop®)
1/4 teaspoon salt
Filling:
2 (15.25 ounce) cans sliced peaches in juice, drained and juice reserved
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 teaspoon Georgia peach spice (such as Savory Spice Shop®)
1 cup frozen peaches, thawed
Topping:
1 (12.4 ounce) package refrigerated cinnamon roll dough with icing

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Pulse flour, brown sugar, butter, peach spice, and salt together in a food processor until the mixture resembles pea-sized crumbs. Press mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
Bake crust in the preheated oven until golden and set, about 15 minutes.
While crust is baking, heat a saucepan over medium heat. Pour reserved peach juice into the saucepan; stir in sugar, cornstarch, and peach spice until smooth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in canned and frozen peaches.
Remove crust from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Pour peach mixture into the crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine cinnamon rolls together to form a square pastry disc. Roll out disc with a rolling pin on a lightly floured work surface. Cut into thin strips using a pizza cutter. Weave strips together to create a lattice topping.
Remove the baking dish from the oven; lay lattice over the peaches. Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake cobbler in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Drizzle the included cinnamon roll icing over the lattice crust. Serve warm.

Description: 
This peach cobbler is easy to make and very decadent. The use of store-bought cinnamon rolls makes it even faster to make. Serve with vanilla ice cream, if desired.
