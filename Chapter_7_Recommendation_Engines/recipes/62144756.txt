Ingredients:
3-1/2 pounds fresh peaches, peeled, pitted and chopped (or equal amounts of frozen, thawed peaches)
6 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon cardamom
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 fresh vanilla bean, cut in half, seeds scraped out
2 habanero peppers, seeded & destemed
2 - 3 oz. packages liquid fruit pectin
5 cups sugar
2 cups packed brown sugar

Directions:
Place peaches in a Dutch oven or soup kettle. Stir in lemon juice, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and vanilla bean.
Place habaneros in a blender; add peach mixture. Cover and process until smooth (some chuncks may be visible). Return to the pan.
Stir in pectin. Bring to a full rolling boil. Quickly stir in sugar. Return to a full rolling boil; boil and stir for 2 minutes.
Pour hot mixture into hot sterilized jars, leaving 1/4-in. headspace. Adjust caps. Process for 15 minutes in a boiling-water bath.
For best results, let processed jam stand at room temperature for 1- 2 weeks to set up.

Description: 
I developed this recipe when I was low on funds one Holiday Season and needed an inexpensive gift for family and friends.  I now make several batches every years at several peoples request.  It has become a huge hit at bake sales as well.  Don't be afraid of the fact that it has habanero peppers in the recipe.  The heat is very subtle and just adds to the flavor of the jam.  It's also great spread over a block of cream cheese served with crackers for an easy appetizer for parties.  Try it instead of sugar in your baked bean recipe and you will not be disappinted.
