Ingredients:
4 boneless pork chops, 1/2-inch thick
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 egg
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 cup almond flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
avocado oil cooking spray

Directions:
Season pork chops with salt and pepper on both sides.
Beat egg in a medium bowl. Mix Parmesan cheese, almond flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and garlic powder together in a second bowl.
Dip each pork chop in egg, then in Parmesan-flour mixture to coat. Place in the air fryer basket and spritz with avocado oil.
Cook in an air fryer at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Flip pork chops over, spritz with avocado oil and cook until pork is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 4 minutes more.
