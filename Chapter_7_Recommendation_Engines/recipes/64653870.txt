Ingredients:
8 ounces uncooked spaghetti
1 pound bulk Italian sausage (or ground beef)
1 large onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, minced
1 jar (24 ounces) pasta sauce
1 can (4 ounces) mushroom stems and pieces, drained
1 large egg, lightly beaten
2 cups (16 ounces) cottage cheese
1 package (10 ounces) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 tsp seasoned salt
1/4 tsp pepper
2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375Â°. Cook pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook sausage and onion, crumbling meat, until sausage is no longer pink. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Drain. Stir in pasta sauce and mushrooms. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook until heated through, about 15 minutes.
Drain pasta. Combine the egg with the next five ingredients. Spread 1 cup sausage mixture in a greased 13" x 9" baking dish. Top with spaghetti and remaining sausage mixture. Layer with egg mixture and mozzarella cheese.
Cover and bake 45 minutes. Uncover; bake until lightly browned and heated through, about 15 minutes longer. Let stand 15 minutes before cutting.
