Ingredients:
1/4 cup diced onions
1/4 cup diced green peppers
2 cloves chopped garlic
1 lb ground beef or turkey
10 oz can of diced green chiles
16 oz can of diced tomatoes (mostly drained)
1 cup frozen kernel corn
1 1/2 cups mashed potatoes (homemade or instant, whatever works for you)
1/2 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese

Directions:
Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Cook onions and peppers until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and saute about 2 minutes more. Add ground meat and cook until done.
Add the green chiles, tomatoes and corn to the meat mixture, and continue cooking until corn is done, about 7 minutes.
Pour meat mixture into a casserole dish. Spread the mashed potatoes over the top of the meat mixture, and top with grated cheddar. Heat in microwave about 1-2 minutes to melt the cheese.

Description: 
I love the idea of filling, rib-sticking shepherd's pie, but my West Texas tastes didn't quite jive with the traditional version. This one has a southwestern twist.
