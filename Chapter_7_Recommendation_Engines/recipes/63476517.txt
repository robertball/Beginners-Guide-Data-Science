Ingredients:
2 firm ripe tomatoes(chopped)
1 jalapeno(sliced in rounds)
2 cloves of garlic(sliced thin)
olive oil(just enough to cover the bottom of the pan)
salt(to taste)
pepper(to taste)
1 tsp minced onion(optional)

Directions:
slice the garlic and the jalapeno in round thin slices and heat in the pan with Olive oil until pan is hot.(If usuing onion this should also be added)  Chop the tomatoes and add to the pan along with the salt and pepper.  (If you do not like it spicy remove the seeds from the jalapeno.)Cover and reduce to medium heat until the color changes from bright red to a soft orange.  A juicy tomato works best if the tomato is too dry you will probably have to compensate with more olive oil.  Serve with hot pita bread.
