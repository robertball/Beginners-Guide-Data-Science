Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups quick-cooking oats
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 1/4 cups butter or margarine, softened
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling
1 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips
3/4 teaspoon shortening

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine flour, oats, sugar and butter until crumbly. Set aside 1-1/2 cups for topping. Press remaining crumb mixture into an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until edges begin to brown.
In a bowl, combine pie filling and extract; carefully spread over crust. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture. Bake 20-25 minutes longer or until edges and topping are lightly browned. In a microwave or heavy saucepan, melt chocolate chips and shortening; stir until smooth. Drizzle over warm bars. Cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
I've been making bars since I was in third grade, but these are special. I bake them for the church Christmas party every year... and folks always rave about them and ask for a copy of the recipe.
