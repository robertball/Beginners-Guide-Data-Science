Ingredients:
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons dry red wine or chicken broth
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 (3/4 pound) pork tenderloins
HOT MUSTARD:
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon prepared horseradish
2 teaspoons sesame seeds, toasted

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the soy sauce, wine or broth, sugar, honey and cinnamon; add pork. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.
Drain and discard marinade. Grill pork, covered, over indirect medium-hot heat for 25-40 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing.
In a small bowl, combine the mustard, honey and horseradish. Slice pork; sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve with hot mustard.

Description: 
I love Chinese food, and this soy-marinated tenderloin is one of my favorites. It's terrific served warm or cold, especially when dipped in the zippy mustard sauce.
