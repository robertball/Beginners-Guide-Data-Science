Ingredients:
1 to 1.5 lb. ground beef
1/4 cup A1 steak sauce (or similar sauce)
1/2 tsp salt (optional)

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in a bowl with bare hands (kinda messy!). Shape into 4 quarter-pound hamburger patties, and place on preheated grill or skillet (on medium heat). Cook until no more pink remains in the meat (about 3 min. on each side, depending on heat).

Description: 
This burger is juicy and tangy. It has the perfect flavor for summer grillin' or just cooking on the skillet. Sometimes the simplest recipes are the best.
