Ingredients:
Fruit Filling:
7 cups fruit of choice, coarsely chopped (fresh or frozen)*
1 tbsp cornstarch
1/2 tsp cinnamon
Biscuit Topping:
1 3/4 cups whole wheat flour
4 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup butter
1 egg, large
1/2 cup applesauce, unsweetened
2 tbsp raw honey or maple syrup
Sesame seeds, slivered almonds,  sugar, for topping (optional)

Directions:
In a large bowl, add Fruit Filling ingredients and gently stir to combine. Rub sides and bottom of a medium deep baking dish with butter (cooking spray works too) and place filling in an even layer into it. Set aside.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, whisk to combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Add butter and work it into the dry ingredients with a pastry cutter, fork or I prefer hands, until dough is crumbly and butter is well incorporated into flour.
In a small bowl, whisk the egg and then whisk in applesauce and honey. Pour into the bowl from a previous step and mix with spatula until thick wet dough forms. Drop spoon fulls of dough on top of fruit filling evenly. Sprinkle with any toppings you have on hand, like sugar, slivered almonds, sesame seeds etc.
Bake for 40 minutes (cover loosely with parchment paper if top starts to brown before filling is bubbling) or until filling is bubbling on edges. Serve warm with optional ice cream on top.
Storage Instructions: Refrigerate covered for up to 5 days.

Description: 
Do you have more fruit and berries than you know what to do with? I specifically named it “Fruit Cobbler” because you can use any fruit and berries.  Blueberries,  peaches,  plums,  figs and apples, wild blackberries and over ripen bananas. Apricots, pears, rhubarb, cherries  you name it! Here in Vancouver, BC our summer produce choice is insanely amazing. You could also use frozen fruit, go ahead! Clean out the fridge!
