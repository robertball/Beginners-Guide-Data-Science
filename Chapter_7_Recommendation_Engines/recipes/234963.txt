Ingredients:
Squash Layer:
4 cups mashed, cooked butternut squash
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
Apple Layer:
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
6 cups peeled and sliced Red Delicious apples
1/4 cup white sugar
Topping:
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup rolled oats
1/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter or spray a 3-quart casserole dish with cooking spray.
Stir butternut squash, 1/4 cup softened butter, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in apples and white sugar. Cover skillet and simmer over low heat until apples are barely tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
Whisk flour, oats, 1/3 cup brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Cut 1/4 cup butter into flour mixture using a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; stir in pecans.
Spread apple mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Spoon butternut squash mixture over apples; sprinkle with topping.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and lightly browned, about 25 minutes.
