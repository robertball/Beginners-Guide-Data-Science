Ingredients:
Add a shot of vodka to each serving of gazpacho. Add a shot of rootbeer schnapps and a shot of butterscotch schnapps to root beer floats. Dissolve cotton candy in vodka. Champagne popsicles are yummy. Make instant pudding with Baileys instead of milk. Baileys also makes great malts and can be used in place of milk in Tres Leches cake. You can make Poke cake with jello dissolved in vodka
