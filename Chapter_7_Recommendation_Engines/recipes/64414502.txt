2     ears corn, off the cob, or a can of sweet corn

1     chicken bullion cube
1     tbsp smoked paprika
2     tbsp fried garlic chili oil

1     tbsp garlic powder or 4 garlic cloves grated
1     tsp red pepper flakes
1     tsp cracked black pepper
1/2   tsp seasoned salt
1/4   cup soy sauce

Directions:
Bring all items, except the meat and noodles, to a boil. Toss in the ramen or udon until it is soft. Should only take 5 minutes, less for fresh noodles.
Toss in shrimps or chicken until it's done, just a few minutes. Serve in a big ramen bowl.
