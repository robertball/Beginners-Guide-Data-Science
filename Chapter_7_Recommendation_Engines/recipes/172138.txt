Ingredients:
3/4 (12 ounce) package egg noodles
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup minced green bell pepper
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 (16 ounce) package cooked and peeled whole crawfish tails
2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning blend (such as Tony Chachere'sÂ®), or to taste
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup sliced fresh mushrooms (optional)
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/3 cup sliced green onions

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a rolling boil; stir in the egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the chopped onion, green pepper, garlic, and parsley. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the crawfish tails and Cajun seasoning; simmer 5 minutes longer.
Pour in the heavy cream, mushrooms, and 1/2 cup of Cheddar cheese; stir until the cheese has melted. Toss the pasta with the crawfish sauce and green onions; sprinkle with the remaining Cheddar cheese.
