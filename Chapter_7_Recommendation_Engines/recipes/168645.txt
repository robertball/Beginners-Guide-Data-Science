Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups uncooked brown rice
3 cups water
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (14.5 ounce) can collard greens, drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can green peas, rinsed and drained
1 (15.25 ounce) can corn kernels, drained
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies
1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style tomatoes, undrained and chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring the brown rice, water, olive oil, and 1//2 teaspoon salt to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes. Scrape into a mixing bowl, fluff with a fork, and refrigerate to room temperature.
Stir the collard greens, black beans, green peas, corn, green chiles, olives, and tomatoes into the cooled rice until evenly mixed. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.

Description: 
This is one of our summer staples. It goes together quickly and easily; it's good for you and yummy. It's also very versatile. The first night it's a stand-alone salad; the second night, heat a portion in a pan with an additional canned veggie and it's a side dish. If you have a favorite veggie, add that; if you hate corn, leave it out. Have fun and eat without guilt!
