Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, minced
1 large carrot, minced
1 large stalk celery, minced
4 ounces ground beef
4 ounces ground pork
1/2 cup red wine
1 pound tomatoes, peeled and chopped
1 tablespoon tomato paste
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat.
Cook the onion, carrot, and celery in the hot oil until the vegetables are tender and the onion has begun to brown around the edges, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the beef and pork; continue cooking and stirring until the meat is brown and crumbled, about 5 minutes. Pour in the wine, bring to a boil, and cook until the wine has nearly evaporated.
Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover the pan, and simmer 2 hours until the sauce is very thick. Use a little water as needed if the sauce begins to look too dry.

Description: 
I learned this recipe from an Italian chef in Florence. It is a wonderful meat sauce of ground beef and pork, originally served over a homemade ricotta and eggplant ravioli. It's great over spaghetti and fettuccini as well!
