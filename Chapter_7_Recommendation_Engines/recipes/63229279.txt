Sauce:
1 1/2 cups water
2 tablespoons orange juice
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/3 cup rice vinegar
2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
2 tablespoons chopped green onion
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
3 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons water
Chicken:
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1/3 cup flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
3 large eggs
1 1/2 cups Kikkoman Panko Bread Crumbs

Put rice on to cook.
Place the chicken pieces into a resealable plastic bag. When contents of saucepan have cooled, pour 1 cup of sauce into bag. Reserve the remaining sauce. Seal the bag, and refrigerate at least 2 hours.
Beat the eggs until frothy and set aside. Mix the flour, salt, and pepper in a reasealable bag. Add the marinated chicken pieces, seal the bag, and shake to coat. Remove the chicken pieces from the flour, shake off the excess, dip in eggs and roll in panko bread crumbs.
Heat the oil in a deep fry pan over medium heat. Deep fry the chicken pieces. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels, and cover with aluminum foil.
Bring reserved sauce to a boil over medium-high heat. Mix together the cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water; stir into the sauce and cook until thickened.
