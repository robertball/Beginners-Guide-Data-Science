Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 pound ground beef
1 pound bulk hot Italian sausage
1/4 pound pancetta, diced
1 large onion, finely diced
2 medium carrots, peeled and finely diced
1 large stalk celery, finely diced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 cans (28 ounces each) diced tomatoes, drained
3/4 cup whole milk
3/4 cup dry red wine
2 pounds hot cooked pasta (optional)
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and Italian sausage and cook until no longer pink, stirring often to break up meat. Transfer to slow cooker with slotted spoon. Discard drippings and wipe out skillet with paper towel; return skillet to heat.
2. Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to pan. Add pancetta and cook until crisp and brown, stirring occasionally. Transfer to slow cooker with slotted spoon.
3. Reduce heat to medium and add onion, carrot, celery, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent and carrot and celery are just tender. Stir in tomato paste and garlic. Cook 1 minute, stirring constantly, then add to slow cooker. Stir in tomatoes, milk and wine. Cover and cook on LOW 6 hours. Toss with hot cooked pasta just before serving and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, if desired.

Description: 
We developed this recipe for a slow cooker project and we expected it to be an easy way to make homemade bolognese sauce. We didn't realize it would also be one of the most flavorful bolognese recipes we'd ever tasted!
