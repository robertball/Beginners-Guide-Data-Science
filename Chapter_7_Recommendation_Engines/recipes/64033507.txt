Ingredients:
1 1/2 T. olive oil, divided
1/4 c. diced red onion (or other)
5 ounces baby spinach
2 ounces feta, finely crumbled
several greek olives, sliced or chopped
3 large whole eggs, separated, plus 2 egg whites
2 tsp. grated lemon zest
salt and pepper
chopped fresh dill for garnish

Directions:
Heat oven to 45o.
In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 T. oil. Add onion and sauté briefly. Add spinach and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until spinach is wilted. Sprinkle the feta on top and set aside.
In a medium bowl, beat egg yolks with hefty pinch of salt, freshly ground pepper, and the lemon zest till fluffy.  Rinse beaters.
In a separate bowl, beat egg whites till they hold soft peaks; stir 1/4 of the whites into the egg yolks, then fold the remaining whites into the yolks gently, just till they are incorporated.
In a large non-stick skillet or seasoned pan with oven-safe handle, heat the remaining 1/2 T. of oil over medium. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet, and gently spread it evenly.  Place in the oven on the middle shelf. Bake till it is puffed and almost cooked through, about 3 minutes.  Meanwhile, reheat the spinach mixture over medium heat.
remove omelet and make an indent down the center with a spatula.  Spoon spinach mix on one side; top with olives. Fold other half over. Return to oven and bake for another 2 to 3 minutes.
Divide into half, sprinkle tin dill, and serve.
