Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
oil for frying
extra cinnamon, sugar and salt for sprinkling

Directions:
Slice the sweet potatoes into thin slices.
For quick prep, Set out two bowls and a plate.
Put the milk and sweet potatoes in the first bowl.
In the second, mix the flour, sugar, cinnamon, ginger and salt.
Take out a few slices at a time, let drip for a moment or two, then then dredge them in the flour mixture, and place on the plate until you've coated them all.
Meanwhile, heat a skillet of oil over medium-high heat, until it acts like its frying when you drop in a chip. Also, mix a little extra cinnamon, sugar and salt to your taste, to sprinkle on the chips after frying. Set out a plate with paper towels for draining.
Fry the chips in 2-3 batches, for 5-7 minutes.
Drain on paper towels.
When they're still hot and moist, sprinkle with a little extra cinnamon, sugar and salt mixed to your taste.
Enjoy!

Description: 
I made this up after I could only find baked sweet potato chips on AllRecipes. (Those are great, too, but I was already frying fish and wanted some nice crunchy chips.) These are crisp, delicious, and easy. Don't sweat the measurements. I just eyeballed it, and you can, too. Mix the seasoning to your own taste.
