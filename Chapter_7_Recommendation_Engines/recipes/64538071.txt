Ingredients:
1 green bell pepper, cut into 1" chunks
2 red bell peppers, cut into 1" chunks
1 red onion, cut into 1" chunks
3 packages turkey breakfast sausage (about 20-30 links), preferably thawed if previously frozen
Olive oil
Fresh ground pepper, to taste
Spike seasoning and/or Spicy Spike seasoning, to taste
1 cup shredded low-fat mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
Place peppers and onions in a casserole dish or Dutch oven.  Toss with olive oil until lightly coated.  Add pepper and Spike seasoning to taste and mix well.  Bake peppers and onions for 20 minutes.
While vegetables are baking, brown turkey sausage in a large pan (about 5-10 minutes, depending on if they are frozen or not).  After sausage is browned and cooked through, cut into bite-sized pieces.
After vegetables have cooked for 20 minutes, add sausage and mix well.  Bake for another 5 minutes.
Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.  Broil for 2 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
