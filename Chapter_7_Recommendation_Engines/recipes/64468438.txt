Ingredients:
2 egg whites (room temperature)
1/8 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cream of tartar
2/3 cup of sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla
6 packages of Pop Rocks (regular 0.33 oz package size) any flavor you like

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. Prepare cookie sheets by cutting parchment paper to fit into the sheet.
Put room-temperature egg whites in the bowl of a stand-mixer along with cream of tartar, vanilla, and salt. Beat together. Add sugar gradually while continuing to beat the egg whites until firm peaks form. Fold in 3 packages of Pop Rocks brand candy.
Dip meringue by heaping Tablespoonsful onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Bites will not rise or spread so only a minimal amount of space between them is needed. Using a spoon, press and spread into the middle of the bites. Lightly wetting the spoon will help meringue not stick to the spoon. Make a little impression in the middle. Bake at 275 degrees for 30 minutes.
Remove bites promptly and allow to cool. Add Â½ teaspoons or so of Pop Rocks to the impressions in the fluffy-bites.

Description: 
Surprisingly quick and easy, these desserts are sweet, chewy, light, and fluffy! 

The Dinomite is 2015's mascot for the annual international charity scavenger hunt, GISHWHES. Inspired by a prompt from the list, I created these confections using POP Rocks brand candy to really add a bit of dynamite to each bite.
