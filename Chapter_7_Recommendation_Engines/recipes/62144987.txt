Three Course Dog Treat Recipe

Ingredients:
3 1/2 c. Whole Wheat Flour (Mine had graham.)
3/4 c. Cornmeal or Grits
1 Beef Bullion Cube (dissolved in 2-3 tbsp. hot water)
1/2 c. Milk
1 Egg, beaten
1/2 tsp Garlic Powder (opt. not all dogs tolerate garlic.)
3 oz. jar Beef and Vegetables baby food
1/8 c. fresh chopped Parsley (optional to taste)
Mashed peas
Finely chopped carrots

Directions:
Mix flour, cornmeal/grits, and garlic.
Beat eggs in with dissolved bullion and milk, add to dry ingredients.
Add parsley.
Stir in baby food. (I used Gerber 3rd Step so it had pieces of food.)
Add mashed peas and carrots if desired. Use judgment as to the amount, there is no right and wrong per se.
Mix until quite stiff.
Spoon into cookie cutter shapes, or roll balls for medallions and place on cookie sheet about 1/2" thick. It doesn't matter how closely, these cookies do not spread.
Cook for 20 minutes, then flip if you want for uniform browning, cook for 40 minutes total.
Cookies will be brown and crispy outside, and slightly soft in center. Let them harden for several hours. Keep refrigerated.
