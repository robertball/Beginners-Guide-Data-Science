Ingredients:
6 eggs
4 slices turkey bacon, cooked and finely chopped
8 small mushrooms, diced
1/2 yellow onion, diced
1/2 medium green bell pepper, diced
1/2 medium red bell pepper, diced
1 teaspoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®)
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 slices Cheddar cheese (such as Tillamook®), or to taste

Directions:
Combine eggs, turkey bacon, mushrooms, onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and Creole seasoning in a bowl. Stir egg mixture well to combine.
Heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Add oil. Pour egg mixture into the skillet. Cook until edges are dry, about 5 minutes. Flip omelet over. Place Cheddar cheese slices on top of the omelet and cook until set, 5 minutes more. Fold omelet over the cheese. Flip again and cook 2 minutes. Flip once more and cook until cheese is melted, about 2 minutes more.
Remove omelet from the pan and allow to sit for 1 minute to cool.
