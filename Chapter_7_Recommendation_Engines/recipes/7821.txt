Ingredients:
3 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate
1/2 cup milk
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs, separated
1 3/4 cups cake flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
2/3 cup white sugar
3/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine chocolate, 1/2 cup milk, brown sugar, and egg yolks.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until custard is thick and smooth.  Cool.
Stir together flour, soda, baking powder, and salt.
In a large bowl, cream butter or margarine.  Blend in white sugar, beating until light and fluffy.  Mix together 3/4 cup milk and vanilla.  Stir flour mixture into creamed mixture alternately with flavored milk.  Make 3 dry and 2 liquid additions, combining lightly after each.  Stir in cooled chocolate custard.
Beat egg whites to form stiff but moist peaks.  Fold into cake batter, and beat by hand for 1 minute.  Turn batter into two greased and floured 8 inch round cake pans.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes, or until cake springs back when lightly touched.  Cool layers for 5 minutes, and then remove from pans.  Cool completely.
