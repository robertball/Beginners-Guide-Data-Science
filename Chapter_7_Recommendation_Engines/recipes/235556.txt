Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta, broken into fourths
2 tablespoons olive oil
12 slices cooked bacon, chopped
1 sweet onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1/2 cup dry white wine (such as Pinot Grigio)
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 pound langostino lobster
1 1/2 cups peas
1 cup basil pesto sauce
1 cup half-and-half
1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted and oiled water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; saute bacon, onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes in hot oil until onion is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir white wine into bacon mixture; cook and stir until wine is absorbed, 2 to 4 minutes.
Stir shrimp and langostino lobster into bacon mixture; saute until shrimp and langostino are pink, about 2 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium and stir cooked linguine into shrimp mixture. Stir peas, pesto sauce, and half-and-half into shrimp-linguine mixture; cook and stir until linguine absorbs the liquid, 5 to 10 minutes. Top servings with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.

It was our turn to host the 'Dinner Club'. Our theme was Italian. This was a great entree that did not take hours in the kitchen and allowed me to enjoy our company. Great fun with great friends!
