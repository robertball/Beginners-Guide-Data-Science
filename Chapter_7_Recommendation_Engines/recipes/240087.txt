2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 cups chicken broth
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained and rinsed
1/2 yellow onion, chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder, or more to taste
1 clove garlic, minced

1/2 teaspoon mustard powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 dash hot sauce (such as CholulaÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Lightly grease the crock of your slow cooker with vegetable oil.
Put chicken breasts into the bottom of the slow cooker crock; add chicken broth, black beans, cannellini beans, diced tomatoes, yellow onion, chili powder, garlic, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, hot sauce, salt, and black pepper.
Cook on Low for 6 hours (or on High for 3 hours).
Remove chicken breasts from the crock to a cutting board. Shred chicken into strands with a pair of forks and return it to the mixture in the crock; add sour cream and stir.
Continue cooking on Low for 30 minutes more.

Description: 
This is so incredibly easy, and I have made it numerous times. I love making this for freezer meals and passing it along to my friends with new babies. This makes a great freezer meal; you can add all ingredients into a freezer bag before or after cooking and freeze.
