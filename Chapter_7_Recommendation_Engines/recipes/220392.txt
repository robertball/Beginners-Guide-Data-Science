Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) jar apricot preserves
1 (8 ounce) bottle Russian-style salad dressing
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard
1  onion, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (3 pound) chicken, cut into 8 pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix apricot preserves, Russian dressing, soy sauce, yellow mustard, onion, and garlic together in a large bowl.
Place chicken pieces into the apricot mixture and stir to coat.
Transfer chicken and sauce to a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and thickened and the chicken is no longer pink inside, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Turn the chicken pieces twice while baking.
If sauce seems thin, transfer chicken to a platter; place baking dish of sauce under broiler until sauce has thickened, 2 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
My mother got this recipe years ago from a friend and we have been making it ever since. I think that her friend called it Sweet and Tangy Chicken but our family has always just said Red Chicken. It's good paired with mashed potatoes or rice.
