Ingredients:
Sauce
2 (28 ounce) cans chopped tomatoes
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce
4 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried basil
2 teaspoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup red wine
Meatballs
1 1/4 pounds ground meatloaf mix (beef, pork veal)
1 1/2 cups crushed corn flakes cereal
3 eggs
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons tomato paste
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
For the sauce, combine the chopped tomatoes, 2 cans tomato paste, tomato sauce, 4 teaspoons oregano, 2 teaspoons parsley, basil, 2 teaspoons sugar, salt, 6 cloves garlic, olive oil, and red wine in a large, heavy pot. Cover, and cook over medium heat until bubbling. Uncover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for at least one hour, stirring often.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray.
Combine the meatloaf mix, corn flakes, eggs, 3 garlic cloves, Parmesan cheese, 3 tablespoons tomato paste, 2 teaspoons dried oregano, 2 tablespoons dried parsley, 1 tablespoon sugar, garlic salt, nutmeg, and black pepper in a large bowl. Mix well with a large fork. Form the meat mixture into 1 1/2 inch firm balls. Place the meatballs on the prepared pan.
Bake meatballs until browned and cooked though, about 20 to 30 minutes. Drop cooked meatballs into hot spaghetti sauce, and serve immediately.

Description: 
I usually spend an afternoon preparing this and freeze leftovers in batches because it's that good. It will easily feed six or you can cut the entire recipe in half. Serve over your favorite spaghetti.
