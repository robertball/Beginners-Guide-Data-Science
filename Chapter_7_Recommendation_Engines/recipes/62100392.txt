Ingredients:
4 venison loin steaks pounded to 1/4" thick
2 cups seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 cup all purpose flour
salt and pepper
2 eggs
2 Tbsp milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Pound steaks to 1/4 inch thickness with meat hammer.
Combine bread crumbs, flour, salt and pepper to taste in gallon size ziplock bag.
In small bowl, lightly beat eggs and milk.
In large skillet, heat oil to med-high heat. (more oil may be needed depending on th size of your skillet.)
Dip one steak at a time into egg mixture, then shake in flour mixture until coated.
Fry in skillet on medium heat until meat is cooked through, turning occassionally to prevent over browning.
Serve with mashed potatoes and gravy. (i used brown gravy, but country gravy may be used for a milder taste.)
NOTE: If you prefer less gamey taste, you can merinade the steaks in milk after pounding out for 30 minutes.
