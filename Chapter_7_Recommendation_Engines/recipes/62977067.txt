Ingredients:

1 lb boneless skinless Chicken Thighs, 1" chunks

3 ribs Celery, chopped

2 teasp minced Garlic
3 cups Chicken Stock
1 1/2 cups Rice
1 Tbs Salt
Cayenne Pepper to taste
Paprika to taste

Directions:
In a Dutch oven over medium high heat, brown the sausage to render fat and develop flavor. When done, add chicken to the pot and cook till almost done, but still juicy.
Add vegetables (onion, celery, peppers and garlic) and cook till soft, not brown.
Add stock, rice, and half of the seasonings and mix again. Raise heat to high, stirring occasionally, until until the stock begins to boil then reduce heat to a simmer and stir occasionally, till the rice absorbs the stock and the Jambalaya is still moist.
Taste for seasonings and adjust as needed.
