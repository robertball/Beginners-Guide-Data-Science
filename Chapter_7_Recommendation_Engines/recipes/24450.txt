Ingredients:
1 cup margarine
7/8 cup superfine sugar
1 egg, beaten
2 1/4 cups self-rising flour
2 1/4 cups cornflakes cereal

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a medium bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the egg alternately with the flour until well blended. If it is a hot day, cover and refrigerate for a few minutes. Wet hands and roll the dough into small balls. Roll the balls in  cornflakes to coat completely and place 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until cornflakes are toasted.
