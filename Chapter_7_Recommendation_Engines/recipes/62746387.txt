Ingredients:
6 lb yams
3 tbsp maple syrup
4 tbsp olive oil
1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 tsp cinnamon
3/4 tsp freshly cracked pepper
1 1/2 tsp Kosher salt - can substitute with 3/4 tsp table salt

Directions:
To prepare the yams, peel, slice in half then cut into 1 - 1 1/2-inch cubes.
Mix together the maple syrup, olive oil, nutmeg, cinnamon, pepper and salt.
You could also add a few pinches of cayenne pepper, if you like.
Pour over the yams and toss to coat.
To bake the yams, preheat the oven to 350Â° degrees Fahrenheit.
Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Toss the yams and spread them out evenly on the baking sheet.
Place into the oven for about 15 minutes before tossing.
Toss the yams and continue to bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until fork tender. Transfer to a serving dish and enjoy.
