Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey sausage
1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, cut into thin strips
1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips
2 tablespoons olive oil
6 slices SARA LEE® Soft & Smooth™ Whole Grain White Bread, cubed
2 cups shredded reduced-fat Swiss cheese
3 eggs
1/2 cup egg substitute
1 cup 2% milk
1 cup fat-free half-and-half
1 teaspoon ground dry mustard

Directions:
Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, and set sausage aside.
Using the same pan, cook mushrooms, onion, and bell peppers in olive oil until tender.
Spread half of the bread cubes in a 7x11 inch baking pan. Add a layer of sausage, and then a layer of vegetables over the bread. Top with half of the cheese, and then spread another layer of bread cubes over the cheese. Top with remaining cheese.
In a bowl, beat together the eggs, egg substitute, milk, half-and-half, and mustard. Pour the egg mixture over everything in the pan. Cover, and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.
Remove the casserole from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake 50 to 60 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
