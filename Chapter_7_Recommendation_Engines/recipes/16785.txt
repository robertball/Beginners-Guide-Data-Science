Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds ground smoked ham
1 pound ground pork
1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup milk
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1 (10.75 ounce) can tomato soup
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon mustard powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine the ham, pork OR sausage, and the ground beef. Stir in the milk, eggs and graham cracker crumbs and mix well. Form into large balls about 2 inches in diameter and place them in a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a separate medium bowl, combine the soup, vinegar, brown sugar and mustard powder. Mix well and pour over the meatballs.
Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour or until internal meat temperature reaches 160 degrees F (73 degrees C).

Description: 
This is my newest, favorite meatball recipe. If you like a sweet twist, you'll like this one. The meatballs will be slightly pink inside when done because of the pork, so do not overbake them!
