Ingredients:
1 large butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch pieces
1 large delicata squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch pieces
3 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
1 (2 pound) rutabaga, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
2 red potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
2 carrots, sliced
1 large onion, sliced
2 tablespoons dried rosemary
2 tablespoons dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
6 dried bay leaves
1 dash lemon juice
1 dash red wine vinegar
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix butternut squash, delicata squash, sweet potato, rutabaga, and red potato pieces, carrots, and onion in a large roasting pan. Mix rosemary, thyme, and oregano in a small bowl.
Drizzle olive oil over the vegetables and sprinkle with herb mixture; toss to coat vegetables with oil and herbs. Scatter bay leaves over vegetables and drizzle lemon juice and red wine vinegar over the top.
Roast in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender, about 1 hour and 30 minutes, stirring every 30 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
