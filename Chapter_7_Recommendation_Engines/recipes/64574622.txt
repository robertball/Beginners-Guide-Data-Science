Ingredients:
4 cups of bread flour
1 1/2 cups of water (must be 105 to 110 degrees)
2 1/4 teaspoons of active dry yeast, or 1 package of active dry yeast
1 1/8 teaspoons of sugar
2 1/4 tablespoons of olive oil
2 1/4 teaspoons of sea salt (not table salt or iodized salt)

Directions:
Add active dry yeast to water in a large mixing bowl that has been warmed to between 105 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit.  You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment.
Add sugar to  yeast and water mixture and let sit for 10 to 12 minutes undisturbed.  You are ready to go to the next step when the top of the water looks a little foamy or bubbly, and it smells a little like beer.
Put half of the amount of flour, plus all of the salt, and all of the oil in at this time.  Add a half cup of flour at a time until you reach a total of 4 cups or when the dough easily pulls away from the side of the bowl.  The dough should not feel sticky at all.
Rub a clean, large bowl with some olive oil and put a little bit of flour on your hands and take the dough out of the mixing bowl.  Cover the bowl with a towel and let it rise for at least one hour.
After allowing the dough to rise for at least one hour, take the dough out of the bowl onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead the dough for a couple minutes.
You may shape the dough into any pan or baking sheet that you have.  This recipe makes enough pizza dough for two 14-inch round pizza crusts.
