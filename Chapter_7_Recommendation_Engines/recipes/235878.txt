Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
3 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuit dough, separated and cut into quarters
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup margarine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Mix white sugar and cinnamon together in a gallon-size resealable bag; add biscuits and toss to coat. Press coated biscuits into muffin cups, about 2/3 full.
Heat brown sugar and margarine together in a saucepan over medium-low heat until melted, 3 to 5 minutes; pour over each biscuit muffin.
Bake in the preheated oven until dough is cooked through, about 20 minutes.

I came across this recipe when looking for bake sale recipes. The bake sale was going a little slow, I popped these in the oven and the smell brought everyone to the table!
