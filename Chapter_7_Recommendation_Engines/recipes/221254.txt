Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
12 ounces fresh spinach leaves, torn
3/4 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
3/4 cup croutons
4 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
1 pinch ground black pepper, to taste
3/4 cup ranch salad dressing (such as Hidden Valley® Original Ranch®)

Directions:
Fry the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble once cool enough to handle.
Toss crumbled bacon, spinach, and mushrooms together in a salad bowl; top with croutons and eggs. Season the salad with black pepper and drizzle with ranch dressing.
