Ingredients:
Avocado salsa:
1 large avocado, peeled, seeded sliced
1 small red or sweet onion, thin sliced
2 bell peppers thin sliced (your choice of colors)
2 tbs finely chopped cilantro
1 minced garlic clove
1/4 cup of fresh squeezed lime juice
1 tbs olive oil
2 tbs finely chopped cilantro
Salt and ground pepper taste
Salmon rub:
2 lbs salmon, cut into 4 pieces
1 tbs olive oil
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground coriander
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp paprika powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp black pepper

Directions:
For the salsa combine the avocado, onion, peppers, minced garlic, cilantro, lime juice, olive oil and salt and pepper in a medium bowl and mix well, let marinate until ready to top your salmon.
Mix the coriander, cumin, paprika, onion and black pepper together, rub the salmon fillets with olive oil and this seasoning mix, and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes before grilling.
Preheat grill to medium high heat
Place salmon skinless side first on an well oiled grill that has been preheated to medium high heat. Grill 2 minutes, just long enough for grill marks, flip to the skin side, cook another 6-8 minutes with the lid closed until the salmon flakes with a fork. Remove fillets and let them rest a minute.
Top with the avocado salsa and serve.
