Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon honey
1 teaspoon Asian (toasted) sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
3/4 pound cooked shrimp
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 thin slice fresh ginger root
1 small head broccoli, broken into florets
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 small onion, halved and sliced
1 small yellow squash, sliced
1 small zucchini, sliced
4 mushrooms, quartered
2 cups hot cooked rice

Directions:
Whisk water, ketchup, soy sauce, cornstarch, honey, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes in a bowl. Stir shrimp into sauce mixture until coated.
Heat a wok or a large skillet over medium-high heat and add vegetable oil; cook and stir garlic and ginger in hot oil until fragrant and garlic begins to soften, 1 minute. Discard garlic and ginger, leaving oil in wok. Cook and stir broccoli, red bell pepper, onion, yellow squash, zucchini, and mushrooms in oil until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
Stir shrimp and sauce mixture into vegetables; cook and stir until shrimp are hot and sauce has thickened and coated shrimp and vegetables, 3 to 5 more minutes. Serve over hot cooked rice.
