Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 tbsp. fresh lime juice (the juice of approx. 1 small lime)
3 cactus figs

Directions:
Remove the outer skin of the cactus figs to expose the light green flesh. Push the flesh through a wire mesh or sieve, into a small bowl. You want to get the juice out of the flesh, but trap the small seeds and pulp in the sieve. Set it aside.
In a small saucepan, dissolve the sugar in the water, and bring it to a boil, stirring frequently. Once slightly thickened, remove from heat and let cool.
Add the lime juice and cactus fig 'juice' to the sugar water. Mix thoroughly and chill for 1 hour.
Freeze mixture in an ice cream maker, according to its specifications.
