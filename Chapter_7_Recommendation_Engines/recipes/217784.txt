Ingredients:
1 (750 milliliter) bottle good-quality vodka (such as Grey Goose®, Chopin®, or Dry Fly®)
1/4 cup grains of paradise, lightly cracked

Directions:
Pour the vodka into a 1-liter glass bottle, and add the grains of paradise. Close the bottle, and shake gently. Store in a cool place for 5 to 7 days; gently shake the bottle once a day.
Strain the vodka through a very fine metal mesh strainer, such as a wine strainer, into a sterile glass container. (Using a coffee filter will strip some of the flavoring oils out of the vodka.)

Submitter: 
The Gruntled Gourmand
Description: 
Substituting grains of paradise for your normal black Tellicherry peppercorns, this delicious blend of peppercorns, ginger, and cardamom flavors will have your friends exclaiming 'We love that voodoo that you do!'  This pepper vodka is great over ice or in your favorite bloody mary!  Na vash zdorovya!
