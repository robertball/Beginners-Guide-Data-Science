Ingredients:
3 cups KELLOGG'S* RICE KRISPIES* cereal
1/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons margarine
2/3 cup chocolate chips
1/3 cup chopped pecans
2 (8 ounce) packages light cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup light sour cream
2/3 cup caramel ice cream topping

Directions:
In food processor, combine cereal, brown sugar and margarine. Process until it becomes fine crumbs. Press into bottom and halfway up sides of 23 cm (9-inch) springform pan coated with cooking spray. Bake at 180 degrees C (350 degrees F) about 8 minutes.
In small bowl mix together chocolate chips and pecans. Remove 50 mL (1/4 cup); set aside for topping. Sprinkle remainder of mixture over baked crust.
In large bowl with electric mixer, beat together cream cheese and sugar on medium until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in salt, vanilla and sour cream. Pour into prepared crust.
Return to oven. Bake about 40 minutes or until set in center and pulls away from edges. Remove from oven and immediately run knife around edge to prevent cracking. Cool 1 hour; remove outer ring. Chill at least 2 hours before serving. Cut into wedges, place on serving plates. Sprinkle tops with a little of the reserved chocolate/pecan mixture and drizzle each with 15 mL (1 tbsp) caramel topping.
