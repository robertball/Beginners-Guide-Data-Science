Ingredients:
2 ½ tsp olive oil, divided
3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into ¾-inch cubes
½ tsp kosher salt
½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 ½ large shallots, minced
1 ½ cups diced carrots
1 cup diced celery
1 tsp dried thyme
1 cup cup quinoa
6 cups chicken broth
1 cup frozen green peas
? cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large saucepan set over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breast meat, salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until the chicken has just turned white on the outside. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
Reduce heat to medium and add 1½ teaspoons olive oil to the pan. Add chopped shallot, carrots, celery, and dried thyme. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are just tender, 7 to 8 minutes.
Stir in quinoa, chicken broth and chicken. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover and let simmer until quinoa is translucent, about 15 minutes.
Add frozen peas and heat for additional 5 minutes. Taste and season with additional ground pepper, if desired. Stir in chopped parsley and serve.
