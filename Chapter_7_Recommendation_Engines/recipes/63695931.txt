Ingredients:
1/2 cup lemon juice
1/3 cup honey
3 Tbl canola oil
6 green onions, sliced
3 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped
3 tsp dried thyme
3/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp ground allspice
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
6 boneless skinless chicken pieces

Directions:
In a blender, combine the first nine ingredients, cover and process until smooth. Pour 1/2 cup into a small bowl for basting; cover and refrigerate. Pour remaining marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add chicken. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for up to 6 hours or overnight.
Drain and discard marinade. Using long-handled tongs, moisten a paper towel with cooking oil and lightly coat the grill rack. Grill chicken, covered, over medium heat or broil 4 in. from the heat for 4-6 minutes on each side or until a meat thermometer reads 170Â°, basting frequently with the reserved marinade.
