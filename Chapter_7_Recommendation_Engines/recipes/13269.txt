Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped celery
1 pound boneless chicken breast halves, cooked and diced
3 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
1/2 cup water
2 cups frozen mixed vegetables
3/4 cup converted long-grain white rice
1 tablespoon dried parsley
2 teaspoons lemon and herb seasoning

Directions:
Combine celery, chicken pieces, chicken broth, water, mixed vegetables, rice, parsley and herb seasoning in a slow cooker.  Cover, and cook on low 6 to 8 hours.   If soup is too thick, add more water to dilute and allow 15 minutes of additional cooking time.
