Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cubed
6 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon sesame oil, divided
2 teaspoons honey
2 teaspoons rice wine vinegar
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 cup frozen sugar snap peas
1 cup shredded carrots
1 cup fresh bean sprouts
1 bell pepper, cut into strips
6 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spread tofu on top.
Mix soy sauce, ginger, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, honey, rice wine vinegar, and garlic together in a bowl. Pour 1/2 the mixture over the tofu.
Bake tofu in the preheated oven until evenly browned, about 30 minutes.
Heat 1 teaspoon sesame oil in a large skillet or wok after 15 minutes of baking time. Add sugar snap peas and carrots; stir-fry until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Heat remaining 1 teaspoon sesame oil in the skillet. Add bean sprouts, bell pepper, and green onions; stir-fry until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
Return sugar snap peas and carrots to the skillets. Add remaining soy sauce mixture. Stir-fry until flavors combine, about 5 minutes more. Mix in tofu carefully.
