Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats, divided
1 cup raisins, divided
1/2 cup creamy natural peanut butter
2 tablespoons applesauce, or more as needed
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons unsalted peanuts

Directions:
Grind 1/2 cup oats in food processor into a powder; transfer to a bowl.
Process 1/2 cup raisins in a food processor until thick and paste-like; add peanut butter, applesauce, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Blend mixture again until smooth. Blend ground oats into the mixture until it begins to clump together. If more moisture is needed to achieve clumping, add more applesauce.
Transfer the raisin mixture to a bowl. Mix remaining oats, remaining raisins, chocolate chips, and peanuts with the raisin mixture; roll by rounded tablespoon into small balls.
