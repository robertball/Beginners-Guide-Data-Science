Ingredients:
3 cups water
1 ½ cups jasmine rice
1 teaspoon salt
3  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
½ cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon water, or as desired
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons curry powder
1  mango - peeled, seeded, and diced
2 cups clover sprouts, or to taste
1 cup finely chopped cashews
1 bunch fresh cilantro, finely chopped
4  green onions, chopped

Directions:
Combine 3 cups water, rice, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover saucepan, and simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and let sit until rice is tender, about 5 minutes more.
Place chicken breasts in a skillet and add soy sauce and 1 tablespoon water; turn heat to medium-high. Cover skillet and cook chicken, turning occasionally, until no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. Cut chicken into cubes.
Combine coconut milk, sugar, and curry powder in a saucepan; bring to a simmer. Add mango to curry sauce and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Spoon rice into a bowl and top with sprouts, cashews, cilantro, green onions, and chicken. Drizzle mango curry sauce over chicken.
