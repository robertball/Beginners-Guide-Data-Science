Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup margarine
2 cups matzo cake meal
6 egg

Directions:
Bring the water to boil in a saucepan. Add the salt, oil and margarine. When it returns to a boil, gradually stir in the matzo meal, continuing to stir until the mixture becomes a solid lump. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.
When the mixture is cool, stir in the eggs until a smooth texture is achieved. Let stand for 30 minutes. Form into four balls and place on a greased baking pan.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake the rolls for 30 minutes. Turn off the oven and leave the rolls inside for 10 minutes.
