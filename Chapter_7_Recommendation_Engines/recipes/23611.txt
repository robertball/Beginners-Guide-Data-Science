Ingredients:
1 pound dry fettuccini noodles
8 slices bacon
4 eggs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 1/4 cups heavy cream
ground black pepper to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Fry bacon in skillet over medium heat until crispy, remove and drain on paper towel.  Chop with knife into bits.
Beat the eggs, cheese and cream in a bowl, then add the bacon.  Pour over the pasta in the pan and toss gently using tongs.
Return the pan to a very low heat and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until slightly thickened.  Don't overheat or the eggs will scramble.  Season well with black pepper and serve.
