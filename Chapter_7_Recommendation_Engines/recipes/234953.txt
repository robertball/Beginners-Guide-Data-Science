8 slices bacon, cut into bite-size pieces
1 small red onion, chopped, or more to taste
3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
5 cups chopped green tomatoes
3 cups vegetable broth
1/2 teaspoon celery salt, or more to taste
1 bay leaf, or more to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a stock pot over medium-low heat; cook and stir until bacon begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir onion and garlic into bacon; cook and stir until onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Add green tomatoes, vegetable broth, celery salt, bay leaf, and black pepper to bacon-onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tomatoes are tender, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great way to use the green tomatoes at the end of the season. Freezes really well! I recommend serving it with a nice crusty bread.
