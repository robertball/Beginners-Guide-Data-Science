Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
1/2 yellow onion, diced
3 1/2 ounces dry chorizo sausage, diced
1 yellow bell pepper, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
2 fresh red chile peppers, diced
1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (15 ounce) can black beans
1 (15 ounce) can baked beans (such as Bush's® Texas Ranchero)
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style stewed tomatoes (such as Del Monte® Italian Recipe Stewed Tomatoes)
1 (14 ounce) can whole kernel corn
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®)
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound ground turkey
3 cloves garlic, diced
8 ounces sour cream
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Turn a slow cooker on High and add butter to melt.
Heat a medium pan over medium heat. Add chorizo and cook until fats begin to render, about 3 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more. Add to the slow cooker. Stir in bell peppers, chile peppers, tomato sauce, black beans, baked beans, tomatoes, and corn. Add hot sauce, chili powder, and paprika.
Heat oil in the same pan over medium-high heat. Saute garlic in the pan until browned, about 1 minute. Add turkey; saute until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain the liquid from the pan and add to the slow cooker. Turn the slow cooker to Low and cook, stirring once every hour, until reduced, about 6 hours. Serve with a spoonful of sour cream and shredded Cheddar on top of each bowl.

Description: 
This is the turkey chili I made to compete on fooduel.blogspot.com. It's not overbearingly spicy, with good texture and flavor. To thicken this chili, you can add double the amount of chorizo and stew the tomato sauce before adding it to the slow cooker.
