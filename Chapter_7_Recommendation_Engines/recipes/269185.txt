Ingredients:
1/2 cup milk
1/3 cup olive oil
1 1/4 cups leftover cranberry sauce
1/3 cup brown sugar, or more to taste
1 egg
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup oatmeal
1/4 cup chopped pecans, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
Combine milk, olive oil, leftover cranberry sauce, brown sugar, and egg in a bowl and mix together using an electric mixer. Mix in baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Gradually add flour and oatmeal and mix everything into a smooth batter.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full. Sprinkle with chopped pecans.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 21 minutes. Cool in the tin for 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
These muffins are so soft and fluffy and so delicious with the roasted pecans on top. A great way to use up leftover cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving! The sugar amount needed depends on how sweet your cranberry sauce is. You can go up to 1/2 cup if the leftover cranberry sauce is on the tart side.
