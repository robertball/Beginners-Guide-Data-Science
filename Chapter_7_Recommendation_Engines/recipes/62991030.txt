Ingredients:
1 extra large egg
1 1/2 TBSP oil
2 TBSP honey
10 oz water
2 1/2 cups bread flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup mixture of grains (such as King Arthur Flour's Harvest Grains Blend)
1 1/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp active yeast

Directions:
Add ingredients in order listed into your bread machine, creating a mound in the middles with the flours and grains. Create a shallow hole with a spoon at the top of the mound for the yeast and add the yeast last.
For Bread Loaf: Set your bread machine to the 2 lb. Loaf setting.
For Cloverleaf Buns: Set your bread machine to the Dough setting. After the dough is complete, divide the dough in half. Store half in the fridge covered in greased Saran wrap. With the other half, using sharp knife, cut into 12 equal pieces. Then cut each of the twelve pieces into 3 pieces, giving you 36 pieces of dough. Shape each piece of dough into a ball. Place three dough balls into each cup of a greased muffin tin. Spray tops of buns with cooking spray and cover loosely with Saran wrap to prevent drying out. Allow to rise for about an hour. You may drizzle with melted butter prior to baking. Bake at 375 degrees for 10-14 minutes. Repeat with other half of dough.
