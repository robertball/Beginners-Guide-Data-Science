Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained
16 slices fresh mozzarella cheese
16 thick slices ripe slicing tomato
32 leaves fresh basil
olive oil
1 pinch ground black pepper to taste
1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained (optional)

Directions:
Cut roasted red peppers into 16 large pieces. Starting at the edge of a serving platter, place a slice of tomato, a basil leaf, a slice of mozzarella cheese, a piece of roasted pepper, and another basil leaf. Continue in that pattern, forming a spiral from the outside in, until all the ingredients have been arranged; salad should end in the center of the platter. Drizzle the salad with olive oil and sprinkle with black pepper and black olives.
