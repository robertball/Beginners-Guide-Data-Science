Ingredients:
4 large garnet yams
2  chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, finely chopped
¼ cup softened butter
¼ cup brown sugar
¼ cup heavy cream, or as needed
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place yams onto a baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven until very soft, about 1 hour. Once done, allow to cool, then peel and place into a mixing bowl. Mash the chipotle chiles into a paste, and add to the potatoes along with the butter, brown sugar, and heavy cream. Mash until smooth, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Spread the potatoes into a shallow baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, 20 to 25 minutes.
