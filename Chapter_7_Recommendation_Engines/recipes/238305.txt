Ingredients:
1 large yellow plantain, peeled
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon canola oil
1/2 teaspoon reduced-fat margarine (such as Smart BalanceÂ®)
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon agave nectar
1/3 teaspoon light brown sugar
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or more to taste (optional)

Directions:
Cut plantain into three sections. Quarter each section so you have twelve pieces. Season plantain pieces with garlic powder.
Heat oil and margarine together in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook plantains in hot oil until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side; season with black pepper and continue to cook until slightly darker in color, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove skillet from heat and drizzle agave syrup over the plantain pieces. Sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon over the plantains.
