Ingredients:
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
1 cup water
1 cup milk
1/4 cup sour cream
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup drained sauerkraut
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds (optional)
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 (16 ounce) package frozen shredded hash brown potatoes

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Whisk the flour, bouillon granules, water, and milk together in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil until thick, 1 to 2 minutes, whisking continuously. Remove from heat and stir the sour cream into the flour mixture; set aside to cool.
Combine the onion, Cheddar cheese, sauerkraut, salt, pepper, and caraway seeds in a large mixing bowl. Stir the sour cream sauce and the melted butter into the sauerkraut mixture; fold the hash brown potatoes into the mixture. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Use a spatula to flatten into an even layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are tender and the top is brown and bubbly, 60 to 70 minutes.

Description: 
This dish has some of the flavors that I miss from my childhood in Germany. It is comfort food with a capital 'C.'  I like to pair it with my own pork schnitzel or with baked chicken for a hearty dinner. This dish also includes a recipe for a creamy sauce that I use both in pot pies and as a substitute for condensed soups in many recipes. 'Guten Appetit!'
