Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) pork tenderloin, or to taste
1/4 cup hoisin sauce, divided
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
1 pound lean ground pork
1 (4 ounce) can small shrimp, drained and chopped
1/4 cup bread crumbs
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons dried cilantro
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1 dash soy sauce
6 cups chicken stock
2 cups beef stock
1 (16 ounce) package wonton wrappers
1 cup chopped green onions

Directions:
Rub pork tenderloin with 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce. Season with red pepper flakes.
Place pork tenderloin in a slow cooker. Cook on High until tender, 3 to 4 hours. Cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Chop into small pieces.
Mix remaining 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce, ground pork, shrimp, bread crumbs, rice vinegar, cilantro, ginger, and soy sauce together in a large bowl.
Place a 3/4-inch round ball of ground pork filling in the center of each wonton wrapper. Brush edges with water; fold and seal.
Bring chicken stock and beef stock to a low boil in a large pot. Stir in pork tenderloin. Add wontons; cook until ground pork filling is no longer pink in the center, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to very low.
Serve soup garnished with green onions.
