Ingredients:
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed
1/2 yellow onion, chopped
1 leek, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
1/2 head broccoli, cut into florets
3 red potatoes, cut into bite-size pieces
1 (32 ounce) carton low-sodium vegetable broth
water to cover
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 bay leaf
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 (12 fluid ounce) can fat-free evaporated milk
3 tablespoons whole wheat flour, or as needed
1 tablespoon curry powder

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a stockpot over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion, leek, and garlic until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Add cauliflower, broccoli, and potatoes to onion mixture; cook and stir until potatoes are lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Increase heat to medium-high; stir broth and enough water to cover vegetables into mixture.  Stir curry powder, turmeric, bay leaf, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper into broth-vegetable mixture. Loosely cover pot with a lid and bring soup to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are softened, 20 to 25 minutes.
Whisk milk and flour together in a bowl until smooth and thickened; stir into soup along with nutritional yeast until soup is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove soup from heat and allow to slightly cool and thicken.

Description: 
Growing up I always loved my mom's broccoli and cauliflower soup! Now that I'm an adult, I've created my own version suited to my personal tastes. This is a vegetarian soup and can easily be made vegan with dairy substitutes (I use soy milk). My fiance likes reduced-fat sharp Cheddar and crackers with his soup. Enjoy!
