Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
8 ounces process cheese food, cubed
1 cup salsa
1 (15 ounce) can chili without beans

Directions:
Mix cream cheese, processed cheese food, salsa, and chili in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat. Stir until the mixture has melted and become well blended.

Submitter: 
jujube
Description: 
A definite crowd pleaser, and not too spicy for those who usually shy away from chili or salsa dips.  Served with tortilla chips.  Best served warm, but still retains a good dipping consistency when cold or at room temperature. This dip can be served in a bread bowl (a hollowed out round loaf).
