Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) can black olives, drained, brine reserved
1 (6 ounce) can pimento-stuffed green olives, drained, brine reserved
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1 onion, chopped
3 stalks celery, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon capers, rinsed and chopped
1/4 cup Italian dressing
2 tablespoons reserved olive brine, or as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the black olives, pimento-stuffed green olives, artichoke hearts, onion, celery, garlic, and capers in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until the ingredients are uniform in size, and no larger than a popcorn kernel. Stir in the Italian dressing. Add equal amounts of green and black olive brine as needed for a moist consistency. Season with salt and black pepper. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours before serving.

Description: 
This combines my love of the New Orleans-style olive salad that you find on muffaletta sandwiches and Italian olive tapenades. With so many olives how could you go wrong? I use it on fish, sandwiches, dips, and in herbed breads.
