Ingredients:
1 1/8 cups of warm water
1/4 cup of Honey
2 tablespoons of butter
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup bread flour
1 teaspoon of salt
1 1/2 teaspoon of active dry yeast

Directions:
Add the ingredients according to your bread machine's instructions. Mine tell me to put the liquid in first. I like to stir the salt into the flour before putting it on top of the liquid. I then make a little hole in the flour for my yeast.
I use the Basic bread cycle with the light color setting.
I have found the easiest way to slice it, is to let it cool completely. Sometimes this doesn't always work, since we want to eat it as soon as it comes out of the machine!!

This is a terrific recipe for the Bread machine. Easy to make, and taste so good!! Has a wonderful crispy crust, and so tasty on the inside! The house smells wonderful! It's terrific right out of the bread machine warm, but it taste just as good when it's cool! Makes wonderful Grilled cheese and lunch box sandwiches!!
