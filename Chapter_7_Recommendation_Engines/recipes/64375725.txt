Ingredients:
1 gallon bag of frozen shrimp shells
2 tablespoons oil (or butter)
1/4 cup each diced onion, carrot, and celery
Seasonings (fresh or dried herbs, peppercorns, or hot chile powder)
6 Cups Water

Directions:
Saute (or "sweat") the onion, carrot, and celery in the oil until softened and translucent.
Add the shrimp shells and cook about 2 minutes, until they turn pink and fragrant.
If you want additional seasonings, add them now.
Add water, bring to a boil, then simmer for about 1 hour.
Strain the liquid through a colander, pressing on the shells with a wooden spoon to make sure all the flavor is released.

Description: 
Shrimp stock is one of those dishes that seem like it's restaurant-only but really, it's plenty easy to make at home.
