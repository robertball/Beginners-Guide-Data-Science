Ingredients:
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
4 center-cut boneless pork chops - 1/2-inch thick
2 teaspoons canola oil, or as needed
salt to taste
1 large sweet onion, sliced

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Mix honey, soy sauce, crushed red pepper flakes, and black pepper in a bowl. Pour about 2 tablespoons of the honey-soy mixture into a small bowl and save for later. Brush chops with canola oil on both sides, and sprinkle with salt and black pepper.
Grill the chops on the hottest part of the grill until lightly charred and crusty, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Move the chops to a cooler area of the grill, and continue to cook, brushing both sides generously with the honey-soy glaze, until chops are no longer pink inside, about 3 to 4 more minutes. The juices should run clear, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
While chops are grilling, brush slices of onion with oil, and sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Grill onion slices until they are translucent and browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. To serve, place chops and onions on warmed plates, and brush the chops with the reserved honey-soy glaze.
