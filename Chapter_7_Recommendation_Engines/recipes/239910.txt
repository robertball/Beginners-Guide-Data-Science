Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
2 (29 ounce) cans tomato sauce
3 tablespoons dried basil
3 tablespoons dried oregano
3 tablespoons onion powder
2 tablespoons garlic powder
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned completely, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Stir tomato sauce, basil, oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, sugar, salt, and pepper into the beef; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook sauce at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick and rich, about 1 hour.
