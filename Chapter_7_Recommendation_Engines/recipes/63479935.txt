Ingredients:
1/2 cup Nutiva coconut oil

2 tsp vanilla
3 cups icing sugar
3 Tbsp canned coconut milk (shaken up to mix the 'cream' with the watery portion)

Directions:
Blend the coconut oil & manna together on low-to-med speed. If you need to, add some coconut milk to help blend the 2 together!
Once the mixture is smooth, add the vanilla.
Add 1 cup of icing sugar & 1 Tbsp of coconut milk at a time & blend till smooth.  Continue adding the icing sugar & coconut milk until all 3 cups/3Tbsp are used.

Description: 
Searching for a dairy-free WHITE icing for our 4-yr-old proved futile - even Google failed!  This is my own recipe - completely made from scratch!  I hope you enjoy this as much as we did!  This made really thick tasty icing!  The best I've had in a LONG time - PLUS it's completely dairy-free! (and soy free I believe!)
This icing will not separate - even at room temperature for 5 days!! :)  Made for my own chocolate cake (Bundt pan) - also on allrecipes.com!
I am NOT a cake icer by any stretch of the imagination! But it was simple to make & fairly easy to 'clump' on & then spread out a bit!
