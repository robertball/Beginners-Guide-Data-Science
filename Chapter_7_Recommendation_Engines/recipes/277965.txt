Directions:
Grease a 9x13-inch pan.

Cut into seventy-eight 1 1/2-inch squares.

Description: 
When I think of fudge, I think of Ralphie in A Christmas Story who slips and says a swear word when helping his father change a tire. This delicious creamy fudge recipe came from my friend Karen's mom, Marge. It uses less sugar than most fudge recipes and is easy to make. Watch A Christmas Story and enjoy a creamy piece of fudge!
