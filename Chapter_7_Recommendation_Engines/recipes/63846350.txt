Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese, grated
1/3 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon basil
2 cloves garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste
2 medium zucchinis, thinly sliced
5 plum tomatoes, thinly sliced
1/4 cup butter
2 tablespoons onion, finely chopped
3/4 cup fine bread crumbs

Directions:
Lightly butter a 9x9-inch pan.
In a large bowl, combine Cheddar, Parmesan, oregano, basil, and garlic.
Season with salt and pepper, and set aside.
Arrange half of the zucchini slices in the pan. Sprinkle 1/4 of the cheese and herb mixture on top.
Arrange half of the tomatoes, and top with another 1/4 of the cheese mixture. Repeat layers.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat.
Stir in onions, and cook until soft and translucent.
Stir in breadcrumbs; cook until they have absorbed the butter.
Sprinkle on top of casserole.
Cover loosely with foil, and bake at 375Â° for 25 minutes.
Remove foil, and bake until the top is crusty and the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.
