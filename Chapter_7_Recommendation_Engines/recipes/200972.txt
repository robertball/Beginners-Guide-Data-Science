Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package lasagna noodles
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
10 ounces ground lamb
1 teaspoon dried sage
1 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 (5.5 ounce) package crumbled goat cheese
1 bunch fresh mint
1/4 cup pine nuts
6 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the pasta in the boiling water uncovered until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Cut each sheet in half, width-wise.
Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the lamb in the hot oil until evenly browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Season with the sage, thyme, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat; stir the goat cheese into the cooked lamb. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the lamb mixture into the center of each of the lasagna sheets and roll into a cylinder; arrange on a plate.
Blend the mint, pine nuts, and olive oil in a blender until finely chopped but not liquefied; drizzle over the rolls to serve.

Description: 
This is a very rich dish. Often, I find it's best served as a small appetizer rather than an entree because of the meat and cheese filling.
