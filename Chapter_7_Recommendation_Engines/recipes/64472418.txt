Ingredients:
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
3 cups cold heavy cream
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Place the sugar and cornstarch in a small saucepan.
While stirring constantly, pour in 3/4 cup of the cream. Place the pan over medium heat and, stirring constantly, bring to a boil (it will be lumpy, but will smooth out). Remove from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and let cool completely, about 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, place the remaining 2 1/4 cups cream in the bowl of a stand mixer and refrigerate.
2When the cornstarch mixture has cooled, fit the chilled bowl of cream onto the stand mixer.
Using the whisk attachment, whisk on medium speed until tracks begin to show in the cream, about 2 minutes.
With the mixer still on, slowly add the cornstarch mixture and continue whisking until stiff peaks form, about 1 to 2 minutes more.
The whipped cream can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days or left out at room temperature for up to 3 hours.
