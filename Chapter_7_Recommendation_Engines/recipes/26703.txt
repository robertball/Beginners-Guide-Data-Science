Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) loaf white bread, crusts trimmed
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 pound sliced bacon, cut in half

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut each slice of white bread in half horizontally. Spread with cream cheese. Tightly roll each piece of bread with half a piece of bacon. The bacon should be on the outside of the bread. Secure with toothpicks.
Arrange roll ups in a single layer on a medium baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until bacon is no longer pink and bread is lightly browned. Serve warm.

Description: 
I was given this recipe at a party a long time ago by the hostess. It is a really easy appetizer to make and always the first one to disappear. Toothpicks are necessary to secure these little roll ups.
