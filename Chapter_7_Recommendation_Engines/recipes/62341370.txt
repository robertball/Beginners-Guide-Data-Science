Description: 
Eye of round roast is roasted at 500 degrees F. The original cook was a genius. This recipe takes a very tough piece of meat and makes it so tender and delicious.  The easiest roast you'll ever cook! I didn't change anything except for the seasoning. You can't improve on perfection.Modified from: High Temperature Eye-of-Round Roast
