Ingredients:
2 cups Shredded Zucchini (packed tightly)
2 cups Sugar
1 cup Coconut Oil
3 Eggs (free range)
1 - 1/3 cups all purpose white flour
2/3 cups whole wheat pastry flour
2T Baking Powder
1T Ground Cinnamon
1 cup chopped Walnuts
1T Vanilla
CREAM CHEESE FROSTING
4 cups Powdered sugar
1 - 8oz Pack of cream cheese
1 - 1/4lb stick of butter

Directions:
1. Set cream cheese and butter in a bowl and allow to soften - warming to room temperature.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees
3. Grease Muffin pan (or use muffin liners)
4. Beat sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla at medium speed i with electric mixer for 4 minutes
5. Add Zucchini and nuts to sugar/egg/oil mixture, mix until blended
6. Sift together Flours, Baking Powder and Cinnamon, can be sifted directly onto the zucchini/sugar mixture. Blend throughly.
7. Drop by scoops into muffin pan, fill 1/2 way
8. Bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick entered in the center comes out clean (My time is based on using a Pampered Chef muffin stone, so if you are using a metal pan you many need to adjust the time)
9. Allow muffins to cool in the pan for 15 minutes, using a butter knife separating them from the sides of if pan if necessary - left gently from the pan and transfer to a cooling rack.
10. Blend the room temperature cream cheese and butter, add in the powered sugar in slowly. You may add milk by the tablespoon for a thinner frosting or flour by the tablespoon to thicken
11. Once cupcakes are completely cook, frost and enjoy!
