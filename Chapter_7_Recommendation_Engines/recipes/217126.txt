Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
2 (3 ounce) packages beef flavored ramen noodles
1/2 cup beef broth
2 tablespoons Thai chili peanut sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
1 tablespoon olive oil
3/4 pound beef top round steak, cut into 1/4-inch strips
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 carrot, cut into matchsticks
1 stalk celery, thinly sliced
3 green onions, thinly sliced
1/4 cup thinly sliced red bell pepper
2 cups shredded cabbage
1 cup bean sprouts
4 fresh mushrooms, thinly sliced
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the ramen noodles with only 1 seasoning packs, and return to a boil. Cook until the noodles are tender, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Whisk the beef broth, peanut sauce, soy sauce, and ground ginger together in a bowl; set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet. Stir in the steak; cook and stir until the steak is no longer pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the meat from the pan and set aside. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the same skillet. Stir in the carrot, celery, green onion, and bell pepper. Cook and stir until the vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add cabbage, bean sprouts, and mushrooms. Stir in the sauce. Cover and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes.
Toss in the cooked ramen noodles and steak. Season with salt and pepper, and serve in bowls.
