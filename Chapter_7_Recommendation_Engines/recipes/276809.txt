Description: 
This healthier alternative to pumpkin pie makes a delicious autumn breakfast or midday snack. Prepare these ahead of time in small jars and you'll have breakfast ready on those busy mornings! If you prefer more crunch, add the final layer of granola right before serving. Try to find low-sugar yogurt and granola for a healthier parfait.
