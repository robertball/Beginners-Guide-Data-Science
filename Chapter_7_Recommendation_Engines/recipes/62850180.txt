Ingredients:
3 eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 cups cucumber, peeled, grated and drained (about 2 large)
3 cups all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
3 teaspoons cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon each of nutmeg and cloves
1 cup coarsely chopped pecans or walnuts

Directions:
Heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease, or spray with cooking spray, two 9x5 inch loaf pans, making sure the bottoms are well-greased. Mix all ingredients well in a large bowl. Fill loaf pans evenly and bake for 50 to 60 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Let sit 10 minutes in pan before removing to cool.
