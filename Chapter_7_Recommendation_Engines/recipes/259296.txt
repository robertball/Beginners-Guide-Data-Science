2 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon onion powder

1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

1/2 (11 ounce) can Mexican-style corn (such as Green Giant® Mexicorn®) (optional)

Directions:
Combine cilantro, lime juice, olive oil, onion powder, parsley, garlic powder, ground cumin, and chili powder in a bowl.

Description: 
I was inspired to create this recipe after a major retailer stopped carrying a favorite boxed version of cilantro lime rice mix, leaving a hole in my rotation of meals. My version is budget friendly and has a fresher taste and aroma than the boxed version, and I hope others enjoy it.
