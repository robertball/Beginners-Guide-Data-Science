Ingredients:
1 Tablespoon Caramelized Onions
2 Strips of Bacon (I used double smoked Berkshire bacon)
LOTS of Old Gouda Cheese
2 Slices of Your Favourite Fresh Bread (I used sourdough)
1 Teaspoon of Butter

Directions:
1.) Cut bacon strips in half, horizontally.  Pan fry all four strips of bacon, flipping until cooked through.  Remove from pan and cool on paper towel.
2.) Drain the majority of the bacon fat from the frying pan.  Leave approximately two teaspoons of the bacon fat in the frying pan and set aside.
3.) Butter each slice of bread, on one side only.
4.) On low to medium heat, warm frying pan and bacon grease.
5.) Place one slice of buttered bread in your frying pan, buttered side down.  Arrange ingredients on bread in this order: cheese, bacon, caramelized onions, cheese.  Top with the remaining slice of bread, buttered side up.
6.) Heat sandwich in frying pan until bottom cheese has melted.  Flip sandwich.
7.) Continue heating sandwich until all cheese has melted.  Flip to ensure both slices of bread are a nice golden brown.
8.) ENJOY!
PRO TIP: When using fresh bread, try to make sure you select two slices that are the same size.

This is a personal favourite, and it is easily modified to suit your own personal taste.  Be dangerous, experiment, and when in doubt, add more cheese!

WARNING: This is definitely a cheat day sandwich.  Enjoy!
