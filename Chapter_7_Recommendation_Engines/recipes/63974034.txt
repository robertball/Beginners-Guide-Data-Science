Ingredients:
1 cup almond flour (optional: 2/3 cup almond flour, 1/3 cup pumpkin seed meal)
1/2 Tbsp flaxseed meal
1/8 cup finely chopped walnuts
1/2 tsp salt
1-1/2 tsp olive oil
2 Tbsp water

Directions:
Mix flour, salt, walnuts and flaxsed meal in a bowl until well combined. Add olive oil and water and mix all ingredients thoroughly. Dough/batter should be fairly moist but should hold its own form.
Place a sheet of parchment paper on a cookie sheet and turn out mixture onto it. Place another sheet of parchment paper on top & roll down fairly flat and rectangular until very very thin - like 1/16". Remove top parchment paper and cut sides evenly, removing excess and adding it to corners or one end & re-roll until uniform thickness and a good rectangular shape.
Using a pizza cutter, cut into regular squares about 1" on a side, but don't separate. Bake in a preheated oven at 350ยบ for 15 minutes or until outside edges are browned. Remove and let cool, then break into squares and store.
