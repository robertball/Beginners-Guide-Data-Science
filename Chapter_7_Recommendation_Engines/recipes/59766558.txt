Description: 
This sauce tastes best when slow cooked on low. I don't know the exact measurements for spices -- it's a use your own taste type. I mix up the ingredients the night before, and then before I go to work in the morning I set the slow cooker on low. When I get home it's ready.Modified from: Slow Cooker Spaghetti Sauce II
