Ingredients:
2 heads napa cabbage, finely chopped
1 bunch cilantro, chopped
2 pounds ground pork
2 egg whites
3 jalapeno peppers, minced
1 (2 inch) piece ginger root, peeled and minced
1 tablespoon sesame oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 (16 ounce) packages potsticker wrappers, or more as needed

Directions:
Spread cabbage and cilantro over a clean dish towel. Gather up towel and squeeze out as much moisture from the cabbage as possible.
Transfer cabbage and cilantro to a bowl. Add pork, egg whites, jalapeno peppers, ginger, and sesame oil. Mix thoroughly with your hands. Season with salt and pepper.
Cover 2 baking sheets with waxed paper. Fill a small bowl with water.
Hold a potsticker wrapper in the palm of your hand. Place a tablespoonful of the pork mixture in the center. Dip a finger in water and use it to wet the edges of the wrapper. Fold up edges and pinch together to seal. Transfer dumpling to a prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining wrappers and pork mixture.
Freeze dumplings until firm, about 2 hours. Transfer to large resealable plastic bags.
