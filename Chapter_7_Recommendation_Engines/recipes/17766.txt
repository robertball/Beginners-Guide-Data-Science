Ingredients:
3 pounds lean ground beef
2 pounds Italian sausage, casings removed
1 onion, chopped
4 potatoes - boiled and mashed
salt and pepper to taste
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground cloves
4 (9 inch) 9-inch pastry shell

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the ground beef and sausage for 10 minutes, or until browned. Drain excess fat and transfer to a large bowl.
Combine the meat with the onion and mashed potatoes, mixing well. Season with salt and pepper, cinnamon and cloves to taste. Spoon mixture into two pie shells. Cover each with the other pie shell. Remove foil pan from each top pie shell and, using a knife, poke some holes in each top pie shell to vent steam.
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes, or until pie crusts are golden brown.

Description: 
When I married a Rhode Island guy, this was a must at holiday time, but we Southerners like it so much, we have it anytime! Meat and potatoes cooked in pie shells. This one's easy and fills them up.
