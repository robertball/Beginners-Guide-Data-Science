Ingredients:
3 cups rolled oats
1 tablespoon rolled oats
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon whole wheat flour
3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 cup milled flax seeds
1/2 cup coarsely chopped almonds
1/2 cup golden raisins
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3/4 cup canola oil
2 tablespoons canola oil
3/4 cup water, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix 3 cups plus 1 tablespoon oats, 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon whole wheat flour, brown sugar, flax seeds, almonds, raisins, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder, and nutmeg together in a large bowl.
Stir 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons canola oil into the oat mixture. Add water; stir until dough is firm. Let rest about 5 minutes.
Drop tablespoonfuls of dough about 4 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet. Flatten with a fork to a 3-inch diameter.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden around the edges, 10 to 13 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
