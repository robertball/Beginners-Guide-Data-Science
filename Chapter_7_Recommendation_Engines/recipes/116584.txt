Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) package long grain and wild rice mix
2 1/3 cups vegetable or chicken broth
1 teaspoon rubbed sage
1 teaspoon dried thyme
2 celery ribs, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
1 tablespoon olive or vegetable oil
3/4 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup toasted, coarsely chopped pecans
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
4 medium acorn squash
3/4 cup water

Directions:
In a large saucepan, combine the rice with contents of seasoning mix, broth, sage and thyme. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 23-25 minutes or until rice is tender and liquid is almost absorbed. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, saute celery and onion in oil until tender. Stir in cranberries, pecans and parsley. Remove from the heat. Stir in rice mixture.
Cut squash in half widthwise. Remove and discard seeds and membranes. With a sharp knife, cut a thin slice from the bottom of each half so squash sits flat. Fill squash halves with about 1/2 cup rice mixture. Place in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Pour water into pan.
Coat one side of a large piece of heavy-duty foil with nonstick cooking spray. Cover pan tightly with foil, coated side down. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until squash is tender.

I made this recipe when we invited both families to celebrate our first Thanksgiving in our new home. There were 37 of us, and those who tried this dish raved about it.
