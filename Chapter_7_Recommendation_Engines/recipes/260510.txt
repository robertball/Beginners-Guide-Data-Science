Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 egg, separated
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon white sugar
3/4 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons buttermilk, or more as needed
1 teaspoon butter
1 (4 ounce) bar milk chocolate, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe dish for 10 seconds. Let cool.
Whisk egg yolk into cooled butter with a fork. Sift flour and baking powder into a large bowl; stir in sugar. Whisk in egg-butter mixture and 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons buttermilk until a smooth, thick batter forms. Add more buttermilk, 1 tablespoon at a time, if batter is too thick.
Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a nonstick skillet over high heat. Reduce heat and pour batter onto the hot skillet using a ladle. Cook until bubbles form and edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate. Repeat with remaining batter.
Use a large heart-shaped cookie cutter to cut out hearts. Place a few chocolate pieces on top of 1 warm pancake and sandwich another pancake on top. Repeat with remaining pancakes. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.

I make these heart-shaped pancakes every year for Valentine's Day and for special occasions. You can of course use other cookie cutter shapes as well. This recipe makes either 8 pancakes or 4 stuffed double-layer pancakes.
