3/4 pound chicken cutlets
2 Tbs. butter or margarine

1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Cut chicken into bite-size pieces.
Drain spinach of all water by ringing in a kitchen towel.
Add butter to pot and allow to melt.
Add chicken, only cooking outside.
Add spinach, wine, broth, and milk (I use skim, and it turns out fine.)
Allow ingredients to come to a boil.
Add Pasta and Sauce.
Allow to continue boiling for 10 minutes.
Add grated Parmesan cheese, to taste.
