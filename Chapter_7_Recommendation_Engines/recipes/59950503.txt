Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
1 cup sliced carrots
1 cup frozen green peas
1/2 cup diced potatoes
garlic salt, poultry season to taste
2 c chicken broth
1/3 cup butter
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
2/3 cup milk
2 (9 inch)  unbaked pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
In a saucepan, combine chicken, carrots, peas, potatoes and spices. Add broth to cover and boil for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, drain - RESERVING BROTH and set aside.
In the saucepan over medium heat, cook onions in butter until soft and translucent. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed. Slowly stir in reserved chicken broth and milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick. Remove from heat and set aside.
Bake bottom pie crust 5-6 min.  Place the chicken mixture in bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid mixture over. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
