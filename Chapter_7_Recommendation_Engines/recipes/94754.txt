Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
3/4 cup olive oil, divided
6 cloves garlic, minced
2 (4 ounce) cans sardines packed in olive oil, drained
1 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
additional Parmesan cheese for serving (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti, and cook until al dente, or 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, and rinse under cold water. Toss with 1/4 cup olive oil, cover and keep warm.
Place another 1/4 cup olive oil in a skillet, and heat over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook just until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the sardines, and cook 1 minute more. Stir in the bread crumbs and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. If necessary to give the mixture a crumbly texture, stir in the remaining 1/4 cup of olive oil. Stir in the parsley and pepper, and remove from the heat. If desired, serve with additional Parmesan cheese.
