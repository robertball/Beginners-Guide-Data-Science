Ingredients:
1 cup oil for frying, or as needed
2 cups okra, cut into bite-size pieces
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup diced onion
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 green chile pepper, chopped
1/2 teaspoon ginger paste
1/2 teaspoon garlic paste
1 pinch ground turmeric
1 cup diced fresh tomatoes
2 teaspoons ground coriander
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder
2 cups chopped bell peppers (yellow, green, red)
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro (coriander)
1/2 teaspoon garam masala

Directions:
Heat about 1 inch of oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry okra in the hot oil to reduce the stickiness of the okra yet maintaining the green color, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer fried okra to a paper towel-lined plate.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a separate skillet; cook and stir onion and salt until onion is transparent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add green chile pepper, ginger paste, garlic paste, and turmeric and cook until onion is evenly coated, about 1 minute.
Stir tomatoes into seasoned onion mixture and cook for 2 minutes. Add ground coriander, ground cumin, and cayenne powder; cook and stir until tomatoes are cooked but not completely mashed, about 4 minutes.
Mix bell peppers and cilantro into onion-tomato mixture; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add okra and cook over very low heat for 4 minutes. Sprinkle garam masala over okra.
