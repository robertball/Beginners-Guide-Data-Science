Ingredients:
1 (15.25 ounce) box chocolate cake mix
1 cup plain Greek-style yogurt
1 cup milk
Optional: rainbow sprinkles for garnish

Directions:
1. Whisk together ingredients until completely combined. Refrigerate until ready to serve!
Tip: to make sure that my dip is completely smooth (without any little lumps), I like to sift my cake mix before whisking in the other ingredients.
