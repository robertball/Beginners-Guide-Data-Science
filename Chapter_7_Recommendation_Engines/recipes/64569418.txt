Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil
1 white onion, chopped
1 1/2 tbsp ground cumin
1 tbsp dried oregano
2 tsp salt
1 green bell peppers, chopped
1/2  jalapeno pepper, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (12 oz) package vegetarian burger soy crumbles
1 (28 oz) cans whole peeled tomatoes, crushed
1/4 package taco seasoning powder
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 (15 oz) can pinto beans, drained
1 (15 oz) can garbanzo beans, drained
1 (15 oz) can black beans, drained
150 grams frozen corn
1/3 cup salsa

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, and season with cumin, oregano, and salt. Cook and stir until onion is tender, then mix in the green bell peppers, jalapeno pepper, garlic. Add taco seasoning. When vegetables are heated through, mix in the vegetarian burger crumbles. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer 5 minutes.
Mix the tomatoes into the pot. Season with black pepper. Stir in the pinto beans, garbanzo beans, black beans, and salsa. Add water if pot seems too dry, you want this to be semi-soupy at this point. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 40 minutes. Stir in the corn, and continue cooking 5 minutes before serving. Consistency should be thick but liquid like porridge.
