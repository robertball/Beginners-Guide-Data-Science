Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 large yellow onions, diced
4 large celery ribs, diced - or more to taste
1 (8 ounce) package dry bread stuffing mix with seasoning packet
1 (16 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (7 pound) bone-in turkey breast with pop-up timer
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions and celery in the hot butter until onions are translucent, about 8 minutes; remove from heat.
Place a plastic slow cooker liner into a 6-quart slow cooker. Place dry bread stuffing into the liner bag and sprinkle contents of seasoning packet over the bread. Stir cooked onions and celery, cranberry sauce, 1/2 cup melted butter, chicken broth, and 1/2 teaspoon salt into the dressing mix, taking care not to pierce the bag.
Rinse turkey breast and pat dry with paper towels; season turkey breast with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Push the dressing mixture to the edge of the cooker and lay the turkey breast into the slow cooker with the pop-up timer facing upward.
Cook on High until the pop-up timer in the turkey breast pops, 4 to 4 1/2 hours. Transfer turkey breast to a cutting board and let stand for 10 minutes before serving. Transfer dressing to a serving bowl and serve alongside turkey.

Description: 
My cranky old 1934 oven is very small and slow, so I devised this method of cooking holiday meals. The slow cooker keeps the turkey breast moist, and cooking the dressing in the same cooker gives it a wonderful flavor.
