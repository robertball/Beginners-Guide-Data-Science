Ingredients:
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1 cup butter or margarine
1 cup sugar
3 tablespoons boiling water
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup vanilla baking chips

Directions:
Sprinkle almonds on a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 300 degrees F for 15 minutes or until toasted and golden brown; remove from the oven and set aside. In a saucepan over low heat, cook butter and sugar for 5 minutes. Add water and corn syrup. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until a candy thermometer reads 300 degrees F (hard-crack stage). Quickly pour over almonds. Sprinkle chips on top; let stand for 1-2 minutes or until melted. Spread and swirl chocolate over candy. Cool completely; break into pieces.

My easy recipe is an old favorite that we keep in steady use from mid-November until the New Year. Homemade gifts are still a Christmas tradition at our house.
