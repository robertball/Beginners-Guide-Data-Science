Ingredients:
For the cake:
2 tsp butter
2 tbsp flour
1 box yellow cake mix (about 4 1/2 cups mix)
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
1/4 cup Galliano liqueur
1/4 cup vodka (use a premium, such as Grey Goose or Absolut)
1 - 3.4 oz packet instant vanilla pudding mix
3/4 cup orange juice
For the glaze:
1 cup confectioner's sugar, sifted
1 tbsp orange juice
1 tbsp Galliano liqueur
1 tsp vodka

Directions:
1.  For the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 10-cup bundt pan with butter, dust with flour, shake out the excess flour and set aside. Put cake mix, oil, eggs, Galliano, vodka, pudding mix and orange juice into a large mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well-combined.  Pour batter into prepared pan and bake until cake is golden brown and a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 45-50 minutes.
2.  Let cake cool on a cooling rack for 10 minutes, then invert onto a serving plate.
3.  For the glaze:  Put confectioner's sugar, orange juice, Galliano liqueur and vodka into a small bowl and stir until well-combined.
4.  Drizzle glaze over still-warm cake.  Let cake cool completely, then transfer to a cake plate.

Description: 
This cake has decorated every party table at my grandmother's house for 40 years.  I've tried different liqueurs, including apricot brandy, but Galliano suits the cake the best.
