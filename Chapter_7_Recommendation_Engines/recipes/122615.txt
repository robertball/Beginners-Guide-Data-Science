Description: 
EVERYONE notices a special taste in this cobbler. It's orange peel, which enhances the color and gives this traditional dessert a delicious distinction.    Cobblers usually serve a large group, so it's convenient to have a recipe that makes just enough for two. -Betty Clark, Mt. Vernon, Missouri
