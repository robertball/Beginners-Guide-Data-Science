10 pitted dates, or to taste

Directions:
Blend almonds and coconut in a food processor; add dates and pulse until combined. Add cashews and coconut oil; pulse until mixture is thick and sticks together. Transfer to a sheet of waxed paper; form into a square, folding sides of waxed paper over the top. Refrigerate until solid, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
The on-the-go, travel-light snack bar. Derived from a famous raw food bar and the ultimate in 'foodie!' This is a great snack for the active lifestyle and impressive to hand out to others.  As an outdoor professional I take these in the back country and they need not be refrigerated and give great energy. Cut into bars and enjoy or wrap individually for on the go.
