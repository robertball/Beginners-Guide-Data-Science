Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons honey
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce
1 tablespoon sherry
1 tablespoon red food coloring (optional)
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
1/8 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring (optional)
12 skinless, boneless chicken thighs

Directions:
Whisk brown sugar, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, honey, garlic, sriracha sauce, sherry, food coloring, sesame oil, Chinese five-spice powder, and liquid smoke together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken thighs, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil and place a roasting rack in the bottom of the pan.
Remove chicken from marinade and place on the rack in the prepared roasting pan.
Pour marinade into a saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Bake chicken in the preheated oven, turning once and basting occasionally with marinade, until the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
This dish is so easy to make, but so delicious! Due to the marinating time, you do need to plan ahead to make this, but the wait is worth it. I serve this with a skinny Hawaiian slaw and there are never leftovers. Whether I roast it or grill it, this recipe never fails.
