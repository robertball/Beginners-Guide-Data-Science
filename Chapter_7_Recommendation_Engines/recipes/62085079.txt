Ingredients:
2 pounds pork spare ribs
4 Tablespoons peeled and grated ginger
4 lemons
Salt
1 12 ounce Orion Okinawan Beer or other Asian Beer

Directions:
Score the meaty side of the ribs with a knife. In a bowl, mix 2 tablespoons grated ginger,the juice of two squeezed lemons,salt to taste and set aside. In a large plastic food storage bag , place the juice of two squeezed lemons, 2 tablespoons grated ginger and salt to taste , then add the ribs and marinate for one hour. Every 15 minutes, hand mix the spare ribs to distribute the marinade unto the meat. After one hour,pour the 12 ounce beer into a pot and add the two pounds of ribs, bringing to a boil for two minutes . Lower heat and simmer until the beer is absorbed. Brush the ribs with the remaining ginger, lemon and salt mixture and grill, or bake or broil in an oven until the ribs are brown. Continue basting the ribs frequently with the ginger, lemon and salt mixture until they are cooked. A hibachi makes this recipe more authentic if available but any grill is fine or an oven. Serve with sticky rice or soba noodles with cold Orion or other Asian beer .
