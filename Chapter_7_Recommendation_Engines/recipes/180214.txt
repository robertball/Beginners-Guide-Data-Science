Ingredients:
1 beet, peeled and quartered
2 cups loosely packed beet greens, stems trimmed
2 cups water
2 cups vegetable broth
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, minced
1 cup Arborio rice
8 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
salt and pepper to taste
grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place the beet and greens in a blender or food processor and pulse until finely chopped.
Bring the water and broth to a simmer in a large pot over medium-low heat.
Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir the onion in the oil until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the rice; cook and stir another 2 minutes. Mix in the beet and beet green mixture, cooking another minute. Pour in the broth mixture 1 cup at a time, allowing the liquid to be absorbed before adding each batch, stirring continually; reduce heat to medium and simmer 20 minutes. Stir in the Cheddar cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Continue stirring until creamy and thick, about 3 minutes more. Serve with Parmesan cheese.
