Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/4 cu non-fat plain yogurt
1 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3 cups quick-cooking oats
1 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup carrots, shredded
1/4 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, yogurt, brown sugar, and white sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda; stir into the creamed mixture until just blended. Mix in the quick oats, walnuts, carrots, cranberries, and chocolate chips. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
Carrots are not normally found in cookies, but they act as a great natural sweetner while adding moisture. I also replaced half the chocolate chips with dried cranberries. These cookies are tasty and a good source of fiber.Modified from: Chewy Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies
