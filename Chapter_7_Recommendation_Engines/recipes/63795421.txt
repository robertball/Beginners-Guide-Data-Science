½ tsp sugar
300ml sour cream or yoghurt

1 tsp paprika
½ tsp sugar
25g fresh breadcrumbs
25g unsalted butter

Directions:
1 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Wash and drain the asparagus thoroughly. Simmer for 5 minutes in boiling water and drain. Pat dry with kitchen paper and arrange in a large, greased ovenproof dish.
2 In a small bowl, mix together thoroughly the sour cream or yogurt, flour, egg yolk, salt, paprika and sugar. Pour this evenly over the asparagus. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the top and then dot with small knobs of the butter. Bake in the oven for about 15 minutes or until the top is golden.

Description: 
Sparga siitve is a very tasty dish which can be served with vegetables and salads or with bread or a pilaf. Hungarian asparagus is long, thick and white, but the green British variety will do just as well. You can also use yogurt instead of sour cream.
