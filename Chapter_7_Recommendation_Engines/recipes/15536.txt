Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons ground black pepper

Directions:
In a large skillet combine the Worcestershire sauce and ground black pepper. Add the chicken and simmer over medium heat until the sauce begins to boil. Reduce heat to low and let simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Turn chicken occasionally, spooning sauce over it. The sauce will thicken. Let cool and serve.
