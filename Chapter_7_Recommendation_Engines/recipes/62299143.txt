Ingredients:
* 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour (or white whole wheat flour)
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 tablespoon sweetener (stevia, agave, sugar)
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup coconut oil (solid at room temp)
* 1 cup almond milk

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder, sweetener, and salt; mix well. Cut in coconut oil until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in almond milk just until moistened. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface; knead gently 8 to 10 times. Roll to 3/4-in. thickness; cut with a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees F for 8 to 10 minutes or until lightly browned.
