Ingredients:
1 pound ground chuck
1 pound ground pork
1 egg
1/2 cup pumpernickle breadcrumbs (I grind my own)
1/2 cup finely diced sweet onion
1/3 cup canned petite diced tomatoes with sweet onions, juice reserved.
1/4 cup of reserved liquid from the canned tomatoes
1/4 cup finely diced green bell pepper
1 tbs onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic salt
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
2 dashes Worcestershire sauce
2 dashes soy sauce
6 slices swiss cheese
1 small can sliced mushrooms, drained
1/2 cup bottled chili sauce

Directions:
Combine all but the last three ingredients until just mixed.  (over mixing will make meatloaf tough)
press 1/2 of the meat mixture into a large loaf pan.
Place 3 pieces of cheeese over the top of meat mixture to cover.
Spread out the muchrooms evenly over cheese.
Place remaining 3 slices cheese evenly over top of mushrooms to cover.
Press remaining meatloaf mixture over the top of the cheese and form the top until smooth.
Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 45 minutes.
Take meatloaf out of the oven and top with chili sauce.
Place back into oven and bake an additional 15 minutes or until juices run clear.
Let meatloaf sit for 10 minutes before serving.
