Ingredients:
1 pound flat iron steak cut into 1/4 inch thick strips
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 Chinese Rice wine or sherry
2 tsp corn starch
1/4 Oyster sauce
1/3 cup chicken broth
1 Tbsp sugar
1 Tsp Asian sesame oil
4 scallions, whites finely sliced, greens cut into 1/2 inch segments on the diagonal, reserved separately
3 cloves of garlic minced
1 Tbsp minced fresh ginger
3 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 pound bite-size broccoli florets, from about 1-1/2 pounds broccoli crowns
1/3 cup water

Directions:
Combine the beef with 1 Tbsp of the soy sauce and 1 Tbsp of the rice wine in a bowl and toss to coat. Let marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature or 1 hour in the refrigerator.
Meanwhile, combine the remaining 3 Tbsp. of soy sauce with the corn starch and stir with a fork until the corn starch is dissolved. Add the remaining 3 Tbsp of rice wine, Oyster sauce, chicken broth, sugar, and sesame oil. Stir and set aside.
Combine the scallion whites, garlic and ginger in a bowl and set aside.
When you're ready to cook, heat 1 Tbsp of oil in a large saute pan or wok over high heat until smoking. Add the broccoli and stir fry for 30 seconds, then add the water. Cover the pan with a lid (or tightly with foil) and lower the heat to medium; steam the broccoli until tender-crisp, about 2 minutes, then transfer to a plate.
Add another Tbsp of oil to the pan and heat until smoking. Add the remaining beef and cook without moving until the beef is well seared, about 1-1/2 minutes. Add the scallion white, garlic and ginger mixture and cook, stirring constantly with the beef, for about 30 seconds.
Return the reserved bee and broccoli to the pan, along with the reserved sauce and scallion greens and coo, tossing and stirring constantly until the sauce is lightly thickened, about 45 seconds. Transfer to a serving platter and serve with rice.
