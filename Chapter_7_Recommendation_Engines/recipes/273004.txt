Ingredients:
7 cups plain popped popcorn, unsalted
1 cup mini chocolate candy-coated eggs (such as Cadbury®)
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut
1/2 cup chopped almonds
1 (8 ounce) package white chocolate chips (such as Ghirardelli®)
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/8 teaspoon almond extract (optional)
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.
Place popcorn, chocolate eggs, coconut, and almonds together in a large bowl. Toss to combine.
Pour white chocolate chips into a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until chocolate is melted, stirring every 30 seconds, about 2 minutes. Stir in butter and almond extract until fully melted and incorporated.
Pour melted chocolate mixture over popcorn mixture and toss to thoroughly coat. Sprinkle in salt; stir. Pour mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Adjust salt to taste.
Let popcorn cool and harden before serving.

Description: 
This popcorn is an easy and festive way to enjoy some leftover Easter candy! You can use any kind of candy, nuts, or mix-ins that you like! And make sure to adjust the salt at the end, it really helps to balance out the sweetness! Make sure to store this in a  cool, dry, and airtight container, or the popcorn will become soft. It should be eaten within a few days of being made.
