Ingredients:
5 cups peeled and sliced Granny Smith apples
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/3 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 (12 ounce) package cranberries
1 cup white sugar
1 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Spread apples into a 9x9-inch baking dish. Mix brown sugar, flour, rolled oats, butter, cinnamon, and allspice together in a bowl until crumbly; sprinkle topping over apples.
Bake in the preheated oven until the crumble topping is browned and the apples are soft, 30 to 40 minutes.
Combine cranberries, white sugar, and water in a saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring often, until cranberries pop, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; compote will thicken as it cools. Serve apple crisp topped with warm cranberry compote.

Description: 
I like to make this delicious apple crisp recipe in the fall using fresh Granny apples picked from our local orchard. For a Thanksgiving-like twist, top with a sweet cranberry compote.
