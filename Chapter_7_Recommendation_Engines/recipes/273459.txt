Ingredients:
1 (6 inch) baguette end, sliced horizontally into 2 halves
3 large eggs
1/2 cup grated Cheddar cheese
1 small onion, chopped (optional)
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped (optional)
2 slices chopped cooked bacon, divided, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Scoop out the bread from the center of the baguette pieces, or make a depression by pushing the centers down with your fingers. Place bread boats on the prepared baking sheet.
Whisk eggs in a medium bowl until blended. Add Cheddar cheese, onion, bell pepper, and 1/2 of the bacon; mix to combine. Pour egg mixture into the bread boats.
Bake in the preheated oven until until the egg mixture is fully set, 20 to 25 minutes. Broil for a few minutes if egg is not fully set; watch carefully to make sure edges of the bread don't burn.
Sprinkle with remaining bacon and serve.

Description: 
Easy use of leftover baguette for a quick and unique breakfast egg boat treat. I used a day-old baguette end which was just the right size. If you have more, you can make 4 servings.
