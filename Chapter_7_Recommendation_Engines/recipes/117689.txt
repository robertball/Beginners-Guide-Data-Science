Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon dried minced onion

1 (10.75 ounce) can reduced-fat, reduced-sodium condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted
1/3 cup reduced-fat sour cream
1/2 cup fat-free milk
1/3 cup crushed reduced fat butter-flavored crackers
1 teaspoon butter, melted

Directions:
Place the chicken in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with minced onion, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Top each with a slice of cheese.
In a small bowl, combine the soup, sour cream and milk; pour over chicken. Toss the cracker crumbs and butter; sprinkle over chicken. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until chicken juices run clear and crumbs are golden.
