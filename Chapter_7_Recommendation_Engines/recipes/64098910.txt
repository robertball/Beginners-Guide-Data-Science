Description: 
This should be called Clean Out the Fridge Soup. I created it one day shortly after the holidays when I had a lot of little leftovers. Originally, I used some jalepeno cream cheese, Alouette cheese spread, goat cheese and I was wishing I had a bit of gorgonzola. Mmmm. I also had some half and half and leftover mashed potatoes and cooked chicken breast in the freezer. It was delicious and I'll probably never be able to get it exactly the same, but I think this will be close.
