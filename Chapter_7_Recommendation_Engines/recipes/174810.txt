On tray, place largest piece. Place 1 1/2-inch strip of cake along top edge of jeans; cut off excess. Place triangles along outer edges of legs. Cover; freeze 1 hour or until firm.
Tint frosting with blue food color. Remove cake from freezer; frost sides and top of cake. Use fork or decorating comb to create fabric texture.
To decorate cake, cut fruit snack into 8-inch length and 6-inch length. Place fruit snack on top edge of cake, overlapping in center, for belt. Decorate as desired with candies. Store loosely covered at room temperature.
