Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 eggs
2 tablespoons water
1 cup panko bread crumbs
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup whole green beans
1/2 cup whole asparagus spears
1/2 cup red onion rings
1/2 cup sweet pepper rings
1/2 cup avocado wedges
1/2 cup zucchini slices

Directions:
Mix together flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a shallow dish. Whisk together eggs and water in another shallow dish. Stir together panko and oil in a third shallow dish. Add desired seasoning to either panko and/or flour mixture.
Sprinkle vegetables with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Dip in flour mixture, then in egg mixture, and finally in panko mixture to coat.
Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
Arrange half of the vegetables in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Cook until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with additional salt, if desired. Transfer vegetables to oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining vegetables.

Description: 
Air fryers are taking over kitchens nationwide. They're basically mini convection ovens that 'fry' foods with little to no oil, less fat, and fewer calories. A heating element and fan bathe the food in hot air to produce a crispy finished product. Use 2 to 3 cups of assorted vegetable pieces, cut 1/2-inch thick. Serve with desired dipping sauce.
