Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) container refrigerated extra large biscuit dough
1/2 pound sliced bacon
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 medium onion, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
4 roasted green chile peppers, seeded and chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
6 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Prepare biscuits according to the directions on the package. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, and set aside.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, jalapeno, green chile, salt, and pepper. Fry, stirring, until onions are soft. Whisk together the eggs and milk; pour into the skillet. Stir frequently until eggs are scrambled and cooked through.
Split biscuits in half.  Place some of the scrambled egg mixture on the bottom half, criss-cross two slices of bacon over the eggs, then top with shredded Monterey Jack cheese. Place the other half of the biscuits on the top, and serve.

Description: 
This biscuit breakfast sandwich is made with green chiles, bacon, jalapenos, onions, eggs, and Jack cheese.  Get up and go with some spice! I prefer to roast my own green chiles, but you can use a can of green chile.
