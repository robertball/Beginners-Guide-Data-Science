Ingredients:
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 cup uncooked brown rice
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary (optional)
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, chopped
2 shallots
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained
1/4 cup drained chopped sun-dried tomatoes
2 eggs, slightly beaten
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup pine nuts
1/4 cup fresh basil

Directions:
Bring chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan. Add rice and rosemary. Reduce heat and simmer until rice is tender and broth is absorbed, about 45 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic; stir in onion and shallots. Cook, stirring frequently until softened, about 5 minutes. Add green bell pepper; cook until tender, about 1 minute. Stir chickpeas and tomatoes into the vegetable mixture; cook until heated through, about 1 minute.
Spoon the cooked rice into the vegetable mixture. Pour in eggs and stir until mixture is dry. Season with salt and pepper; remove from heat. Stir in pine nuts and basil.

Description: 
A delicious combination of Mediterranean flavors, this flavorful dish is both quick and healthy. Also, this dish is quite versatile, depending on your preferences. My family likes adding the eggs after adding the rice for a more moist pilaf; otherwise, cook the eggs before adding the rice to attain a drier version. Serve warm.
