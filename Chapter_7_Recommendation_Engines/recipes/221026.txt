Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package frozen cauliflower
4 cloves garlic, peeled
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives or more to taste
3 tablespoons light cream
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan-Reggiano cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover and bring the water to a boil. Place cauliflower and garlic in steamer and steam until soft, 10 to 15 minutes.
Remove garlic cloves and smash with a fork; place smashed garlic with cauliflower into a pot.
Smash butter and chives into cauliflower and garlic with a fork or potato masher until smooth.
Stir light cream into smashed cauliflower mixture.
Sprinkle Parmesan-Reggiano cheese onto cauliflower mixture; season with salt and black pepper.
Cook the cauliflower mixture over low heat to absorb the cream and melt the butter, about 12 minutes.

Description: 
I substituted this dish for mashed potatoes as a low-carb alternative, and my husband said it was 'rockin' good.' Flavors of Parmesan, garlic, and chives brought cauliflower to a new level and we didn't miss the potatoes. This goes well with a nice grilled steak or London broil.
