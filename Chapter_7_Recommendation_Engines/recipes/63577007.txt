Ingredients:
3 c sugar
1 c Karo Light Syrup
1/2 c water
1/2 c apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Stir all ingredients together in a heavy saucepan until mixed well.
Heat over medium high heat until mixture reaches 252 (or soft ball stage) on candy thermometer.
Pour out onto 6 buttered plates to cool.
May add some drops of food coloring now but do not stir it in.  (It will distribute evenly during the pulling process).
Lightly butter hands, then carefully lift and pull until candy has a sheen.
Place finished ropes on wax paper.
Cut in chunks.
Wrap individual pieces in wax paper.

Description: 
This old-fashioned vinegar sugar taffy comes with many tall tales through 4 generations.  One time it was being made without mom at home and the girls drizzled hot taffy everywhere.  They were not supposed to be cooking it unsupervised.  They thought they got it all cleaned up before their mom got home, so she wouldn't suspect a thing.  Somehow she became suspect when she saw a hole had been cut out of the linoleum right in front of the stove where the girls apparently couldn't get it quite 'cleaned up'...
