Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter, divided
2 cups quinoa, rinsed and drained
4 cups chicken broth
1 1/2 cups frozen corn
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 red bell peppers, diced
1 small yellow onion, diced
6 ounces frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 tablespoon water
1/3 cup crumbled reduced-fat feta cheese

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon butter over medium-low heat in a skillet. Add quinoa and toast until lightly browned with a nutty aroma, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
Combine chicken broth and toasted quinoa in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until broth is just absorbed and quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and place in a bowl.
Heat remaining tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add corn and cook and stir constantly until just browned, about 8 minutes. Set aside.
Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil and vanilla extract in another skillet away from heat, then place over medium heat. Add bell peppers and onion. Cook and stir until onions are softened and begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and water. Cook until spinach is wilted, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in charred corn, feta cheese, and remaining tablespoon olive oil.
Add vegetable mixture to quinoa and mix well.
