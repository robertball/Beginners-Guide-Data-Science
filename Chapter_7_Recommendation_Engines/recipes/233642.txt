Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
2/3 cup canola oil
1/4 cup unsulfured molasses
1 egg
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup white sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Mix flour, 1 cup sugar, canola oil, molasses, egg, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, and salt in a bowl. Refrigerate dough for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour 1/4 cup sugar into a bowl.
Roll dough into 1-inch balls and coat each ball in sugar. Flatten each coated ball onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges begin to harden, 7 to 8 minutes. Cool on the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
My Aunt Lisa always made these chewy ginger snaps around the holidays. These are so easy to make and are sure to disappear for whatever crowd you make them for, your family or a get together. Enjoy!
