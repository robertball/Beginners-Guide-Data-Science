Ingredients:
2 pounds small red new potatoes, rinsed, dried and halved
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/4 teaspoons herbes de Provence (mixed dried French herbs) or dried thyme leaves
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup pitted and coarsely chopped Kalamata olives
1/2 small red onion, cut into thin slivers
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 1/2 tablespoons malt vinegar or rice wine vinegar
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 small garlic clove, minced
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Toss potatoes in oil with herbs, a generous sprinkling of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Place potatoes, cut side down, in a single layer on a lipped cookie sheet. Set pan on lowest rack of cold oven; heat oven to 450 degrees. Roast until cut side is golden brown and potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
Transfer potatoes to a large bowl; add olives, onion and parsley.
Whisk vinegar, mayonnaise, garlic, a big pinch of salt and a couple of grinds of pepper in a 1-cup glass measuring cup. Slowly whisk in oil, first in droplets, then in a slow, steady stream. Pour dressing over warm salad; toss to coat. Serve at room temperature for best flavor.

Description: 
The Roasted New Potato Salad With Olives exemplifies an amazingly quick - cooking technique. Instead of roasting the potatoes in a preheated oven, start them in a cold oven and roast them as the oven heats. Cooked this way, they brown nearly twice as fast.
