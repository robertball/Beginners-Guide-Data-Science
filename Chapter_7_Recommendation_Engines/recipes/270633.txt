Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) beef chuck roast
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups beef broth
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 cup crushed tomatoes
10 pepperoncini peppers plus a splash of their juice
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, or more to taste
3 green bell peppers, chopped
1 onion, chopped
12 hoagie rolls, split lengthwise
12 slices provolone cheese, or as needed

Directions:
Season roast liberally with onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper on all sides.
Heat a pan over medium-high heat until scorching hot. Add olive oil. Sear beef until brown on all sides, holding up roast to get all edges, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer roast to the slow cooker. Deglaze the pan by pouring in broth and scraping up browned bits. Add Worcestershire sauce. Pour mixture over the roast in the slow cooker.
Add tomatoes, pepperoncini peppers and their juice, garlic, and Italian seasoning to the slow cooker. Turn roast over a few times to coat. Cover slow cooker and cook on High power for 4 hours.
Add green bell peppers and onion to the slow cooker, tossing to incorporate. Continue cooking on High power 1 more hour.
Shred beef and season with salt and pepper to taste. Let beef and sauce sit in the slow cooker on Warm until ready to serve.
Meanwhile, toast hoagie rolls, if desired. Top rolls with shredded beef and add provolone cheese to each.

Description: 
Slow-cooked Italian beef for sandwiches. Provolone, Swiss, and Cheddar cheese are all delicious with this. My kids had hot Italian sandwiches on hoagies; I prefer mine over veggies like spaghetti squash or zoodles. Really, any veggies would work, as would mashed potatoes, rice, or grits. Don't forget to add the cheese on top if you're not doing sandwiches...it's absolutely heavenly without the bread, as well.
