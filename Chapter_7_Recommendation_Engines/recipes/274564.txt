Ingredients:
1 (8 pound) pork butt, bone-in
2 tablespoons yellow mustard
1/3 cup BBQ rub
wood chips, soaked

Directions:
Cut a few slashes in a crosshatch pattern across the fat cap of the pork butt. Rub mustard on top. Massage BBQ rub into the meat, getting it into the cuts. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat a smoker to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Add wood chips according to manufacturer's instructions.
Place pork butt on rack, with a drip pan underneath to minimize the mess. Smoke until internal temperature of meat reaches 200 to 203 degrees F (93 to 95 degrees C), 10 to 16 hours, depending on size of pork butt and outside temperature.
Remove pork butt from smoker, wrap in foil, and let rest for 1 hour. Remove bone and shred pork.

Description: 
I have been using this method for years and always have perfect results for making pulled pork. This will give you tender, juicy, fall-apart meat. This method works equally as well on smaller or bigger pork butts. The final internal temperature of the meat is what's important. Smoking meat is an all-day affair, but well worth the time investment! I like to use a variety of wood chips, including maple, apple and bourbon barrel. Serve with your favorite sauce.
