Ingredients:
• 1 pound cooked penne pasta
• 1 tablespoon or more olive oil
• 3 cups spinach
• 1 garlic clove, minced (1 teaspoon)
• 1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes
• 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
• 1 teaspoon sea salt
• 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
• 1 tablespoon fresh parsley
• 3/4 cup chicken broth
• 1/2 lemon zest (1 teaspoon)
• 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

Directions:
In a large pot with boiling salted water cook pasta by following directions. Cook 2 minutes less than directions to ensure they are almost al dente as they will continue cooking in the pan. Drain and set aside
In a large Le Creuset Saute Pan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high. Add spinach and cook for about 2 minutes. Add garlic and for 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and shrimp. Cook until shrimp is almost opaque throughout, about 4 minutes. Season with salt, pepper and fresh parsley and toss all ingredients together. Add in chicken broth and let warm through.
Toss cooked penne into the pan and add lemon zest using your Edgeware Zester and lemon juice.
If you need more liquid add in some of the reserved pasta water or more chicken broth.
