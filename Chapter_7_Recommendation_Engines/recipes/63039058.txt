Ingredients:
1 loaf frozen bread dough
Cooking spray
Garlic Powder
Dried Oregano

Directions:
1. Allow the dough to thaw at room temperature in a large, greased mixing bowl
2. When the dough is soft enough to knead, break off pieces and shape into cigar sized sticks
3. Place these 3 inches apart on sprayed cookie sheets. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, and 1 1/4 hours.
4. Preheat oven to 375
5. Holding the can of cooking spray about 8 inches from the sticks, lightly spray the top of each stick, dust with garlic powder, and sprinkle with oregano.
6. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown.
7. Let cool on the cookie sheets on racks for a few minutes before serving.
