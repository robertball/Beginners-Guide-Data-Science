Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
6 oz. chicken breasts (boneless skinless)
1/4 cup reduced sodium chicken broth
1 teaspoon light soy sauce (or Bragg’s Liquid Aminos)
1 1/2 cups broccoli florets
1/2 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

Directions:
Mix chicken broth and soy sauce. (This is also where I have to interject and recommend Bragg’s Liquid Aminos as a soy sauce substitute. It is delicious and healthier!) Set aside the broth mixture.
Steam the broccoli. Set this aside in a bowl.
Use Pam or another non-stick cooking spray and spray down a skillet. Cook the minced garlic.
Combine your chicken and garlic in the skillet and stir it as you cook. Cook for about 3-4 minutes. Make sure the chicken is fully cooked. Add the broth mixture you made earlier and bring it to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium/low depending on your stove. Stir in the mustard until it is well blended.
Throw the broccoli back in! Cook until the whole mixture is heated thoroughly.
Now you’re ready to dig in!
Add chicken to the garlic; cook and stir 3-4 minutes or until cooked thoroughly. Add broth mixture, mix well and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium low. Stir in mustard until well blended. Return broccoli mixture to pan, mix lightly. Cook until heated thoroughly.
