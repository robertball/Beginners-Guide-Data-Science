Description: 
My husband took me to his best friend Elton's house and begged his wife, Vonda, to teach me to make this potato salad.  It has a lot of popular ingredients from other recipes, but this particular blend of flavors is INCREDIBLE!  All of my friends ask me to bring this to their parties now.
