Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds beets - red, yellow, the candy-striped Chioggia, or a mixture
1/4 cup slivered almonds, roasted
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon minced fresh chives
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt or sea salt
2 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
A few whole chives for garnish

Directions:
Place beets in a medium pot and cover with water. Cover, bring to a boil, and cook 15 to 25 minutes, until a beet is easily pierced with a fork. Drain, let cool, and use a paring knife and fingers to slide off skins.
Cut beets into bite-sized pieces and place in a large salad bowl. Add almonds, olive oil, chives, lemon juice and salt, and toss gently. Sprinkle with feta, lay whole chives across salad as garnish, and serve.
