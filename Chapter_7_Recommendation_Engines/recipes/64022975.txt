Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
4 lean boneless pork chops, trimmed
4 cups egg noodles
1 green bell pepper (diced)
For the Sauce:
1/2 cup apple juice
4 tablespoons brown sugar
4 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon crushed red hot pepper flakes
4 teaspoons cornstarch
4 tablespoons water

Directions:
Prepare sauce in small bowl. Combine apple juice, brown sugar, soy sauce, and red hot pepper flakes. -Set aside.
In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chops; cook until browned, about 2 minutes on each side.
Pour the sauce over chops. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Add water if needed, to keep sauce from cooking down too much.
While chops are simmering, cook the egg noodles according to package directions. Drain well and place on serving plates.
Place pork chops over the noodles; cover to keep warm. In a small bowl, combine cornstarch and water, then stir into sauce in skillet. Stir until thickened, 1-2 minutes. Pour sauce over pork chops. Garnish with bell peppers and serve.
