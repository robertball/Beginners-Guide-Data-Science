Ingredients:
16 0z Perdue Ground Chicken
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ginger powder
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon pepper
1/2 cup of chopped cilantro
hamburger buns
1 avocado (optional)
1 teaspoon lime juice (optional)
ranch (optional)

Directions:
1) Place ground chicken a large mixing bowl
2) Add chopped cilantro, garlic powder, ginger powder, soy sauce, pepper, and lime juice (optional) to ground chicken.
3) Mix chicken and seasonings together until mixed well
4) Form chicken into hamburger patties-whatever size you please
5) Cook stovetop with a bit of olive oil in the pan (so they don't stick) until thoroughly cooked through (about 4-5 minutes per side, depending on the thickness).  I would recommend covering pan while cooking and only removing it to check on the patties.
6) Put finished chicken hamburger patties on a hamburger bun, garnish with sliced avocado and a bit of ranch (if you enjoy ranch)
