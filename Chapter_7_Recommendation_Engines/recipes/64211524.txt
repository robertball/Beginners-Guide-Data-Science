Ingredients:
This makes two crusts.
3 3/4 c. bread flour (I used all purpose flour--I'm anxious to try it with bread flour)
2 1/2 Tb. fast-acting yeast
3/4 ts. salt
1 ts. sugar
1 1/3 c. room temperature (about 72 degrees) water
olive oil for the pans

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, yeast, salt, and sugar.  Add the water and, using a wooden spoon or your hand, mix until blended, at least 30 seconds.  The dough might be a bit stiffer than other pizza doughs you've made.  Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature until the dough has doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
Oil two 13x18 baking sheets.  Use a bowl scraper or rubber spatula to scrape half the dough onto an oiled pan in one piece. Starting at one end, gently pull and stretch dough across the surface of the pan, and use your hands to press it evenly out to the edges.  If the dough sticks to your fingers, lightly dust it with flour or coat your hands with oil.  Pinch any holes together. Repeat with the second piece.
