Ingredients:
One pound ground turkey (or any ground meat)
One tablespoon Grill Mates Garlic & Onion medley seasoning
One half tablespoon canola oil
One tablespoon finely chopped ginger root
One half roughly sliced white onion
Two-Three thinly chopped baby bella mushrooms
One tablespoon cilantro
The freshly squeezed juice from one half lime
One tablespoon dried shredded Basil leaves
One Finger Hot Pepper finely sliced
Shredded cheese
One package flour tortillas (taco sized)
Sri Racha sauce

Directions:
Place thawed groud turkey in a large pan at medium heat.  Midway through browning, add the garlic & onion medley and the basil leaves.  Finish browning the turkey.
In a seperate pan, warm up the canola oil at a medium flame.  Add 3/4 of the ginger and the finger hot peppers.  After a minute or two of stirring, add the onion.  After the onions are nicely sauteed add the mushrooms.  After another five to seven minutes of stirring, add the lime juice, the remainder of the ginger, and the cilantro.  After another minute or two of stirring, turn down the heat to low and add the turkey.  Stir until everything is blended nicely.
Warm up the tortillas on a skillet or in a toaster oven 300 degrees for 4-5 minutes or until soft and fluffy.  Place a healthy scooping of the meat mixture on the warm tortilla and add some shredded cheese immediately.  Finally, add as much Sri Racha as you can handle on top.  Than enjoy!!

Description: 
I love tacos and I love Thai food.  If you're like me, than this dish will seem heaven-sent!  The basil, ginger, and lime bring you to Thailand, but the Sri Racha will make you say Sut Yot!
