Ingredients:
8 cups torn Romaine lettuce
2 large sweet red peppers, roasted, peeled and diced
14 oz. can black beans, drained & rinsed
14 oz. can white corn, drained
4 oz. can diced green chiles
1/4 cup finely chopped sweet onion
1 cup diced Roma tomatoes
1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1 large avocado, seeded, peeled, sliced
fresh cilantro, if desired
1 packet Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup fat free plain yogurt
1 packet taco seasoning, divided

Directions:
Line a very large serving bowl with lettuce. In a separate bowl, combine roasted peppers, black beans, corn, onion and green chiles. Spread mixture over the lettuce. Top with tomatoes, then sprinkle with cheese. Fan slices of avocado over top of the cheese, then garnish with fresh cilantro. Serve with dressing on the side.
Dressing:
Whisk together buttermilk, sour cream and dressing mix. Stir in taco seasoning to taste (I use a little more than half the packet).

Description: 
This salad is very pretty when served in a large bowl, and is bursting with lots of fresh flavors. You can spice it up by substituting jalapeno peppers for the chile peppers. The dressing is fabulous for all types of salads.
