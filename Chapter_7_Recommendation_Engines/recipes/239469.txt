Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
2 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (14.4 ounce) package graham crackers, smashed to crumbs
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon hot water
1 (12 ounce) bag chocolate chips
1 cup miniature marshmallows
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the butter mixture completely before adding the second with the vanilla extract; continue beating until you get a smooth batter. Stir graham cracker crumbs and salt into the creamed batter.
Dissolve baking soda in hot water in a small bowl; stir into the batter. Fold chocolate chips and marshmallows through the batter.
Sprinkle flour into the batter while stirring until flour is completely incorporated and you get a cookie dough texture.
Scoop small balls of the dough from the bowl and drop onto prepared baking sheets. Depress each dough ball slightly using the back of a spoon.
Bake in preheated oven until the edges begin to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before moving to cooling racks.

Description: 
Cookies that taste like s'mores! This is the first cookie recipe I've created. I started with my favorite chocolate chip cookies and worked from there to give them a traditional s'mores flavor. My kids gobble them up! Enjoy!
