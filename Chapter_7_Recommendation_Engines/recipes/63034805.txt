Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 lbs butter
1 tsp vanilla
Saltine crackers (the salted type)
12 oz package chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Lay saltines on a 13X9 inch cookie sheet with a lip to completely fill pan.  Break saltines to fit the edges and sit the pan aside for later.
In a sauce pan melt the butter and brown sugar.  Bring to a boil for three minutes. (be very careful not to exceed 3 minutes or it will burn!) Add vanilla while stirring.  Be careful not to get burnt becasue the mixture will spit and spatter when the vanilla is added.
Pour brown sugar mixture over saltines and quickly cover the crackers with a spatula.  Bake at 350 for 7 minutes.  Remove from oven and immediately sprinkle with chocolate chips using a spatula to even out the chocolate.  Put in the freezer fro 2-3 hours.  Remove and break into pieces.  Keep frozen until ready to serve.  They can also be kept in the fridge; but, the freezer is better.  They can melt quite a bit in warm weather, so keep that in mind if you are making them for an outdoor event.
