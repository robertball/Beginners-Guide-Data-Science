Ingredients:
12 - six inch bamboo skewers
12 ounces chicken skin
1/8 tsp sea salt
For the tare sauce:
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup mirin
1/8 cup sake
1/8 cup water
1 packed tsp light brown sugar
1/4 green onion, sliced diagonally

Directions:
Soak the bamboo skewers in water.
Combine the soy sauce, mirin, sake, water, brown sugar, and spring onion slices in a saucepan and bring to a light boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer until the sauce has reduced slightly. About 3-5 minutes. Once reduced, set aside to cool.
Meanwhile, cut the chicken skin into strips approximately 1.5 inches wide. Each strip should weigh about 1 ounce each. Thread lengthwise each strip onto a skewer. The skin should be slightly bunched up, not too taut.
Heat a grill. Once hot, grease the grate. Sprinkle the skewers with salt. Cook the yakitori on the grill until browned and crispy but not where the fat has completely rendered. Flip it over and cook it likewise. Grill all the skewers the same way.
Lightly blot each yakitori on a paper towel before serving. Serve the cooled tare sauce on the side.
