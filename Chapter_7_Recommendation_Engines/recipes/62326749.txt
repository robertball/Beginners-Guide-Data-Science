Ingredients:
- 2 medium leeks , washed thoroughly and cut into 1/2-inch slices (approx. 2 cups)
- 2 tbs butter
- 2 large eggs
- 2 large egg yolks
- 3/4 cup whole milk
- 3/4 cup light cream
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
- pinch of nutmeg
- 4 ounces goat cheese cubed or crumbled (broken into 1/2-inch pieces)
- 1, 9" partially baked pie shell (warm), baked until light golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake pie shell until golden brown (5-10 mins) and set aside.
Saut√© leeks in butter over medium heat until soft, for about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a medium sized bowl whisk together eggs, egg yolks, milk and cream.  Add salt, white pepper, and nutmeg.
Crumble or cube goat cheese. Spread goat cheese and leeks evenly over bottom of warm pie shell and set shell on oven rack.
Whisk egg mixture just before pouring to avoid spices sinking to the bottom.  Pour the egg mixture mixture to 1/2-inch below crust rim.
Bake until lightly golden brown and a knife blade inserted about one inch from the edge comes out clean, and center feels set but soft like gelatin, 32 to 35 minutes.
Transfer quiche to rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Description: 
This rich and delicious quiche is perfect for Sunday brunches.  It has become a staple in our house, as my 2 picky kids devour this.  The leftovers reheat well, though I can't promise you will have any.  This is truly my favorite quiche of all time.  Vegetarian friendly!
