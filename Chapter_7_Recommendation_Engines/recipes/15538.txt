Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
2 cups white sugar
1 cup chopped almonds
2 cups milk chocolate chips
1/2 cup finely chopped almonds

Directions:
In a saucepan over low heat, combine the butter, sugar and 1 cup chopped almonds. Stir constantly until mixture boils, then do not stir or shake.  Heat to 300 to 310 degrees F (149 to 154 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard, brittle threads.
Pour onto a large buttered cookie sheet. Immediately press chocolate chips onto the hot candy. As the chocolate melts, spread it into a coating over the candy.
Sprinkle finely chopped almonds over the top; cool, and break into uneven pieces.
