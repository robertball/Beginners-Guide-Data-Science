Ingredients:
1 pound ricotta cheese (the less moisture the better)
4 eggs
1/2 Cup white sugar
1 tsp. almond extract
1 to 2 TBL. Amaretto
Cookie crust recipe of your choice--enough for a 9 inch springform pan

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375.  Make the cookie crust recipe of your choice. Lightly spray a 9 inch springform pan with non-stock spray.  Line the springform pan with the cookie dough; evenly pressing the cookie dough 2 inches up the sides of the pan.  RESERVE 1/3 cup of the dough.  Set aside.  In a medium bowl beat the eggs with a wisk, add the sugar and almond extract.  Beat well.  Scoop the ricotta into a second bowl and make a well in the center of the ricotta.  Pour in the egg mixture and using a rubber spatula, mix the ingredients until they are smooth.  Carefully pour the batter into the prepared crust.  Break the remaining cookie dough up into small pieces and dot the top of the batter with the dough--do not worry of the dough disappears into the batter.  BAKE at 375 for about 30 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the middle comes out clean.  Remove from the oven and allow the pie to sit for five minutes and then gently brush the Amaretto over the warm pie.  Allow to cool completely before serving.  Keep refrigerated.
