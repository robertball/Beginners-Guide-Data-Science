Ingredients:
12 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
2 quarts milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Place the eggs and sugar into a pan, and whisk until light colored and frothy. Whisk in 2 cups of milk until thoroughly blended. Place the pan over medium heat, continuing to stir until the mixture thickens, and coats the back of a wooden spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, and allow to stand 5 minutes.
Stir in the remaining 6 cups of milk, vanilla extract, and nutmeg. Refrigerate at least 2 hours to cool thoroughly before serving.

Description: 
This is a rich and creamy eggnog that is an alternative to traditional eggnog, because the eggs are cooked. When served chilled and topped with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkling of nutmeg and cinnamon, it is a sure bet that it will be a hit at your next Christmas party.
