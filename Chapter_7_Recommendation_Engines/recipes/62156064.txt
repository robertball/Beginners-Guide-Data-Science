Brush olive oil onto each half. Cut butter into pea-sized pieces and spread evenly over halves. Spread garlic and scallions over halves.
Place in oven until the butter is completely melted and the bread is very lightly toasted.
Add cheese, tomatoes, and crumbled bacon atop the halves and put back in the oven.
Turn the heat up to broil and watch carefully. Remove when tips of the sundried tomatoes begin to darken and the cheese is fully melted.
