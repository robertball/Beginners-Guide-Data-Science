Ingredients:
2 cups chopped walnuts
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 onions, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
2/3 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs
2 teaspoons seafood seasoning, such as Old Bayâ„¢
4 eggs, beaten
4 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In the container of a food processor or blender, combine the walnuts, garlic, onions, celery and parsley. Pulse until finely chopped. Add the bread crumbs, seafood seasoning, eggs and oil; process until smooth. Roll the mixture into 2 inch balls and place on a baking sheet. Flatten them slightly to keep them from rolling off.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a deep brown color.
