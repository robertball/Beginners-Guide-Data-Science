Ingredients:
1 Granny Smith apple, finely chopped
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 celery stalks, finely chopped
1 carrot, finely chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped, or more to taste
3 tablespoons minced ginger
2 tablespoons curry powder
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon garam masala (optional)
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 cups chicken broth
1 cup seeded and chopped tomatoes
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
2 cups fresh spinach
1/4 cup chopped cilantro, or to taste
3 cups cooked jasmine rice
1 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Combine apple, onion, celery stalks, carrot, jalapeno pepper, ginger, curry powder, garlic, garam masala, and red pepper flakes in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and saute until starting to soften, 3 to 5 minutes.
Pour chicken broth and tomatoes into the pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, add chicken breasts, and cover. Cook over medium heat until chicken is no longer pink in the center but still tender, about 15 minutes.
Shred the chicken in the pot. Stir in coconut milk and spinach. Remove soup from heat as soon as spinach begins to wilt, about 1 minute. Garnish with cilantro. Place 1/2 cup cooked rice in each serving bowl and ladle soup on top. Place a wedge of lime for squeezing into the soup on the side of each bowl.

Description: 
The list of ingredients is long, but don't let that intimidate you! It's actually quite easy to make. You can find the more exotic ingredients at Asian markets, natural food markets, or the Asian section of well-stocked grocery stores. This soup tastes best when made 24 hours before eating.
