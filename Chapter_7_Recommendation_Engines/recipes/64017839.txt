Ingredients:
3 cups peanut butter
3 cups brown sugar, firmly packed
1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla
6 eggs, lightly beaten
3 cups old fashioned oats
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the peanut butter, brown sugar, vanilla, and eggs and mix until smooth.
In another bowl, toss the oats with the baking soda and salt.
Mix the dry ingredients into the wet and then stir in the chocolate chips.
Place scoops of the dough (about 2 heaping tablespoons) onto a prepared baking sheet or one covered with a silicone mat or parchment paper. Bake 10 to 13 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies just begin to brown. Cool on a wire rack and keep in an airtight container.

Description: 
They are crisp on the edges, gooey on the inside, and have the perfect combination of sweet and salty flavors.  If you ask me, those things make up the perfect cookie.
