Ingredients:
2 cups Whole Grain Quick Cooking Oats
1 cup Fiber One Original Cereal (crushed)
1 (18.25 ounce) Package Yellow Cake Mix
1 cup Butter (melted)
1 teaspoon Cinnamon
1 cup Jam (your favorite)
1 T. Hot Water

Directions:
1. Preheat Oven to 375 degrees. Grease a 13X9 pan with butter spray.
2. In a large bowl, mix melted Butter, Fiber One Cereal (crushed slightly in a baggie), Oats, Cake Mix & Cinnamon. It should be evenly mixed. Press 1/2 of this mixture into the greased pan.
3. In a separate bowl, mix 1 cup of your favorite flavor jam with 1 T. Hot tap water. Stir until mixed. Microwave on high for 30 seconds to improve spreading consistency.  Spread all of the Jam over the first layer in the pan going all the way to the edges.
4. With your hands, crumble the rest of the mixture over the top of the Jam making sure to cover it as best you can. Gently press down on the crumb mixture to make sure it is set.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until top is slightly browned & middle seems set.
