Ingredients:
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 medium carrots, sliced
2 stalks of celery, sliced
1-28 oz can diced tomatoes
6 cups stock, chicken, beef or vegetable, (your choice)
1/2 lb smoked ham, diced into 1/2" cubes
1-19 oz can kidney beans, drained. (or any other bean of your choice)
3/4 cup small shell pasta (or any other chunky pasta)
1/2 Tbsp dried parsley flakes
Salt and pepper to taste.
Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
In a large pot, heat oil over medium heat and saute onions until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add garlic and saute another minute or two, being careful not to burn it.
Add carrots, celery, canned tomatoes and stock.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for one hour.
Add ham and beans, return to boil, reduce heat again, cover and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir in noodles and cook until done about 15 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper to taste and stir in parsley flakes.
To serve, sprinkle a little bit of parmesan in the bottom of the bowl if desired and ladle in soup.
Soup can be made the day before.  It actually tastes better the day after.  Refrigerate soup just prior to adding the pasta.  The next day bring soup to full boil and add pasta and remaining ingredients.

Description: 
I put this soup together one day when I found myself missing ingredients for a more traditional minestrone.  So I omitted and substituted and ended up with a healthy, hearty and really delicious soup.   Served with a loaf of freshly made bread, it's a meal all it's own.
