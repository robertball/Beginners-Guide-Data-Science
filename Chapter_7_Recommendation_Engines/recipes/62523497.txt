Ingredients:
3 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cut in to 1 inch cubes
2 tablespoons olive oil, or enough to lightly coat sweet potatoes

1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon fresh ground pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
Toss sweet potatoes in oil, honey, rosemary, salt and pepper.
Arrange sweet potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet.  You may want to line it with foil or parchment paper for easier clean up.
Bake 45 minutes at 350 degrees, then turn heat to 450 and bake an additional 15 minutes.
