Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground pork
3/4 pound cooked shrimp, shelled, deveined and coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons minced green onions
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
2 tablespoons chopped water chestnuts
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1 pinch white sugar
1 tablespoon dry sherry
1 teaspoon chili oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
1 (16 ounce) package wonton skins
1 pinch garlic salt
1 egg white

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook the ground pork over medium heat until no longer pink.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the shrimp, ground pork, green onions, ginger, and water chestnuts. Mix in the cornstarch, garlic salt, and sugar. Mix in the dry sherry, chili oil, soy sauce, and sesame oil.
Place about one teaspoon of the mixture in the center of each won ton wrapper. Bring points of the wrapper together (in a triangular shape) and pinch the edges, sealing them closed with egg whites.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to boil. Carefully place won tons into boiling water without crowding. (Work in batches if necessary.) When the wontons float to the surface, add a cup of cold water and allow the water to come to a boil again. Then remove from the boiling water.

Description: 
I recently learned to make homemade won tons from my mother. They can be deep fried as an appetizer, but I prefer them in a rich, homemade chicken broth with baby bok choy or other leafy greens. Extras will freeze well for later enjoyment.
