Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, melted and cooled
1 egg
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough, thawed

Directions:
In a bowl, combine cooled butter, egg, garlic salt and dried parsley. Pull off walnut size pieces of dough. Dip the bread pieces in the butter mixture and place in a lightly greased Bundt cake pan. When all of the bread dough has been placed in the pan, pour the remaining butter mixture over the top of the dough.
Cover pan and put in a warm place until bread pieces have doubled in size. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, until browned. Serve warm.
