Ingredients:
2 ½ cups white Rice flour
½ cup almond meal flour
1 tsp xanthan gum
1 tsp baking powder
1 ¼ tsp baking soda
¾ tsp salt
½ tsp cloves
1 tsp nutmeg
2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 ½ cup sugar
1 egg
1 ½ tsp vanilla
1 ¼ cup pumpkin puree (make your own or Libby’s 100% pure pumpkin canned boasts to be GF right on the label.)
1 cup dark chocolate chips or 2 ½ squares chopped semi-sweet bakers chocolate.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees, grease cookie sheet with butter
Combine dry ingredients, flour, sodas, and spices mix well set aside
Cream butter and sugar together, mix in vanilla, egg and pumpkin puree, when mixed well slowly add in your flour mixture.  Add Chocolate chips.
Dough should be tacky and moist roll into desired sized balls and place on greased pan.  Take a cup with a flat bottom, butter the bottom of the cup (don’t over do it just a little) gently press cup on top of balls.  You don’t want to flatten them just push them down a little.
Bake for 12-20minutes depending on size, cookies should not be doughy in the middle but should be very soft and cake like.
