Ingredients:
2 lg. eggplants, sliced lengthwise 3/4 inch thick
3 T. olive oil, plus more for baking dish
Coarse salt and ground pepper
1 container (15 oz.) part-skim ricotta cheese
3 lg eggs
1 C. grated Parmesan cheese
2 T. chopped fresh oregano (or 2 tsp dried)
1 jar (16 oz.) store-bought marinara sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Arrange eggplant slices in a single layer on two rimmed baking sheets. Brush lightly on both sides with oil; season with salt and pepper. Roast until eggplant is tender and golden, turning halfway through, 25 to 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together ricotta, eggs, 1/2 cup Parmesan, oregano, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Brush an 8-inch square baking dish with oil.
Lay a fourth of eggplant slices in bottom of prepared dish; spread with half of marinara sauce. Top with another fourth of eggplant; spread with half of ricotta. Repeat layers, ending with ricotta; sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan. Bake until bubbling and golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool 10 minutes before serving.
