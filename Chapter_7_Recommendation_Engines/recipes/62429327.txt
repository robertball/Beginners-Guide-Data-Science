Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 cup butter
4 eggs
2 cups flour
1 tsp. vanilla, lemon or almond extract
Pie filling, flavor of your choice (I usually use 2 different kinds and put half the filling on one half of the dough and the other on the other half of the dough). There will be filling left over.
Confectioners sugar

Directions:
Grease  15 1/2 x 11 1/2 jelly roll pan.  Mix sugar and butter until light and fluffy then add eggs and beat well.  Add flour and extract and mix well. Spread in pan and smooth flat.  Mark out 24 squares by lightly marking top of unbaked dough.  Put 1 tsp. pie filling on each square, omit some of the jelly, use more fruit with a little jelly on it.  Bake 350 deg. for 45-50 minutes.  While warm sprinkle with confectioners sugar.  Cut into squares before serving.
