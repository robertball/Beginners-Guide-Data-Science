Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package butter cake mix
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant butterscotch pudding mix
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup butterscotch chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a medium bowl, stir together the cake mix, instant pudding and flour. Add oil and egg, mix until well blended. Stir in the pecans and butterscotch chips. Batter will be somewhat crumbly.
Scoop cookies with a small ice cream scoop or compress 1 tablespoon of dough into a ball. Place 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges are just starting to brown. Allow cookies to cool for 2 minutes before removing from baking sheet to cool on wire racks.
