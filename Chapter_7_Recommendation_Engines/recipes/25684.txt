In a large pot over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp.  Remove and crumble.  Return to pot with onion and celery and cook until onion is translucent.  Stir in clam juice and tomatoes.  Season with thyme and pour in clams.  Simmer 45 minutes, until flavors are well blended.

Description: 
Sometimes I add carrots.  I have also made this recipe up until the tomato addition, omitted the tomatoes and instead added light cream and made New England Clam Chowder adding a little flour to thicken.  Enjoy!
