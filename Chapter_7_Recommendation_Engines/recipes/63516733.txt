2 Tbsp. Flour
1 tsp. Seasoned Salt
1 tsp. Ground Medley Peppercorns (or regular pepper)

In large skillet, warm olive oil. Sprinkle chicken tenders with salt & pepper to taste; cook on each side until cooked through and slightly browned on both sides. Allow chicken to cool slightly; shred with two forks in bowl. In crock pot, add all vegetables and pour sauce over. Add chicken and thyme and stir. In sieve, add celery leaves to soup. Cover and cook on high until vegetables are done and soup is hot, stirring occasionally.
