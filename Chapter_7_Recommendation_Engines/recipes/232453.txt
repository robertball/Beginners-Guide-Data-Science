1 envelope gluten-free taco seasoning mix
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir quinoa and onion in the hot oil until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and jalapeno pepper to quinoa mixture and cook until garlic is fragrant and slightly softened, 1 or 2 more minutes.
Mix undrained can of diced tomatoes with green chiles, taco seasoning mix, and chicken broth into quinoa mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until liquid has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in cilantro.

Description: 
As a healthier alternative to Mexican or Spanish rice, this version uses gluten-free quinoa instead of rice for its additional protein and fiber and great taste. However, it still has all the great flavor and spices of your usual Mexican or Spanish rice dish.
