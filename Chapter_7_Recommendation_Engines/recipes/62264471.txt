Ingredients:
3/4 cup kosher salt
1 gallon cold water
or soak shrimp in vermouth w/ seasoning and salt
1 pound peeled and deveined large shrimp (21 to 30 per pound)
8 ounces package angel hair pasta
2 T butter
1/4 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons minced garlic
1 tsp kosher salt
1/3 cup white wine
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil or cilantro
1 tablespoon lemon zest (1 lemon)

Directions:
Dissolve the kosher salt in 1 gallon of water in a large pot. Add the shrimp, and refrigerate 2 to 4 hours. Drain and pat shrimp dry with paper towels.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the angel hair pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the shrimp, white wine, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until the shrimp is no longer translucent in the center, about 6 minutes. Remove shrimp to avoid over cooking.
Stir in the black pepper, basil or cilantro, and lemon zest.  Turn off heat and add the butter, swirl to thicken sauce.  Add pasta and toss to coat.  Add shrimp and toss.
