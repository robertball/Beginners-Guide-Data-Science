Ingredients:
2 large cans whole tomatoes
1 large can crushed tomatoes
2 cans hunts spaghetti sauce
1 jar prego sauce (trad)
1 small jar tomato sauce
4 carrots peeled cut
2 zucchinis
1 onion
1 gr. pepper
2 lbs cooked hamburg
2 cloves garlic
fresh basil
fresh oregano
black pepper
mushrooms
fresh shredded parm cheese

Directions:
Opinions differ on how long to simmer a sauce like this.  I personally simmer it low and slow - about 3 hours (give or take).  The goal is not to boil it, and to remember that the longer you simmer it the more concentrated the flavor becomes (assuming the lid is off).
