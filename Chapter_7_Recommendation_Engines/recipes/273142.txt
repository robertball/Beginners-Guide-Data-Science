Ingredients:
1 cup old-fashioned oats
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 egg whites
1/2 cup skim milk
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup fresh raspberries
1/4 cup fresh blueberries
1/4 cup fresh blackberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper or foil liners, or grease if not using liners.
Combine oats, all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, applesauce, egg whites, milk, brown sugar, oil, and vanilla in a large bowl. Mix until blended. Fold in raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries. Divide batter evenly into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 15 to 17 minutes.
Let muffins cool for 5 minutes in the pan before transferring to a cooling rack.
