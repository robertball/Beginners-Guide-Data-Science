Ingredients:
2 bananas, peeled and sliced
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 (8 ounce) can refrigerated crescent rolls
1 cup caramel topping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a small bowl, combine bananas, vanilla and melted butter, until bananas are well coated.  On a cookie sheet, unroll two crescent rolls, leaving the two triangles attached to form a square.  Place 1/4 of banana mixture in the center of each pair of rolls.
Bake for 11 to 13 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown.  Heat caramel topping and drizzle over dessert.  Serve warm.
