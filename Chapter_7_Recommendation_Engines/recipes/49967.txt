Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) boneless round steak
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
8 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto
2 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (32 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
1 (16 ounce) package uncooked spaghetti

Directions:
Pound meat as thin as possible, hopefully 1/4 inch thick. Drizzle or brush with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then sprinkle with a thin layer of bread crumbs. Layer the prosciutto over the crumbs, and sprinkle with remaining bread crumbs, and chopped hard-cooked eggs. Roll the meat up into a tight spiral, and secure with kitchen twine.
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saucepan, or stock pot over medium-high heat. Sear the outside of the roast on all sides. Pour spaghetti sauce over the roast, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
Remove meat from the sauce to a serving platter, and let stand for 15 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti, and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain.
Carve the meat into slices about 1/2 inch thick. Serve with spaghetti and sauce.
