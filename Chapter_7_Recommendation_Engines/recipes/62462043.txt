Ingredients:
- 1/4 cup of butter
- 1/2 all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp of salt
- 1/2 tsp of nutmeg
- 1 1/2 cups of whole milk
- 1/2 cup chopped cooked ham
- 1/4 shredded cheddar cheese
- Breadcrumbs
- 1 egg
Olive oil for frying

Directions:
Melt the butter in a pot, add the flour and stir with a wisk. Cook for a couple of minutes so that you get rid of the taste of "raw" flour. Then gradually add the milk stirring constantly. Cook it until it starts boiling and then remove from heat. Add the salt, nutmeg, chopped ham and the schredded cheese. The result should be a thicker than usual bechamel sauce.
Pour sauce onto a recipient to let it cool. I usually do them the day before so that the next day the sauce is cold and easier to form the croquettes.
Beat 1 egg and prepare the breadcrumbs on another plate.
To form the croquettes some people just use two spoons, I find that hard so I use my hands to shape them. You take a small amount, roll it in between your hands so that it takes the desired form, then dip it the egg mixture, and finally roll it in breadcrumbs. Now they are ready to be fried. Serve hot.
