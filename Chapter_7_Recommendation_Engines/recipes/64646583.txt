1 cup small organic carrots, chopped
1 pint cherry tomatoes
1 tsp Italian seasoning

In a small bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar, honey, salt and pepper.
Place 1/3 cup of the balsamic mixture in a large bag or glass bowl and add the chicken tenders.
Coat and place in the fridge to marinate for at least 15 minutes or up to 4 hours.
Place all the veggies on your prepared tray.
Add oil, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper and mix to get them all coated and seasoned.
