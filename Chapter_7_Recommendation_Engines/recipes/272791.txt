Ingredients:
Shrimp:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 egg
1 teaspoon water
1 cup coconut milk
1 cup coconut flakes
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails left intact
1 cup vegetable oil for frying
Sauce:
1/2 cup orange marmalade
1 teaspoon horseradish

Directions:
Place flour, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Whisk egg and water together in a separate bowl. Pour coconut milk in a third bowl. Place coconut flakes in a fourth bowl.
Hold a shrimp by the tail and coat in flour well, making sure to leave tail clean. Dip in egg coating; return to flour and cover again. Dip in coconut milk; roll in coconut flakes. Place on a sheet of wax paper or a plate. Repeat with remaining shrimp.
Heat vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat until a drop of water crackles when dripped into in the pan. Place shrimp in skillet in batches if needed, with small space between each. Fry until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate covered with napkins to drain excess oil.
Combine orange marmalade and horseradish together in a bowl for sauce. Adjust ratio to taste. Serve as a dip with the shrimp.
