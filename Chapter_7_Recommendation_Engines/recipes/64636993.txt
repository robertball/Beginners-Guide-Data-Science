Ingredients:
1 large cucumber, peeled and thinly sliced
1/2 large sweet onion, thinly sliced
1 1/2 cups apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup water (or more if desired)
1 tsp salt
a couple turns of black peppe

Directions:
Place your cucumbers and onions in a tupperware or large jar and fill with the vinegar, water, salt and pepper. Stir to combine. Keep covered in the refrigerator for up to one week.
Notes
My grandmother adds a little sugar to the mixture to sweeten it just a bit, but that's optional!
You can increase the recipe, but keep the liquid ratio 3 parts vinegar : 1 part water.

Description: 
Quickles are yet another family recipe made by my sweet Aunt Nancy.

Ok, she doesn’t call them quickles. I made that up… quick + pickles = quickles! She refers to them as Vinegar Cucumbers and Onions. This recipe is so simple and easy to make, low in calories, and super addictive. She claims these as her “summer snacking staple.”
