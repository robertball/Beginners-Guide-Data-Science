FIRE SPICE: Combine 3 parts cumin, 2 parts cayenne, 2 parts Old Bay, 1 part black pepper and a little salt.  Set aside.
Saute the scallops in a small pan until they are cooked through and the outsides of the scallops begin to brown.  Set aside.
Break uncooked pasta in half and boil until al dente.  While pasta is boiling, saute tomatoes, zucchini, mushrooms, carrots and olives (if using) together in olive oil in a skillet over med-low heat.
Drain pasta. Add drained pasta, scallops, garlic, rosemary, parsley and thyme to sauteeing vegetables.  Mix together thoroughly, spreading all ingredients evenly throughout the pasta.
Squeeze lemon halves over pasta mix and zest with fire spice, to taste.  Cook everything for 8-10 minutes until the pasta begins to harden, stirring frequently and thoroughly.
Garnish served pasta w/ fire spice for added kick.
