Ingredients:
1/2 cup flour blend (1/3 white flour, 1/3 whole wheat flour and 1/3 unsweetened wheat germ)
1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
2 large eggs
1/4 c. brown sugar
1/4 c. canola oil
1/2 c. White Puree
1/2 c. fresh or frozen corn kernals, pureed
Optional toppings: chocolate chips or grated cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line a muffin tin with paper liners.
In a mixing bowl, whisk together the Flour Blend, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
In another large bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar until well combined, then whisk in oil, White Puree and pureed corn.
Fold the wet ingredients into the dry and mix until flour is just moistened (don't overmix or the muffins will be too dense).
Scoop the batter into muffin tins, filling just over the top.  Sprinkle with chocolate chips or shredded cheese and bake for 22-24 minutes until tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
