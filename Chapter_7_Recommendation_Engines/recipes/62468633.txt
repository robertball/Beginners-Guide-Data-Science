Description: 
Choose whatever 3 kinds of beans you like.  
I allow my daughter to choose the beans and she chooses something different every time.  
She enjoys helping me by opening the cans/packets and dumping them in the slow cooker.
When serving the soup, top with regular sized corn chips, and/or grated cheddar cheese.
