Ingredients:
1 litre buttermilk
1/3 cup rice
1/4 cup raisins, soaked in boiling water to soften, drained
1/3 cup sugar

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in large saucepan.
Bring just to a boil.
Lower heat, cover and simmer until rice is tender, being careful that it doesn't scorch.
I remember it being served warm, but am sure it would be good chilled as well.

Description: 
We always looked forward to Oma's visit and made sure to have the ingredients on hand for this soup, which is hard to categorize, as it's almost a dessert for us, but could be an appie. I'm just glad the recipe was written down! It's an acquired taste for those who didn't grow up with it.
