Ingredients:
1 (1 1/2 pound) pork tenderloin, cut crosswise into 1-inch slices
2 tablespoons olive oil
Salt and ground black pepper
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup chicken broth
3 plum tomatoes, seeded and cut into small dice
1/4 cup chopped green olives
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary

Directions:
Heat a large nonstick skillet over low heat while coating pork slices with oil and seasoning with salt and pepper.
Increase heat under skillet to high and turn on exhaust fan. When skillet is hot, add medallions and sear, until crusty brown, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Meanwhile mix wine, broth, tomatoes, olives, garlic and rosemary in a small bowl.
Transfer medallions to 4 dinner plates and let rest. Add sauce to empty skillet and simmer to blend flavors and reduce slightly, about 2 to 3 minutes. Pour over pork and serve.
