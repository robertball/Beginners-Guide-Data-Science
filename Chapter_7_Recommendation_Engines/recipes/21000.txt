Ingredients:
3 cups white sugar
1/4 cup corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup water
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
Generously coat a 9x13 dish with cooking spray.
In a large saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup, salt and water.  Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.  Remove from heat and beat with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form, 10 to 12 minutes.  Stir in vanilla.  Pour into prepared pan.
Chill in refrigerator 8 hours or overnight.  To cut, loosen edges with a knife.  Dust surface with confectioners' sugar, and turn out onto a waxed paper lined surface.  Dust with confectioners' sugar again and cut with a knife.
