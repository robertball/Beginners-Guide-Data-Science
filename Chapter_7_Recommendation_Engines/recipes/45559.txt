Ingredients:
1/2 cup white wine
1 teaspoon white pepper
2 teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
4 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
5 pounds boneless pork chops
2 tablespoons barbeque sauce
2 medium onions, finely chopped
1 medium green bell pepper, finely chopped
1 medium red bell pepper, finely chopped
1 medium yellow bell pepper, finely chopped

Directions:
In a bowl, mix the wine, white pepper, liquid smoke, garlic, black pepper, pepper sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Place pork in a slow cooker, and cover with the sauce mixture. Cover, and cook 4 to 5 hours on Low, or until the meat shreds easily.
Shred the pork with a fork. Mix in the barbeque sauce, onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper. Continue cooking 30 minutes, or until vegetables are tender.
Place pork in a strainer to remove excess liquid, pushing down with a large spoon to extract as much moisture as possible. Liquid may be reserved as a dipping sauce.

Description: 
The BEST pork barbeque recipe available. It is a modified version of a long time secret pork barbeque recipe of a now out of business barbeque restaurant in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It can be made the day that it is to be served, but the best is to cook it the day before, place it in the refrigerator overnight, and then heat it in the slow cooker the next day to serve. This way, it soaks up all of the added flavoring.
