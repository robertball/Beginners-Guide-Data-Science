Ingredients:
2 cups vanilla-flavored almond milk
1 cup instant espresso-style coffee (about 1/2 cup for each serving)
Pinch cocoa (optional)

Directions:
Warm milk in a saucepan or in the microwave.  Insert whip or blender into warmed almond milk, turn on the motor and whip until milk becomes a dense foam.  (If using a handheld blender, the results wont be as frothy.)  Prepare espresso-style coffee according to package instructions, filling each mug halfway.  Divide foamed milk among the mugs and into the coffee. Dust each mug with a pinch of cocoa, if desired.
