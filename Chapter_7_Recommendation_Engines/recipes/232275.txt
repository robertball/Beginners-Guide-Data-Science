Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup shredded unpeeled zucchini
1 cup shredded carrots
1 large apple, cored and shredded
1 cup nonfat plain yogurt
1 cup sucralose and brown sugar blend (such as SplendaÂ® brown sugar blend)
2 eggs
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup skim milk
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 lemon, zest only
1 orange, zest only
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 24 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Stir zucchini, carrots, and apple together in a large bowl. Mix in yogurt, sucralose and brown sugar blend, eggs, applesauce, skim milk, canola oil, lemon zest, and orange zest until thoroughly combined.
Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice in a separate bowl. Gently stir dry ingredients into wet ingredients until just combined. Fold walnuts into batter. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
I'm learning to eat a more healthy diet. I couldn't find a recipe for all the ingredients that I wanted in my muffins, so I made up my own. They're yummy and they have so many healthy ingredients! This recipe makes 24 muffins or 12 mini-loaves.
