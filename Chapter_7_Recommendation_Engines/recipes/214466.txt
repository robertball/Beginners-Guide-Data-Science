Ingredients:
2 pounds lean beef, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
3 tablespoons rice flour
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon rice flour
1/4 cup chili powder, or more to taste
5 cups beef broth
1 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Combine the beef cubes and 3 tablespoons rice flour in a bowl; toss to coat evenly.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the beef to the hot oil, reduce heat to low, and cook and stir until the beef is completely browned and tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir the garlic and 1 tablespoon rice flour into the beef and cook another 2 minutes. Add the chili powder and stir. Pour the beef broth over the beef mixture;  mix well. Season with the sea salt. Raise the heat to medium; bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the mixture to simmer until the beef is cooked through and the sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes.
