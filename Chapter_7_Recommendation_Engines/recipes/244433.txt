Ingredients:
1 quart half-and-half
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant pudding mix, any flavor

Directions:
Place the bowl of an ice cream maker in the freezer until completely chilled, at least 1 hour.
Chill half-and-half in the freezer, shaking every 10 minutes, until chilled but not frozen, about 30 minutes.
Pour chilled half-and-half and pudding mix into a bowl and mix well with a whisk.
Place frozen bowl of ice cream maker into the ice cream maker; add the stirring component and lid. Turn on the machine so the bowl is rotating. Pour pudding mixture into the machine through the hole in the lid.
Allow ice cream to process in the ice cream maker until desired consistency is reached, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Using only two ingredients, this ice cream recipe consistently produces thick, creamy ice cream. It can be made fat-free or sugar free in any flavor available in a pudding mix. This recipe is ideal for busy cooks, children, elderly people, diabetics, or dieters who cannot find sugar-free ice cream they like, or anyone who wants to impress guests with little effort. This recipe has been tested in a Cuisinart®® 2-quart electric ice cream maker, the kind where you freeze the bowl overnight and do not need ice or salt. This ice cream tastes like very good commercial ice cream.
