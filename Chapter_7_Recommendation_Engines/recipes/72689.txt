Description: 
I came up with this fresh-tasting, spicy recipe one night as we fired up steaks smothered in a smoky hickory BBQ sauce on our new grill. The combination was a hit and this has definitely become a new favorite. We like our food spicy, so adjust the amount of chipotle and onion to suit your taste.
