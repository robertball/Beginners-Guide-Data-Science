Ingredients:
1/4 cup dried rosemary
1/4 cup ground thyme
2 tablespoons rubbed sage
4 bay leaves
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 gallon boiling water
1 pound kosher salt
1 gallon cold apple juice

Directions:
Place rosemary, thyme, sage, bay leaves, and black pepper into a cloth spice bag.
Combine water and salt in a stock pot; stir until salt dissolves. Bring to a boil, place spice bag into water, and simmer until flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature, at least 1 hour.
Pour cold apple juice into cold spice mixture and stir until combined.

Description: 
An apple brine not only adds flavor to the meat, it adds moisture through osmosis. This moisture will prevent the meat from drying out while slow-roasting for many hours.
