Ingredients:
ngredients
4 teaspoons best-quality olive oil
1 cup diced onions
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon coriander
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
2 15-ounce cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
4 teaspoons lemon juice, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon salt
Pepper to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro or parsley

Directions:
1. Heat a sauté pan large enough to easily hold the beans over medium heat. When hot, add the oil to heat, then add the onion and sauté until deeply colored, about 6 to 8 minutes, stirring periodically.
2. Add the turmeric, cumin, coriander and cayenne pepper (if using) and continue to sauté until the spices are aromatic and a bit toasted, about 3 minutes.
3. Add the chickpeas, lemon juice, salt and pepper and cook for another 5 minutes to blend the flavors.
4. Remove from heat and cool. Store in the refrigerator, or mix in the fresh cilantro or parsley and serve immediately.
