Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Grease a 9x5" loaf pan with butter or lightly mist with olive oil spray.
Combine the oats and milk in a medium mixing bowl, stir to mix.  Let stand for 3 minutes to allow the oats to soften.
Stir in the wing sauce.
Add the turkey, celery, carrots, onion, & egg whites.  Mix with clean hands or utensil until well mixed.
Gently mix in the blue cheese crumbles.
Transfer the mixture into the prepared baking loaf pan & spread to an even flat top.
Bake for about 35 to 40 minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked through & is no longer pink (internal temperature of 165 degrees).
Within the last 15 minutes of cooking time, brush an additional little bit of buffalo sauce for a little kick!  Enjoy!!!
