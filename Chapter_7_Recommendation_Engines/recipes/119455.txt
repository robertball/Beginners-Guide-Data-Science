Ingredients:
10 cups bread cubes
2 cups diced cooked chicken
1 cup diced potatoes
1 cup diced celery
1/2 cup diced carrots
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley
4 cups milk
2 cups chicken broth
5 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup butter, melted and cooled
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 (12 ounce) jar chicken gravy (optional)

Directions:
Arrange bread cubes in a single layer on several ungreased large baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-30 minutes until golden brown and crisp.
Transfer to a large bowl. Add the chicken, potatoes, celery, carrots and parsley. In another large bowl, combine the milk, broth, eggs, butter, salt and pepper. Pour over bread mixture; toss to coat.
Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes; stir. Bake 45 minutes longer or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Serve with gravy if desired.

My great-grandparents made this traditional Amish recipe on Sundays when they had company, and it's still one of my family's favorite dishes.
