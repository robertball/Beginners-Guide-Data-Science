Ingredients:
1/2 cup quick-cooking oats
2 tablespoons coconut sugar
1 tablespoon almond butter
3/4 cup hot water

Directions:
Combine oats, coconut sugar, and almond butter in a small jar with a tight-fitting lid (such as a Ball(R) mason jar); cover with lid and store in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.
Mix hot water into oat mixture, return lid to jar, and allow to sit, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir well and eat.

Description: 
Mornings are not my thing, so if I want anything beyond a cup of coffee before heading out the door, I have to prep it the night before. My overly-expensive love of the oatmeal at StarbucksÂ® led me to start making this tasty Mason Jar Oatmeal.
