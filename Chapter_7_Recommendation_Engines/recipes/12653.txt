Ingredients:
3 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups shortening
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar
5 tablespoons ice water

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. With a pastry blender, cut in the shortening until pea-sized.
Beat together egg, vinegar and water.  Mix  liquid with flour mixture, using a fork, until mixture forms a ball (Note: add liquid one tablespoon at a time.  You probably will not use all of it.)
Roll out on lightly floured pastry cloth with cloth covered roller.
Brush the crust with milk and sprinkle with sugar before baking.

Description: 
This crust was used by  Elsie Hack to win the 1978 Ohio State Fair pie baking contest. (It was wrapped around an apple pie.) Because the crust is very flaky when baked, it is a bit difficult to roll and handle,  but well worth the effort.
