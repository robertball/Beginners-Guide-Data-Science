salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 onion, sliced

Season steaks with salt and pepper and place in a slow cooker; add onion, 1/2 cup water, bouillon, and dill.
Cook on Low until steaks are tender, about 6 hours. Remove steaks from broth and place on a serving platter.

Description: 
This is a variation of beef stroganoff. The dill gives it a wonderful flavor. The meat melts in your mouth, and it's so easy to make; serve over mashed potatoes or noodles.
