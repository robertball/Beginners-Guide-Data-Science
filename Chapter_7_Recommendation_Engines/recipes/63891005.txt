Ingredients:
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/3 cup chopped onion
4 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 cups dry wheat bread cubes, about 8 slices
2 medium apples, peeled, cored, and finely chopped
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 teaspoon ground sage
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine chicken broth, celery, onion, butter and salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
In a large mixing bowl, combine bread cubes, chopped apples, chopped pecans, sage, cinnamon and pepper. Pour broth and vegetable mixture over the bread cubes. Gently stir to moisten. Spoon into a greased 11/2-quart casserole. Bake, covered, at 350 F for 25 to 30 minutes. May also use as a stuffing for an 8- to 10-pound turkey.
