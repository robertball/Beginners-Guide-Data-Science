Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped hazelnuts
1/2 cup canola oil
2/3 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
3 tablespoons white granulated sugar
2 eggs
3 tablespoons sugar free hazelnut syrup
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 cup nonfat dry milk
2 tablespoons Mini Chocolate Chips, melted (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Spray a cookie sheet or jellyroll pan with baking spray and set aside.
Spread hazelnuts in a shallow pan and toast in preheated 350 degrees F oven for 7-10 minutes.  Remove hazelnuts from the oven and cool.
Mix the oil, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and sugar together in a large mixing bowl. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.  Add hazelnut syrup and mix well.  Set aside.
Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and nonfat dry milk in a medium mixing bowl.
Pour the flour mixture into the oil and egg mixture and stir until blended.  Add hazelnuts and mix until just blended.  Refrigerate dough 1 hour or until stiff.
Divide dough in half.  Roll each half into a log approximately 3 1/2 inches wide by 12 inches long.   Place the logs on the prepared sheet 2 inches apart.
Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven for 20-25 minutes.
Remove from oven and cool for 5 minutes.  Cut the loaves with a sharp knife into 48 slices, approximately 1/2 inch wide.  Cool completely.
If desired, lay slices on their sides and drizzle with melted chocolate chips.
Store in airtight containers.  Cookies will stay fresh up to 5 days.
