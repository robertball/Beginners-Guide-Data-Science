Ingredients:
1 large zucchini cut into sticks
1 eggplant cut into sticks or discs (SKIN ON - helps to keep its shape.)
2 cups panko bread crumbs
2 large beaten eggs
1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons tapioca starch
Vegetable oil, for frying
Dash of Malt Vinegar
1/2 cup finely shredded Parmesean and/or Asiago Cheese
1 cup of GOOD Ranch Dressing
1 lemon cut into wedges

Directions:
Pour panko into a food processor and pulse until it becomes a fine powder. (Add a dash of garlic and/or cheese if you like.)
Put 1/2 cup of the tapioca starch, the beaten eggs and the panko crumbs in 3 bowls.
Stir the remaining 3 tablespoons of tapioca starch into the panko crumbs. Dust each veggie piece in the tapioca.
Dip into the eggs, and then into the bread crumbs. Assemble on a cookie sheet.
In a saucepan, heat 1 1/2 inches of oil to 350Â°.
Fry the veggies in batches until golden and cooked through, about 4 minutes, turning occasionally. Drain on paper towels.
Drizzle with malt vinegar, sprinkle with cheese and then salt to taste. Serve with lemon wedges and ranch dressing.
YUM!
