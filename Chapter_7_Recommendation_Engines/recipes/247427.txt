Ingredients:
1 bunch enoki mushrooms, cut from stalk and separated
2 tablespoons garlic salt
2 tablespoons safflower oil
1/2 large shallot, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound extra-lean ground turkey breast
2 yellow bell peppers, finely chopped
12 eggs
2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Toss enoki mushrooms with garlic salt on a large plate.
Heat oil in a large skillet or wok. Add enoki mushrooms; cook and stir until firm and lightly browned on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Return to the plate. Add shallot and garlic to the skillet; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add to mushrooms.
Stir turkey into the skillet. Cook, stirring to break up clumps, until browned, about 5 minutes.
Combine turkey with mushroom mixture; chop finely. Stir in yellow bell peppers.
Beat eggs, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Stir in turkey mixture and pour into two 1/3-cup muffin tins.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
I often eat these for lunch or breakfast on my current diet. They have a great flavor while remaining healthy, and are very easy to make! 

Is it as good as a buttermilk crust quiche? No. But it sure takes care of the hunger pangs!

 I personally dip mine in sriracha sauce but I have had friends who sprinkle some TabascoÂ® on theirs.
