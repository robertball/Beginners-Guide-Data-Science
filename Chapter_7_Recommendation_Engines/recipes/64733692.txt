Ingredients:
Crust:
1 ½ cups almond flour
3 tablespoons coconut flour
¼ cup salted butter, melted
1 tablespoon honey
Candied blood orange slices:
1 blood orange
1 tablespoon honey
Filling:
2 tablespoons salted butter, melted
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon vanilla bean powder (or vanilla extract)
½ cup sweetened condensed milk (I use coconut)
3 eggs
zest and juice of 1 blood orange

Directions:
For crust:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Combine almond flour, coconut flour, butter, and honey.
Using fingers, press crust ingredients into a tart pan.
Bake at 325 degrees for 12 minutes.
Slice remaining oranges thinly with peel on.
Place in a small saucepan with 1 tablespoon honey and 1 tablespoon water.
Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat; simmer 10-20 minutes or just until juices thicken.
Using tongs, set on wax paper to cool.
Meanwhile, for filling:
Using an electric mixer, beat together filling ingredients and pour over warm crust.
Raise heat to 350 degrees and bake for 15 minutes.
Carefully top with candied orange slices, slightly overlapping each other, and return to oven.
Bake 15-20 minutes or until filling is just set.
Allow to cool slightly before serving.
