Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons Panang-style red curry paste
1 pound beef top sirloin, thinly sliced
3/4 cup coconut milk, or as needed
1 medium onion, sliced
1 green bell pepper, sliced
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 tablespoon peanut butter
1 tablespoon coconut sugar
1/2 tablespoon fish sauce
1/3 cup finely chopped Thai basil

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Add oil and curry paste to the hot pot; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add sirloin strips and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in coconut milk. Cancel Saute mode. Close and lock the lid.
Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, for 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes.
Unlock and remove the lid. Select Saute function. Mix in onion, bell peppers, peanut butter, coconut sugar, and fish sauce. Simmer until flavors are well combined, about 5 minutes. Taste and add more coconut milk if curry is too spicy. Sprinkle with Thai basil before serving.
