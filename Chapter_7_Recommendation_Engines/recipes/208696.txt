Ingredients:
Ceviche:
32 small shrimp, cooked and peeled
1/4 cup lemon juice, freshly squeezed
1/4 cup pink grapefruit juice, freshly squeezed
Sea salt
3 tablespoons red onion, minced
1 tablespoon red bell pepper, finely chopped
1 tablespoon green bell pepper, finely chopped
1 tablespoon yellow bell pepper, finely chopped
1 tablespoon cilantro, chopped
1 tablespoon jalapeno pepper, seeded and finely chopped
1 tablespoon oil
Chilean Hass Avocado Soup:
2 medium to large Chilean Hass avocados
1 1/2 cups chicken broth, good-quality, chilled and defatted
1 1/2 cups cold milk
1 tablespoon lemon juice, freshly squeezed
1/2 teaspoon salt
Pinch of merken (see note) or cayenne pepper

Directions:
In a non-reactive bowl, marinate the shrimp for 30 minutes in the lemon and grapefruit juice.  Season to taste with sea salt. Add the remaining ingredients, mix to combine and refrigerate until ready to serve.
Cut avocados in half, remove pit, and peel. Put into blender. Add broth and puree until smooth. Blend in enough milk to make a thick but pourable soup. Add the lemon juice, salt and Merken to taste. Pour about one half cup soup into each of 8 small cocktail glasses. Top each with 4 shrimp and some of the vegetable mixture. Serve at once.
