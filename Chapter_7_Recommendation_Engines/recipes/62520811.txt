Ingredients:
4 turkey breast cutlets
1/4 C flour
1 Tbsp olive oil
1/2 C baby spinach
1/4 C diced onion
1/2 C presliced baby portabella mushrooms
1 clove minced garlic
2 tsp fresh rosemary
1 tsp lemon juice (optional)
1 Tbsp olive oil
4 tsp tapenade
1 tomato sliced thinly
4 Tbsp crumbled feta
4 Tbsp shredded mozzarella
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Dredge the turkey in the flour and sprinkle with salt and pepper. You only need a light flour coating. Brown the turkey in 1 Tbsp of olive oil on medium heat about 5 minutes on each side, they should have a light golden color.
While the turkey is browning, sautee the onions, mushrooms and garlic with the rosemary, lemon juice and salt/pepper to taste for about 5 minutes. Add the spinach and stir, continue sauteeing until the spinach is wilted or the turkey is done browning.
Lay the turkey in a small casserole, and top each piece with 1 tsp of tapenade, spread over the slice, sliced tomatoes, a Tbsp of feta and 1/4 of the spinach mushroom mixture. Cover and bake for 15 minutes. Top with 1 Tbsp of mozzarella, remove the cover and bake for another 10-15 minutes until the cheese is melted and the turkey breasts are done.
