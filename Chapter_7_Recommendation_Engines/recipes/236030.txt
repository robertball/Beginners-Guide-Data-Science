Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
½ cup hot sauce
¼ cup ranch dressing
¼ cup minced onion
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon onion powder
3 (5 ounce) cans chicken chunks, drained
2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls
2 tablespoons butter, melted
½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix cream cheese, hot sauce, ranch dressing, onion, garlic powder, and onion powder together in a bowl; fold in chicken.
Roll crescent roll dough onto a work surface, pressing dough into a thin layer without tearing. Cut 3-inch pieces out of dough using a biscuit cutter. Spoon about 1 tablespoon cream cheese mixture into the center of each dough piece. Pull dough over filling and press into other edge of dough; crimp edges together using a fork.
Arrange pockets on a baking sheet. Brush each pocket with butter and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
