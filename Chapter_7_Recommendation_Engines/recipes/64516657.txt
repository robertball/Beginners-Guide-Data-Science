Ingredients:
1 loaf Italian, Vienna or French bread (18 oz)
8 oz sliced deli ham
4 oz Swiss cheese sliced (4 slices)
2 1/2 tsp butter (soft or melted)
1 tsp mustard
I shallot (Finley chopped)
1/8 tsp Worcestershire sauce
Poppy seeds for sprinkling
Mayonnaise for spreading (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
BUTTER SPREAD:
Combine butter, mustard, onions and worchestershire sauce into a bowl until spreading consistency is reached. If spread is too runny, put into freezer while you prepare the sandwich.
SANDWICH:
Split the loaves lengthwise and if using, spread the bottom half of the loaf with mayonnaise. Arrange all the ham onto the bottom half and top with sliced cheese. Spread the butter mixture onto the inside of the top half of the bread and sprinkle poppy seeds over the butter.
With the top and bottom of the loaf side-by-side, wrap the two halves in tin foil (with seal on top) and bake for 10 minutes, until the cheese is melted. Once cheese is melted, open the foil and bake 2 minutes longer. Remove from oven, cool slightly then slice into desired portions. Serve warm.
