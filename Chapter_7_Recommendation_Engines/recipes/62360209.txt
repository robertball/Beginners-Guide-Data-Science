Description: 
Italian ice is a summertime frozen treat. In the heat of the summer, you usually notice Italian Ices Carts out, selling them to cool off the kids. It is nothing but flavored ice, but is smooth and sweet. The favorite flavors seems to be Lemon, Strawberry and Chocolate. Italian Ice should never contain any non-dairy creamer and always is made with pure cane sugar. .
