Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons Olive Oil
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 Large fresh tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 large leaves of fresh basil, chopped

Directions:
Blanch tomatoes in a pot of boiling water. (I use the same water I will use to cook the pasta) Peel off skins.  Process tomatoes until smooth in blender or food processor.
Heat oil over medium heat in saucepan.  Add crushed garlic and let it warm for a minute or so, until you can smell the garlic.  DO NOT BROWN the garlic.  Add the processed tomatoes and salt and bring sauce to a simmer.  Allow to simmer, uncovered for 10-15 minutes.  When the sauce is reduced to the thickness desired, remove from heat and add chopped basil.  Stir and let sit a few minutes, so basil oils combine with the sauce.  Serve over pasta.
