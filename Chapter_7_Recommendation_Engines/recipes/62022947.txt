Ingredients:
for cake:
2 1/4 cups cake flour
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1 Tbl. baking powder
1 tsp. salt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
5 egg yolks
3/4 cups unsweetened pineapple juice (drain from a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple and reserve pineapple for topping below)
1 cup (8) egg whites
1/2 tsp. cream of tartar
for topping:
2 cups whipping cream
sugar to sweeten cream
1 (20 oz.) can crushed pineapple, well drained

Directions:
Start by draining the pineapple at least 2 hours.  Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Add the oil, egg yolks, and pineapple juice. Beat smooth with a wire whip.
In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar together until very still peaks form. Fold the batter into the egg whites until well mixed.  Pour into a 10-inch ungreased tube pan and bake at 350 degrees for 60 minutes (until cake springs back when touched). Invert and cool. Whip the whipping cream and sweeten to taste. Fold in the crushed pineapple and use to frost the Pineapple Chiffon Cake. There is plenty of topping to divide the cake into two layers and fill if desired.  Garnish with flaked coconut and tropical flowers.
