Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup vegetable oil
3 fluid ounces milk
6 cups apples - peeled, cored and chopped
1 lemon, juiced
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (230 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mix white flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder and salt. Stir in oil and milk all at once with a fork.  When mixture forms a ball, divide into 2 pieces. Roll out, one half at a time between two pieces of waxed paper. Line a 9 inch pie pan with one half.
In a large bowl, combine apples, lemon juice, sugar and cinnamon. Mix well and pour into pie crust; dot with butter. Cover with top crust. Seal and crimp edges, and cut slits in the top for steam to escape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then lower oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Continue to bake for another 30 minutes or until apples are soft.
