Ingredients:
2 cups fresh cilantro leaves
1 cup fresh parsley leaves
3 tablespoons lime juice
1 cup chili-lime cashews
1/2 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 cup grated Asiago cheese

Directions:
Put the cilantro, parsley, lime juice, cashews, olive oil, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, and grated cheese into the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until mixture is smooth, 8 to 10 pulses. If mixture is too thick, add more olive oil; if too thin, add more cashews.
Pour into 4 one-cup freezer containers. Use one container within a few days; freeze the others for later.
