Ingredients:
8 ounces water, or as needed
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon honey
1 cinnamon stick
1 clove garlic, peeled and smashed

Combine water, vinegar, honey, cinnamon stick, and garlic in a small saucepan. Heat to 100 degrees F (38 degrees C); remove from heat and pour into a mug.

Submitter: 
T. Robert Bruse
Description: 
If you feel it coming on drink lots of this. It can't hurt, and seems to have some effect clearing nasal passages. You may hate it at first, but by the end of the first cup you may want to make more. Breath the steam in deeply. Drink it as much or as often as possible while fighting off your cold. You can substitute balsamic vinegar for the apple cider vinegar
