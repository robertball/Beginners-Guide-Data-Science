Ingredients:
1 pound chopped spinach fresh or frozen
2 tbsp salted butter
3 cloves garlic
1/4 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped sweet red onion
8oz lite cream cheese (softened)
2 eggs
1 tsp salt
2 tsp pepper
1/4 cup bread crumbs

Directions:
1.  Preheat oven to 350 F.  Grease a 9 x 3 loaf pan / baking dish.
2.  Lightly steam spinach.  I do this with a vegetable steamer over boiling water, but without a lid for 5 minutes.
3.  Melt 2 tbsp butter in sautee pan.  Add minced garlic, chopped celery, and chopped sweet red onion.  Sautee until tender and slightly brown.
4.  Mix together cream cheese and eggs until smooth.  Stir in sautee mixture and spinach.  Season with salt and pepper then pour into baking dish.
5.  Top with bread crumbs and bake 1 hour at 350F.
