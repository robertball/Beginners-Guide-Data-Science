2 tbsp. olive oil
3/4 cup dry white wine
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Remove turkey from marinade. Open breast like a book. Sprinkle with salt, black pepper and thyme. Spread cranberry mix evenly over butterflied breast, leaving a 1-inch border around edges. Roll up turkey breast. Tie rolled
turkey breast with strings.  In a skillet, heat 2 tbsp. olive oil. Add turkey and cook, turning occasionally, for 6 minutes.
Transfer turkey to a roasting pan and add wine. Roast, uncovered, for about 30 minutes, then add marinade and roast for another 20 minutes.
