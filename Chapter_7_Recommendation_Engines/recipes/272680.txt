Ingredients:
2 (4 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 (7 ounce) package shirataki noodles, drained
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 small onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained
1 medium carrot, shredded
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste
Â½ cup chicken broth

Directions:
Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add chicken breasts; simmer until no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring another pot of water to a boil. Add noodles and boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain well.
Drain chicken and cool until safe to handle, 5 to 10 minutes. Pull apart into bite-sized pieces.
Heat oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic until onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chicken, water chestnuts, carrot, soy sauce, garlic salt, and pepper. Mix well until blended and carrot is tender, about 4 minutes.
Pour chicken broth into the wok. Add noodles and cook until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.
