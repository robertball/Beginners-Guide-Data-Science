Ingredients:
PEACH LAYER:
6 lb 10 oz canned peaches, drained.
1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 tbls fresh lemon juice
2 tbls cornstarch
CAKE LAYER:
2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, chilled and grated on a box grater.
1/2 cup boiling water.
CRUST:
6 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
For easier clean up, line dutch oven with heavy duty tin foil. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (14 hot charcoal briquettes on bottom, 19 hot charcoal briquettes on lid OR 23 on lid, 7 on bottom).
In a large bowl, combine peaches, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Toss to coat evenly, and pour into a preheated, 12-inch shallow dutch oven. Bake for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine flour, white sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. Toss in chilled, grated butter with your fingertips, or a pastry blender, until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in water until just combined.
Drop spoonfuls of topping over hot cooked peaches and spread with back of spoon until batter is covering all of the peaches. Sprinkle entire cobbler with the sugar and cinnamon mixture. Bake until topping is golden and a skewer inserted into center, comes out clean, ~about 30 minutes.
