Description: 
This dish will satisfy everyone in your house.  Add options on the side--shredded cheddar, sour cream, jalepeno's, tortilla strips.  I even brown ground beef for the meat eaters in my family who want to add to it.  And, if they like heat--pull out the Tobasco sauce.  It's a sure thing for everyone.  Just add cornbread and Smores over the campfire for dessert.Modified from: Grandma's Slow Cooker Vegetarian Chili
