Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups Herdez Traditional Chipotle Cooking sauce
4 large garlic cloves
1 Jalapeno
1/2 yellow onion
1 tablespoon vegetable oil or olive oil
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 lime, juiced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 bunch fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon Mexican Oregano
1 (2 pound) skirt steak or flank steak

Directions:
In a blender container, combine cooking sauce and remaining ingredients except meat. Cover and run on high until smooth.  Reserve 1/2 cup of the mixture for basting the steak on the grill.
Trim steak of any visible fat. Place steak in a non-metallic baking dish or sealable plastic bag. Add marinade; turn meat to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight, turning meat one or more times while marinating.
Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Drain meat and discard marinade. Grill skirt steak about 4 minutes over direct heat with cover closed. Turn meat then baste meat with reserved sauce; grill with cover closed 3 minutes more or until cooked as desired.
Brush any remaining sauce on steak and serve with warm tortillas and salsa.

Description: 
Great for tacos or burritos. Herdez Cooking Sauce has made it so much easier for me to make my Chipotle Flank steak recipe.  You can also use this marinade with chicken, pork or even shrimp.
