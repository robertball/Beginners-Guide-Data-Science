Description: 
Friends and family will flip over these light whole wheat pancakes with a sunny twist of citrus. Earl Brunner of Las Vegas, Nevada adapted them from a traditional pancake recipe. 'Feel free to mix raisins or dried cranberries into the batter to add a bit of chewy sweetness,' he recommends.
