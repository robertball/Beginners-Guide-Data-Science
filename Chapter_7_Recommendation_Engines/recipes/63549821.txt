Description: 
'MY MOTHER-IN-LAW said she devised this recipe when her children were growing up and schedules were hectic. It was a favorite Sunday dish because it could be cooking while the family was at church. When they came home, it didn't take long to finish the preparations and put dinner on the table.'Modified from: No-Fuss Chicken
