Ingredients:
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon dry mustard powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1 (2 1/2 pound) boneless pork loin roast

Directions:
Mix brown sugar, pepper, salt, garlic powder, mustard powder, ground ginger, onion powder, red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, cumin, paprika, and thyme in a bowl. Rub spice mixture over pork loin and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Place pork on a 9x13-inch baking dish and refrigerate for 4 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove plastic wrap from pork and discard; return pork to baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Cover pork loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
