Ingredients:
2 teaspoons butter
1 slice Cheddar cheese
1 slice Muenster cheese
1 slice provolone cheese

Preheat your oven's broiler.
Butter one side of each slice of bread, and place butter side down on a baking sheet. Place cheese slices on top of each piece of bread.
Broil until cheese is bubbly and slightly brown. Remove from the oven, and press the two pieces of bread together cheese to cheese.

Description: 
This is my version of the best grilled cheese inspired by a local restaurant in DC. Rye bread is broiled with three types of cheese then pressed together to make a masterpiece of a hot sandwich.
