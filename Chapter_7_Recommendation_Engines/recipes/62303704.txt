Ingredients:
1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast
2-3 Tbsp cornstarch
1-2 Tbsp oil
2 green peppers, chopped
2-3 dried chilis, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1-2 tsp ginger root, minced
1/2 tsp salt

1 Tbsp crushed red pepper
1/4 cup chopped leek or onion
2 Tbsp chili garlic sauce
1/2 Tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp chicken bullion powder (optional)

Directions:
Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces and coat with cornstarch.  Set aside.
Heat oil in wok on medium-high heat.  Add green pepper and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes (until peppers turn bright green).  Remove peppers from wok, set aside, and keep warm.
Place dried chilis, garlic, ginger, and leek in wok and stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Add chicken and dry ingredients except chicken bullion.  Cook until chicken is done.  Remove from wok.
Put chili garlic sauce in wok, then stir in chicken and green pepper.  Add soy sauce and chicken bullion.  Stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Serve over rice.

Description: 
This recipe is from Yunnan province, China.  The first time I made it for my family, my sister thought I called it 'Non-Profit Chicken' instead of 'Yunnan Province Chicken' and the name stuck.  This dish is a bit spicy but the heat can easily be adjusted by changing the the amount of chilis used.
