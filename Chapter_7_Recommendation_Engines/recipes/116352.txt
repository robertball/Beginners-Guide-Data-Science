Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
Dash pepper
3/4 cup soft bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons rubbed sage
1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 bone-in pork loin chops
1 tablespoon olive or vegetable oil
1 tablespoon butter or margarine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a shallow dish, combine the flour, salt and pepper. In another shallow dish, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, sage and lemon peel. Place egg in shallow bowl. Coat pork chops with flour mixture, dip in egg, then coat with bread crumb mixture. Let stand for 5 minutes.
In a skillet, brown chops in oil and butter for 2 minutes on each side. Transfer to a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until juices run clear and a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
