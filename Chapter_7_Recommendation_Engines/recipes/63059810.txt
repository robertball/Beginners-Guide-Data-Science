Ingredients:
1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips
2 tbsp natural unsalted peanut butter
1 cup cereal (popped rice, flakes, etc)

Directions:
Melt the chocolate chips in the microwave or on the stovetop on low heat, then stir in the peanut butter. Take the pot off the heat and stir in cereal until well coated. If your cereal is on the plain side, add a drizzle of maple syrup to flavor it up.
Drop by big spoonfuls on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and let chill in the fridge for at least half an hour (try to be patient!).
