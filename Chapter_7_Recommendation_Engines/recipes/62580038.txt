Ingredients:
Soup:
3 Tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 medium onions, chopped
4 cloves garlic
1/2 cup white cooking wine, or white grape juice
8 cups chopped tomatoes, skins left on
1-2 teaspoons kosher salt
1-2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
1 cup fresh basil, chopped
1/4 cup cream
Croutons:
bread 2-3 slices
olive oil
grated parmesan
fresh chives,chopped (I used garlic chives)
kosher salt
pepper

Directions:
Soup:
Melt butter in stock pot. Add chopped onion and garlic, cook for about 5 minutes, or until soft. Add wine or grape juice, tomatoes, salt, pepper and basil. Cook for another 5 minutes. Cool for about 5 minutes add cream if desired. Blend soup in batches using blender*until all soup is smooth. Return to stockpot, add cream and heat just until warmed through. Serve with croutons.
Croutons:
Cut up 2-3 pieces of bread, preferably a dense and crusty bread. I used leftover french, and it was still yummy.
Heat a non stick skillet using medium high heat. Add about 3-4 tablespoons olive oil. Toss bread in pan and cook for about 3-4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle generously with grated parmesan, toss and add chopped chives. Remove from heat and let cool. Top soup with croutons. This can also be cooked in the oven at 350 degrees for about 10-15 minutes or until browned. To cook in oven: toss all ingredients and place on foil lined cookie sheet, bake as directed.
