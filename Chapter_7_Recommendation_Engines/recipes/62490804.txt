Ingredients:
1 gallon vegetable broth
1 cup sea salt (or 1.5 c. kosher salt)
1 tablespoon crushed dried rosemary
1 tablespoon dried sage
1 tablespoon dried thyme
1 tablespoon dried savory
1/4 c. brown sugar
1 gallon ice water

Directions:
In a large stock pot, combine the vegetable broth, salt, rosemary, sage, thyme, savory and sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently to be sure salt is dissolved. Remove from heat, and let cool to room temperature.
When the broth mixture is cool, pour it into a clean 5 gallon bucket. Stir in the ice water.
Wash and dry your turkey.  Make sure you have removed the innards. Place the turkey, breast down, into the brine. Make sure that the cavity of the bird gets filled.  Place the bucket in the refrigerator overnight.  (May also be kept, well covered, in a locked garage near the garage door.  Don't try to leave it on the porch!)
Remove the turkey carefully draining off the excess brine and pat dry.  Discard excess brine.
Cook the turkey as desired reserving the drippings for gravy.  Keep in mind that brined turkeys cook 20 to 30 minutes faster so watch the temperature gauge.
