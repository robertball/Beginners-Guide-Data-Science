Ingredients:
2 Tbsp ghee or your fat or oil of choice
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 onion chopped, about 1 cup

3 garlic cloves, minced
1 1-inch chunk ginger, peeled and grated
2 bay leaves
1 Tbsp curry powder (mild, med or hot)
1 16 oz. can diced tomatoes, or about 1 1/2 cups chopped fresh
1 tsp ground coriander
1 Tbsp chili powder (lessen amount for less heat)
1 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground turmeric

1 lb (500g) ground beef or lamb
2 cups frozen peas, keep frozen

Directions:
Melt ghee or oil/fat of choice in a large skillet with a lid on medium-high heat
Add cumin seeds, stirring until they become fragrant and start to crackle (less than a minute)
Stir in onion, pepper, garlic, ginger, bay leaves and curry powder. Stir and cook 5 minutes or until onions start to soften but aren't translucent.
Add tomatoes, stir and cook for 2 minutes.
Add coriander, chili powder, cumin, turmeric and salt. Stir thoroughly.
Add the beef or lamb, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up the meat and cook until no longer pink
Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 15 minutes.
