Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp nutmeg
1 tbsp honey
1/2 tsp vanilla
4 slices bread
1/4 cup butter
Fruit (optional)

Directions:
Beat the eggs until frothy and egg white and egg yolk are mixed completely.
Beat in the milk and vanilla.
Add the cinnamon and nutmeg, mixing as thoroughly as possible.
Mix in the honey, making sure to mix it completely. Don't let it stick to the bottom of the bowl.
Melt butter in a pan over medium heat, making sure to have a consistent amount of butter all around.
Once butter is melted, quickly dunk a piece of bread entirely in the egg mixture, making sure to not soak it through.
Place the bread in the pan. Depending upon how big your pan is, you can do one to all of the pieces of bread at a time. Slowly cook until golden on one side, and then flip, making sure not to burn.
While French Toast is cooking, if desired, chop up some fruit to sprinkle over it. I generally use whole blueberries, sliced strawberries and cherries, and halved blackberries in even ratios.
Once French Toast is done, serve with chopped fruit on top, and, if desired, whipped cream or maple syrup.

Description: 
I've been eating French Toast since I was a child, but I've never found a recipe I liked. So I made one up. Everyone I've served it to loves it. Slow cooked and sweet.
