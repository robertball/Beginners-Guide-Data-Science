Ladle hot salsa into hot jars leaving 1/2 inch headspace. Remove air bubbles. Wipe rim. Center hot lid on jar. Apply band and adjust until fit is fingertip tight.
Process filled jars in a boiling water canner for 15 minutes, adjusting for altitude. Remove jars and cool. Check lids for seal after 24 hours. Lid should not flex up and down when center is pressed.

Description: 
This recipe used to be on here but now seems to be gone and is also not on Ball's site.  I've started making my own salsa with fresh ingredients, though I just freeze it rather than canning - but this is a proper canning recipe.  The only issue is that it only fills the jars maybe 2/3 full.  This is not hot in my opinion, but I don't use the seeds.
