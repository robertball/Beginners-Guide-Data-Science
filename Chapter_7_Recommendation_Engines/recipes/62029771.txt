Ingredients:

Directions:
Meatballs:
1 pound lean ground meat
1 egg
1 c dry breadcrumbs
2 tsp dry basil
1 tsp dry parsely
1/2 c grated parmesan cheese
Soup:
8 cups chicken broth
2 heads escarole, cleaned & chopped
3 eggs
1 cup parmesan cheese
1.  Bring a large pot of water to boil. Put the escarole in the water and cook it until it wilts.  This removes the bitter taste from the greens.  Strain the greens and squeeze the liquid from them when they cool.
2.  Bring the chicken broth to boil in a separate pot.
3.  Mix the meatballs and form into bite sized meatballs.  Drop these into the boiling chicken broth.  When they rise to the top, they are cooked.
4. Add the greens to the chicken broth and mix the egg with the parmesan cheese.  Pour this into the pot and stir it continuously until the egg is cooked.

Description: 
This recipe was passed down from my Grandmother, who was from Agnone, Italy. My mother taught me how to make this.  There are several steps to this recipe, but it is worthwhile.  Serve it with fresh Italian bread.
