1 tablespoon sesame oil
5 habanero pepper, or more to taste, seeded and chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
1 teaspoon sweet curry powder, or more to taste
1 teaspoon salt
2 ripe mango - peeled, seeded, and cut into cubes

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Saute peppers, garlic, and ginger in hot oil until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
Season pepper mixture with curry powder and salt. Reduce heat to low and cook to let the flavors blend, 1 to 2 minutes.
Transfer pepper mixture to a blender; add mango cubes and blend until smooth.
Pour blended mango mixture into the saucepan, bring to a simmer, and cook until slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.
