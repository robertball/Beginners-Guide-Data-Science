Ingredients:
3 ounces white chocolate baking squares, cut up
1/4 C. light corn syrup
3 Tbsp. white Creme De Caco liqueur
2 C. shortbread cookie crumbs
1 C. finely chopped toasted almonds, or macadamia nuts
1/3 C. chopped dried apricots
Sifted powdered sugar

Directions:
Using a food processor or blender, process the shortbread cookies and nuts to finely chopped then place in a large mixing bowl and set aside.
Chop the apricots in the food processor or blender, using a little powdered sugar to prevent the dried fruit from sticking together. Place the chopped apricots in the mixing bowl with previous ingredients.
Melt the white chocolate in the top of a double boiler over low heat or in the microwave for 15 seconds at a time until melted.
Add the corn syrup and Creme De Cacao liqueur to the melted chocolate and blend.
Combine the white chocolate mixture with the crumb mixture.
Form into 1-inch balls; roll in powdered sugar and place on sheets of waxed paper and let stand until dry. (about 30 minutes)
Store in an airtight container up to 1 week.
Roll in powdered sugar before serving.
Optional:
After rolling in powdered sugar, dip each ball in melted white chocolate candy coating or milk chocolate and chill to set the coating. Store in the refrigerator in air tight covered container
