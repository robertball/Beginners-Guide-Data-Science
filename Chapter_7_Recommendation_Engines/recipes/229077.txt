Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, finely chopped
1 cucumber, seeded and chopped
1/2 onion, chopped
1 large tomato, chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
4 serrano chile peppers, seeded and finely chopped
1 1/2 cups spicy vegetable juice (such as V8®)
12 small Key limes, juiced
2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste
1 tablespoon soy-based liquid seasoning (such as Maggi®)
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
salt to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cauliflower in the boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
Mix cauliflower, cucumber, onion, tomato, cilantro, and serrano chile peppers together in a large bowl. Add vegetable juice, lime juice, chili powder, soy-based seasoning, and Worcestershire sauce, respectively, stirring after each addition. Season with salt.

Description: 
This cauliflower version of the authentic Mexican ceviche is the best I've tried! It has great flavor and it's full of vegetables! I prefer to serve it over a tostada (baked or fried corn tortilla) with guacamole!
