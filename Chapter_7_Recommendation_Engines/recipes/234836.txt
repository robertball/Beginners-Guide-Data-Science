Ingredients:
1 pound pork loin, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 onion, diced
2 tablespoons water
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 serrano peppers, minced
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons ground coriander
2 cups water
2 cups chicken broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/4 cup cornmeal
2 (15 ounce) cans hominy, drained
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 lime, juiced

Directions:
Season pork with salt and pepper.
Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork in hot oil until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate and return pot to heat.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook and stir onion and 2 tablespoons water in hot pot until water has evaporated and onion is soft and golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic, serrano peppers, cumin, and coriander; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir 2 cups water, chicken broth, and tomatoes into onion mixture. Whisk in cornmeal and bring to a simmer over high heat, stirring often; add hominy, pork, salt, and pepper to taste. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is soft and hominy mixture thickens, about 30 minutes. Stir in cilantro and lime juice.

Description: 
Traditionally a long-simmered stew, this Mexican-inspired stew is quick and easy, thanks to canned hominy. Searing the pork loin in the pot before making the stew gives you a great base of flavors so the stew seems as if it indeed simmered all afternoon. Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with warm tortillas on the side. Yum, yum, yum.
