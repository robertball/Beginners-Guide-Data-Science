Ingredients:
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup water
1 cup couscous
1 cucumber, seeded and diced
3 green onions, chopped
1 carrot, grated
1 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Bring chicken broth and water to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat and stir in couscous. Cover saucepan and let couscous stand until the liquid is absorbed and the couscous is tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
Place couscous, cucumber, green onions, carrot, and parsley into a large salad bowl. Combine olive oil and lemon juice in a small bowl and pour over the couscous and vegetables; stir cumin, salt, and black pepper into the tabbouleh. Mix in feta cheese just before serving.

Description: 
A variant on traditional bulgur tabbouleh. Great to serve at potlucks because it can be served cold or warm! Even better left over! The longer it sits, the more the flavors meld together.
