Ingredients:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts
1/2 cup chopped raisins
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoons flaked coconut
2 tablespoons bourbon
2 1/4 ounces colored candy sprinkles

Directions:
Mix the butter and the confectioners' sugar until smooth. Stir in the chopped nuts, raisins, cocoa, coconut and bourbon. Refrigerate mixture until firm, about 1 hour.
Shape mixture into small balls and roll in chocolate sprinkles to coat. Work fast, as they can melt in your hands. Chill on a wax paper lined tray. Keep balls refrigerated in a covered container.
