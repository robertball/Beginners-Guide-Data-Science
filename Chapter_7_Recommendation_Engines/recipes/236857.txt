Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips
1 (16 ounce) jar peanut butter
1 (16 ounce) package buttery round crackers

Directions:
Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.
Spread peanut butter onto a cracker and top with another cracker creating a sandwich. Repeat until all the crackers are used.
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Gently place a cracker sandwich into the melted chocolate; spoon chocolate over the cracker until covered. Carefully lift coated cracker sandwich out of chocolate using a fork to strain off the excess chocolate and place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining cracker sandwiches and chocolate; refrigerate until chocolate is hardened.
