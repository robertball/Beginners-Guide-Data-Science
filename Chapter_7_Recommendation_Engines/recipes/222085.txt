Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups peeled and diced potatoes
1/2 cup chopped carrots
1/2 cup chopped green beans
1/3 cup diced celery
1/3 cup finely chopped onion
3/4 cup diced cooked ham
3 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
1 teaspoon ground white pepper, or to taste
5 tablespoons butter
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups nonfat milk

Directions:
Combine potatoes, carrots, green beans, celery, onion, ham, and water in a stockpot. Bring to a boil and cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in chicken bouillon and pepper.
Melt butter in a separate saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour with a with fork and cook, stirring constantly, until thick, about 1 minute. Slowly stir in milk so lumps do not form until all of the milk has been added. Continue stirring until thick, 4 to 5 minutes.
Pour the milk mixture into stockpot and cook soup until heated through, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This soup was great, so creamy. I add some carrots and green beans to it and it has a little more fiber and a little more heartiness to it.
