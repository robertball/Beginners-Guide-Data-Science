Tropical Rice - Paleo Style Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 medium cauliflower
1/4 cup finely diced white onion
1/2 tbsp coconut oil
1/2 tsp ground cardamom
3/4 cup coconut milk
3/4 cup crushed pineapple
2 tbsp coconut amino
1 tbsp sesame oil
1 tsp sucanat
1/4 cup finely chopped green onion
1/4 cup chopped macadamia nuts or toasted coconut flakes

Directions:
1.  Break the cauliflower into florets. Using a cheese grater, grate the cauliflower. Or, if you have a food processor, add florets to the bowl of your food processor and pulse until cauliflower looks like rice. About 10-15 seconds of pulsing.
2.  Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat for 1-2 minutes. Add the coconut oil, melt, then add the onion. Saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the cardamom and stir with a wooden spoon until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
3.  Add the cauliflower and coconut milk, stirring to combine. Saute the cauliflower for about 10-12 minutes until the coconut milk is adsorbed.
4.  The consistency will be a little off for awhile, but it will come together as the cauliflower dries out a bit and brown specks begin to appear.
5.  Fluff the cauliflower rice and mix in crushed pineapples, coconut amino, sucanat and sesame oil. Top with chopped green onion and any of the delightful toppings.
