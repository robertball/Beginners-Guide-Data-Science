Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
4 chicken breasts, cut into quarters
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (8 ounce) package white mushrooms, sliced
6 carrots, peeled and sliced
1 1/2 cups white cooking wine
6 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
3/4 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup minced garlic
1 shallot, chopped
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 bay leaf
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons butter, softened

Directions:
Place flour in a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken through flour until evenly coated, shaking excess flour back into bowl. Reserve remaining flour.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; saute chicken until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Add mushrooms, carrots, cooking wine, bacon, chicken broth, garlic, shallot, parsley, thyme, marjoram, bay leaf, salt, and black pepper; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low, cover skillet, and simmer until chicken is cooked through and carrots are soft, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Mix butter and 2 tablespoons reserved flour together in a bowl until smooth; stir into chicken mixture until sauce becomes thick, about 5 minutes.
