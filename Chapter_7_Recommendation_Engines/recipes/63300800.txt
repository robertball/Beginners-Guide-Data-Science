Ingredients:
•1 pound ground beef
•1 small red onion, finely chopped
•1 small carrot, finely chopped
•4 garlic cloves, minced
•3/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
•1/2 cup dry red wine or beef broth
•1 can (15 ounces) crushed tomatoes, undrained
•1 can (8 ounces) tomato sauce
•1/2 cup vegetable broth
•1 bay leaf
•1/4 teaspoon salt
•1/4 teaspoon pepper
•2 tablespoons minced fresh basil or 2 teaspoons dried basil
•48 slices French bread baguette (1/4 inch thick)
•2 garlic cloves, halved
•1/3 cup olive oil
•1 cup shaved Parmesan cheese

Directions:
•In a large skillet, cook the first five ingredients over medium heat until beef is no longer pink; drain. Add wine, stirring to loosen browned bits from pan.
• Stir in the tomatoes, tomato sauce, broth, bay leaf, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes or until thickened. Discard bay leaf. Stir in basil.
• Rub baguette slices with garlic halves; place on ungreased baking sheets. Brush lightly with oil. Bake at 400° for 3-5 minutes or until lightly browned.
• Arrange toast on serving platters; top with beef mixture and cheese. Serve immediately. Yield: 12 servings.

Description: 
Crispy bread replaces the classic tortilla chips and savory meat sauce tops things off. This hearty appetizer easily doubles as a main dish. Add a salad and you have dinner.—Sonya Labbe, Los Angeles, California
