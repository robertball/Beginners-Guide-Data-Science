Ingredients:
6 oz tomato paste
1 cup beef stock
1/4 cup shallot, minced fine
3 gloves garlic, minced
1 T Dijon mustard
1 tsp prepared horseradish
2 T apple cider vinegar
1 T avocado oil
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp red pepper
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp black pepper

Directions:
Combine all ingredients into a sauce pan and bring to a quick simmer using medium heat.
Reduce to medium low and cover for 15-20 minutes. You'll want to stir frequently to keep it from sticking to the sides.
The longer you let this simmer, the more flavor you get in the sauce. If you aren't rushed and have at least another 25-35 minutes, add an extra 1/2 cup of beef stock to the mixture at the beginning, then simmer 25-35 minutes or until the desired consistency is achieved.
