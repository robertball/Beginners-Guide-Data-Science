Description: 
ver. 01: I added Neufchatel in place of Cream Cheese and halved the amount. I also added a touch of cinnamon and generalized the squash, since this will work for all winter squash. Very minor tweaks, this recipe is nearly perfect as-is! Other potential changes are to replace some of the cream cheese for yogurt or add apples.

ver. 00: Delicious and very easy to make. You can use 3 to 4 cups of chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon cubes. Also works well with half as much cream cheese if you don't want it too rich.Modified from: Butternut Squash Soup
