Ingredients:
1 (29 ounce) can sliced peaches, drained and chopped
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 lemons, zested
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup orange juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch baking pan.
In a saucepan over low heat, mix the peaches, brown sugar, cornstarch, and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil. Cook and stir until sugar is melted and mixture is slightly thickened.
In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, and lemon zest. Stir in eggs, vanilla, 1/2 cup oil, and orange juice. Mix until smooth. Pour 1/2 the batter into the prepared pan. Layer with 1/2 the peach mixture, then with remaining batter. Top with remaining peach mixture.
Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.

Description: 
This is my mom's recipe for coffee cake. She uses fresh peaches, which are definitely better, but I like this cake too much to restrict it to the summer. Increase the brown sugar to 1/2 cup if using fresh peaches.
