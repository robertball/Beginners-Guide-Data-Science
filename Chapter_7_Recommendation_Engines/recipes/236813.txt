Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed, divided
1/2 cup water
1 onion, chopped
1 cup sliced mushrooms
3 slices Havarti cheese, or more to taste

Directions:
Cut cauliflower into 3 or 4 'steaks'. Remove the stem and leaves from each 'steak' using a sharp knife; reserve the florets that have fallen off while slicing steaks.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook cauliflower 'steaks' in the hot oil until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add florets and water to skillet; cover and steam until cauliflower is tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; saute onion until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms and saute until onion is lightly browned and mushrooms are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Arrange cauliflower 'steaks' and florets on a baking sheet; top with onion-mushroom mixture and Havarti cheese.
Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes.

This is another vegetarian option. Leave out the cheese and it's vegan. Serve with steamed brown rice and beans. Colby cheese can be substituted for the Havarti cheese.
