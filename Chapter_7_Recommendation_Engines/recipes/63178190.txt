Ingredients:
1 box (9 ounces) golden yellow cake mix
1 box (8.5 ounces) corn muffin mix
1/3 cup milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup water
2 eggs, lightly beaten

Directions:
Lightly grease an 11x7 inch baking pan, or spray with non-stick spray. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Mix ingredients until well incorporated. Do not over mix. Pour into prepared pan. Bake at 400 degrees for 5 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees, and bake for an additional 20-30 minutes, or until cornbread tests done with a toothpick. Serve warm.
