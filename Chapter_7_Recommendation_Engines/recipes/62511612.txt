Description: 
I never measure anything when I cook & I'm always being asked how to make my pesto. So here's someone else's recipe that I tweaked to resemble mine--that should work. You HAVE TO use really good ingredients or this won't taste as good as it should!!Modified from: 15-Year-Old Pesto Sauce
