Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 pounds fryer or boiler chicken, cut into pieces
2  leeks, sliced
1 large onion, diced
2 stalks celery, sliced
1 ½ teaspoons salt
5 cups water
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
¼ teaspoon nutmeg
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon lemon juice
½ cup heavy cream
2  egg yolks
1 tablespoon dried parsley

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium -high heat and quickly brown the chicken pieces. Remove and set aside.
In the same pot, saute the leeks, onion, celery and salt until the vegetables are tender crisp.  Return the chicken to the pot and add the water, bouillon and nutmeg.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low; cover and simmer for 35 to 40 minutes, until the chicken is tender.
In a small bowl or cup, combine the flour and lemon juice; pour into the pot and stir.
Beat the cream and the egg yolks with 2 tablespoons of the hot liquid; stir into pot.  Heat through, but do not allow to boil as the cream will curdle.  Sprinkle in the parsley before serving.

I learned this while stationed in the Flemish part of Belgium, in a village called Sint-Hubrechtslille. So tasty good, my daughter still asks me to make it for her 10 years later!
