Ingredients:
1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage
1/4 cup white wine
2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing
1 yellow bell pepper, sliced
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 orange bell pepper, sliced
1 red onion, sliced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) package prepared polenta, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1/4 cup water, or as needed
4 ounces crumbled feta cheese
3 ounces crumbled goat cheese

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and break apart with a wooden spoon. Cook until sausage is browned thoroughly, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Pour in white wine and stir, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Remove sausage mixture from the skillet, place in a bowl, and set aside.
Add olive oil, all bell peppers, and onion to the skillet. Season with a pinch of salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened and caramelized, about 10 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round pie dish with olive oil. Arrange polenta slices over the bottom, overlapping slightly.
Stir tomato paste into bell pepper mixture in the skillet and cook briefly. Return sausage mixture to pan and stir well. Add water until mixture is saucy but not too thin; you may use less than 1/4 cup. Add chopped parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer briefly until thickened. Remove from heat.
Spoon sausage-pepper mixture over polenta in the pie dish and spread evenly. Sprinkle feta cheese and goat cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
