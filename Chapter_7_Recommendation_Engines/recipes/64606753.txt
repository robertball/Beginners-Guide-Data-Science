Ingredients:
2 cups flour
2 tbsp. sugar
4 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. salt
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1 cup (or less) cold milk
Filling:
1/3 cup butter or margarine
1 cup brown sugar
3 tsp. cinnamon

Directions:
In large bowl, mix first 4 ingredients.
Cut in butter until crumbly. Make a well in center.
Grease 12 muffin tins (there's usually 12 tins/pan).
Cream filling ingredients together. Drop 1/2 tsp. mixture into each muffin tin.
Pour milk into well. Stir to form soft dough, adding a bit more milk if needed.
Turn out onto lightly floured surface. Knead about 8 times.
Roll into rectangle about 1/3" thick and 12" long.
Spread remaining filling mixture over dough rectangle, as close to edges as possible.
Roll up as for jelly roll - starting at long edge.
Mark 12 sections with a knife, then slice (here's where math is very rewarding as u see 12 slices appear! and hey!, that's the same # of muffin tins you just greased haha)
Place each slice cut side down in muffin pan.
Bake @ 400 x 15-17 minutes.
Turn out onto foil-lined baking sheet.
Try not to burn your fingers when u can't resist sampling!
