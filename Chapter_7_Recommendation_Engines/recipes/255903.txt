Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
1 (16.3 ounce) can refrigerated biscuit dough
6 eggs
1/2 cup Borden® Cheddar and Monterey Jack Shreds
3 tablespoons Borden® Cheddar and Monterey Jack Shreds, for topping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble or chop into small pieces.
Separate 6 biscuits into 2 rounds each. Press rounds into 12 cups of a muffin tin, pressing up sides to form biscuit dough cups.
Mix eggs, bacon pieces, and 1/2 cup shredded cheese together in a bowl.
Fill muffin pan biscuits with egg mixture about 3/4 full. Sprinkle remaining 3 tablespoons cheese on top.
Bake in preheated oven until egg mixture is set, 18 to 22 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before serving.
