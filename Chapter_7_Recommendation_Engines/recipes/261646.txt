Ingredients:
8 cups all-purpose flour
3 ounces compressed fresh yeast
1 pinch white sugar
1 tablespoon lukewarm milk
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup unsalted butter
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 cup white sugar
2 egg yolks
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups chopped blanched almonds
1 1/4 cups raisins
6 tablespoons candied lemon peel
6 tablespoons chopped candied orange peel
2 tablespoons melted butter
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Place flour in a large bowl, make a well in the center, and crumble fresh yeast into it. Sprinkle in sugar and add 1 tablespoon milk. Cover and let rise at a warm place for 15 minutes.
Heat 1 1/2 cups milk and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter in a saucepan over low heat until butter is melted.
Pour milk-butter mixture over yeast mixture and add 1 cup sugar, egg yolks, and salt. Knead until a soft dough forms. Cover with a clean dish towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix almonds, raisins, candied lemon peel, and candied orange peel together and fold into the dough. Shape dough into a loaf and place on the prepared baking sheet. Cover and let rest until the loaf has risen again slightly, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove from oven. Brush hot stollen immediately with 2 tablespoons melted butter and dust with confectioners' sugar.
