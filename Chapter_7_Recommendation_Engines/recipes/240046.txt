Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup frozen vegetable blend (peppers, onions, celery, and parsley)
1 clove garlic, crushed and minced
2 pounds fresh cauliflower, cut into florets
1/2 pound carrots, sliced
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 (32 fluid ounce) container vegetable broth
2 (14 ounce) cans coconut milk
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a 4-quart pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-low heat. Cook and stir vegetables in the hot oil until nearly tender, 7 to 10 minutes; add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
Stir cauliflower and carrot into the vegetable mixture; season with allspice and seasoned salt. Pour vegetable broth over the vegetable mixture. Place lid on the pot and cook vegetables until soft, 30 to 45 minutes.
Ladle about half the vegetables into the bowl of a blender with enough liquid to cover. Hold lid in place with a towel and pulse blender a few times to get mixture moving before leaving blender on to puree vegetables entirely.
Mash remaining vegetables in the pot with a fork or potato masher until no large chunks remain. Pour pureed vegetable mixture into the pot with the coconut milk; stir. Season soup with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Hearty and satisfying without being overly rich or heavy, this flavorful, easy, healthy 'bisque' gets rave reviews and is always gone by meal's end! It travels well, as the soup can be eaten hot, cold, or in-between. It always vanishes during pot-luck dinners, even when cauliflower is an unfavorite food!
