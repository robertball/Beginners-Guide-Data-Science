Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 medium green bell pepper, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with jalapeno peppers
1 (12 fluid ounce) can tomato juice
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 tablespoon chili powder
3 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/2 cup red wine

Directions:
Combine beef, green pepper, and onion in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir until beef is browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess grease.
Reduce heat to medium. Add tomatoes, tomato juice, tomato paste, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, and cayenne; mix well. Cover and cook until sauce begins to bubble gently, 5 to 10 minutes.
Pour wine into the sauce. Cover and simmer over low heat until flavors combine, 2 to 3 hours. Stir every so often to prevent soup from sticking to the bottom of the pan.

Description: 
It's hard to recipe hunt when it's just the two of you - everything seems to be tailored for families of 4 or more (or with the intention of having massive leftovers). I've begun to learn the art of cooking for 2, and with a primal outlook... beans are a no-go. This chili is my take on my Polish grandmother's recipe - it's not too spicy but very savory. This recipe gave us 2 decent-sized bowls each. Enjoy and feel free to tweak to your liking!
