Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
3 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs
Bacon grease or preferred fat
4 shallots, thinly sliced
1 cup dry white wine
1 Tbsp butter
1 Tbsp flour
2 cup chicken stock
1 Tbsp herbes de provence

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  Cut the bacon into small pieces and fry until crispy over medium high heat.  Remove from pan. Add chicken thighs and sear on both sides, adding more bacon fat or alternative as necessary.  Remove chicken and place in oven safe dish- preferably one with a lid.
Saute the shallots in bacon grease until softened and golden brown.  Stir in the wine and deglaze the pan. Reduce the liquid by about one half. Whisk in the butter and flour, stirring constantly until incorporated. Add the chicken stock, herbes de provence and the fried bacon.  Bring to a boil and simmer 5 minutes.
Pour the onion and bacon sauce over the chicken.  Roast, covered, in the oven for 30 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.
