Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 onion, chopped
1 pound beef sirloin tips
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (10.5 ounce) can chicken broth
2 1/2 cups water
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 jalapeno pepper, chopped
1 head bok choy, chopped
2 tablespoons chile-garlic sauce (such as SrirachaÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the beef, and continue cooking until the beef is evenly browned. Season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken broth, water, lime juice, and jalapeno. Increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Stir in bok choy, and simmer until tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in chile-garlic sauce.

Description: 
A spicy-warm soup with light flavorings. As is, I believe it is mildly hot, depending on the jalapenos' quality. Consider adding chayote, more lime, beef broth, tomatoes, or hotter peppers. Very versatile recipe. I recommend serving this soup over or with rice.
