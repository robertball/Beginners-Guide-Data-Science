Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups 2% milk
1 large egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
6 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided
6 cups confectioners' sugar
4 tablespoons hot water, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease donut pans well.
Sift flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, and salt together into a large bowl.
Whisk milk, egg, butter, oil, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Stir into flour mixture until just combined.
Spoon batter into the prepared donut pans, filling each well 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a donut comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for about 5 minutes; tap donuts out onto a sheet pan.
Combine confectioners' sugar, hot water, and remaining vanilla extract in a bowl to make the glaze.
Place parchment paper under a wire cooling rack. Transfer cooled donuts to the rack and coat in glaze, letting excess drip onto parchment paper; coat the donuts a second time if desired.
