Ingredients:
6 single serving bags of corn chips
1 lb. ground beef
1/2 tsp. onion powder
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1 packet taco seasoning
1/2 cup water
1 tomato diced
1/2 yellow onion diced
1/2 head of iceburg lettuce shredded
cheddar cheese shredded

Directions:
In skillet; brown beef, onion powder and garlic powder over medium heat.
Add taco seasoning and 1/2 cup water and reduce heat to low.
Dice your tomato, onion, and shred you lettuce and cheese.
Remove skillet from heat.
Open the corn chips and scoop a sixth of the beef mix directly into each bag.  Allow everyone to top with their favorite taco toppings!  I recommend using a plastic fork (might as well keep clean up at a minimum!)

Description: 
I had my first walking taco at one of my daughter's swim meets.  Basically it is a taco inside a Frito's bag, and the best part is that you are free to walk around the party without dropping half of your dinner on the ground.
