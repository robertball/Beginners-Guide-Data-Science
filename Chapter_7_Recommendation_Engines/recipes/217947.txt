Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon curry powder
1 pinch salt
3 potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 cup tomato sauce
1 cup golden raisins
water, or enough to cover
1 (14.5 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 bunch kale, ribs removed, chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onions are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper, garam masala, curry powder, and salt into the onion and garlic; cook together until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the potatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and raisins to the pot. Pour enough water over the mixture to cover; bring to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are soft, 10 to 15 minutes.
Add the chickpeas and kale to the pot; simmer until the kale wilts, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the cilantro over the stew and immediately remove the pot from the heat.

Description: 
This recipe came to be as a way to use the kale that was flourishing in my garden. It could also incorporate all kinds of other vegetables - whatever is in your fridge that needs to be used. Serve over couscous.
