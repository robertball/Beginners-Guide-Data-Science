Ingredients:
2 cups peeled and diced potatoes
2 cups frozen mixed vegetables
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup finely chopped celery
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
2 cups SwansonÂ® Chicken Broth
1 1/2 cups diced cooked turkey
1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups fat free half-and-half
1/2 teaspoon sriracha chili garlic sauce
salt and pepper to taste
2 slices bacon - cooked and crumbled

Directions:
Combine potatoes, mixed vegetables, onions, celery, parsley and Swanson(R) Chicken Broth in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat, cover, and simmer gently until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in turkey and poultry seasoning.
Whisk flour and the half-and-half together until smooth. Stir mixture slowly into the saucepan. Stir until slightly thickened, or until mixture reaches a chowder-like consistency. Add sriracha sauce, salt, and pepper, mixing well.
Ladle into soup bowls; garnish with crumbled bacon.
