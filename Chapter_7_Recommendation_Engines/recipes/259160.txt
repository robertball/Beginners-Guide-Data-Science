Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package dried spaghetti
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
4 garlic scapes, tops trimmed and stems finely chopped
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 11 minutes. Drain.
Heat olive oil in a deep skillet until hot. Remove from heat and add garlic scapes; let stand for 3 minutes. Mix in parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Serve over drained spaghetti sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.
