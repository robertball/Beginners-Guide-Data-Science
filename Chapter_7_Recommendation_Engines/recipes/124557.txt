Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon instant minced onion
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon leaf oregano
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce, divided
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 (6 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained

Directions:
In large bowl, combine beef, crumbs, egg, onion, salt and oregano. Stir in 3/4 cup tomato sauce; set aside. Cut 2 pieces of waxed paper 15 inches long. Place meat mixture in center of one rectangle; cover with second rectangle. With a rolling pin, press meat into a 13-in. x 9-in. rectangle. Remove top sheet of wax paper. Sprinkle meat with cheese and mushrooms; top with remaining tomato sauce. Roll up meat, jelly-roll fashion, starting at narrow end; use wax paper to help. Place meat seam side down; seal ends securely. Place in non-stick 9-1/4-in. x 5-1/2 in. x 2-3/4-in. bread pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes. Drain off any fat that accumulates; return to oven for 30 minutes.
