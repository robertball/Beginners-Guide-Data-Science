Ingredients:
3/4 cup almond flour
3 tablespoons granular no-calorie sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
1 dash salt
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 egg white
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Mix almond flour, sweetener, and salt together in a small bowl with a fork. Add butter, egg white, and vanilla extract; continue mixing with a fork. Place in the freezer to help it harden for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or use a silicone baking mat.
Remove batter from freezer. Measure out 1 teaspoon at a time; roll into balls and place on the prepared baking sheet. Place plastic wrap on the bottom of a glass and roll dough balls flat.
Bake in the preheated oven until light, golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
