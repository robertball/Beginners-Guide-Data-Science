Ingredients:
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups chopped okra
1 cup chopped onion
3/4 cup chopped celery
3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
4 cups water
2 cups chopped tomatoes
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 bay leaves
1/2 pound cooked ham, cubed
1 (15.5 ounce) can black-eyed peas

Directions:
Heat 1/3 cup oil in a medium saucepan over medium low heat, and whisk in flour. Whisking constantly, cook 5 to 7 minutes, until a golden brown roux has formed.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium high heat. Stir in okra, onion, celery, and garlic, and cook 10 minutes, or until tender.
Thoroughly blend roux into the vegetable mixture. Stir in water, tomatoes, parsley, salt, thyme, cayenne pepper, pepper, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Mix in ham, and continue cooking 15 minutes, until tender.
Stir in black-eyed peas, and continue cooking until heated through.

Description: 
This is a super easy gumbo. Smoked turkey may be substituted for the ham. Tastes even better the next day! Top with cooked rice and garnish with parsley and chopped green onions to serve.
