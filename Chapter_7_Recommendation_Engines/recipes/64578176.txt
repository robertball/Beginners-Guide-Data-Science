Ingredients:
2 large baking potatoes
1 1/2 cups finely chopped cabbage
4 strips bacon, cut up
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1/4 cup butter
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt (or more to taste)
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese
1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese

Directions:
Bake the potatoes in the microwave until soft.  When cooked, split them in half horizontally and scoop out contents.
While potatoes are baking, place cabbage, bacon and onion in saute pan.  Toss and  stir frequently until cabbage  and onion are soft, and bacon is cooked.  Bacon doesn't need to be browned.
To the pan, add the butter, potato, pepper, salt, milk and 1/2 cup of cheese.  Stir well, breaking up potato and mashing lightly.
When everything is blended well, and milk has been absorbed, remove from heat.  Pile into the potato skins.
Sprinkle remaining cheese over the tops.  Bake for 25 minutes at 350F.

Description: 
A marriage of Irish Colcannon and potato for a delicious version of the baked potato. It's a meal in itself or a side with meat.  This is definitely NOT a diet dish.
