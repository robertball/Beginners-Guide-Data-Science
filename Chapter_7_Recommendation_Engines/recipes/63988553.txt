Ingredients:
12 Ounces boneless skinless chicken breast
1/8 Cup soy flour
1 Teaspoon salt
1 Teaspoon pepper
1 Cup heavy cream
3 Tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 Cup chicken broth
1 Tablespoon fresh tarragon, chopped
1 medium lemon, cut into wedges

Directions:
Remove tenderloin from each breast. Cut each breast into 5 strips of approximately the same length as the tenderloin (about 4-5 inches). In a mixing bowl, combine soy flour, salt and pepper. Toss strips in mixture, tapping to remove any excess.
In a saucepan, boil cream until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. While cream is reducing, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Cook chicken strips in batches, about 3 minutes per side (do not crowd the pan). Transfer to a plate and keep warm.
Pour off excess fat in skillet. Add chicken broth and cook on high heat until reduced by half, scraping up browned bits with a wooden spoon. Add reduced cream and cook for another 3 minutes, until sauce thickens. Stir in tarragon and season with salt and pepper. Serve with lemon wedges.
