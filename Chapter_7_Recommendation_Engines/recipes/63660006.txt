Ingredients:
1-1/2 lbs Salon Filet
4 sprigs of dill
1 lemon, sliced
2 tablespoon lemon, juiced (fresh or bottled)
3 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon old bay seasoning
1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
Parchment paper

Directions:
1.  Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. Rinse salmon and pat dry.  Tear a piece of parchment paper long enough to fold over salmon the horizontal way.  Lay salmon on paper.  Place onto a baking sheet.
2. Sprinkle salmon with old bay seasoning, seasoned salt and pepper.  Lay dill across salmon, place lemon slices over the dill. Take butter and place sliced on top of lemon.  Holding the sides of the parchment paper up, pour the lemon juice over the salmon.  Fold the parchment paper vertically across the salmon, being careful not to let juices out.  Carefully fold it horizontally on under the fish.
3. Bake fish in oven until not longer raw in center.  About 15-20 minutes.  Remove and let cool.  Carefully open and discard lemon slices and dill.  Enjoy.
