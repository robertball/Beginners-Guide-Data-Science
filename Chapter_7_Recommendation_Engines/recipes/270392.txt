Ingredients:
6 large cloves garlic, peeled
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 (4 pound) boneless New Zealand leg of lamb, trimmed and tied
2 pounds small red potatoes, halved
6 large cloves garlic, unpeeled
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Combine peeled garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a food processor. Process until finely minced while pouring in the melted butter. Coat top and sides of lamb with the mixture. Allow to sit for 1 hour at room temperature.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Toss potatoes and unpeeled garlic together with olive oil. Place lamb in the center of a roasting pan; surround with potatoes and garlic.
Roast in the preheated oven for 75 to 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Let lamb rest for 20 minutes before slicing.
