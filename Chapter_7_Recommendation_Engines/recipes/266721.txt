Ingredients:
4 sweet potatoes
2 tablespoons butter
2 carrots, peeled and diced
2 ribs celery, chopped
1/2 large sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®), diced
2 cloves garlic, chopped
5 cups vegetable stock
1 1/3 cups light cream
1 (11 ounce) can creamed corn
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 tablespoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon red wine vinegar
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 (10 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Dice 1 1/2 sweet potatoes and roughly chop the remaining 2 1/2.
Place diced sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until barely tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.
Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium heat. Add carrots, celery, onion, and garlic; cook and stir 5 minutes. Add roughly chopped sweet potatoes and cook 10 minutes more.
Add vegetable stock to the stockpot with the vegetables and bring to a boil. Cook for 2 minutes and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook until sweet potatoes are fork-tender, 30 to 35 minutes.
Mix cream, 1/2 the creamed corn, brown sugar, coriander, red pepper flakes, soy sauce, vinegar, and ginger into the stockpot. Simmer soup for 5 minutes.
Puree soup using an immersion blender. Stir in remaining creamed corn, reserved boiled sweet potatoes, and whole kernel corn. Simmer soup 20 minutes more, stirring a few times. Remove from heat; season with salt and pepper.
