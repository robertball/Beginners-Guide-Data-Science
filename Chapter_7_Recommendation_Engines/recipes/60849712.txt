Ingredients:
1 serving of cooking spray
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 large egg
1 large egg white
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
2 TBS packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
3 TBS canola oil
1 tsp vanilla extract
6 TBS semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400. Coat muffin tins with cooking spray.
Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl and set aside.
Seperate the egg, placing the whites in a medium bowl and yolk in a large bowl. Set the whites aside. Add the brown sugar, applesauce, oil and vanilla to the yolk. Mix until well blended. Add the flour mixture and stir until well combined.
With an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the whites until soft peaks form. Add to the batter along with 1/4 cup of the chocolate chips. Stir until well blended.
Divide the batter equally amoung the 12 muffin tins. Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp of chocolate chips on the top of each muffin.
Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of one muffin comes clean, about 23 minutes. Cool 5 minutes in the tins then remove muffins to a rack to cool 10 minutes more.
