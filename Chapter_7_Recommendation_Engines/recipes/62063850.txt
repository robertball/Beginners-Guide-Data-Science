Ingredients:
*3 Tb olive oil
*3 pounds boneless beef pot roast (chuck arm, bottom round, eye round may be used. Trim any visible fat.)
*1 medium onion, chopped
*2 carrots, peeled and sliced
*3 cloves garlic, mashed
*1 cup dry red wine (Burgundy, Cabernet sauvignon, merlot are all fine)
*1- 8oz can tomato sauce
*1- large can diced tomatoes, drained, juice strained and reserved
*1 can beef consomme
*4 Tb flour
*1/2 tsp black pepper
*1 tsp dried basil
*1/2 tsp dried thyme leaves
*1 bay leaf
*1 pound mushrooms, roughly chopped

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven or large (4-5 qt) saucepan.
Brown the beef on all sides. Remove to a plate.
Add onion and carrot to pan. Stir, cooking until the onion is lightly browned and all the bits from the bottom are scraped up.
Add garlic, stir for another 2 minutes, taking care not to burn the garlic.
Add the red wine, and boost the heat to high. Boil vigorously until reduced by half. Reduce heat to medium.
Stir flour into consomme until smooth and free of lumps. Add to wine, stirring constantly until thickened.
Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 cup of reserved, strained tomato juice, spices.
Return meat to the pot. Stir in mushrooms. Set cover askew and regulate heat to cook at a light simmer for 2 hours.
Slice meat and serve over noodles, topped with gravy. May be sprinkled with grated Parmesan or Asiago for added flavor, if desired.
After step 6, remaining steps may be finished and remaining ingredients combined in a slow cooker instead of on top of the stove. Cook covered on low 6-8 hours. All steps except for cooking may be done up to 2 days in advance, then refrigerated and cooked at your convenience.
Leftovers last in refrigerator up to 4 days. Reheat thoroughly before serving. Also freezes very well.
