Ingredients:
1 lb Sausage (crumbled)
1 package (8 oz) refrigerated crescent rolls
1 cup frozen hash browns, thawed
1 cup (4 oz) shredded cheese
5 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In skillet, cook sausage until browned, drain and set aside.
Separate dough into eight triangles, arrange on non-greased 12 inch pizza pan (or pie plate) with points toward center.  Press over bottom and up sides to form crust, sealing perforations completely.
Spoon sausage over crust, sprinkle with potatoes.  Top with cheese; set aside.
Beat together eggs, milk, salt and pepper.  Pour over filling.  Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over all.
Bake at 375* for 25-30 minutes
