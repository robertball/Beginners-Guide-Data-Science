Ingredients:
Sauce
3 tbs EVOO
4 cloves garlic, chopped
2 fresno chilies, thinly sliced
1 small red onion, finely chopped
salt
1/2 cup dry sherry or dry vermouth
2 pints cherry tomatoes, large tomatoes halved and small tomatoes left whole

Directions:
For the sauce, heat the EVOO in a pot or skillet with a lid over medium to medium high heat.  Add the garlic, chilies and onions.  Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes.  Season with salt and stir in the sherry.  Cook until reduced by half.  Add the tomatoes and oregano, cover and cook until the whole tomatoes burst, 10 to 15 minutes.  Stir in the basil and parsley.  Remove from the heat.
Pasta.  Bring pot of water to a boil and season with salt.  Pat the seafood dry and sprinkle with salt, pepper and about 1 tsp seafood seasoning.  Heat the EVOO in a skillet over medium high heat.  Add the seafood and cook until opaque and firm or heated through for the crab or lobster.  Deglaze the pan with vermouth, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom.
Meanwhile, cook the linguine until al dente, then drain.
Toss the linguine with the sauce and fold in the seafood.
