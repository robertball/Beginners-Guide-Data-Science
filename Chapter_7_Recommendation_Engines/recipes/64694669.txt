1 cup cooked rice
1 (8 oz) container of sour cream
Salt and pepper to taste

(I’ve added all sorts of vegetables to this in the past, everything tastes pretty good all mixed up.  Also, you can increase the amount of soup or sour cream to get more “gravy”.  If you’re looking to sneak some more nutrients in there, you could always swap wild or brown rice for white.  The sky is the limit with how you want to alter this recipe!)
