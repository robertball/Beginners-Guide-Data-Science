Ingredients:
2 large chicken breasts
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning, or to taste
White Sauce:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
2/3 cup sour cream
1/4 cup half-and-half
2 tablespoons powdered Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon garlic, minced
crushed black pepper to taste
4 garlic naan breads
1 (4 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese, or to taste
Buffalo Sauce:
1/2 cup Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank'sÂ®)
1/3 cup melted butter
1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Season chicken with Cajun seasoning.
Grill chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink inside and juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes per side. Remove from grill, leaving grill on. Let chicken rest for 3 to 4 minutes, then cut into small pieces and set aside.
Combine cream cheese, sour cream, half-and-half, Parmesan cheese, rosemary, garlic, and black pepper in a mixing bowl. Spread white sauce evenly onto naan, then layer chicken and feta cheese on top. Refrigerate any leftover white sauce.
Combine Buffalo sauce, melted butter, tomato paste, smoked paprika, and nutmeg in a bowl. Drizzle Buffalo sauce on top of naan pizzas.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Heat pizzas on the hot grill until warmed through, about 5 minutes.
Transfer pizzas to the preheated broiler and finish cooking until golden brown on top, about 1 minute more.
