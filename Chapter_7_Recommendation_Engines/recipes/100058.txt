Ingredients:
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 cup beef broth
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup dry sherry
1/4 cup orange marmalade
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound beef sirloin steak, sliced thinly across the grain
1 tablespoon finely chopped orange zest
2 cloves garlic, minced
3/4 teaspoon ground ginger
3 green onions cut into 1-inch pieces

Directions:
Mix cornstarch, broth, soy, sherry, marmalade and pepper flakes.
Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. When wisps of smoke start to rise from the pan, stir-fry steak in 2 batches, cooking until well-browned, about 3 minutes per batch. Return steak to skillet; add orange zest, garlic and ginger; stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Pour broth mixture over beef and stir constantly to blend. Bring to a boil and cook until sauce thickens and flavors blend, about 2 minutes. Stir in green onions and serve hot.
