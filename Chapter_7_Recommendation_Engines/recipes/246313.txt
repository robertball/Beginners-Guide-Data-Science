Ingredients:
1 pound whole russet potatoes, peeled
3 tablespoons chicken stock
3 tablespoons champagne vinegar
3 tablespoons Sancerre or quality dry white wine
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon kosher salt, divided
1 tablespoon cracked black pepper, divided
1/2 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup green onions, chopped
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Place potatoes into boiling water and cook about 20 to 30 minutes depending on the size until they are cooked thoroughly.
Drain and cover to let stand until they are cool enough to handle.
Cut potatoes in half or quarter (depending on the size; smaller sizes will cook faster) and attempt to make them as uniform as possible.
Place in a bowl and add poultry stock and white wine, mix and let the liquid absorb into the potatoes.
In a separate bowl add garlic, vinegar, Dijon mustard, 1/2 the salt and pepper and mix well. Whisk in 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil into the mixture until dressing is emulsified.
Add vinaigrette to the potatoes and mix well.
Add green onions, parsley, dill, and basil and mix again.
Serve immediately or at room temperature.
