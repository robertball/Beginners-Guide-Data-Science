Ingredients:
cooking spray
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 ¼ cups crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
6 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
⅓ cup minced green onion (white part only)
3 cloves garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
12 slices thick-cut applewood-smoked bacon
toothpicks

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Cut a slit into the thick side of each chicken breast, about 3 inches long and 1 1/2 inches deep.
Mash Gorgonzola cheese, parsley, green onion, and garlic together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Stuff each chicken breast with 1/4 cup cheese mixture. Wrap 2 slices bacon around each chicken breast, securing bacon to the chicken with wooden toothpicks. Arrange stuffed chicken in the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
