Image:

Ingredients:
3 8oz. pkgs. cream cheese, softened
1 bunch green onions, chopped (use only the green part)
1 sm. can mushrooms, chopped (drain)
1 sm. can "diced" black olives, drained
1 jar dried beef, chopped
3 to 4 tsp. Accent seasoning

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together well.  An electric chopper works well to chop the dried beef and mushrooms but it's best to use a knife to chop the green onion.  Line 2 cereal bowls with large piece of plastic wrap and divide mixture equally into each bowl.  Gather up the extra plastic wrap and use to form each into a ball, cover and refrigerate overnight to let the flavors blend and "set" the balls.  Serve with vegetable flavored crackers or "Sociables" brand crackers.

Description: 
This is in response to Southerngirl5's request. I believe it is exactly what she is looking for.  Very simple and savory cream cheese ball that even people who don't like some of the specific ingredients (like me) love!  Serve with vegetable flavored crackers or Sociable crackers.
