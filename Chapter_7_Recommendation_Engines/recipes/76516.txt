Ingredients:
6 ounces macadamia nuts
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups soy flour

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the macadamia nuts into the container of a food processor, and blend until they reach a peanut butter like consistency. Scrape out into a bowl, and stir in the eggs and soy flour until well blended.
Place the dough between two pieces of waxed paper, and roll out into about a 12 inch circle. Remove the top piece of waxed paper, and invert the dough into a 9 inch pie plate. Press into the bottom and up the sides. Remove any overhanging dough.
Bake for 5 minutes in the preheated oven, or until light golden brown. Use in any recipe calling for a prebaked pie crust.
