Ingredients:
2 lbs Yukon Gold potatoes; cut into 1.5 inch chunks, rinsed well, and drained.
4 tablespoons unsalted butter; melted
2/3 cup whole milk; warmed
Salt
Black pepper
Heavy Cream

Directions:
If you don't mind peeling potatoes, you can do it beforehand, but since we're using a ricer, the skins come off very easily after cooking while using the ricer.
Add enough water to your double boiler to to just reach bottom of the insert. Turn heat to high and bring water to boil. Add potatoes, cover, and reduce heat to medium-high. Cook potatoes 10 minutes.
Transfer steamer insert to sink and rinse potatoes under cold water for 2 minutes. Return steamer insert and potatoes to pot, cover, and continue to cook until potatoes are soft and tip of paring knife inserted into potato meets no resistance, about 10 to 15 minutes longer.
Preheat oven to 400F.
Set ricer over large oven safe casserole dish. Rice potatoes in batches, removing skins after each press of the ricer.
Using spatula, stir in melted butter, then stir in warm milk until fully mixed - don't stir too vigorously. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Brush top of potatoes lightly with heavy cream.
Place potatoes in oven and bake until top is light golden brown, about 10 -15 mins.

Description: 
This recipe works best in a double boiler with steamer insert. For 2 lbs of potatoes you will need a 3 quart insert. Make sure your lid fits snugly. For a fluffy and light texture, use a potato ricer. My favorite potatoes to use are Yukon Gold.
