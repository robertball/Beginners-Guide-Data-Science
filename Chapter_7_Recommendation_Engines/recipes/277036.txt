Ingredients:
1 sweet potato, peeled
1 teaspoon butter
1/2 medium onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup chicken stock
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Place sweet potato into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until barely tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain. Let cool until safe to handle. Cut into medium pieces.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is translucent and slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add the sweet potato, cumin, ginger, black pepper, brown sugar, cinnamon, and red pepper flakes. Cook until flavors come together and sweet potato is soft, about 10 minutes.
Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth.
