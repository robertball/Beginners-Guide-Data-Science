Ingredients:
½ cup water
⅓ cup low-sodium chicken broth
¼ cup ketchup
¼ cup low-sodium soy sauce
¼ cup honey
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
2 teaspoons Sriracha sauce
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4  boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-size pieces
3 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons cornstarch

Directions:
Combine water, chicken broth, ketchup, soy sauce, honey, garlic, rice vinegar, Sriracha, sesame oil, ginger root, and red pepper flakes for sauce in a medium bowl.
Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, and stir-fry until chicken is opaque on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes.  Transfer chicken to a plate.
Reduce heat to medium and add the sauce to the wok. Whisk together water and cornstarch in a small bowl and add to the sauce, stirring constantly until the sauce starts to thicken, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chicken back to the wok, stir, and cook until reheated, about 2 minutes.

Description: 
This is a healthier version of honey-sesame chicken that's pan-fried instead of deep-fried--an easy, home-cooked meal that's salty, sweet, and a little bit spicy. It's a combination of flavors so deliciously right that you'll never think about Asian takeout again. Serve over rice or noodles, and garnish with sesame seeds and green onion slices.
