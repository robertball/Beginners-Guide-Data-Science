Ingredients:
1 eggplant, peeled and sliced lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices
salt as needed
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 pinch Italian seasoning, or to taste
1 (4 ounce) log goat cheese, softened
2 canned whole roasted red peppers, drained and diced

Directions:
Arrange eggplant slices on a large plate and sprinkle both sides with salt. Refrigerate until water has been drawn out, at least 30 minutes. Rinse eggplant slices and pat dry with a paper towel.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Lightly brush both sides of eggplant slices with olive oil and season with Italian seasoning.
Grill eggplant slices on the preheated grill, exactly 3 minutes per side. Spread goat cheese on 1 side of each eggplant slice and sprinkle with roasted red peppers. Serve open-faced or rolled up.
