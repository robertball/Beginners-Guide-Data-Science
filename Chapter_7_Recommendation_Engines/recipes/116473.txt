Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
3/4 cup milk
2/3 cup orange marmalade
1/4 cup vegetable oil
ICING:
1/4 cup orange marmalade
3 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
1 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, beat the eggs, milk, marmalade and oil. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.
Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups three-fourths full. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
In a small mixing bowl, beat the marmalade and cream cheese until fluffy. Stir in confectioners' sugar until smooth. Spread over cooled muffins. Store in the refrigerator.

This is simply my all-time favorite recipe! The sweet orange marmalade added to the icing and baked right into these golden muffins makes breakfast something to celebrate.
