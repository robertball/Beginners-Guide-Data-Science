Ingredients:
pie pumpkin
3 poblanos
1 spanish onion
1 carrot
1 celery rib
1 garlic clove
1tsp cumin
1 tsp coriander
1tsp cinnamon
2 tbs honey
1L stock or water
1 can coconut milk
1 tbs coconut oil

Directions:
PREP: Rough chop pumpkin and roast (on a parchment lined baking sheet) at 350º with a drizzle of honey, coconut oil, salt and pepper for 30 -45 mins. At the same time roast off the poblano peppers until the skin is charred on all sides. Place the peppers in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. The steam will loosen the skin and make it very easy to remove.  Rough chop all of the other ingredients. When the roasted peppers have cooled remove skin and seeds.
COOK: Sautée onions, garlic, carrot & celery in coconut oil until tender. Add spices, roasted pumpkin & poblanos, stock or water and allow everything to simmer for 10 minutes or so, then add coconut milk and puree soup with hand blender until smooth. Taste to check seasoning/ sweetness.
