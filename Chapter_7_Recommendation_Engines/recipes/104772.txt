Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, room temperature
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup white sugar
5 eggs
1 box moist pineapple cake mix
1 cup sour cream
1 cup evaporated milk
1 cup flour
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
Glaze
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
1 cup rum
1 cup toasted coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease a 12 cup Bundt pan with shortening, dust with flour, and shake out excess.  Place on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.
Cream together butter and oil in a large mixing bowl until fluffy, about 1 minute.  Slowly pour in 1 cup of sugar and continue to beat until fluffy, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Beat in eggs one at a time, beating for about 10 seconds per egg.  Stir in cake mix and blend until smooth.  Add the sour cream, evaporated milk, flour, and vanilla; beat together for 2 to 3 minutes until smooth.
Bake in preheated oven until cake has a golden brown crust and springs back when pressed with a finger, about 60 to 70 minutes.  Let cake sit in the pan for 20 minutes while proceeding to the next step.
Melt 1/2 cup of butter in a small pan over medium heat.  Stir in brown sugar, and 1/2 cup of sugar; bring to a gentle simmer and stir in the rum.  Cook until the sugars have dissolved, then remove from heat.  Unmold cake onto a serving dish.  Gently poke holes into the cake with a fork or cake tester.  Pour glaze evenly over cake.  Top with toasted coconut.
