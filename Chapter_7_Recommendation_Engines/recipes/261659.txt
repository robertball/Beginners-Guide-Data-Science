Image:
NA
Ingredients:
½ pound bacon, cut into thirds
2  onions, halved and thinly sliced
2  apples, peeled and thinly sliced
1 (9 ounce) package frozen cooked chicken breast strips, thawed
¼ cup jalapeno pepper jelly, or more to taste
½ teaspoon dried thyme
¼ teaspoon salt
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
¾ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon minced parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 8 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into smaller pieces. Reserve drippings in the skillet.
Cook onions and apples in the same skillet until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken strips, jalapeno jelly, thyme, and salt.
Unfold puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 9x10-inch rectangle. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
Spread chicken mixture over the pastry, leaving 1 inch around the edges. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese and black pepper. Press edges with a fork, forming a decorative border.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove and sprinkle with bacon. Continue baking until pastry is golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes more. Sprinkle with parsley.
