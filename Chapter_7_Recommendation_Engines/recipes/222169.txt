Ingredients:
1/4 cup diced carrot
1 jicama, peeled and diced
1 (10.5 ounce) can black beans
1/2 cup lemon juice
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 (3.5 ounce) can sliced jalapeno peppers
1/4 cup white vinegar
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup white rice
1 1/4 cups chicken broth
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives
2 green onions, minced
1/4 red bell pepper, seeded and diced
1/4 green bell pepper, seeded and diced
1/2 cucumber, seeded and diced
1/2 bunch chopped fresh parsley
1/4 bunch cilantro, chopped
1 teaspoon seasoned salt

Directions:
Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil; cook diced carrot in boiling water briefly, about 2 minutes. Drain immediately and plunge into a bowl of ice-cold water; drain.
Mix jicama, black beans, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper in a bowl; toss to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Stir blanched carrots, jalapeno peppers, vinegar, sugar, and salt together in a bowl; cover bowl with plastic wrap. Store both bowls in refrigerator 8 hours to overnight.
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir rice in hot oil until opaque, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour chicken broth over  rice; bring to a boil, cover the saucepan, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the liquid is absorbed completely, 20 to 25 minutes. Spread cooked rice onto a large platter and cool completely in refrigerator.
Stir chilled rice with jicama mixture and carrot mixture in a bowl; add black olives, green onions, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, cucumber, parsley, cilantro, and seasoned salt to the rice mixture and toss to combine.

Description: 
Tabbouleh-like composed salad fits in well at potlucks. This is the basic version. You may dress it up with a host of other goodies. Avocado and lime-marinated shrimp come to mind. Or grilled and chilled chicken breast. Of course if you do that it stops being a side dish and becomes a main course, but why not? The longer it's chilled the better.
