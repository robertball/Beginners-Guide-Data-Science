4 Cups Unsalted Beef Stock
1 12-oz beer (Newcastle)
1/4 cup Chili Powder
1 Tablespoon Cumin
2 Teaspoons Oregano
1 Tablespoon Salt
1/4 cup Brown Sugar
1/4 cup Apple Cider Vinegar
1 Tablespoon balsamic Vinegar
1 Teaspoon Coconut Aminos or Worcestershire Sauce
4 Teaspoons Beef Bouillon Granules (this is in original but I need to find a gluten free substitute)
Several Dashes Black Pepper

Directions:
Preheat a heavy skillet on high heat. While skillet is heating, cut chuckeye roast into 1/2" chunks. Throw on hot skillet and cook until browned. Drain fat and put browned roast into a large stock pot. (A crock pot isn't big enough). In the same hot skillet, brown the pork sausage and the ground beef. Drain off fat and place in large stockpot.
Cut bacon into 1/4" strips, fry and place into pot. Leave grease in pan and brown the ground turkey and lamb. Drain fat and add to pot as well.
Add remaining ingredients and mix well. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer 3 hours.
