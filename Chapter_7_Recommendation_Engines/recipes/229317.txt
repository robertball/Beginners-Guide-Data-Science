Ingredients:
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock
1 teaspoon dried summer savory
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/8 teaspoon chipotle chile powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1/4 cup sherry
2 carrots, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon butter
2 stalks celery, sliced
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 pound cubed cooked dark-meat turkey
1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine chicken stock, summer savory, basil, thyme, chipotle powder, salt, black pepper. parsley, and sherry in a stock pot; bring to a boil. Add carrots, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until carrots are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Melt butter in a skillet. Cook and stir celery, onion, and garlic in hot butter until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes; stir into stock mixture. Add turkey, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until turkey is hot and has flavored the soup, about 30 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain and add to soup. Season with salt and black pepper to serve.

Description: 
Make good use of your leftover dark meat without the fuss of boiling the carcass. Simply pick through the carcass before you toss the bird and save the meat for a quick next-day soup. Serve with warm bread for a great hot meal on a cold winter day. I substitute fresh herbs wherever possible, but for a quick meal after the intense preparation of a whole turkey, dried herbs do nicely. If you don't have chipotle chili powder, regular chili powder can be substituted. The chipotle provides a very light smoky flavor in the background. White meat can be used, but your broth will be less flavorful. Leftovers freeze well. Use whatever type pasta you prefer.
