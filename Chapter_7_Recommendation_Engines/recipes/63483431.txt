Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped
2 carrots, diced
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp dried oregano
1 bay leaf
1 tsp dried basil
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed tomatoes (optional)
2 cups dry lentils (vs 1lb) rinsed
8 cups water (2 cans 14.5 oz each vegetable broth + 4 cups water)
• 1/2 cup spinach, rinsed and thinly sliced
• 2 tablespoons vinegar
• salt to taste
• ground black pepper to taste
add ham, sausage, or kielbasa
1/2 cup uncooked pearl barley (optional)
optional: add 1 1/2 tsp basalmic vinager after finished and kale

Directions:
Crockpot: Mix all ingredients together in a slow cooker. Cover and cook on low heat setting 8-9 hours (may need extra 2 hours) or high heat for 3-5 hours or until lentils are tender. Stir well before serving. 8 servings.
Note: For the truly streamlined, empty-pantried folks: This recipe works just as well when you combine only the lentils, water equal to the amount of broth plus water, salt, and pepper.
In a large soup pot, heat oil over medium heat. Add onions, carrots, and celery; cook and stir until onion is tender. Stir in garlic, bay leaf, oregano, and basil; cook for 2 minutes.  Stir in lentils, and add water and tomatoes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for at least 1 hour. When ready to serve stir in spinach, and cook until it wilts. Stir in vinegar, and season to taste with salt and pepper, and more vinegar if desired.
