Ingredients:
2 cups seeded, grated summer squash
1/2 cup all-purpose baking mix (such as BisquickÂ®)
1/3 cup milk
1 egg
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon butter, melted
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch garlic and herb seasoning, or more to taste
1/3 cup oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Mix grated squash, baking mix, milk, egg, Parmesan cheese, butter, salt, pepper, and garlic-herb seasoning together in a large bowl.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Drop tablespoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil about 1 inch apart. Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes; flip and continue cooking until lightly browned on the second side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batter, adding oil to the skillet as needed.

A great way to use that summer excess of zucchini or yellow squash. Everyone loves these fritters, even kids. In the summer we have these at least once a week. They go well as a side with almost anything.
