Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) rib roast
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
1/4 cup sea salt
2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
Brush rib roast lightly with olive oil. Rub sea salt, black pepper, and garlic into the roast. Place fatty-side up on a rack set inside a shallow pan.
Roast in the preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and tent pan with aluminum foil. Continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the rib roast registers 140 degrees (60 degrees C), about 1 hour.
Let rib roast stand for 10 to 20 minutes before carving.
