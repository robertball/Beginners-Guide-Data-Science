Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie shell
5 cups apples - peeled, cored and sliced
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup rolled oats
3/4 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bake pastry shell for 10 min.
To Make Apple Filling: Place apples in a large bowl. In a separate bowl combine 1/4 cup flour, white sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and nutmeg. Mix well, then add to apples. Toss until apples are evenly coated.
Place apple mixture in pie shell and dot with 2 tablespoons butter or margarine. Lay a sheet of aluminum foil lightly on top of filling, but do not seal.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
While filling is baking, make Streusel Topping: In a medium bowl combine flour, cinnamon, brown sugar and oats. Mix thoroughly, then cut in softened butter until mixture is crumbly. Remove pie from oven and sprinkle streusel on top.
Reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake an additional 30 to 35 minutes with aluminum foil loosely on top until streusel is browned and apples are tender.
