Directions:
HEAT OVEN TO 350 DEGREES. SPRAY A LARGE BAKING PAN WITH PAM AND SEASON CHICKEN WITH SALT AND PEPPER.  BAKE CHICKEN FOR 30 MINUTES OR UNTIL JUICES RUN CLEAR.  SET ASIDE AND COOL.  WHEN COOL CUT INTO BITE SIDE PIECES. DISTRIBUTE CHICKEN EVENLY IN THE BOTTOM OF A 13 X 9 DEEP BAKING PAN SPRAYED WITH PAM.
COOK PASTA ACCORDING TO DIRECTIONS ON BOX. DO NOT OVERCOOK, SHOULD BE AL DENTE.  COOK BROOCLI IN BOILING WATER FOR 3 MINUTES BLANCHING IT.  DRAIN BROCCOLI IN WATER AND ICE BATH TO STOP THE COOKING PROCESS.  DRAIN AND SET ASIDE.
IN A LARGE POT, POUR IN OLIVE OIL. SAUTE ONIONS FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES ON MEDIUM HEAT.  ADD MUSHROOMS AND GARLIC AND COOK ANOTHER 7 MINUTES UNTIL MUSHROOMS ARE COOKED.  ADD WINE AND CHICKEN BROTH AND COOK DOWN FOR 5 MINUTES ON MEDIUM HEAT.  ADD WHIPPING CREAM, HALF & HALF, PESTO SAUCE, SUN DRIED TOMATOES AND BELL PEPPERS.  COOK ON MEDIUM TO LOW HEAT FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES, STIRRING OCCASIONALLY UNTIL SAUCE STARTS TO THICKEN. ADD SALT AND GARLIC PEPPER TO TASTE. TURN OFF HEAT AND ADD 1 CUP PARMESAN CHEESE AND MIX INTO SAUCE UNTIL CHEESE MELTS.  POOR SAUCE ON TOP OF CHICKEN.  MIX EVERYTHING TOGETHER UNTIL SAUCE IS DISTRIBUTED OVER EVERYTHING.  IF YOU ARE SERVING RIGHT AWAY, ADD BROCCOLI IN DISH AND SPRINKLE WITH REMAINING PARMESAN CHEESE AND FLAT LEAF PARSLEY.
IF YOU ARE COOKING IT AND SERVING ANOTHER DAY KEEP BROCCOLI IN A SEPARATE STORAGE BAG.  COVER AND STORE CHICKEN PASTA DISH IN REFRIGERATOR.  ON THE DAY YOU ARE SERVING, HEAT OVEN TO 350 AND COVER DISH WITH FOIL.  BAKE FOR 30 MINUTES.  REMOVED FROM OVEN AND MIX DISH UP.  ADD BROCCOLI AND BAKE IN THE OVEN UNTIL BUBBLING MAYBE ANOTHER 15 MINUTES.  REMOVE FROM OVEN ADD REMAINING 1/2 CUP OF PARMESAN CHEESE AND SPRINKLE WITH FLAT LEAF PARSLEY.
