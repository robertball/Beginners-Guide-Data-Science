Ingredients:
1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1-1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg
1/8 tsp. salt
1 egg
1/2 cup milk
1/3 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°
Grease muffin cups
In a mixing bowl, combine flour, the 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, nutmeg and salt.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
In another bowl, beat egg slightly; stir in milk and 1/3 cup melted butter.  Add egg mixture to flour mixture.  Stir just until moistened. Fill cups about two-thirds full with batter.  Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.
Meanwhile, in a shallow bowl, combine the 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon.  Immediately dip tops of hot muffins into the 1/4 cup melted butter, then into the cinnamon-sugar mixture until coated.
