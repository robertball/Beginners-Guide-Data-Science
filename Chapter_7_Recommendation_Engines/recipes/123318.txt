Ingredients:
1/3 cup water
1/3 cup butter
1 1/3 cups sugar, divided
2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent rolls
3 cups finely chopped peeled tart apples
1 teaspoon apple pie spice

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine water, butter and 1 cup sugar; cook over medium heat until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. Set aside.
Unroll crescent dough into one long rectangle; seal seams and perforations. Combine the apples, apple pie spice and remaining sugar; sprinkle over dough to within 1 in. of edges. Roll up, jelly-roll style, starting with a long side. Cut into 1-in. rolls; place in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan.
Pour reserved syrup over rolls. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
