Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa
1 3/4 cups water
1 teaspoon vegetable bouillon (such as Better Than Bouillon®)
1/2 cup salsa
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Rinse quinoa thoroughly in a mesh strainer. Add quinoa and water to a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Stir in vegetable bouillon. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Transfer cooked quinoa to a large bowl. Add salsa, nutritional yeast, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Toss to combine. Spread mixture on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; stir. Continue baking until quinoa is dry and crisp, 5 to 15 minutes more.
