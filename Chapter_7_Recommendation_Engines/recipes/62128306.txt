I drain my chicken reserving about a can of stock (I use my empty rotel can)
Add drained chicken to the mixture
Add salt and pepper to taste as well as cayenne pepper to taste.
To make the sauce a bit more creamy I add about 1/2 cup of milk.

Once the mixture comes to a boil lower heat and simmer for about 20 mins. Stirring occasionally.
