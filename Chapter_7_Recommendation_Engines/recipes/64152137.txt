3 tablespoons instant coffee powder
2 tablespoons vanilla
2 1/4 cups sugar
1 1/4 cup flour, divided
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
Preheat oven 350. Grease and flour 13x18x1.4 inch pan.
Melt together butter, chocolate chips and unsweetened chocolate in double boiler.  Cool slightly.  In separate large bowl, stir eggs, coffee vanilla and sugar.  Stir in warm chocolate mixture and cool to room temperature.
In another bowl, stir flour, baking powder and salt.  Add to chocolate mixture. Pour into prepared pan.
Bake for 30 minutes.  Halfway through baking, rap pan against the oven shelf to allow air to escape from between the pan and the brownie dough.  Do not overbake.  Cool and cut into squares.
