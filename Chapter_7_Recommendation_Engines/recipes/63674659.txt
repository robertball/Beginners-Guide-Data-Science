Chili from Scratch Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
3 TBSP vegetable oil
1 lb turkey or lean ground beef (not a combination)
Salt and freshly ground pepper
1 large onion, chopped
1 TBSP minced garlic
2 tsp chili powder
1 tsp ground cumin
1 TBSP chopped fresh oregano leaves or 1 tsp dried
2 cups chopped tomatoes (diced canned are fine; don't bother to drain)
1 or 2 fresh or dried hot chilies, seeded and minced
2 (15-ounce) cans pinto or kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves for garnish

Directions:
Put oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. When it's hot, add ground meat and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Adjust the heat so it sizzles steadily, and cook, stirring occasionally to break it up until the meat brown all over (5-10 minutes).
Add onion, and cook, stirring once in a while, until it softens and turns golden (3-5 minutes). Add garlic, chili powder, cumin, and oregano, and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture becomes fragrant (another minute).
Add tomatoes, chili, and beans to the pot, along with enough water to cover everything by 2-3 inches. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat so the mixture bubbles steadily, but not furiously, and cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, until everything thickens (20 minutes or so).
Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally and adding water if pot looks too dry, until beans are tender but still intact. When beans are tender, taste, adjust seasoning, and serve, garnished with cilantro.
