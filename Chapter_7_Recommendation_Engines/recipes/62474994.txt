Ingredients:
3-4 qt. pan of boiling water
4 yellow, red, orange or green peppers, cut in half lengthwise to make 8 pepper boats
1/2 chopped onion (1/4 cup)
2 cloves fresh pressed or minced garlic cloves
8 oz. hot sausage
1 large fresh heirloom tomato
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 cup beef broth or water
8 oz. smoked mozzarella, shredded
8 oz. sharp cheddar cheese

Directions:
Boil 4 quarts of water. Cut peppers in half, lengthwise, cut out all stems, seeds and membranes and submerge fully in boiling water for 5-7 minutes. They will be al dente. Do not overcook. Drain, cool and let dry in paper towels, flesh side down.
Salt lightly with kosher salt on flesh side and arrange in close fitting baking pan, like CorningWare or Pyrex.
In the meantime, in a fry pan, sautee onion and fresh garlic until fragrant brown and translucent.
Add hot sausage and brown just until barely done, separating with fork only until crumbly.
Add fresh tomato, spices and broth/water. Put lid on and cook on low heat for 10 minutes. Add more broth or water as needed on very low heat.
Spread a little shredded mozzarella cheese in bottom of pepper boats arranged in baking pan. Add meat mixture to fill, then top with more mozzarella cheese, with a topping of cheddar as wanted for more flavor.
Put in refrigerator for 1/2 hour or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 and bake for 30-45 minutes.
Enjoy with plain rice or greens.
