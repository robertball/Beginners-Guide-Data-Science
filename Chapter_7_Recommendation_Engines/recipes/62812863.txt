Ingredients:
1 –  1 1/2 pounds chicken breast, sliced very thinly
Marinade:
1 Tb soy sauce
1 1/2 tsp cornstarch
Sauce:
2 Tb oyster sauce
2 tsp soy sauce
4 Tb beef broth
1 Tb granulated sugar
8 ounces linguine, prepared to al dente
1 tsp sesame oil
1/4 cup canola oil
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 large carrot, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
1/2 cup chopped cabbage, such as Napa
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1-2 cups bean sprouts
3 green onions, sliced in 1 inch segments, white and green parts
*note: I like to chop up the white parts small and leave the green parts in longer pieces

Directions:
Combine marinade ingredients with the chicken and allow to sit for 20 minutes.  While the chicken is marinating, prepare the remaining ingredients.
In a small bowl, combine the oyster sauce, soy sauce, beef broth, and sugar. Set aside.
Boil noodles as per package instructions.  Drain the noodles and toss with the sesame oil.
Heat a wok (or large, deep frying pan) over medium-highheat. Add the 1/4 cup of oil. Add the chicken. Stir fry chicken until cooked – about 5 minutes.  Remove from wok and set aside.
Add another 1 Tb of oil to the wok if needed. When the oil is hot, add the garlic. Stir-fry until garlic browns, then add the carrots. Stir-fry for about 1 minute, then add the shredded cabbage and mushrooms.  Cook for 2 more minutes. Add the noodles, bean sprouts, and green onions and cook for about 2 more minutes.
Add the sauce to the wok. Return the chicken to the pan. Mix everything together and serve hot.
