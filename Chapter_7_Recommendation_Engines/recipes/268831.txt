Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package rigatoni pasta
6 slices leftover beef meatloaf, or to taste
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese (such as Polly-O)
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (28 ounce) jar marinara sauce
1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes.
While rigatoni is cooking, coarsely chop meatloaf. Mix ricotta cheese, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper in a bowl.
Drain rigatoni and return to the pot. Add meatloaf, ricotta cheese mixture, remaining Parmesan cheese, marinara sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Mix well and spread in a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella cheese on top; continue baking until melted, about 5 minutes more.
