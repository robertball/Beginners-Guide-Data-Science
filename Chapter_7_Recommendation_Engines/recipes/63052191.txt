Ingredients:
For the crust:
1 c. a/p flour
1/8 tsp. salt
1/2 c. confectioner's sugar
1 stick unsalted butter, melted, but not hot.
For filling:
2 lg. eggs
3/4 c. sugar
1 1/2 Tbs. a/p flour
9 Tbs. lemon juice or the juice of 3 lemons
1 Tbs. finely grated lemon zest

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Spray an 8x8" baking pan with cooking spray. Fit an 8x16" piece of heavy-duty foil across the bottom of the pan and up the 2 sides as foil overhangs to pull bars from the pan. Spray foil with vegetable cooking spray.
Mix flour, salt, confectioner's sugar in a medium bowl; stir in butter to form dough. Press dough into pan bottom (the bottom of a measuring cup dipped in flour helps). Bake until pale golden, about 20 minutes.
While pastry bakes, whisk eggs, sugar, flour, lemon juice and zest in a medium bowl.
Remove pan from oven. Add lemon mixture and continue to bake until just set, about 20 minutes longer; let cool in pan for a few minutes and then using foil handles, pull bars from pan and set on a wire rack. Cool until room temperature. Cut into squares and serve.

Description: 
I got this recipe from one of the inserts in the Sunday paper last spring. After I read their claim to these being the best lemon bars ever, I had to give them a try & they WERE!!  I added extra lemon juice & zest to make them as tart as I like them, but otherwise they are incredible!
