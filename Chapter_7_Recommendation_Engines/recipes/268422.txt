Ingredients:
Quick Pickles:
1/2 cup rice vinegar
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons raw cane sugar
1 teaspoon sriracha sauce
1 small cucumber, thinly sliced
1/2 small red onion, sliced into petals
Bulgogi:
1 pound lean ground beef
2/3 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 green onions, chopped
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce
1 teaspoon garlic puree
1 teaspoon ginger paste
6 sesame seed burger buns

Directions:
Bring rice vinegar, water, sugar, and sriracha to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes. Place cucumber and red onion in a flat-bottomed dish and pour vinegar mixture over the top. Set aside to pickle as you prepare the bulgogi.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain and discard grease; return beef to skillet. Add soy sauce, brown sugar, green onions, sesame oil, sriracha, garlic, and ginger. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce begins to thicken, about 8 minutes.
Serve bulgogi mixture on hamburger buns topped with the pickled cucumbers and onions.
