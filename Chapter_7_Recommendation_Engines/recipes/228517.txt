Ingredients:
1 egg
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 1/4 cups milk
1/4 cup heavy cream
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed

Directions:
Whisk egg with 3 tablespoons melted butter, vanilla extract, and 1 tablespoon white sugar in a bowl until thoroughly combined; whisk in milk and cream. Sift flour with baking powder and salt in a separate bowl; stir flour mixture into liquid ingredients to make a smooth batter.
Stir 1/4 cup white sugar with brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.
Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Scoop up about 3 tablespoons of batter and pour into skillet. Sprinkle top of pancake with about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon sugar in an even layer; cook pancake until bottom is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancake over onto sugared side and cook until the cinnamon sugar melts into a crust, about 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter and cinnamon sugar. Let pancakes cool without stacking to avoid softening the sugar crust.

Description: 
My girlfriend's love of pancakes and creme brulee ice cream made me decide to try and combine the two. The crunchy sugar crust is a nice addition to the traditional pancake. These pancakes are light, fluffy, and so rich and sweet they don't need syrup.
