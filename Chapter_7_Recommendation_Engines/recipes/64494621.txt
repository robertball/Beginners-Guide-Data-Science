Ingredients:
1 pizza crust in a can (such as pillsbury)
1 box (21 oz) frozen beef sandwich steaks
1 small onion, diced
1 garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon Worscheshire sauce
1/2 pound America cheese, sliced thin
Salt and pepper to taste
*can  add mushrooms & diced bell peppers

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.
Spray a medium skillet with cooking spray.
Break up the sandwich steaks into pieces and add to skillet. (I break them up by hand one at a time. I add them to the skillet as I break them).
Stir steaks and continue to cook until golden brown about 5-7 minutes. Drain all of the grease. Add Worscheshire sauce, onion, garlic, pepper and salt.
Roll out pizza dough onto a flat surface. Stretch the dough into a 12x12 rectangle  (does not matter if it tears a little).  Once dough is stretched, add a thin layer of meat to one end leaving a 1" border on the sides, break 4-5 pieces of American cheese in half  and place them on top of the layer of meat. Carefully roll the dough, meat & cheese over while pinching the sides. Add another layer of meat mixture, cheese then rol. Continue until all meat is used up. Seal top. Transfer to an  ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until top is golden brown.
Allow to cool for 5 minutes. Cut into 1" slices.
Serve with condiment of choice.

My husband loves cheesesteaks and Stromboli. I make this often as an appetizer or for a quick dinner in a busy night served along with soup.
