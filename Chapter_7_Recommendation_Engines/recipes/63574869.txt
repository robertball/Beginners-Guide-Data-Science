Ingredients:
Tbs (60 ml) butter
1/2 lb (250 g) mushrooms -- sliced
6 oz (170 g) dried chipped beef
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1 Tbs (15 ml) Worcestershire sauce
1 recipe cream sauce (see below)
4 to 8 slices toasted white bread
Cream Sauce
6 Tbs (90 ml) butter
6 Tbs (90 ml) flour
1 cup (250 ml) beef or chicken broth -- or milk 1 cup (250 ml) heavy cream
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
A grating of fresh nutmeg

Directions:
Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over moderate heat. Add the mushrooms and saute for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the chipped beef and Worcestershire sauce and stir to combine.
Remove from the heat. Taste for seasoning with salt and pepper - the chipped beef may already be salty enough. Combine with the cream sauce and spoon over toasted white bread.
