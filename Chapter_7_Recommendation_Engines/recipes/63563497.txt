Ingredients:
1/2 c. red wine vinegar
1/2 c. sugar or honey
1-2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped (really, thatâ€™s pretty optional; it all goes in the blender)
1 tsp. Kosher salt
1 tsp. coarsely ground black pepper
1/2 c. canola oil

Directions:
In a blender, combine vinegar, honey, garlic, salt, and pepper. Place lid on blender and blend on high. While blender is running, add oil in a steady stream. Store in refrigerator for about 2-3 weeks. Shake well before serving.
