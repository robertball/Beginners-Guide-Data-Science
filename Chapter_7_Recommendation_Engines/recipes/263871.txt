Ingredients:
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
2/3 cup lukewarm water, divided, or as needed
2 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
3 eggs
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Heat a Dutch oven with the lid on in the oven.
Combine yeast and 1/3 cup lukewarm water in a large bowl; whisk until fully dissolved. Let stand for 10 minutes.
Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; mix well. Add flour mixture to yeast mixture; whisk until flour is absorbed.
Whisk remaining 1/3 cup water, eggs, olive oil, and vinegar in a separate bowl. Add to flour mixture and whisk well until fully combined and a soft dough is formed. Cover dough with plastic wrap and let rise for 45 minutes.
Spoon dough into the center a large piece of parchment paper. Smooth out loaf with an offset spatula; sprinkle top with gluten-free flour.
Place loaf with parchment paper inside the hot Dutch oven; cover with the lid and place in the oven.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 45 minutes. Remove bread with a spatula and transfer to a wire rack.
