Ingredients:
1 cup cooked quinoa
1 can White or Navy beans, drained
1 bag frozen mixed grilled vegetables (one with zucchini, potatoes, and peppers preferred), thawed and pre-cooked

Directions:
Mix together all listed ingredients. Add salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste (one teaspoon of garlic powder sprinkled over mixture then blended is ideal). Mash coarsely or pulse for a few seconds in a mixer (try to leave it slightly chunky if you can). Chill overnight.
Use a flat griddle or large frying pan to cook mixture. Heat your preferred cooking oil at 300 degrees. Add, one dollop at a time, the mixture to the oil, spreading out as if a thick pancake. As mixture browns, fold mixture in upon itself, then flatten out again to brown bottom once more. Remove vegetable hash pattie from heat to another plate and start cooking next one, repeating process until all mixture is used.
