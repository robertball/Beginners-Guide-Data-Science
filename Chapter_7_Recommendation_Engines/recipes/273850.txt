Ingredients:
⅔ cup mayonnaise
2 teaspoons dry mustard
2 teaspoons onion flakes
1 cup butter cracker crumbs
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
½ pound chicken tenders

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Combine mayonnaise, dry mustard, and onion flakes in a shallow bowl; mix well. Combine cracker crumbs and sesame seeds in a resealable plastic bag.
Dip each chicken tender into the mayonnaise mixture, then place in the plastic bag. Seal the bag and shake until chicken is coated in the crumb mixture. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
I am always asked to make these baked chicken tenders when we're invited out! This can be used as a main dish or an appetizer, so the serving size can vary. Add your favorite sauce. It is a great finger food!
