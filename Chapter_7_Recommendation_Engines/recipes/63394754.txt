Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 Tbsp. granulated sugar
1 tsp. kosher salt
6 Tbsp. (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
6 Tbsp. vegetable shortening, chilled, cut into small pieces
4 to 8 Tbsp. ice water

Directions:
1) In large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar and salt.  Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, work the butter and shortening into the four mixture until the mixture resembles course crumbs.  Sprinkle with 4 Tbsp. water, 1 Tbsp. at a time, until the dough is crumbly, but holds together when squeezed (if necessary, add additional ice water, 1 tsp. at a time).
2)  Divide the dough in half.  Transfer each piece to a piece of plastic wrap and shape into a 1-inch thick disk.  Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.
Tip:  The dough can be frozen up to 1 month and defrosted overnight in the refrigerator before using.
