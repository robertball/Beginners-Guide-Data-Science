Ingredients:
1 cup oat bran
1 cup dried figs, chopped
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup chopped cashews
2 tablespoons almond flour
2 tablespoons coconut flour
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted and cooled
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine oat bran, figs, walnuts, cashews, almond flour, coconut flour, cinnamon, and allspice in a bowl, making sure that figs do not clump together.
Beat eggs in a separate bowl until thoroughly blended. Mix in coconut oil and vanilla extract.
Pour egg mixture over oat bran mixture; mix until dough comes together.
Measure dough into 1 1/2-inch balls with an ice cream scoop and flatten with a spoon to about 1/4-inch diameter.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
I love these cookies! Not too sweet. Perfect snack for someone who has to watch their sugar intake as no sugars are added other than the dried fruit.
