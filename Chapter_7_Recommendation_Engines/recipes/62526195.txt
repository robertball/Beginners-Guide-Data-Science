Ingredients:
1 cup butter or margarine
1 pound light brown sugar
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 cup light corn syrup
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
In a heavy bottomed large saucepan over medium heat, combine the butter, brown sugar, sweetened condensed milk, corn syrup and salt. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Heat to between 250 degrees F. Cook for 2 minutes at that temperature. Remove from the heat and stir in vanilla.
Meanwhile, butter a 9x13 inch baking pan or line with parchment paper. When the caramel is ready, pour into the prepared pan. Sprinkle top lightly with kosher salt or fleur de sal.  Allow to cool completely at room temperature. Remove from the pan and cut into squares using scissors. Wrap individual pieces in waxed paper or cellophane.
