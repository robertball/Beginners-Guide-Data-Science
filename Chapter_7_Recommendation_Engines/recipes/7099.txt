Ingredients:
4 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1/4 cup white sugar
3 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
2 teaspoons salt
11 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
6 tablespoons margarine
1 tablespoon cornmeal
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1 1/2 cups warm water.  Let stand 5 to 6 minutes, until mixture is foamy.
In a large bowl, mix together half the flour, remaining water, garlic powder, salt, oregano, and margarine. Add yeast mixture, and stir to combine.  Work in remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time until a soft dough forms.
Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface, and knead for 10 minutes.  Put dough in large plastic bag, and place in refrigerator. Let rise until tripled in bulk.
For a round pizza, break off about 2 cups of the dough. Grease a 15 inch round pan, and sprinkle lightly with corn meal.  Roll out the dough to fit the pan, stretching it to fit.  Brush crust with olive oil, and sprinkle with cheese.  Add desired toppings.
Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 18 to 20 minutes.
