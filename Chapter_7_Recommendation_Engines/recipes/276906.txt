Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup pumpkin puree
1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1/2 cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt
2 eggs, at room temperature
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/3 cup dark cocoa powder (such as Hershey'sÂ® Special Dark), sifted
1/2 cup dark chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
Whisk together whole wheat flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, cloves, nutmeg, allspice, and salt in a bowl until thoroughly combined.
Whisk together pumpkin puree, maple syrup, yogurt, eggs, and melted butter in a second bowl until thoroughly combined and no lumps remain. Stir 1/2 of the flour mixture into the pumpkin mixture until just combined. Mix in the other 1/2 of the flour mixture and stir until just combined, making sure to not overmix.
Divide batter evenly between 2 bowls. Whisk cocoa powder into one bowl until just combined. Fold chocolate chips into the other bowl. (Both batters will be somewhat thick.)
Spoon about 1 tablespoon pumpkin batter and 1 tablespoon chocolate batter into each muffin cup. Continue filling muffin cups, alternating between both batters, until each cup is approximately 3/4 full. Make 2 or 3 swirls in the batter of each muffin with a bamboo skewer or butter knife, holding the muffin liner in place as you swirl. (The chocolate chips may make it difficult but just swirl around them.)
Place muffins into the preheated oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the muffins comes out with a few moist crumbs, 19 to 23 minutes. Do not overbake.
Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
