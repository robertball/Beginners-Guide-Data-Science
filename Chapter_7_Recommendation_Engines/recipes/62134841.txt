Description: 
This is the BEST meatloaf you have ever wrapped your lips around! Using sausage along with the hamburger gives the meatloaf great flavor as well as keeping it moist. Using crushed saltine crackers as a binder keeps this meatloaf holding together without giving it that gelatinous texture so many meatloafs suffer from. The flavor bursting from this meatloaf means no bar-b-que sauce or ketchup is required to jazz it up!
