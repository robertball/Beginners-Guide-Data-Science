Ingredients:
2 cups Raw Cranberries
1 cup Apple Juice
1 cup Brown Sugar
2 Tablespoons Cointreau
1 stick Cinnamon
3 dashes Sea Salt
1 whole Orange (juice & zest)

Directions:
Pour everything except the orange into a medium-large pot. Cut the orange in half. Squeeze the juice of both halves into the pot. Using a grater, zest the outside of the orange and sprinkle it into the pot as well.
Bring all the ingredients to a boil, then simmer on low for around 30 minutes. You will know the jelly is done when you start to see the bottom of the pot as you stir.
Serve it on toast or crackers, or lighten up on the sugar a bit and serve it as a sauce. You might want to double the recipe when having company. It will go fast.
