Ingredients:
5 large skinless, boneless chicken breast, halved lengthwise
¾ cup vegetable oil, divided
¼ cup white vinegar
2 tablespoons salt, divided
1 tablespoon garlic powder, divided
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper, divided
¾ cup all-purpose flour
½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Mix chicken, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, vinegar, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap; place in the refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pour remaining 1/2 cup vegetable oil into a shallow baking pan; place in the preheating oven for 20 minutes.
Mix remaining 1 tablespoon salt, 1 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and flour together in a shallow bowl. Spread out evenly in the bowl.
Remove baking pan from the oven. Dredge chicken in the flour mixture, one piece at a time, and gently place into the hot oil.
Bake chicken in the preheated oven, turning once halfway through, until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
Top chicken with Cheddar cheese and chives.
