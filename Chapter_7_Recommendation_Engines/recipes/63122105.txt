Ingredients:
1/3 cup whole milk
1 teaspoon cider vinegar (no lemon juice on hand)
1 3/4 cups gluten free all purpose flour (bob's redmill)
2 teaspoons Xantham Gum
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1/4 C brown sugar + 1/4 C Blue Agave
3 ripe bananas, mashed
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan or 16 muffin cups with cooking spray. Stir the skim milk and lemon juice together in a glass measuring cup; let stand until curdled, about 30 minutes.
Whisk together the gluten free flour, Xantham Gum, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt; set aside.
Beat the eggs and sugar together with an electric mixer until smooth. Mix in the mashed bananas, the milk mixture, canola oil, and vanilla extract. Stir in the flour mixture just until all ingredients are moistened.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan or muffin cups. cover the tops with crushed pecans and chocolate sprinkles.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour for a loaf(cover with tin foil first 30 min), or 30 minutes for muffins. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
