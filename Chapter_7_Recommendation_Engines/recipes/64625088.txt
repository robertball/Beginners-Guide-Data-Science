Ingredients:
2 large chicken breasts
1 or 2 jars fra diavolo tomato sauce (I used a 25oz jar of "Simply Enjoy" brand fra diavolo)
Bite-sized pieces of carrots, mushrooms, and/or peppers (OPTIONAL)
Pasta (OPTIONAL - penne or rigatoni might be easier to eat with the shredded chicken pieces)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
In a Dutch oven, pour in a little sauce to cover the bottom.  Lay chicken breasts in sauce and then add vegetables (I added the vegetables off to the side to make it easier to shred the chicken later).  Pour in remaining sauce.  Cook for 2 hours.
Remove from oven.  Shred chicken with two forks and ensure that it is cooked through.  It should fall apart very easily.  Mix everything together and cook for another 10 minutes.
Serve over pasta, if desired.

Also, the sauce I used was VERY spicy directly out of the jar, but the final product after cooking wasn't spicy at all.  I would recommend using a sauce that isn't super sweet because t
