Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, diced
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
⅓ large sweet onion, sliced
⅓  green bell pepper, sliced
⅓  red bell pepper, sliced
⅓  yellow bell pepper, sliced
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as <sup>&reg;</sup>O*TEL(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 (10 ounce) package frozen cauliflower rice
1 cup shredded mild Cheddar cheese
½  avocado, diced
2 tablespoons salsa
2 tablespoons sour cream

Directions:
Grease a grill pan with cooking spray. Season chicken with salt and pepper; place in the prepared pan. Cook and stir over medium heat until chicken is no longer pink, about 7 minutes.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and bell pepper slices; saute until slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Mix in diced tomatoes and cooked chicken. Cook until liquid is mostly evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes.
Microwave cauliflower rice following package instructions for 5 minutes. Let stand for 1 minute.
Carefully open the package of cauliflower rice and divide between 2 bowls. Divide the chicken and vegetable mixture evenly between the bowls. Top with Cheddar cheese, avocado, salsa, and sour cream.
