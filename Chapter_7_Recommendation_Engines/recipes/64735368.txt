Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 medium onion
2 cans Brooks Chili Mild Beans
2 pkg. Brooks Secret Chili Seasoning - Mild
2 cans Brooks Just for Chili Mild Diced Tomatoes  - You can substitute Brooks Just for Chili Mild Tomato Sauce.

Directions:
1.  Dice the onion and place in skillet.  If you want to offer the chopped onion as a condiment, you can do this later.
2.  Cook the ground beef and onion (optional) in skillet.  Drain excess fat.
3.  Put the crock-pot liner in the crock-pot.  Add all ingredients and mix well.
4.  Don't add the water called for on the chili seasoning package unless you like chili with more liquid.  The steam the crock-pot makes and the liquid from the other ingredients will help make the chili the right consistency.
5.  Cook for 6 hours on low (preferred) or for 4 hours on high.  Serve with shredded cheese, crackers, and cooked macaroni elbows.

Description: 
This easy-to-make chili recipe is tasty and filling. If you like a spicier chili, purchase the hot variety of the Brooks products. You can increase the recipe easily by adding one more of each ingredient. Be sure to use a crock pot liner so it doesn't stain.
