Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package jumbo pasta shells
2 eggs, beaten
1 (32 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
8 ounces grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 pkg. frozen, chopped spinach, drained and excess water squeezed out
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (28 ounce) jar pasta sauce
8 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms
1 lb sweet Italian sausage (4 links, casings removed)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Cook sausage until no longer pink. Drain on paper towel, and set aside.
Melt 1 tbsp of butter over med-low heat. Add mushrooms and sautee until tender. 5 minutes. Set aside.
In a large bowl, mix eggs, ricotta, half the mozzarella, half the Parmesan, parsley, spinach, salt and pepper until well combined.  Stuff cooked shells with ricotta mixture and place in a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a medium bowl, stir together pasta sauce, mushrooms and sausage. Pour over stuffed shells. Top with remaining mozzarella and parmesan. Cover with foil, being careful that it doesn't touch the cheese.
Bake in preheated oven 45 minutes. Uncover and bake an additional 15 minutes, or until edges are bubbly and shells are slightly set.
