Ingredients:
2 heads of fresh broccoli
1 16 oz. bottle Kraft Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing and Marinade (no substitute-use this one!)
1 1-gal. sealable plastic bag

Directions:
Wash broccoli. Cut off florettes large enough to grill but not too large. Place in sealable bag and add the entire bottle of dressing (using this specific dressing is key!)  Preferably marinate all day turning bag occasionally if possible.  If you decide to make this last minute, I give the bag to my kids to squish the dressing gently down into the florets.
Grill broccoli to your preference.  I like to use a high heat, sear until there are brown grill marks so that they are still a bit crunchy.
