Ingredients:
Marinade:
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon grapeseed oil
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon granulated onion
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard powder
1 pinch ground cinnamon
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, butterflied
1/2 lime, juiced

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, grapeseed oil, cumin, paprika, garlic, thyme, pepper, oregano, granulated onion, coriander, turmeric, mustard powder, and cinnamon in a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) and lightly oil the grate.
Add lime juice to the marinade mixture while the grill is heating up.
Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, turning once, 7 to 8 minutes total.

Description: 
Plan ahead, this chicken marinates for 8 to 24 hours. I add the lime juice 30 minutes before grilling. To make this even quicker, grab the Bajan seasoning by Savory Spice ShopÂ® and just use 1 tablespoon in place of the seasoning below.
