Ingredients:
Sausage Gravy:
6 ounces FarmlandÂ® Original Pork Sausage Roll
1/4 cup yellow onion, minced
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup milk
2 cups chicken stock
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound fingerling potatoes, cooked, slightly smashed
2 cups cheese curds
2 teaspoons chives, chopped
1/2 cup pickled peppers

Directions:
Sausage Gravy: In medium saute pan, cook sausage until rendered and well browned. Remove and reserve.
Add onions and cook for 5 minutes, or until translucent.
Add butter until melted; then whisk in flour. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add milk and chicken stock, whisking thoroughly. Add in reserved sausage. Cook over medium heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add more liquid if necessary to thin. Season to taste.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Heat vegetable oil in an oven-safe skillet over high heat. Add smashed fingerling potatoes and cook until crispy and well browned, about 5 minutes per side.
Top potatoes with sausage gravy and cheese curds. Bake until warmed through and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.
Garnish with chives and pickled peppers.
