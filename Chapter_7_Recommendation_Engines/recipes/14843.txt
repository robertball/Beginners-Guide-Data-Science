Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
⅔ cup butter, softened
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon baking soda
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach
2 tablespoons butter
2 ½ cups chopped mushrooms
1 cup chopped onion
½ teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon lemon juice
⅛ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat together cream cheese and 2/3 cup butter.  Mix in 2 cups flour, a teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda; beat well.  Divide dough into two balls; wrap in plastic wrap.  Chill 30 to 60 minutes or until pastry is easy to handle.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat spinach in large frying pan over medium-low heat; drain.  Squeeze out excess liquid; set aside.
In a large frying pan, melt the 2 tablespoons butter.  Stir in mushrooms and onion.  Cook and stir over medium heat for 3 minutes or until onion is tender.  Mix in spinach, remaining 1 tablespoon flour, oregano, salt, lemon juice and garlic powder.  Cook and stir until mixture thickens.  Stir in Parmesan cheese.  Set aside to cool.
On floured surface, roll a pastry ball into a 12x7-inch rectangle.  Spread with half the spinach mixture to within 1/2 inch of edges.  Starting with a short side, roll up dough and filling, jelly-roll style.  Moisten edges with water; pinch to seal.  Repeat with remaining pastry.  Cover; chill 1 hour. Slice logs into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Place on ungreased baking sheets.
Bake 20 minutes or until golden.  Remove to wire racks; cool.
