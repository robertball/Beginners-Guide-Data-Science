Description: 
I took my mom's childhood Candied Yam Recipe and added a layer of caramel.  It is now a must at every Thanksgiving & Christmas and is often requested with much anticipation by anyone who has had it.  One recipe will serve 6, but barely, I promise there wont be leftovers.  If your going to feed 6 or more I suggest doubling the recipe in a 9x13 pan.
