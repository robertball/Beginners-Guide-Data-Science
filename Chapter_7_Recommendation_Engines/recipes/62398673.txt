Texas Southern Peach Cobbler Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
•1/2 cup butter (1 stick)REAL BUTTER IS BEST
•1 cup all-purpose flour
•1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder
•1/2 teaspoon salt
•1 cup sugar
•1 cup milk
•3 cups peeled and sliced fresh peaches and juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F.
First let me start by saying it is always better to use ripe fresh peaches. I am not going to say use canned peaches because that is not my recipe but, I am sure it would be okay. To skin the peaches I drop them in boiling water after cutting an X at the bottom of each peach. The skins should peel off easier.
Put the butter in a 9x13-inch Pyrex or other oven-proof baking dish and put the dish in the preheating oven. While the butter is melting, mix up the batter by combining the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and milk.
When the butter is completely melted, remove the pan and pour the batter into the melted butter. Then, carefully spoon the peaches and juice evenly over the batter. Return dish to the oven and bake for 30-45 minutes. I prefer a golden brown cobbler where the edges start to shrink a tiny bit. DO NOT MIX THE PEACHES!

Description: 
This is a great Texas Peach Cobbler recipe. I grew up in Sugarland, Texas (a suburb of Houston) so I am very picky about my peach cobbler. The only thing missing was some Bluebell Icecream! I hope everyone enjoy's this as much as I do!!
