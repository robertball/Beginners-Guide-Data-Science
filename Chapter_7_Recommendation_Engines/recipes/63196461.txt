Description: 
This is one of those recipes that cooks love because it's quick, easy and inexpensive. Brown sugar adds a touch of sweetness. In addition to rolls, the beef mixture is tasty over rice, biscuits or baked potatoes.                             -Laurie Hauser, Rochester, New YorkModified from: Sloppy Joe Sandwiches
