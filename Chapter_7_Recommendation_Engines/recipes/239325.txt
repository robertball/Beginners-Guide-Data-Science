Ingredients:
1 apple, cut into bite-size pieces
1 pear, cut into bite-size pieces
1 peach, cut into bite-size pieces
1 banana, cut into bite-size pieces
2 kiwi fruit, peeled and cut into bite-size pieces
1 pint fresh raspberries
1 pint fresh blueberries
1 small bunch fresh mint, minced
1 lime, juiced
1/2 teaspoon triple sec (orange-flavored liqueur), or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Toss apple, pear, peach, banana, and kiwi fruit together in a large bowl. Gently stir raspberries and blueberries into the fruit mixture. Sprinkle mint over the fruit and stir so each bit of fruit has at least a few specks of mint on it. Drizzle lime juice and triple sec over the salad and stir.
