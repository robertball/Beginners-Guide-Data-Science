Ingredients:
3/4 cup candied orange peel
1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup golden raisins
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons honey
2 eggs
1 1/2 tablespoons light cream
2 tablespoons dark rum
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Toss the candied orange peel, walnuts, and raisins with 2 tablespoons flour.  Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream the butter with the sugar and honey.  Beat in the egg, then the cream or milk, rum, and vanilla.  Stir together the remaining 1 1/2 cups flour and the baking powder; beat into the creamed mixture.  Stir in the fruits and nuts.  Turn the batter into a greased and floured 9 x 5 inch loaf pan.
Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 10 minutes.  Lower the heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).   Bake the cake 45 minutes longer, or until it tests done with a toothpick.  Transfer to a rack to cool.
