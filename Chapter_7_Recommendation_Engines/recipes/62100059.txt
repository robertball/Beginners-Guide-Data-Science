to flatten the garlic, peel and segment the cloves.  Hit the garlic with the flat of the knife to squash them just a bit.
Heat oil in a stock pot over medium heat, add the garlic and brown lightly (don't over do it, or it becomes gummy and hard).  Add 1 cup chicken stock and simmer until the garlic is soft, then mash with a fork.  Add the rest of the chicken stock and bring to a light boil.  Add the carrots and cook until almost tender (5 minutes), then add the bell pepper and cook for 3 - 4 more minutes.  Serve immedietly.
