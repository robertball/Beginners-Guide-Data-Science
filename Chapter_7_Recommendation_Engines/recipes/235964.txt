Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
2 large eggs
2 cups salted mini pretzels, crushed
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
6 large dill pickles, sliced diagonally

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat eggs in a bowl. Pour pretzels into a separate bowl. Pour flour into a shallow bowl.
Gently press pickle slices into flour to coat and shake off the excess flour. Dip into the beaten egg, then press into crushed pretzels. Place the coated pickles onto a plate while coating the rest; do not stack.
Fry coated pickles, working in batches, in the hot oil until browned, about 1 minute per side. Drain fried pickles on a paper towel-lined plate.
