Ingredients:
1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon all purpose seasoning

Directions:
Wad three pieces of aluminum foil into 3 to 4 inch balls, and place them in the bottom of the slow cooker.  I used 2 small metal measuring cups instead of the foil.
Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold running water. Pat dry with paper towels. Season the chicken with the salt, pepper and paprika, and place in the slow cooker on top of the crumbled aluminum foil.
Set the slow cooker to High for 1 hour, then turn down to Low for about 8 to 10 hours, or until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear.

Description: 
Every couple of weeks my local grocer has whole chickens on sale, for this recipe I made this recipe for under $4.00.  It's simple and easy and works great if to use leftovers for other recipes such as chicken pot pie or chicken enchiladas.Modified from: Baked Slow Cooker Chicken
