Description: 
If there were ever a recipe to tweak to your own tastes, it's this one. You can adjust the amounts of garlic and anchovy, as well as the proportion of olive oil to butter. You can also control how long you cook the mixture before it's presented. I hear from my friends in Northern Italy that they use twice as much anchovy and garlic as I did. Serve in a small chafing dish or fondue pot with crusty bread, roasted carrots, blanched asparagus, endive, red peppers, and/or roasted potatoes.
