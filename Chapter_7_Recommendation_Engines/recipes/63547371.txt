Ingredients:
3 pounds chuck roast, trimmed well and cut into large chunks
1 Tbl oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 medium red bell pepper, diced
1 medium green bell pepper, diced
5 garlic cloves, minced
28 oz crushed tomatoes
1 8 oz can tomato sauce
1 cup beef broth or consomme
1 6 oz can tomato paste
1/4 cup chili powder
2 Tbl brown sugar
1 Tbl Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips
3 chipotles in adobo sauce, chopped and 1 Tbl chipotle puree from can
1 1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 15 oz can seasoned chili beans
1 15 oz can pinto beans, rinsed
1 15 oz can butter beans, rinsed
1 15 oz can kidney beans, rinsed

Directions:
In a large pot brown the beef in the oil over medium high heat. Set aside.
Saute onions, pepper and garlic in remaining oil until vegetables are tender.
Stir in the remaining ingredients, excluding the beans. Add the browned beef. Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and cook uncovered for at least 1-1/2 hours. Or cook in crock pot on lowest setting for 8 hours.
Remove beef chunks and dice or shred, removing excess fat.  Add back to pot and add beans.
After 15 min adjust seasonings if needed.

Description: 
Chili made with a cut of beef instead of hamburger is what it takes to warm you up on a cold Minnesota day.  The more ingredients you use, the more complex and satisfying the flavor.  So don't leave out the chocolate or chipotle, and add a little dark beer if you want!  Serve with chopped onion, chopped jalapenos, sour cream and freshly shredded cheese.
