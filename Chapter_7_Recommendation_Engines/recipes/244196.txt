Description: 
Miami is such a cosmopolitan city that almost every culture's food is well represented here. A Swedish friend served me this dish at her South Beach apartment once, and I couldn't help to make it a family tradition. I revised her meatball recipe and created this original fusion. Serve with toothpicks sitting in sauce.
