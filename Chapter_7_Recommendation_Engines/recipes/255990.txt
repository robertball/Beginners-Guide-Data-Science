2 pounds lean ground beef
2 green bell peppers, chopped
1 (29 ounce) can hominy, drained

2 cups medium salsa
2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Cook and stir beef and green bell peppers in a large skillet over medium heat until beef is well browned and reduced to small pieces, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.
Stir hominy, tomatoes, salsa, salt, cumin, and pepper into the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer hominy mixture until flavors combine, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
My husband came up with this unique combination and the family fell in love. We use this as a filling for burritos. You can pre-make and freeze the burritos for an easy and instant meal. To make a breakfast-style burrito, substitute scrambled eggs for 1/2 of the ground beef or pork. Serve with warm flour tortillas.
