Description: 
Kielbasa, also called kielbasy or Polish sausage, is a spicy sausage usually made with pork (though beef is sometimes added). It comes in chunky links, and is sold precooked. I haven't met anyone yet who didn't like this dish. I even like it and I really don't care for kielbasa that much! Another bonus is that it is easy to make, and is yet another recipe for your slow cooker.Modified from: Candied Kielbasa
