Ingredients:
FILLING:
1 1/2 cups finely chopped peeled apple
2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

2 cups sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
4 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup cranberry juice
1/2 cup finely chopped fresh cranberries
3 tablespoons vanilla extract

Directions:
For filling, combine apples, sugar and cinnamon; set aside. For muffins, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Combine eggs, oil, cranberry juice, cranberries and vanilla; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups one-third full. Spoon 1 tablespoon filling on top. Fill muffins cups two-thirds full with remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-30 minutes or until muffins test done. Cool 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.
