Ingredients:
1/3 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 1/2 pounds boneless beef sirloin steak, cut 1 1/4 inch cubes
12 whole fresh mushrooms
1 large green bell pepper, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
1 large onion, cut into wedges
12 large pineapple chunks
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
In a bowl, combine soy sauce, oil, brown sugar, garlic, ginger and salt; mix well. Pour half of the marinade into a large resealable plastic bag or shallow glass container; add beef and turn to coat. Seal or cover; refrigerate for 4-8 hours, turning occasionally. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade.
Drain the meat, discarding the marinade. On metal or soaked bamboo skewers, alternate meat, mushrooms, green pepper, onion and tomatoes. Grill, uncovered, over medium heat for 3 minutes on each side.
Baste with reserved marinade. Continue turning and basting for 8-10 minutes or until meat reaches desired doneness (for rare, a meat thermometer should read 140 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well done, 170 degrees F). Serve meat and vegetables over rice if desired.
