Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar packed
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup butter
1 egg
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon rum flavoring
1/2 cup chopped pecans
12 half pecans (optional)
course salt (to taste)

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets, if needed.
2. In a medium bowl, thoroughly combine flour, white sugar, brown sugar, baking soda, and cinnamon. Break up any large lumps of brown sugar.
3. Add the egg, vanilla, rum flavor and butter. As dough begins to gather, add the nuts (The idea is to not blend so much as to break the nuts into too-small fragments)  Mix until well-blended and dough-like.
4. Roll into 1 inch balls place 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheets. Optionally, press a half-pecan on top of each dough ball.
5. Bake for 9-11 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cookie edges are a golden brown.
6. When the cookies come out of the oven and are still hot, sprinkle a small pinch of course salt on each (to taste), then press down lightly on the top of each cookie with a spatula, to "seat" the salt.
7. Cool and enjoy!
