Ingredients:
1/4 cup walnuts
2 tablespoons pine nuts
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon softened butter
3/4 cup firmly packed basil leaves
1/4 cup firmly packed parsley leaves
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup freshly grated Romano cheese

Directions:
Place walnuts, pine nuts, salt, pepper, garlic, butter, basil, and parsley in to a blender or food processor. Turn the blender on, and add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream. Continue processing until a soft paste has formed. Fold in Parmesan and Romano cheeses. Store in the refrigerator covered by 1/4 inch of olive oil to prevent the surface from turning brown.
