Ingredients:
Puffs:
1/2 c. butter
1 c. water
1/4 tsp. salt
1 c. flour
4 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven 400 degrees.
Place the butter and water in a heavy saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil.
Remove from heat and with a wooden spoon or spatula, quickly add the flour mixture. Return to heat and stir constantly until the dough comes away from the sides of the pan and forms a thick smooth ball (about a minute or two).
Transfer the dough to electric mixer and beat on low speed a minute or two to release the steam from the dough. Once the dough is lukewarm start adding the eggs and continue to mix until you have a smooth thick paste.
Spoon or pipe mounds of dough onto the baking sheet spacing them a couple of inches apart.
Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 350. Bake for a further 30 to 40 minutes or until the shells have browned and are dry inside.
PRICK EACH PUFF WITH A TOOTHPICK to allow steam to escape and prevent them from falling.
Turn the oven off and, with the oven door slightly ajar, let the shells dry out for a further 10-15 minutes.
Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack.
Slice puffs in half. Fill with pudding or whipped cream. Place top back on. Serve.
