Ingredients:
1 cup warm water
2 tablespoons nonfat dry milk powder
2 tablespoons butter, softened
2 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups bread flour
1 cup malted barley flour
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
Place all ingredients (except the milk) into the bread machine pan in the above order, or as directed by the manufacturer.  Select the Basic Bread setting; press Start.
After the baking cycle is complete, remove the bread from the pan and brush the just baked bread with milk. This will give it a soft and shiny crust.
