Description: 
Cereal and peanuts add the crunch to these sweet and peanut-buttery treats you can whip up in no time. One batch makes plenty for snacking and sharing. At Christmas, my sister and I add them to trays of homemade candies we give to the customers of the house-cleaning service we run. We're often asked for the recipe.
