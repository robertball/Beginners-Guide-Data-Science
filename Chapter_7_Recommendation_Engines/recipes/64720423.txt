Ingredients:
Ragu:
•	1 cup lentils
•	2 cups boiling water
•	1 cup TVP (textured vegetable protein)
•	1 cup vegetable broth
•	2 tbsp olive oil
•	1 small yellow onion
•	1 medium carrot
•	1 stalk celery
•	1 small red bell pepper
•	1 fresh hot pepper, minced (optional)
•	1 bay leaf
•	1 tbsp oregano
•	1 tsp salt
•	1/4 cup vegan red wine
•	14 ounce can diced tomatoes
Polenta:
•	2 cups vegetable broth
•	1 cup water
•	1 tsp salt
•	1 cup Italian polenta (course-ground cornmeal)
•	4 tbsp vegan butter
•	4 tbsp vegan shredded white cheese

Directions:
In a bowl, soak the lentils in two cups of boiling water. Set aside. Wait one hour.
In a separate bowl, soak the tvp in the vegetable broth. Set aside to allow the tvp to absorb the broth.
Dice the onion, carrot, celery, bell pepper, and hot pepper. Heat the oil and sauté the vegetables in a stew pot. Once the onions are translucent, add the drained lentils and the tvp without draining it first. Stir and add the oregano and bay leaf. Stir well. Add the red wine and continue stirring. Add the tomatoes. Stir and simmer until thickened. Add a bit of water if needed until the lentils have cooked.
Once the ragu has thickened, begin making the polenta.
Bring to a boil two cups vegetable broth and one cup of water and 1 tsp salt. Once boiling, reduce the temperature. Stirring constantly, sprinkle the polenta into the water. Stir to ensure there are no clumps. Continue stirring until smooth. Stir often for 10 minutes on low. Add the vegan butter, stirring constantly.
Distribute the polenta evenly in four pasta bowls. Remove the bay leaf from the ragu. Top with equal amounts of ragu. Sprinkle one tablespoon on each plate. Serve warm.
