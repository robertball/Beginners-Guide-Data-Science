Ingredients:
1 cup canola oil
¾ cup unsweetened apple sauce
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 eggs, beaten (room temp)
¾ cup brown rice flour
¼ cup coconut flour
¾ cup sorghum flour
¾ cup tapioca starch
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. xanthan gum
1/4 tsp. salt
1 c. buttermilk
1 tsp. vanilla
1 oz. red food coloring
4 Tbsps. bittersweet cocoa powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Use a mixer to combine oil and sugar. Add one egg at a time and beat until the eggs are thoroughly incorporated.
Mix all of the dry ingredients together (except 1 Tbsp cocoa) in a separate bowl. Make sure they are well incorporated, either by sifting the flours or whisking them.
Add the flour to the oil and sugar mixture in four parts. Alternate the flour with the buttermilk. You should begin and end with dry ingredients and each part should be mixed in completely before you add the next.
Make a paste of the cocoa, red food coloring, and vanilla and gently stir it into the batter.
Pour the batter into two greased and floured round cake pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for approximately 25 minutes. (A toothpick stuck into the middle of the cake should come out clean when the cake is done)
When the cakes have completely cooled, frost with frosting.

This is the cake I am having made for my wedding.  It was certainly a challenge to find somebody to use my recipe and to do it gluten free!
