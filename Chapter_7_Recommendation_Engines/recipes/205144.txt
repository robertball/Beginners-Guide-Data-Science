Stir in the red bell pepper, zucchini, broccoli, and green onions, and cook and stir until the vegetables are tender and the broccoli is bright green in color, 5 to 8 minutes.

Description: 
Very delicious. I always make a little extra of the orange juice and Asian toasted sesame dressing on the side, just in case anyone wants extra. Serve over rice. I also like to make brown rice instead of white rice.
