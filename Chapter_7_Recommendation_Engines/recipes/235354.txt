Description: 
This is recipe is loved by everyone who has tried it. My husband's uncle kept this recipe a secret for many years and would not share it with anyone; we had to wait until he passed away, and then my husband's aunt gave us the recipe. I made these for a Thanksgiving dinner we had at church, and now every time we have any sort of meal at church I am always asked if I going to make uncle Dick's potatoes. Even in the summer, this is what they want me to make. I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we do.
