Ingredients:
1 (14-ounce) package extra firm tofu
1/3 cup soy sauce
¼ teaspoon liquid smoke
canola oil

Directions:
Drain tofu and wrap in a towel. Press liquid out by placing a heavy item, such as a plate or two, on top and allowing to sit for 15-20 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix soy sauce and liquid smoke in a wide, shallow container; set aside. Cut tofu into 1/8 inch thick slices and pat dry again. Place into soy sauce mixture, turning to coat. Cover and refrigerate overnight, allowing tofu to absorb marinade.
Preheat oven to 325º F.
Grease a large cookie sheet with canola oil. Place marinated tofu slices in a single layer on the cookie sheet and spray with another thin layer of oil. Bake in preheated oven for approximatey90 minutes, or until the tofu is dark and slightly shriveled. The finished product will be chewy yet crunchy.

Description: 
Being a bacon lover, I’ve found that there isn’t a plant-based substitute that closely resembles traditional bacon. Nothing I’ve found has had the taste and texture I crave. Needless to say I created this “bacon” to match the animal-based version as closely as possible. It is smoky and salty, chewy yet crunchy.

Tofaken, as I like to call it, is soaked in a marinade overnight allowing it to absorb plenty of flavor. The finished product is excellent not only plain, but in BLTs and other sandwiches, as well as in tofu scramble and potato salad. It’s difficult to eat just one!
