Ingredients:
1 tablespoon salted butter
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1/3 medium zucchini, thinly sliced
4 chanterelle mushrooms, thinly sliced
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a non-stick skillet over high heat. Cook and stir garlic until quite crispy and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add zucchini and chanterelle mushrooms. Cook and stir until golden brown, about 5 minutes.
Increase heat to medium-high and spread zucchini and mushrooms over the bottom of the skillet. Pour in eggs. Pick up skillet and tilt to spread egg evenly. Working quickly, sprinkle in cheese and season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium. Watch for the top of the omelet to begin bubbling and give the pan a wiggle to loosen the base. When cheese has melted on top and egg has the desired consistency, fold omelet over and serve.

Description: 
Chanterelle mushrooms have a fairly short season and this omelet is one of the many ways in which I like to enjoy them. This omelet is garlicky and cheesy, and will fill you up for hours - it's low carb and keto bonus too!
