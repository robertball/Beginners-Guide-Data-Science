Ingredients:
Scones:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
3 tablespoons cold butter
3 tablespoons shortening
3/4 cup canned pumpkin
1 egg
2 tablespoons half-and-half
Glaze:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons milk
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Mix flour, white sugar, baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger together in a large bowl; cut in butter and shortening using a pastry cutter or 2 knives until mixture is crumbly.
Mix pumpkin, egg, and half-and-half together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture just until combined. Turn dough onto a floured work surface and shape into a 1/2-inch-thick square. Cut dough into pizza-like wedges and arrange on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer scones to a wire rack to cool.
Whisk confectioners' sugar, milk, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice together in a bowl; drizzle over scones.

After eating a delicious pumpkin scone from my favorite coffee shop, I went home and played around with a base recipe until I came up with what I believe to be a fabulous copy!
