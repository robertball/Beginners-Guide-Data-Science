Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (275 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and spray with a non-stick cooking spray.
Cut bacon into thirds. Place brown sugar in a small mixing bowl. Drain chestnuts then roll them in brown sugar. Wrap each nut in a bacon strip and secure it with a toothpick. Arrange chestnut/bacon wraps on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake until the bacon is crisp. Serve.
