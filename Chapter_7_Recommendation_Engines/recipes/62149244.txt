Ingredients:
8 ounces Portobello mushrooms, chopped
4 tablespoons chopped onion
4 tablespoons coarsely chopped carrots
2 tablespoon chopped celery
2-1/2 teaspoons butter
1-1/4 teaspoons olive oil
1 tablespoon and 2-1/4 teaspoons white wine
1/4 cup and 3 tablespoons beef stock
1-1/4 teaspoons tomato paste
2 ounces enoki mushrooms
3 tablespoons and 1-1/4 teaspoons heavy whipping cream
1/4 pinch ground nutmeg
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine the portobello mushrooms, onions, carrots and celery on a cutting board and chop into very small pieces. In a large skillet melt butter or margarine over medium heat. Add portobello mixture and sauté, stirring often, for 5 - 8 minutes or until lightly browned.  Transfer to a heavy large saucepan.
In same skillet pour in the wine, increase the heat and boil briskly, still stirring constantly, until almost all of the liquid has evaporated.  Add veggie mixture to saucepan.  Stir in the stock and tomato paste.  Bring all to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 tablespoons of butter or margarine over high heat in the original skillet.  Add enoki mushrooms and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove enoki from skillet and dice.  Set aside and add to sauce 10 minutes before it is done. A few minutes before serving, stir in the cream and let it heat through.  Season sauce with nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste.
