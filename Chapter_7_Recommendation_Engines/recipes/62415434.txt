Ingredients:
2 cups chopped, cooked chicken meat
2 cups fresh chopped broccoli
1/2 cup chopped red onion
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons Dijon-style prepared mustard
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 batch of biscuit dough for twelve three inch biscuit rounds

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the chicken, broccoli, onions, bell pepper, cheese, mayonnaise, mustard, salt, pepper and garlic. Mix all together.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Form biscuit cutouts into triangles and arrange around a four inch diameter void; when you're finished, the arrangement will look like the sun. Spoon some of the chicken mixture onto the thick part of each lightly depressed biscuit. Fold the pointy end of each roll over the top of the mixture and tuck in. Fill void with any leftover filling, and place any scrap dough on top of the filling.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until bread is golden brown.
