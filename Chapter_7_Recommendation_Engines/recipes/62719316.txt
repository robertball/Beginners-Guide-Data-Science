Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
4 ounces good quality chocolate (70% cocoa), chopped
8 Tablespoons unsalted butter
4 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 Tablespoons Nutella

Directions:
In a bowl, whisk flour, cocoa and baking powder.  Set aside.
In a small saucepan over low heat, melt butter and then add chocolate.  Stir until chocolate is melted and incorporated and remove from heat.
In a bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat eggs, vanilla, sugar and salt until pale yellow, about 5 minutes.  Beat in melted chocolate mixture.  Stir in flour mixture.
Spoon half of batter into six, 6 ounce, ramekins that have been sprayed with cooking spray.  Drop 1 Tablespoon of Nutella into center of each.  Cover with remaining batter.
Begin preheating the oven to 350o F.  Place a roasting pan in the oven and add a 1/2" of hot water to the pan.  When oven is hot, transfer ramekins to the roasting pan.  Bake until cakes have risen and are cracked on top, about 30 minutes.  Let cool for 5 minutes and serve warm.
