Description: 
'ONE OF the staples of Ukrainian cooking is sour cream. This combination of sour cream and cucumbers makes a very tasty salad. During the summer we use cucumbers from our garden for that wonderfully fresh, crunchy taste. But store-bought cucumbers work almost as well, so we enjoy this dish year-around--it goes especially well with meat dishes.'
