Ingredients:
Salad:
7 cups lettuce or mixed greens, I like red leaf lettuce best
6-8 oz Gorgonzola cheese, crumbled
3/4 lb. bacon, cooked until crisp, chopped
1/2 lb. seedless red grapes
Pecan Crunch:
2/3 cups pecans, chopped coarse
2 tablespoons butter
4 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoons salt
Fresh ground pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
Hazelnut Vinaigrette:
1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
4 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1/4 cup orange juice
1/4 cup hazelnut oil*
1/4cup light olive oil

Directions:
Wash and dry the lettuce. Combine with chopped bacon and grapes in large bowl. Chill.
Combine pecans with butter, sugar, salt, pepper and cayenne in non stick pan. Cook over medium heat until the sugar caramelizes. Stir often. Place the mixture in a small paper bag to cool. Shake to break up pieces, or chop on cutting board.
Combine all of the dressing ingredients in bowl, whisk until well blended. Refrigerate leftover dressing.
