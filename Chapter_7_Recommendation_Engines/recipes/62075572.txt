Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups butter
3/4 cup sifted powdered sugar
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
Red and green food coloring

Directions:
Cream butter. Gradually add sugar, beating well. Add flour and mix well. Stir in almond extract. Divide dough in half, and place in separate bowls. Tint half of the dough green, and the other half red. Roll dough into balls using 1/2 teaspoon of dough per ball. For each wreath-shaped cookie, place six balls in a circle on an ungreased cookie sheet, alternating colors. Press together securely. Bake at 375 degrees for 8 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes; remove to racks (Be careful, these cookies are fragile). Cool completely.

Description: 
This recipe has been in the family for years, and we also make these for Christmas. These cookies literally do melt in your mouth, and everyone who tastes them absolutely loves them! Instead of using the almond extract, another excellent twist is to add peppermint extract. Also, I always double this recipe.
