Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
6  boneless, skinless chicken thighs
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic powder, rosemary, salt, and pepper; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Add chicken thighs to skillet and turn to coat. Cook until browned on 1 side, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and flip chicken. Cover and cook for 15 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest parts registers 170 degrees F (86 degrees C). Remove chicken from skillet and skim fat off pan juices. Return chicken to skillet.
Stir honey and lemon juice together in a small bowl; drizzle over chicken. Continue cooking until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.
