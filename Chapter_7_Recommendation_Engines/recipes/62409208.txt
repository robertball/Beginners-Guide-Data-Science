1/2 cup oil
1 3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 tsp. vanilla
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
4 Tbsp. cocoa

2 cups grated zucchini
Topping:
1 Tbsp. granulated sugar
1/2 cup chopped nuts (any type)
1 cup chocolate chips (I use milk chocolate)

In large mixing bowl, beat softened butter, oil and granulated sugar until light and creamy.  Add eggs one at a time, beat well after each addition.  Add vanilla.  In a separate bowl, combine flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt.  Add flour mixture alternately with sour milk, ending with milk.  Stir in grated zucchini.  Pour into a greased 13 X 9 pan.  Make topping by combining the sugar, nuts and chips.  Sprinkle on top of batter. Bake @ 350 degrees for approx. 40-45 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean from center of cake.

Description: 
Dense chocolate cake that is to die for!  The chocolate bits, nuts & sugar make a crunchy but velvetty topping on a very moist cake.  One would never know that there is zucchini in the batter!
