Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups powdered sugar
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
3/4 cup mascarpone cheese, at room temperature
1 teaspoon Madagascar vanilla paste

Directions:
Place powdered sugar and butter in an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Start mixing on the lowest speed. Increase speed to medium and beat until fluffy, scraping down the sides occasionally, about 3 minutes.
Add mascarpone cheese and vanilla paste; mix on medium-low until creamy. Do not overmix frosting at this point, or the butter and mascarpone could separate.
