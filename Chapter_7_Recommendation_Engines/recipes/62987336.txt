Ingredients:
SEASONING:
4 oz. ketchup
3 heaping tsp. mustard
3 heaping tsp. cream-style horseradish
3 heaping tsp. salt (I reduce to 2 tsp.)
3 tsp. Worchestershire sauce
1/4 tsp. black pepper
MEAT:
5 lb. ground beef (85% lean)
8 oz. finely chopped yellow onion
1/2 tsp. Accent

Directions:
Thoroughly mix seasoning ingredients together. If this mixture does not fill an 8 oz. cup or jar, add additional ketchup to equal 8 oz.
Brown 5 lb. of 85% lean ground beef. (The 85% is important. If not available, mix 2.5 lb. each of 80% & 90% lean to equal 85%.)
While browning meat, break up meat into fine pieces. Drain off grease.
Stir seasoning mixture into cooked meat. Fill the same 8 oz. cup/jar with water & stir in as well.
Fill the same 8 oz. cup/jar with finely chopped yellow onion & add to meat mixture.
Add 1/2 tsp. Accent (a flavor enhancer found in spice section).
Mix all ingredients & stir over low heat for 15 min. Increase heat & boil for another 25 min.
Serve on small hamburger buns.
Garnish with mustard, dill pickle, or onion as desired.
