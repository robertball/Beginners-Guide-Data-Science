Ingredients:
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon lemon pepper
2 (4 ounce) fillets salmon
1 lemon

Directions:
Season salmon fillets on both sides with lemon pepper.
In a large skillet, melt butter over medium high heat.  Stir in garlic.  Place salmon in pan.  Cook for 10 minutes per inch of thickness, or until fish flakes when tested with a fork.  Flip fillets halfway through cooking to brown on both sides.  Sprinkle with lemon juice before serving.

Description: 
Fresh salmon needs very little preparation. These salmon fillets are cooked in good, sweet butter and minced garlic, and then sprinkled with a little lemon juice. If you'd like a little more kick and a fancy presentation, caramelize onions and serve them atop the cooked salmon.
