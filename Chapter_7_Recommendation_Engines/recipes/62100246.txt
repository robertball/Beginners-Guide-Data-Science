Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 Romaine Hearts, rinsed
2 Limes
2 Granny Smith Apples
1/3 Cup Fresh Mint
1/2 Cup Chopped Cucumber
1/4 cup Simple Sugar (Syrup)
Lemon Juice to Taste (optional)

Directions:
Rinse and dice romaine hearts and place in large bowl.  Zest limes into the bowl, and then squeeze as much juice as possible. Rinse mint, then dice leaves until you have about 1/3 Cup, crush them to release their flavor.  Cut apples (I like to use an apple corer/divider for ease/appearance). Slice cucumber (I like about 1/2 cup in my salad), then place all ingredients in the bowl.
At this point, add Simple Sugar (a bartender's solution of water and sugar--but plain sugar will be fine if thoroughly mixed) and maybe some lemon juice to taste.  Enjoy!

Everything you love about a Mojito except the rum!  After having a few friends over for some mojitos, I was in the mood for salad the next day and had all the right ingredients--better than the hair of the dog!
