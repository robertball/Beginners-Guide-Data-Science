Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
3/4 cup granular sucrolose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 egg whites
1 cup mashed ripe banana
1/4 cup applesauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12 cup muffin tin, or line with paper muffin liners.
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar substitute, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon. In a separate bowl, mix together the egg whites, mashed banana and applesauce. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, and mix until just blended. Fill prepared muffin cups 3/4 full.
Bake for 15 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top springs back when lightly touched. Allow muffins to cool in the pan over a wire rack for a little while before tapping them out of the pan.

Description: 
These muffins have no sugar and no fat, but are moist and tasty.  Instead of regular applesauce, I sometimes use mango-peach to give the muffins more flavor.  Great recipe for diabetics! You can use all white flour instead the whole wheat flour, too.
