Ingredients:
Basil Pesto:
1 1/2 cups packed fresh basil leaves
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
2 cloves garlic
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Pizzas:
2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
5 cremini mushrooms, sliced
1/2 tablespoon dried rosemary
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper
1 (8.8 ounce) package 2-pack naan bread
2/3 cup ricotta cheese
1/3 cup feta cheese
1 tablespoon shredded Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Combine basil, Parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup olive oil, walnuts, garlic, salt, and pepper in a blender; blend pesto until desired consistency, 5 to 8 minutes. Add 1 extra tablespoon olive oil at a time for a thinner pesto. Set aside.
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in mushrooms, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Saute until mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1 naan and cook until crispy, about 2 minutes per side. Spread naan with a generous amount of pesto, and top with ricotta cheese, feta cheese, and sauteed mushrooms. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Cook until cheese is melted. Repeat with second naan and remaining ingredients.

Description: 
The garlic in the pesto might add a little kick, so use less, if necessary. A great appetizer or a main dish. Hope you guys give this a try!
