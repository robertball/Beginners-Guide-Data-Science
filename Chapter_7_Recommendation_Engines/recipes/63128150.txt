Ingredients:
1 Tbsp dried onion
1 pound dried split peas
1 pound ham bone
pepper to taste (I used 1 tsp)

Directions:
Soak split peas overnight, change out water 2-3 times.
In a medium pot boil ham bone (water just over the top) and simmer for at least 1 hour. Remove bone and pull meat. Toss bones. Add the split peas, pulled ham, and ham broth you made cover ingredients; season with dried onion and pepper.
Cover, and cook until there are no peas left, just a green liquid, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.  While it is cooking, check to see if water has evaporated. You may need to add more water as the soup continues to cook.
Once the soup is a green liquid remove from heat, and let stand so it will thicken. Once thickened you may need to heat through to serve.
