Ingredients:
1-900g package of baby shell macaroni
4 stalks of celery, chopped
4 green onions, chopped
1/2 bottle of French dressing
1/2 bottle of Thousand Island dressing
1/2c  mayonnaise
2cans baby shrimp, drained
2cans chunk white tuna, drained and crumbled( white is best but light can be substituted for a more "fishy" flavour)

Directions:
Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until "al dente" (too long and the salad will be mushy.) Drain, rinse with cold water and drain again. In a large bowl, toss 1st 3 ingredients together. Add dressings and mayonnaise (adding more dressing if it is too dry-mixture should be slightly soupy). Fold in shrimp and tuna. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours or overnight to allow pasta to absorb dressing.
