Peanut Butter Fudge Brownie Trifle Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 batch of your favorite brownies
1 large box of chocolate pudding, prepared per package directions
1 large tub cool whip
8oz cream cheese, softened
1 cup creamy peanut butter
1 cup confectioners sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1 bag of Reeses Peanut Butter Cups, chopped up

Directions:
Prepare the brownies and the pudding per the directions on the boxes.  Allow both of these things to cool and chill completely.  Cut the brownies into small bite-size pieces.
In a bowl, beat the peanut butter, cream cheese, vanilla, and confectioners sugar until it is light, fluffy, and mousse-like.
Have all of your ingredients ready for assembly.
In a large trifle bowl or a 9x5” clear pan or paper-lined muffin tins, build your trifle dessert.  You can layer however you’d like.  I do a layer of brownies, a layer of peanut butter mousse, some peanut-butter cups, a layer of chocolate pudding, and a layer of whipped cream.  If you are doing this in a trifle bowl or larger pan, continue layering until you reach the top.  Finish with whipped cream and top with peanut butter cups for garnish.  If you are making mini-trifles in muffin tins, you will not need to build a second round of layers.
Chill or serve immediately with a very large spoon.  And prepare to make lots of friends.
