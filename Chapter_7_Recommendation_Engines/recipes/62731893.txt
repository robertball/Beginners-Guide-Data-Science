Ingredients:
2 six ounce boxes of stuffing mix, divided
1-1/2 cups chicken broth
3/4 cup white wine (or water)
1 stick butter, divided
6 boneless pork chops, about 2 pounds
1 can cream of mushroom & roasted garlic soup
1/4 cup white wine (or milk)
1 teaspoon italian herb blend
salt & pepper

Directions:
Divide one box of stuffing in half, reserve one half in small bag.
Cut butter into 8 tablespoons, reserve 2 tablespoons.
Preheat oven to 400F.
In a sauce pan add 6 tablespoons of butter, chicken broth, 3/4 cup wine/water.  Bring to a boil.
Remove from heat.  Add 1-1/2 boxes of stuffing mix, cover.  Let sit 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix soup, 1/4 cup wine/milk, herbs, and pepper to taste.
Season pork chops with salt & pepper on both sides.
Spray a 9 x 13 baking dish with no-stick spray.
Fluff stuffing with a fork, add to baking dish, forming a wide mound down the center of the dish.
Lay the pork chops over the stuffing, angling so stuffing is mostly covered.
Spoon soup mixture over chops, spreading so chops are completely covered.
Cover with foil and bake 30-35 minutes.
While it is baking, melt the last 2 tablespoons of butter in the pan used to make the stuffing.
Use a rolling pin or heavy pan to lightly crush the reserved 1/2 box of stuffing mix.
Toss the stuffing with the melted butter.
Remove foil and sprinkle with buttered stuffing.
Bake another 8-12 minutes until stuffing is nicely browned.

Description: 
This is double stuffing - not stuffed pork chops.  I uses stuffing in 2 ways so you get both of the great aspects of stuffing: the moist, dense, wet kind and the crispy, brown kind.
