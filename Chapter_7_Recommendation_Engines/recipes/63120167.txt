Ingredients:
4 large eggs
2 large egg whites
2 TBSP chives, fresh, chopped
2 TBSP reduced calorie mayonaise
1/2 tsp Dijon mustard
1/2 tsp table salt
1/4 tsp black pepper, freshly ground

Directions:
Place eggs in a medium saucepan and pour in enough water to cover them; set pan over high heat and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about 10 minutes; drain and place eggs in an ice-water bath.
When eggs are cool enough to handle, remove shells.  Discard yolks from two of the eggs.  Chop remaining whole eggs and whites into bite-size pieces.
Transfer eggs to a medium bowl.  Add chives, mayo, mustard, salt & pepper; mix until blended.
