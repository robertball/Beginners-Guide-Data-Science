Ingredients:
MAKES 12 POPOVERS
Olive oil to drizzle in muffin pan
4 eggs
1 3/4 cups 2% milk
1 1/4 cups flour
1/2 tsp salt
ground black pepper to taste
3/4 cup grated sharp cheddar
2 tbsp of chopped fresh chives

Directions:
METHOD
Preheat oven to 435 degrees.
Use a SILICONE 12 cup muffin pan (the regular size cups are fine- don't use extra large ones)
Drizzle olive oil in each cup and using a paper towel, grease each cup - wipe off any excess
Beat the eggs in a medium sized metal bowl for 2 mins with a whisk
Add the milk, flour, salt, pepper, cheese & chives
Beat with whisk for 30 seconds until blended (don't worry if there are a few small lumps)
Pour enough of the mixture into each muffin cup until they are 3/4 full
Bake the popovers for 20 mins. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and bake for another 10 to 15 mins. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR - look through the oven door to see if they are golden brown and puffed.
If you think they are done - remove one popover and cut it open to see if they are no longer moist inside.
If done - remove & they will easily pop out to go on a cooling rack. However, they are best if eaten immediately drizzled with butter.  I love to eat them cut open with with a bit of butter melting in the nooks & crannies, a small shaving of cheddar and some thinly sliced proscuitto.
If not completely done, cook for another 5 mins.
ENJOY!

Description: 
These light and fluffy popovers are the result of tweaking many recipes and methods. I have struggled with dense & un-popped popovers until now!  I hope you have success with them too.  Follow the recipe exactly the first time. Good luck!
