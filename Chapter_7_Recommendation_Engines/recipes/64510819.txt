Ingredients:
1 pkg active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water
1 cup plain yogurt (or sour cream or 1/2 of each), warmed
2 tsp. (or more) vegetable seasoning (I use Club House brand)
1/4 cup sugar
2 tbsp. butter or margarine, softened
1 egg
1 tbsp. dill weed
1/2 tsp. salt
3 - 3 1/2 cups flour

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.
Add yogurt/sour cream, seasoning, sugar, butter, egg, dill, salt & 1 cup flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Knead until smooth & elastic.
Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place till doubled, about 1 1/2 hrs.
Punch dough down. Divide into thirds. Shape each portion into a 20" long rope (this is where you put those playdough skills to good use!). Place ropes on a large greased baking sheet. Pinch together on one end and braid. Pinch ends to seal and tuck under.
Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.
Bake @ 350 x 35 minutes, or until golden brown.
