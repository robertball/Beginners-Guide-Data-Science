2 cups chicken broth
1 (8.8 ounce) package quick-cook farro (such as Trader Joe'sÂ®)

1 tablespoon butter

1 large onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, chopped

Directions:
Bring chicken broth to a boil; add farro. Cook until farro is tender, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer sausage to a bowl using a slotted spoon, reserving remaining grease in the skillet.
Melt butter into the reserved grease over medium heat; cook and stir apples, onion, and garlic until apples are tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Add sausage and farro. Season with red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. Continue to cook and stir until warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes more.
