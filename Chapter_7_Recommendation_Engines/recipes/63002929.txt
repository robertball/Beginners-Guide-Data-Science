Ingredients:
1 lb hamburger meat
2 onions (chopped)
3-6 cloves of garlic (diced)
1 tblsp olive oil
1/4 c water
taco seasoning
1 1/2 c milk
1 c bisquick
3 eggs
3 cups sharp cheddar cheese ( or what ever cheese you prefer)
2 tomato's
2 jalapeno (optional)
Onion (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven at 425. Heat olive oil in a frying pan, add half the onion,  garlic, and the meat.  Fry until cooked. Drain fat, and add taco seasoning, and water. Keep frying until water has evaporated. place in a 9" greased casserole dish.  In a mixing bowl add milk, bisquick, and eggs. Mix together, don't worry if it's still lumpy. You can whip smooth if you wish.  Pour mixture over meat, (DO NOT STIR, THE LIQUID JUST SITS ON TOP)  Bake for 25 min, or until crust is golden brown.  Pull out of oven, add tomato's onion's, jalapeno, and cheese. Put dish back in the oven until the cheese has melted.   I like to serve it with sour cream, and salsa.   Enjoy, your kids will love this.  I love taking it to work for lunch.
