Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
1 ⅓ teaspoons ground black pepper, divided
2  eggs, beaten
¼ cup milk
1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce
½ teaspoon paprika
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon granulated onion
1 ½ cups unseasoned panko bread crumbs
8  skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine flour, 1/3 teaspoon kosher salt, and 2/3 teaspoon black pepper in a shallow bowl.
Combine eggs, milk, Sriracha sauce, 1/3 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/3 teaspoon black pepper in a shallow bowl.
Combine panko bread crumbs, 1/3 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/3 teaspoon black pepper paprika, garlic powder, and granulated onion in a shallow bowl.
Dredge chicken thighs first in flour mixture, then egg mixture, and finally in panko mixture, shaking off excess after each step. Place coated chicken thighs onto the prepared baking sheet, skin-side up.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
