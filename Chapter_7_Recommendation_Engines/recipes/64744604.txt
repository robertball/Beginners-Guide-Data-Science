Ingredients:
2 Tbsp butter
2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and shredded (about 4 cups)
1 garlic clove, minced
1/2 tsp salt, divided
1/8 tsp dried thyme
2 cups fresh spinach, coarsely chopped
4 large eggs
1/8 tsp coarsely ground pepper

Directions:
In a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet, heat butter over low heat. Add sweet potatoes, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt and thyme; cook, covered, until potatoes are almost tender, 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in spinach just until wilted, 2-3 minutes.
With the back of a spoon, make four wells in potato mixture. Break an egg in each well. Sprinkle eggs with pepper and remaining salt. Cook, covered, on medium-low until egg whites are completely set and yolks begin to thicken but are not hard, 5-7 minutes.
