Ingredients:
2 cups rolled oats
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt
3/4 cup stevia powder
1/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup hot water
3 egg whites
1 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Combine oats, pumpkin, yogurt, stevia, whole wheat flour, brown sugar, water, egg whites, cinnamon, vinegar, vanilla extract, cloves, nutmeg, and salt in a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth, with only small pieces of oats left. Pour into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
I took the base of this recipe from a recipe for chocolate muffins that I found on Pinterest. With oats, nonfat Greek yogurt, and pumpkin at the core, these muffins are both wholesome and delicious!
