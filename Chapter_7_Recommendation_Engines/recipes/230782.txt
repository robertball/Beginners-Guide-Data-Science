Ingredients:
3 tablespoons coconut oil
3/4 cup popcorn kernels
2 tablespoons honey, or more to taste
salt to taste
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat coconut oil in a large pot over high heat. Drop 3 popcorn kernels into the hot oil and place a lid on the pot; cook until 1 kernel has popped. Remove the lid and pour in the remaining popcorn. Return the lid to the pot and cook popcorn, shaking pot back and forth over burner, until there are 1 to 2 seconds between pops, about 5 minutes.
Quickly transfer popcorn to a large bowl; evenly drizzle honey over popcorn. Add salt and cinnamon; toss popcorn with your hands to coat evenly.

Description: 
I wanted to make a sweet popcorn that was delicious but not loaded with sugar, so I came up with this recipe. It's one of my kids' favorites! Olive oil works if you don't have coconut oil. If you accidentally add to much salt, add a little more honey. If it's too sweet, add a little more salt. Start with a little cinnamon and gradually add more until it is the flavor you desire.
