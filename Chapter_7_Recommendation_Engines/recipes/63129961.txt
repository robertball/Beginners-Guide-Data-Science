Ingredients:
1/2 cup spelt flour (you can sub white)*
1/2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp nunaturals stevia or 1T plus 1 tsp sugar (you can use much less if you’re planning to top with syrup and therefore don’t want the actual pancakes to taste sweet. With this amount, the pancakes taste kind of like cookies, even with no toppings!)
1/2 cup plus 2T nondairy milk (or more, for thinner pancakes)
1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
tiny bit over 1/16 tsp salt (don’t omit)
optional: if you don’t like the texture of fat-free pancakes, I recommend adding 1T canola oil

Directions:
Mix all ingredients well and poor onto a greased skillet at med high

Description: 
Snickerdoodle cookies take on a new form in these spelt-flour pancakes that have only 223 calories in the whole recipe, which produces six thick pancakes. Sprinkle your flapjacks with cinnamon and sugar, and it will really taste like you’re eating a homemade cookie for breakfast — except this version has 7 grams of fiber and 8 grams of protein per batch.
