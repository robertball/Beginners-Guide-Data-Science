Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups applesauce
2 cups pumpkin puree
4 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground mace
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips (optional)
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
Mix white sugar and applesauce together in a large bowl; stir pumpkin puree and eggs into sugar mixture until smooth. Mix baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, ginger, cloves, and mace into pumpkin mixture; fold in walnuts and chocolate chips. Stir flour into pumpkin mixture until fully incorporated. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of each loaf comes out clean, 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Sprinkle each loaf with confectioners' sugar.

This yummy family tradition started when buying the kids their pumpkins. Each of the kids got one to make their jack o'lanterns. Mama got one to cook! Friends and family usually enjoy this treat. Tweak it to fit your family as I do mine! Enjoy with confectioners' sugar on top or cream cheese frosting!
