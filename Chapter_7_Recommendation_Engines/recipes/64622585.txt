Ingredients:
1 1/2 lb. boneless skinless chicken breasts trimmed of excess fat
1 yellow onion, diced
1 stalk celery, diced
2 cloves minced garlic
2 15 oz. cans Great Northern beans, drained and rinsed
2 4 oz. cans diced green chiles
1 16 oz. bag whole kernel corn
4 cups chicken broth/stock
1 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. black pepper
1 tsp. cumin
1 tsp. dried parsley
1 tsp. oregano
small handful fresh cilantro, chopped
1 1/2 cups heavy cream or half and half
Optional : 3 T each butter and flour to make a roux with the cream for a thicker, creamier chili.

Directions:
Place chicken breasts in bottom of crock pot. Layer onions, garlic, beans, chiles and corn.  Pour broth over all.  Add salt pepper and herbs.  Stir.
Cook on high for 3-4 hours or on low for 6-8, or until chicken is done and onions are cooked well and no longer crunchy.  Remove chicken from crock and shred or cut into bite size pieces. Return to crockpot
For a soup like consistency, simply add cream or half and half and cover and bring back up to temperature.  For a creamy consistency, make a roux to add to the soup, by melting  butter in a saucepan, then adding the flour.  Whisk thoroughly and allow to bubble and cook for at least one minute.  Add cream or half and half and whisk until smooth and thickened, and add to the crock.  Serve with shredded Monterey Jack cheese, tortilla strips, sour cream, jalape√±os or avocados.
