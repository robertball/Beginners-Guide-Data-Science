Ingredients:
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1/2 cup unsalted butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup minus 1 T water
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 t cinnamon
1 T vanilla
1 T cornstarch
dash nutmeg
2 Honeycrisp apples
2 Red delicious apples
2 Granny Smith apples
lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place the bottom crust in your pan. Brush egg whites on the bottom.
Peel, core, and slice the apples.  Toss with lemon juice and set aside.
Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, spices, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
Fill crust with apples, mounded slightly. Pour most of the sauce over the apples, covering completely.
Cover with a lattice work crust.  Gently brush the remaining liquid over the crust.  (If pouring, pour slowly so that it does not run off.)
Bake for 1 hour, until apples are soft.
