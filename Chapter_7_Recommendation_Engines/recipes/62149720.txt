Description: 
This recipe has been in our family for about 20 years, and I haven't seen another like it this easy. This is one of quickest, yet best tasting coffee cake recipes I've ever made.  It uses boxed cake mix, and a box of instant pudding.  It's rich, moist, and a hit everywhere I bring it!
