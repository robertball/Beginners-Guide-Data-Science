Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces
6  red potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 cups carrots, cut into bite-size chunks
1 cup mixed red, yellow, and orange bell peppers, cut into bite-sized chunks (optional)
2  onions, cut into chunks
4 tablespoons Thai red curry paste (such as Maesri Masaman Curry(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 tablespoon fresh ginger paste (such as Gourmet Garden(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
2 teaspoons fresh lemongrass paste (such as Gourmet Garden(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
2 (14 ounce) cans coconut milk, divided
2 cups chicken stock, such as (Kitchen Basics(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
Â¼ cup peanut butter
4 tablespoons lemon juice
3 tablespoons fish sauce, or more to taste
2 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste
1 cup dry roasted peanuts, chopped, divided
6 cups cooked jasmine rice

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet. Add chicken pieces in batches, cooking until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place browned chicken in the bottom of a slow cooker. Place potatoes, carrots, and bell peppers on top of the meat in the slow cooker.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the skillet and add onion. Cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add to slow cooker. Add red curry paste, ginger paste, and lemongrass paste to the skillet and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in 1 can coconut milk; reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer until reduced by half, about 10 minutes.
Whisk in remaining 1 can coconut milk, chicken broth, and peanut butter. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until liquid begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce over ingredients in the slow cooker; stir gently to combine.
Set slow cooker to Low and cook until vegetables are tender and chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 4 to 6 hours.
20 minutes before serving season with lemon juice, fish sauce, and brown sugar. Stir in 1/2 cup of chopped peanuts. Serve with hot cooked rice and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup of peanuts.
