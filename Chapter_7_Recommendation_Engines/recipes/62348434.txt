Ingredients:
1 cup stone ground grits (I used Riverview Farms - a local farm outside of Atlanta)
2 cups of skim milk
2 cups of Tomato and Roasted Red Pepper Soup (I use Trader Joe's Brand)
1 Roma Tomato
Olive Oil spray
Kosher Salt and Fresh Cracked Pepper, to taste
2 TBS light butter
2 TBS Gourmet Garden Italian Blend herbs (in the tube)
1/4 cup grated Parmesan
Fresh basil leaves to top with

Directions:
Clean your Roma Tomato and slice it in half.  Spray both sides with olive oil and pop it in the oven at 375 degrees until hot and bubbly (15 - 20 mins).
Combine your milk and soup in a large pot and bring to a boil
Add your grits and bring back to a boil
Lower the heat to a slow simmer and cover, stirring occasionally for 20 minutes
Once a creamy consistency is reached, add your butter, herbs, and Parmesan
Remove your tomatoes from the oven and rough chop
Toss into the grits and stir

Description: 
Good Southerners know there are no such things as instant grits.  Cook them slow, low, and enjoy the Southern version of Polenta.
