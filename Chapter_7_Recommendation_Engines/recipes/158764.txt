Ingredients:
30 pitted green olives
10 slices bacon, cut into thirds

Directions:
Wrap each olive with a piece of bacon and secure with a toothpick.
Preheat a grill for medium heat. When hot, lightly oil the grate.
Grill the olives until the bacon has crisped, about 10 minutes. Turn frequently and keep a spray bottle handy in case of flare-ups from the bacon grease. Remove to a paper towel lined plate to absorb any excess grease.

Description: 
Absolutely delicious and surprisingly simple recipe! How can only TWO ingredients be so fantastic? The two may not sound like a match, but you will be in love after one bite!  Great appetizer - for parties, tailgating and more. I get requests for this at all of our get togethers.
