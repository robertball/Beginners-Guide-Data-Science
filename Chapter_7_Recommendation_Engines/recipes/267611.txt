Ingredients:
2 cups broken wheat vermicelli
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup peanuts
1/4 cup cashews (optional)
6 green chile peppers, chopped
1 large clove garlic, minced
1 (1 inch) piece ginger, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
1 large onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon salt, or to taste
4 1/2 cups water

Directions:
Heat a deep, dry skillet over medium heat. Add vermicelli; cook and stir until lightly toasted, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
Heat oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add peanuts and cashews to the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
Add chiles, garlic, ginger, cumin seeds, and mustard seeds to the skillet. Cook and stir until chiles are slightly tender, 1 to 3 minutes. Add onion and salt. Cover and cook until onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes more. Add water and bring to a boil. Add vermicelli, peanuts, and cashews to the skillet and stir continuously to avoid lumps, about 1 minute.
Reduce heat to a simmer, cover skillet with a lid, and cook until smooth, about 5 minutes more.
