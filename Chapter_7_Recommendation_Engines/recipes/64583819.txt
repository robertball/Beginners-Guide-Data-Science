Ingredients:
1 pound bacon (I use Kirklands low sodium)
4 medium onions, chopped
2 poblano peppers, chopped (you could add a few jalapeños)
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 T. tomato paste
¼ c. brown sugar
¼ c. apple cider vinegar
2 t. espresso powder
½ t. salt
¼ t. pepper

Directions:
Chop bacon into ½ inch pieces.
Fry until almost crisp.
Add in onion, poblano and garlic.
Stir over medium heat until onions are transluscent and peppers have lost their bright green color, about 15-20 minutes.
Add in remaining ingredients and reduce heat to very low simmer and continue to cook for one hour, stirring every 5 minutes.
Color should darken and the liquid should cook in and all vegetables should become very soft.
Pulse mixture in a food processor leaving still semi-chunky or using an immersion blender right in the pot.
Simmer 15 minutes more.
Jar or transfer to container to cool.
Serve warm over burgers with guacamole, lettuce and tomato.
