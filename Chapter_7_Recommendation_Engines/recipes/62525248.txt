Ingredients:
250 grams of bacon
2 cups asparagus
1 10 oz package frozen spinach
3 cloves garlic minced(optional)
2 tablespoons lemon zest
2 cups alfredo sauce
454 grams rotini
1/2 Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Fry the bacon and put aside.  Drain the fat reserving 1/4 cup. Fry the asparagus, garlic and spinach (make sure you squeeze the water out of the spinach first) in the bacon fat.  When the asparagus is soft add the lemon zest, bacon and alfredo sauce and bring to a simmer.  If the sauce is too thick you can add some chicken broth or water.
Cook the pasta according to directions.  Serve the sauce on top of the pasta (it's very thick) and sprinkle with Parmesan.

Description: 
A delicious pasta dish with bacon, spinach, asparagus and a hint of lemony goodness. The sauce is alfredo but it's almost unrecognizable.  This is one of my 5 year old's favourite suppers.
