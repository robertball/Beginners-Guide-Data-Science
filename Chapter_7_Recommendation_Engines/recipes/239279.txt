Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups white sugar
1 cup canned pumpkin puree
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 1/2 tablespoons molasses
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 cup toasted almond slices, divided
1/2 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Beat sugar, pumpkin, vegetable oil, eggs, and molasses together in a large bowl. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ground ginger together in another bowl. Add flour mixture to pumpkin mixture and stir until batter is well-combined.
Stir 2/3 of the almonds and 3/4 of the chocolate chips into batter. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan; sprinkle remaining almonds and remaining chocolate chips over the top of the loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
