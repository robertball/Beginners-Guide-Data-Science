Ingredients:
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1 teaspoon mild curry powder
1 teaspoon lemon juice
2 pinches ground ginger
2 (4 ounce) salmon fillets
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine cream, curry powder, lemon juice, and ginger in a skillet and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and slide salmon into the cream. Cover and simmer until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 12 minutes depending on the thickness of the fillets. Flip 1 to 2 times while cooking. Season with salt and pepper.
