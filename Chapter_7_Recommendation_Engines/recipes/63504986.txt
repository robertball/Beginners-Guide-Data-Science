Ingredients:
6 Large Bananas (Green Tip)
6 Eggs
2 Tbsp Vanilla Extract
3 Tbsp Extra Virgin Coconut Oil
1/2 Tsp Salt
1/2 Tsp Baking Soda
1 Tsp Cinnamon
1/2 Cup Chopped Walnuts
*1 Tsp Coconut Oil (For Cooking)

Directions:
Peel & cut bananas (any size).  Place pieces in a mixing bowl.  You may also put in blender or food processor, but I prefer to use a mixing bowl with mixer so the eggs make it more fluffy.
Get your griddle or pan heated with the coconut oil.  If using a griddle heat to about 325.  You're going to want to have this ready as soon as the pancakes are mixed.  The bananas tend to get dark very soon so don't waist time to put on the heat.
Add the eggs, vanilla, coconut oil, salt, and baking soda and mix well and forms a smooth batter.
With your ladle place gently batter on griddle/pan.  Sprinkle cinnamon and place chopped walnuts on batter.  Let cook well, these will take a little longer than flour batter to set.
When ready flip carefully and cook on the second side for about 4 minutes.  Repeat with remaining batter, * add a little more coconut oil to your griddle/as needed.
Serve HOT AND ENJOY!!

Description: 
My smallest LOVES pancakes but, I HATED to constantly make him those enriched flour and unhealthy pancakes.  So, as I entered my journey into Paleo I discovered these absolutely heavenly pancakes and have modified the recipe to make them even more perfect.  Now, I don't have to feel like a bad mom when I make him his favorite almost everyday :0)
