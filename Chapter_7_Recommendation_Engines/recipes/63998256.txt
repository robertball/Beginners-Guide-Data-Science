Ingredients:
1 can coconut milk
1sm can tomato paste
1 t ginger
1 T cumin
1/2 t salt
1 t pepper
1 t garlic powder
1 t onion powder
1 t paprika
1 T lemon juice
1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs
1 T olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350*. Use olive oil and rub baking dish. Take all of your ingredients, except the chicken thighs and add to a mixing bowl. Whisk them together until smooth and creamy. (Some of my family adds diced white or yellow onion at this point).
Take your chicken thighs and cube the meat. (My aunt likes to brown her chicken but I do not). Place the cubed chicken into your baking dish and then cover with the sauce from the mixing bowl. Make sure that the sauce covers the chicken completely. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and let sit for a few while you clean up.
Place dish in your heated oven and let cook for thirty minutes. Take off foil cover and turn temperature up to 400* and let cook for ten more minutes.
Take out of the oven and stir until creamy again.
Serve with rice, naan, vegetables or whatever tickles your fancy and enjoy!
