Ingredients:
2 EGGS
1 BUNCH FRESH CILANTRO – CUT INTO 3 inch SECTIONS
1 RED CHILI PEPPER – CHOPPED INTO 1/4 inch PIECES
1 GREEN CHILI PEPPER – CHOPPED THE SAME WAY
1 RIPE TOMATO, DICED
4-5 CLOVES OF GARLIC, HALVED
1/4 RED ONION, MINCED/DICED
1/4 t Chinese 5 spice mix
4 T Hot Chili sauce (or sweet chili sauce depending on your tastes)
1 1/2 t Chicken boullion
1 medium handful of bean sprouts (your choice)
2 CUPS RICE – before steaming

Directions:
First get the rice in the steamer, then chop and slice the vegetables.
Whisk the eggs and then scramble in a wok with a little oil, (I used sesame oil) over medium-high heat.
Remove the eggs and set aside. Then sauté the vegetables, excluding the sprouts, in the oil. Add the seasonings and let simmer while waiting for the rice steamer to finish (about 20 minutes total).
Add the sprouts and eggs to the vegetables while you are spooning the rice into bowls. When the sprouts are limp (about 2-3 minutes), spoon the vegetable mixture over the rice.

Description: 
Dan chao fan (Egg fried rice) with a twist. Added some heat and cilantro, chicken bullion and bean sprouts. The result was a smooth tasting, but not over-the-top spicy recipe that really hit the mark.
