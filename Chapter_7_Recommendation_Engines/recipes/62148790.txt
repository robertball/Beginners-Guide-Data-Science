Ingredients:
Chicken:
8 Boneless, skinless chicken breasts
6 Tablespoons of olive oil
1 Cup of bread crumbs
1 Teaspoon oregano
1/2 Teaspoon of garlic salt
Salt and Pepper to taste
Tomato Sauce:
2 14 ounce cans of diced or chopped tomatoes
2 Teaspoons of sugar
1/2 Teaspoon of oregano
1 Teaspoon of basil
1 Teaspoon of garlic salt
Salt and Pepper to taste
6 Ounces of Pepperoni
3 Cups of mozzarella cheese, shredded.

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 325 degrees.
Take boneless, skinless chicken breasts and pound with a mallet until about 1/2 an inch thick. This is most easily done in a zipper bag, or with sheets of wax paper.
Combine bread crumbs, oregano, garlic salt, salt and pepper.
Coat each breast in crumbs.
Brown chicken in olive oil. Brown each side for about 4 minutes. Add a little olive oil before each new breast.
Combine tomatoes, sugar, oregano, basil, garlic salt, salt and pepper. Make sure to taste and add more spice if needed.
Cook tomato sauce over medium low heat, until hot. The longer it stews the more flavor it will have.
Place the chicken breasts into a 9x13 pan. Depending on how big the breasts are, you may need 2 of these pans.
Gently pour tomato sauce over beasts.
Cover each breast with several pepperonis.
Lastly, cover breasts in mozzarella cheese.
Place in center of the oven for 20 to 30 minutes, just until the cheese melts. Leaving in too long will cause the cheese to burn.
Serve plain, or over your favorite pasta.
