Ingredients:
1 medium onion, chopped
1 (10 ounce) package frozen cut okra
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1 (20 ounce) package frozen corn
1 tablespoon file powder
1/2 tsp liquid smoke (opt)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Saute the onion in water until half done and add okra. Fry until tender and browned, stirring constantly. Be careful, as this tends to brown quickly.
Pour in the tomatoes, and simmer over medium heat for 10-20 minutes. Mix in the corn, and simmer for another 10 minutes. Season with file powder, smoke if using, salt and pepper, and serve.
