Ingredients:
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
1/4 cup flour
1/4 tsp garlic powder (or more, to taste)
1/4 tsp onion powder (or more, to taste)
1/8 tsp of dried yellow mustard powder
1 cup ricemilk or soymilk
1 1/2 tablespoon of margarine (I highly suggest Earth Balance)
salt to taste

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix dry ingredients. Add ricemilk or soymilk and whisk until lumps are gone.
In a medium pot, add the 1 1/2 tablespoons of 'butter' and allow it to melt before adding the mixture. Keep over medium heat, whisking continually, until the sauce thickens.
Cook for about 1-2 minutes longer, making sure the flour in the sauce loses its "raw" taste.

Description: 
My boyfriend and I are dairy-free--he having no choice in the matter because of a severe casein allergy. This creamy cheese sauce is not only dairy-free, but extremely YUMMY and a great base recipe--you can do just about anything with it! Add a dash of cumin to add that smokey cheddar taste for mac and cheese, add more garlic, butter, and parsley for alfredo, or add a can of tomatoes and green chilies to make a that staple Queso dip!
