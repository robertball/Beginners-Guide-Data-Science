Ingredients:
3/4 cup pecans coarsely chopped
3 tbsp butter
2 tbsp maple syrup
salt and pepper
2 shallots, minced
2/3 tsp orange zest
pinch of cayenne pepper
2 tsp all-purpose flour
1 1/2 lbs green beans
2/3 cup chicken broth
1/3 cup orange juice
1 tsp minced sage

Directions:
Toast pecans over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant (3 minutes). Remove from heat, and stir in 1 tbsp butter, maple syrup, and a dash of salt. Return to medium heat and cook, stirring constantly until nuts are dry and glossy (45 seconds). Transfer to plate, and set aside.
Wipe out pan, and melt remaining butter over medium heat. Add shallots, orange zest, cayenne and cook, stirring occasionally, until shallots are soft (2 minutes). Stir in flour, then add green beans. Add chicken broth, orange juice and sage. Increase heat to medium-high, cover and cook until beans are crisp-tender (4 minutes).
Uncover and cook, stirring occasionally, until beans are tender and sauce has thickened slightly (4 minutes).
Remove from heat. Salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle pecans and serve.
