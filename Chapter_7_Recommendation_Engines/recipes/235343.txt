Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1/2 cup shredded coconut
1/2 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line are large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl.
Beat butter, peanut butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Beat eggs, 1 at a time, into butter mixture, beating well after each addition, until smooth and creamy.
Stir oats into butter mixture until incorporated. Stir coconut into butter mixture until incorporated; fold in chocolate chips. Stir butter mixture into flour mixture until dough is smooth.
Roll about 1 tablespoon dough per cookie in your hands and arrange balls on baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Press each ball with a flour-coated fork to flatten dough.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
