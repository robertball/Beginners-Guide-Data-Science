Ingredients:
1 (18 ounce) bottle honey teriyaki barbeque sauce
½ cup Worcestershire sauce
¼ cup honey
3 dashes liquid smoke flavoring
1 ½ tablespoons grated fresh ginger
6 cloves crushed garlic
8  habanero peppers, seeded and minced
4  green chile peppers, chopped
3 tablespoons finely grated raw horseradish
18  chicken wings, separated at joints, tips discarded

Directions:
In a medium saucepan mix together barbeque sauce, Worcestershire sauce, honey, liquid smoke, ginger, garlic, habanero peppers, green chile peppers, and horseradish. Simmer 1 hour over low heat, stirring occasionally.
Place chicken wings in a large bowl, and coat with 3/4 of the sauce. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours.
Preheat grill for low heat.
Lightly oil grate. Discard marinade, and place chicken on the grill. Cook over low heat for 45 minutes to 1 hour, turning occasionally, until juices run clear. Transfer chicken to a slow cooker for serving, and stir in the remaining sauce. Set to the Low setting to keep chicken warm while serving.
