Ingredients:
64 ounces canned sliced peaches with juice
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 cup white sugar
1 cup butter, softened
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x14-inch baking dish.
Pour peaches and juice into a bowl; stir in lemon juice.
Mix sugar and butter together in a large bowl. Strain the juice from peaches into sugar-butter mixture and stir well. Stir flour, milk, vanilla extract, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, respectively, into butter-peach juice mixture until batter is evenly combined; pour into the prepared baking dish. Spoon peaches evenly over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until cobbler is lightly browned and bubbling, about 1 hour.
