Description: 
This is a great no-cook summer entertaining recipe.

I love these Tomato and Mozzarella Bites all summer long. They are perfect for guests at our lake house and easy to assembly. Everyone can enjoy their own on their way for a boat ride. And the other hand is free for a glass of wine!

Paleo entertaining at its bestâ€¦
Enjoy
