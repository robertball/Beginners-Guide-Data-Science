Ingredients:
1 egg
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon mustard powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
6 hamburger buns, split and toasted

Directions:
Mix the egg, jalapeno peppers, and garlic in a large mixing bowl until the egg is well blended. Add the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, cumin, mustard, paprika, chili powder, salt, bread crumbs, and turkey; mix well and form into 6 patties.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Cook the turkey burgers on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve on the toasted hamburger buns.

Description: 
These spicy burgers are full of flavor and smell amazing. They stand on their own, but onions or roasted peppers give them even more of a kick! Ground chicken also works great if you want to substitute the turkey.
