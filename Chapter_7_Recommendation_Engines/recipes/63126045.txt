Ingredients:
1 cup water
2 cinnamon sticks
1 heaping tablespoon apple chopped into small pieces
2 pinches of cardamom
1 teaspoon sugar
1 drop vanilla extract

Directions:
Bring water to boil.
Working quickly so that the water doesn't get cold, crush up one of the cinnamon sticks into small pieces.
In a tea strainer, combine the cinnamon stick, apple, and cardamom.
Pour the hot water into a mug and place the strainer into it.
Stir in the sugar and one small drop of vanilla extract.
Keep the tea strainer in the water for at least 5 minutes before taking it out, just so that the tea has the most flavor.
When 5 or more minutes is up, take the strainer out and place the other cinnamon stick into the mug.
Serve immediately.
