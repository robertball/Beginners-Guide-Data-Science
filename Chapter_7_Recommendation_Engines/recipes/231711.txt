Ingredients:
1/2 pound bacon, cut into small pieces
1 onion, cut into small pieces
2 (15 ounce) cans kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir bacon and onion in pot until the onion is tender, 7 to 10 minutes; add ketchup, dry mustard, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, salt, and black pepper.
Reduce heat to low and cook bean mixture at a simmer until hot, about 10 minutes; pour into a large casserole dish.
Bake in preheated oven until bubbling on top, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is a recipe that has been in my family for years. It's a great combination of sweet and spicy! If you like your beans saucy, you can double the sauce mixture.
