Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups medium shredded coconut
1/8 cup honey
1 egg white, beaten
1/4 tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp cornstarch
1 tbsp whole wheat flour
1 1/2 dark chocolate bars (about 1 cup melted)

Directions:
In a double boiler or microwave, melt the chocolate, stirring occasionally, until almost all chunks are melted. Continue stirring, away from heat, until all chunks have melted.
Meanwhile, mix together all other ingredients. Form into small balls with your hands. If you find mixture is crumbling too much, you may need to add more flour.
Bake coconut balls in a preheated 350C oven for 10 minutes or until lightly golden brown on tops and bottoms.
Allow to cool, then dip in the melted chocolate, coating thoroughly, and tapping off the excess with a fork against the side of the bowl/pot. Place on a piece of parchment paper or a plate and chill until chocolate is hardened.
