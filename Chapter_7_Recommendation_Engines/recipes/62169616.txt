Ingredients:
1 cup rice flour
1 cup plain flour (maida)
½ cup wheat flour (atta)
¼ cup gram flour (besan)
1 cup sour curds/yoghurt
1 pinch soda bicarbonate
1 teaspoon mustard (rai) seeds
1 pinch asafoetida (hing) powder
6- 8 chopped green chillies
3 small onions, finely chopped
Oil

Directions:
Mix all the flours with salt, curds, and water till you reach a thin batter consistency. Set aside for 15 minutes. Add the soda bicarb. Remember that the batter needs to be thinner than a typical dosa batter.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a small frying pan. Add mustard seeds and asafoetida powder. Now add the onions and green chillies and fry till onions are softened, about 3 minutes. Cool the onion mixture and add to the batter.
To make the dosas, heat a tawa (or flat griddle). Ladle the batter on one corner of the tawa and spread into a thin circle by  lifting and rotating the tawa, causing the batter to spread. This type of dosa is difficult to spread using a ladle as it has a tendency to tear easily. Gently grease with oil on the edges and the middle. Cook for a few minutes and flip over to the other side. Cook a few more minutes, transfer to a plate and serve immediately. Dosas are best eaten hot and crispy right off the tawa.

Description: 
This is a quick mixed dosa that I first ate at a friends’ house. It comes together very quickly for breakfast or when you have unexpected guests. It has a lot of flavour so all you need is some pickle or chutney powder on the side.
