1 teaspoon rubbed sage
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Rub one side of each chicken breast with herb mixture. Place chicken herb-side up in a baking dish, and pour broth over the chicken.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes.

Spread about 1 tablespoon of preserve mixture over each breast. Bake 10 minutes more.
