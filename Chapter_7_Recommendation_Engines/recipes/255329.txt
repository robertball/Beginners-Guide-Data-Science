Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (8 ounce) package frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 (8 ounce) loaves Italian country bread
8 eggs
1/2 cup half-and-half
1 pinch ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). (If using a countertop induction oven, preheat to 390 degrees F (199 degrees C) or use the "Combo 2" setting.) Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; arrange bacon slices on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is partially cooked through but not crispy, about 10 minutes in the conventional oven and 6 to 7 minutes in the countertop induction oven.
Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C); reduce countertop induction oven temperature to 325 degrees F (163 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add spinach; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until spinach turns dark green, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Cut four 2-inch holes 3/4 of the way through each loaf, evenly spaced apart, using a small serrated knife. Remove bread cutouts with your fingers; discard or set aside for another use.
Press 1 tablespoon of the spinach mixture into the bottom of each hole. Line each hole with 1 slice of bacon. Crack 1 egg into each hole; top with 1 tablespoon half-and-half. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese over half-and-half. Transfer loaves to a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
I was inspired by this simple recipe consisting of making holes in a loaf of Italian country bread and putting eggs in it. I decided to make it a little differently using bacon and spinach. This recipe was made in a Panasonic CIO and appears on an episode of the Dinner Spinner TV Show on The CW!
