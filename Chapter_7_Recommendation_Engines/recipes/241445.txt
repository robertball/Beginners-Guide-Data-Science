Ingredients:
3/4 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup honey
3 cups rolled oats
1 cup shredded coconut
2/3 cup sliced almonds
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/3 cup chopped pecans
1/3 cup flax seeds
2 tablespoons diced crystallized ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Combine coconut oil and honey together in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until smooth and melted, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat.
Mix oats, coconut, almonds, cranberries, pecans, flax seeds, crystallized ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl. Add coconut oil-honey mixture and stir to coat. Spread oat mixture in 1 even layer on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 minutes, until granola is dark brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool completely.

Description: 
The coconut oil and honey is a really tasty alternative to all the sugar in most granola recipes. The crystallized ginger also gives a nice chewy balance to the crunchy texture of this granola. Everyone that tries it asks me for the recipe!
