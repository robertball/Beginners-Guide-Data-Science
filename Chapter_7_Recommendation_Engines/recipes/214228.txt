Ingredients:
3 tablespoons paprika
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion salt
2 dashes red pepper, or to taste (optional)
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup fresh corn kernels
1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
2  green onions, chopped
1 (12 ounce) package dry fettuccini pasta
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Stir together the paprika, garlic powder, onion salt, and red pepper in a shallow bowl. Coat the chicken breasts with the seasoning, and set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the corn, grape tomatoes, and green onions until the tomatoes are soft and begin to release their juice, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Grill the seasoned chicken on the preheated grill until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and shows grill marks, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer the grilled chicken breasts to a platter and allow to stand about 5 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil; cook the fettuccini in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Combine the fettuccini, Cajun seasoning, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and any juices from the chicken in a large bowl; toss to coat evenly.  Slice the chicken diagonally across the grain. Divide the pasta between 4 plates and top each plate with sliced chicken and corn-tomato mixture.
