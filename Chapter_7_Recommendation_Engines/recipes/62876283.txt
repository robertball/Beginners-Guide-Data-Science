Ingredients:
2 1/2 Cups fresh peach puree (6-8 medium peaches, skinned and processed in a blender or food processor.
1/2 C. Butter
1 1/2 C. Sugar
2 Eggs
2 C. Flour
1/2 tsp. Cinnamon
1 tsp. Baking soda
1 tsp. Baking powder
1/4 tsp. Salt
1 tsp Almond extract
1 1/4 C. chopped Toasted Pecans, Walnuts or Hazelnuts
(I like a blend of Walnuts and Hazelnuts)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
In a large mixing bowl, with an electric mixer cream sugar and butter.
Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and continue beating until the mixture is light and fluffy.
Blend in the peach puree.
Stir in the dry ingredients and almond extract until the dry ingredients are blended.
Fold in the chopped nuts and mix well.
Pour into two 9x5 loaf pans that have been greased.  Bake at 325 degrees F for 50- 60 minutes.
I like to make a template of the loaf pan with parchment paper and grease or spray with baking release.
Remove from oven and cool ten minutes then remove from loaf pan and cool completely before cutting.

Description: 
Now that the Peach season is here, this recipe is really good for using those fresh peaches. When the season is over, just use canned peaches for the same delicious bread.  This was a big hit at our Tennis Round Robin Day.
