Ingredients:
5 tablespoons butter
3 medium ripe bananas, pureed
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon lemon zest
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 egg yolk

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add banana puree, brown sugar, lemon juice, vanilla extract, cinnamon, lemon zest, and salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.
Beat eggs and egg yolk in a bowl until foamy. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons hot banana mixture to temper the eggs. Slowly add egg-banana mixture to saucepan and cook, stirring constantly, until the back of a spoon is coated with the curd, 4 to 7 minutes.

Description: 
You could almost call this banana curd a dessert. It is delicious and so versatile. You can pour some on your cereal, top off your oatmeal, eat it with cookies or crackers, on toast, in a smoothie, over ice cream or even as a filling for cakes. Or you can eat it by the spoonful, just like my granddaughter does!
