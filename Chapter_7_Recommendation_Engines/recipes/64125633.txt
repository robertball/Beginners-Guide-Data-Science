Ingredients:
1 package dry cake mix-I used french vanilla, but you can use white or yellow
1/3 cup butter, room temperature
2 eggs
29 ounce can peach slices, drained-I used light peach slices
8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
1/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
In a large bowl combine  the dry cake mix, butter and 1 egg. Mix with a fork until crumbly. Remove 1 1/2 cups crumbs to a small bowl and reserve for topping.
Press the remaining crumbs onto the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Bake 10 minutes.
Cut peaches into 1-inch pieces and spoon onto partially baked crust.
In a mixing bowl beat together cream cheese, sugar, the other egg and vanilla on medium high until creamy. Spread over top of peaches.
Sprinkle with reserved crumbs and bake 30 minutes.
Chill 30 minutes in the refrigerator before serving. Cut into 12 squares.

Made from a cake mix and canned peaches, pretty much the simplest of my recipes. I created it in 2010 and have it on my blog at
