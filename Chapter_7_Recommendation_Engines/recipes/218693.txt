Ingredients:
16 saltine crackers, finely crushed
2 tablespoons water
1 pound flaked cooked crabmeat
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon prepared mustard
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®) (optional)
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 cup vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Stir the cracker crumbs and water together in a mixing bowl. Let stand 1 minute to soften the crackers. Add the crabmeat, egg, mustard, and mayonnaise. Season with Worcestershire sauce, seafood seasoning, salt, and black pepper; stir until evenly mixed.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Form the crab mixture into patties 3/4-inch thick. Cook in the hot oil until golden brown on each side and hot in the center, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.
