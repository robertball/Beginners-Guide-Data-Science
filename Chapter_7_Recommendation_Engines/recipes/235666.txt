Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup low-fat vanilla yogurt
1/2 cup canola oil
1 egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 ripe pear - peeled, cored, and diced
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease or line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
Whisk whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk yogurt, oil, egg, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until smooth. Stir yogurt mixture into flour mixture until batter is just mixed; fold in pear and pecans. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Place muffin tin in the preheated oven; reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake until tops of muffins are browned and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
