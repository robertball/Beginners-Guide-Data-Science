Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
3/4 cup long-grain white rice
3/4 teaspoon cumin
3/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup canned diced tomatoes
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
3/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
12 ounces frozen cooked shrimp without tails, thawed
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 teaspoons pureed chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
6 (10 inch) flour tortillas, warmed
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/3 cup salsa

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook until tender, stirring frequently. Stir in rice, and season with cumin and 3/4 teaspoon of garlic salt. Cook and stir until the rice is lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth and the diced tomatoes. Bring to a boil, then cover and cook over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until all of the liquid has been absorbed.
In a small saucepan, stir together the refried beans, 3/4 teaspoon of garlic salt, and black pepper. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until heated through.
Place shrimp in a bowl, and stir in garlic until shrimp is coated. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with cooking spray.  Saute shrimp until heated through and lightly browned.
In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, mayonnaise, and chipotle peppers until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Place about 1/4 cup of cheese onto each warm tortilla. Then place about 1/2 cup of shrimp on the cheese. Top with 1/4 cup of beans, and 1/4 cup of rice. Spread on about a tablespoon of the chipotle sauce, and salsa to taste. Roll up, and serve.

Description: 
I worked at a Mexican restaurant that specializes in Baja dishes, and became addicted to this burrito... I moved away, so I had to create my own. The Chipotle Sauce is what makes it oh so yummy!
