Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons lemon zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup toasted hazelnuts
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 tablespoons lemon marmalade

Directions:
In a mixing bowl beat butter and 1/2 cup sugar with an electric mixer until smooth.  Beat in lemon peel and vanilla.
In a food processor, finely grind flour, nuts, salt and cinnamon.  Add to butter mixture and mix just until dough holds together.
Gather dough into a ball and flatten into a disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill for about 1 hour or until firm.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Butter cookie sheet.
Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch thick.   Cut out cookies with a 3-inch round cookie cutter.  Gather scraps into a ball and re-roll to 1/4-inch thick.  Cut out cookies, forming total of 12.  Transfer cookies to the cookie sheet.
Using a 1-inch round cookie butter, cut out the center of 6 cookies and remove.  Bake about 20 minutes or until golden.  Cool on rack for 5 minutes.
Leaving a 1/8-inch border, spread 1 1/2 teaspoons of marmalade   evenly over each cookie without a hole.    Sift additional powdered sugar over cookies with holes.  Place cookies with holes sugar side up atop jam-covered cookies.
