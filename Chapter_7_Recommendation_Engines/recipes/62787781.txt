Ingredients:
1 tube sugar cookie dough
2 8oz packages cream cheese softened
2/3 c packed brown sugar
1/2 T vanilla
2 large apples ~ I like yellow or green
1/2 c cinnemon chips
Cinnemon & sugar mixture
Nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Press sugar cookie dough into bottom of medium size cookie sheet and bake until light golden brown. Remove from oven & set aside to cool.
In medium bowl mix cream cheese, brown sugar & vanilla until smooth, mix in cinnemon chips.
Peel & thinly slice apples.
When cookie is completely cool spread cream cheese mixture over cookie & layer with apple slices.
Sprinkle with cinnemon & sugar mixture & lightly sprinkle with nutmeg. This not only tastes great but keeps the apples from browning.
Cut into squares and serve immidiately or refridgerate for later. Bars cut a little easier and are firmer if refridgerated first.
