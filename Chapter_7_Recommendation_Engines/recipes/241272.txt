Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup rolled oats (not instant or quick oats)
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup packed light or dark brown sugar
1 cup Mott'sÂ® Cinnamon Applesauce
2 large eggs
2 cups finely shredded carrots
1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
1/4 cup shredded sweetened coconut

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a standard 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.
Whisk the flour(s), oats, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and nutmeg together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
With a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or an electric hand mixer, beat the butter and sugar together on medium speed for about 3 minutes until a thick paste forms. Scrape the beaters and the bowl.
Add the applesauce and eggs and beat on medium-low speed until the sugar paste breaks up and a loose batter forms. Stir in the carrots, walnuts, and coconut.
Gently stir in the flour mixture just until it is incorporated--don't over mix. The batter will be very thick.
Divide the batter evenly between the 12 muffin cups, mounding it to the brim of each paper liner.
Bake for about 25 minutes, until the muffins are browning on top. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
