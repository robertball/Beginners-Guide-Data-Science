Pork Tenderloin with Steamed Kale Recipe

Ingredients:
2 limes
1 cup olive oil
2 teaspoons dried cilantro
1 teaspoon cracked peppercorns
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 2-lb pork tenderloin
1 lb. fresh kale

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Juice the two limes into a small bowl, and add the spices.  Whisk in olive oil.
Brush the pork tenderloin with three tablespoons of this dressing.  Wrap the tenderloin in aluminum foil, place on a flat baking dish and roast at 350 degrees for 30 minutes per pound, or until a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees.
While the tenderloin is cooking, wash the kale and remove the tough stems.  Tear the leaves into manageable handfuls and place into the top of your steamer (a pan shaped like a double boiler, but the top pan has holes in its bottom) or in an all-metal colander set into a larger pan, and fill the bottom pan with 1 1/2" of water.  Cover and heat at high temperature until boiling.  Reduce heat to maintain a gentle boil and steam for twenty minutes or until the greens are tender.
Whisk the remaining dressing to make sure it is still emulsified.  Slice the pork tenderloin into 1 1/2" thick medallions.  Serve the medallions on top of the kale, and drizzle with the remaining dressing.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite meals: pork tenderloin medallions atop crisp steamed greens, drizzled with a robust olive oil and lime juice dressing.  It is wonderful served with brown rice on the side and the white or blush wine of your choice.
