Ingredients:
1 bulb garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
1/3 cup diced prosciutto
1/3 cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as Ocean Spray® Craisins®)
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
kosher salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Slice off the top part of garlic bulb so tops of cloves are exposed; place garlic bulb in an oven-safe ramekin. Pour 2 tablespoons olive oil over garlic bulb. Cover ramekin with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until cloves are soft and browned, 30 to 45 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Place Brussels sprouts, prosciutto, and cranberries in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour in 3 tablespoons olive oil, chicken broth, and balsamic vinegar; toss to coat. Season with salt and black pepper.
Squeeze the softened garlic cloves into a small bowl and mash slightly. Add mashed garlic to Brussels sprouts mixture; mix well.
Bake in the preheated oven until sprouts are browned, about 30 minutes.
