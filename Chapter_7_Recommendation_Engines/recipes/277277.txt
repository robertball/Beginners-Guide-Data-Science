Ingredients:
4 slices sandwich bread, torn into small pieces
1/3 cup milk, or more as needed
2 1/4 pounds lean ground beef
3 (4.5 ounce) cans Vienna sausage, minced
6 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup grated Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup minced sweet pickles
1 red bell pepper, minced
1 (1.5 ounce) box raisins (optional)
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
aluminum foil

Directions:
Place bread in a large bowl and pour milk over top, just until pieces are moistened; soak for several minutes. Add ground beef, Vienna sausage, eggs, Cheddar cheese, pickles, bell pepper, raisins, salt, and pepper. Mix together until thoroughly combined.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of beef mixture to the hot skillet; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 4 to 6 minutes. Taste and add salt and pepper if necessary.
Press remaining beef mixture into 2 loaf pans and cover with aluminum foil.
Fill the water reservoir of a steamer and place loaf pans in the steam tray, using multiple tiers if necessary. Steam meatloaves  until no longer pink in the center, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Allow loaves to cool to room temperature and then place in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Slice loaves into 1/2-inch slices and fry in a hot, nonstick skillet.
