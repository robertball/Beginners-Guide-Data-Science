Ingredients:
1/2 cup pecan halves
1 pound unsalted butter, softened
1/4 cup clover honey

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pecan halves on a baking sheet.
Bake pecans in the preheated oven until toasted, 5 to 8 minutes. Let cool to room temperature; chop.
Place chopped pecans and butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Blend for 3 to 5 minutes, stopping as needed to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Reduce speed to low and add honey. Blend until well mixed. Transfer mixture to a serving dish or bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.
