Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 red bell pepper, finely chopped
1/2 white onion, finely chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, minced, or to taste
4 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 dash adobo seasoning sauce (such as Frontera® Chipotle Pepper Adobo) (optional)
12 ounces soy chorizo (such as Trader Joe's®)
2 (16 ounce) cans tri-bean blend, drained and rinsed
1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, with juice
1 (14 ounce) can vegetable stock
1 sweet potato, peeled and diced

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add bell pepper, onion, and jalapeno pepper. Cook and stir until softened, about 6 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, chili powder, garlic salt, and adobo sauce. Stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add soy chorizo to the pan and break it up with a wooden spoon until crumbled, about 2 minutes. Add beans, tomatoes, vegetable stock, and sweet potatoes. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes soften and flavors meld, 45 to 60 minutes.

Description: 
I looked at a bunch of vegan chili recipes trying to find one that I really liked. This recipe is a remix/modification of a great recipe. 

I could probably double the soy chorizo, as it's my absolute favorite meat substitute and I can't get enough of it. Your mileage may vary. I also don't get too caught up on what should or shouldn't be in chili.
