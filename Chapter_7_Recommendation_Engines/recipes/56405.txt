Ingredients:
10 miniature fast food hamburgers without pickles
1 1/2 cups chopped celery
1 1/4 teaspoons ground thyme
1 1/2 teaspoons ground sage
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup chicken broth

Directions:
Tear the small hamburgers in to small pieces, and place in a large bowl. Toss with celery, thyme, sage, and pepper. Pour in the chicken broth while stirring to moisten the stuffing. Stuff into the cavity of a turkey just before roasting. This makes enough to stuff a 10 to 12 pound bird.
