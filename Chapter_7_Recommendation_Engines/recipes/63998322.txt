Ingredients:
2/3 cup cashews
1/3 cup water
1 cup water
1/4 teaspoon salt
few drops of hot-pepper sauce

Directions:
Process cashews in a blender until they are a fine powder.
Stop the blender and scrape the bottom. Add 1/3 cup of water and process until smooth (about 2 minutes).
Add remaining water and other ingredients and process 1 minute more.
Pour into a saucepan and bring to boil over medium heat while stirring constantly. Cook until the sauce is pleasantly thick (about 1 or 2 minutes).

Description: 
I use this creamy dairy-free grain-free sauce as the basis of many tasty variations (like a white sauce). It is so creamy and delicious that my husband actually tried to put it in his coffee as a creamer (not recommended!) (note 1).
