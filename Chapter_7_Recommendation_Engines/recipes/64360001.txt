Add remaining water little-by-little, stirring constantly until thick. Simmer, stirring often until reduced to the desired consistency.

Description: 
A substitute for the famous browning sauce. I made this up to use for pot Roast. It can be used anywhere Kitchen Bouquet is required or just to make tasty gravies. I use homemade, low sodium broth powder  in mine, but the popular prepared brands work just as well, it will offset your sodium though. I also use all vegan and gluten free ingredients.
