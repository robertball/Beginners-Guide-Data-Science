Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
4 green onions, chopped
1 head leaf lettuce - rinsed, dried and torn into bite-size pieces

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Place the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.
Add the chopped green onions to the bacon grease; cook and stir for about a minute or until the onions reach your desired tenderness. Pour the onions and bacon grease over the lettuce and toss lightly. Crumble the bacon and add it to the lettuce. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Growing up in the North Carolina mountains, everyone knew what killed lettuce was and how to fix it. This is my mom's recipe, and it is very simple and basic. In the south it is usually served with pinto beans and cornbread.
