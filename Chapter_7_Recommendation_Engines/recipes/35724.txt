Ingredients:
8 ounces ditalini pasta
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup chopped leek
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese
1 pinch black pepper (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Melt butter in a large skillet over low heat. Saute leeks and garlic until tender and translucent. Stir in cream, and simmer until thickened. Toss with pasta and cheese until evenly coated and cheese is melted. Season with pepper.

Description: 
While the small tubular Ditalini pasta isn't usually eaten on its own, it works well here with a number of strong flavors and a creamy sauce.
