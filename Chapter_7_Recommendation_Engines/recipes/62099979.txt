Description: 
A popular restaurant in Iowa serves these sandwiches, also known as loose meat.  Missing home, I've tried to recreate their recipe, this version comes as close to the original that I've ever tasted.  Simple, quick, and just a short list of ingredients make it feel like your sitting at the diner back home.
