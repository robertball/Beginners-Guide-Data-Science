Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa flour
1 cup rice flour
2 teaspoons xanthan gum
1 teaspoon dried basil (optional)
1 teaspoon dried rosemary (optional)
1 teaspoon dried oregano (optional)
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 egg yolk
1/3 cup water
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/3 cup rice flour, divided

Directions:
Mix quinoa flour, 1 cup rice flour, xanthan gum, basil, rosemary, oregano, and salt together in a large bowl; make a well in the center.
Whisk eggs and egg yolk together in a small bowl. Mix in water and olive oil. Pour into the well in the flour mixture; mix thoroughly until a dough forms.
Lightly dust a work surface with 2 1/2 tablespoons rice flour. Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 8 to 12 minutes. Cover dough and let rest, about 10 minutes.
Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Dust work surface with remaining 2 1/2 tablespoons rice flour. Roll each piece of dough into a square shape that is about 1/16-inch thick. Let dough rest, uncovered, for 20 minutes.
Roll each square of dough up loosely; slice into 1/4-inch pieces. Unroll noodles.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook noodles until tender yet firm to the bite, about 2 minutes.

Description: 
I made this one up myself when I was really wanting chicken and noodles. It's based on the Betty CrockerÂ® recipe.
 I use quinoa flour because of the increased nutritional content. Plus, as any GF person knows, we get real tired of the same old stuff constantly, and quinoa has a great flavor.
