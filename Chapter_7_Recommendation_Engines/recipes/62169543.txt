Description: 
A creamy shrimp and bean soup. When you are looking for some great comfort food with the flavor of Mexico, this is the one. My friends were vacationing in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and they were served this soup. This is our version of that wonderful soup. It has never failed to get rave reviews from friends and family.
