Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool WhipÂ®), thawed
1 cup crushed pretzels
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/3 cup white sugar

Directions:
Mix cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar together in a bowl; add pineapple and mix well. Fold whipped topping into pineapple mixture; refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.
Combine pretzels, butter, and 1/3 cup sugar in a bowl until evenly coated; spread onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until pretzel mixture holds together like toffee, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove pan from oven and cool. Break pretzel mixture into pieces and mix into pineapple mixture.

Description: 
Can be used for a party dip for pretzels or a side salad depending on your choice. I usually double this recipe for parties. If you want to use for a dip for pretzels, one batch should be enough. I recommend crushing the pretzels using a rolling pin. I recommend not to add pretzel mixture to pineapple mixture until ready to serve.
