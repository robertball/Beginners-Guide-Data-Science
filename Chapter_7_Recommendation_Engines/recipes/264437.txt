Ingredients:
For the Dressing:
1/2 cup champagne vinegar
3 tablespoons Boar's Head Real Mayonnaise
1 green onion, white and green parts, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons honey
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 small garlic clove, minced
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley leaves
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 cup canola oil
2 1/2 cups mixed salad greens
8 ounces Boar's Head Bold® BourbonRidge™ Uncured Smoked Ham, sliced thin
1 cup peaches, sliced thin
1/2 cup blueberries
1/2 cup raspberries
1/2 cup blackberries

Directions:
To make the dressing, combine the vinegar, mayonnaise, green onion, honey, Dijon mustard, garlic, lemon juice, dill, parsley, salt, and pepper in a blender or food processor with a metal blade. With the machine running, gradually add the oil in a thin, steady stream to form an emulsion. Set aside when complete.
