Ingredients:
cooking spray
Waffles:
1 cup milk
1/2 cup whole milk ricotta cheese
1 large egg
2 cups gluten-free pancake mix
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
Blueberry Sauce:
1 cup fresh blueberries
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Coat heated waffle iron with cooking spray or butter.
Whisk milk, ricotta cheese, and egg together in a large bowl until smooth; stir in pancake mix, coconut oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Mix batter until well combined.
Combine blueberries, sugar, and 2 teaspoons lemon juice in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir and reduce the heat to low, allowing blueberry sauce to simmer.
Pour 1/4 cup batter on the center of the waffle iron and close. Cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Pour blueberry sauce over the waffle. Repeat with remaining batter and sauce.
