Ingredients:
1. 2 small  9" French bread sliced 1" thick( I actually use 1 loaf  plain sandwich bread crust and all)
2. 6 eggs
3. 6 Tablespoons sugar
4. 2 Teaspoons vanilla
5. 4 122 cup milk
6. 1 cup flour
7. 12 tablespoons brown sugar
8. 1 teaspoon cinnamon
9. 1/2 cup butter
10 2-4 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
Maple syrup or flavored syrup
might want whole berries to decorate and/or use whip cream

Directions:
Grease large lasagna pan bigger than 9"x 13" with butter
Diagonally slice bread in 1" thick slices ...place in pan close together no spaces ..(if using regular sliced bread overlap the slices)..
In bowl beat 2. 3. 4. and stir in 5. blend together..pour over bread evenly cover and refridgerate overnight
In the AM might want to turn slices over ( I never did too busy in the AM and came out fine)
combine in bowl 6. 7. 8. and cut in 9. until coarse crumbs...place this mix over the bread evenly
Bake 375* 40 min uncovered  till golden brown
serve with maple or flavored syrup ..might fancy up with real whip cream and whole berries
