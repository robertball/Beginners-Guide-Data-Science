Ingredients:
24 ounces spinach artichoke dip, at room temperature
1 cup ricotta cheese
1 egg
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) package jumbo pasta shells
2 cups white sauce (such as bechamel)
1 cup shredded Gruyere cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine spinach artichoke dip and ricotta cheese in a bowl. Stir in egg, lemon juice, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper; mix until well-combined. Set aside.
Bring white sauce to a simmer over medium-low heat. Stir in grated Gruyere cheese until cheese is melted and incorporated into sauce, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in shells and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Set aside.
Pour half the white sauce mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish; spread evenly.
Stuff pasta shells with the spinach artichoke mixture and place in casserole dish atop the white sauce, stuffed-side up.
Pour remaining white sauce over the tops of the shells and sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and bubbling, about 25 minutes.
