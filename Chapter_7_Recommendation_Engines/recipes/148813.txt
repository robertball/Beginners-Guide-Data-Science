Ingredients:
14 small potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 tablespoon butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup minced red onion
3 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 cup 2% milk
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Lightly grease 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange potatoes over the bottom of the dish, and set aside.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion is transparent, about 5 minutes. Stir in 3 tablespoons butter until melted. Sprinkle the flour, salt, and pepper over the onion mixture. Cook and stir until mixture bubbles and thickens, about 2 minutes. Continue to stir the flour mixture while gradually pouring in the milk and buttermilk, and return the mixture to boiling. Stir in 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese; cook for 2 minutes until melted, and mixture is smooth. Pour the mixture over the potatoes in the baking dish, stirring to coat evenly.
Bake in preheated oven for 1/2 hour, and stir. Bake 1/2 hour longer, stir the potato mixture again, and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Bake for 20 minutes more.

Description: 
I created this potato dish when I had leftover ingredients to use up. They give a little subtle twist to scalloped potatoes, and may make you want seconds! They also reheat well, that is if you have leftovers...
