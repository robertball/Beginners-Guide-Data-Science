Description: 
The recipe for fish dipping sauce is definitely to taste. Any Viet Southerner would argue the ration of the Northern proportions (and vice versa).
Southern palates tend to be much sweeter, thus the tendency to make sweeter fish sauce. dip Southern flavors also tend to be more bold, spicy and sweet.
Northern palates are more mellow, balanced and normally I don't like sweet food, thus their fish sauce dips are less sweet.
