Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup water

Directions:
Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Stir in water to form a soft dough.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead several times. Divide into 8 pieces and roll each into a ball. Roll each ball into a very thin round using a rolling pin.
Heat a griddle over medium-high heat. Cook each dough round on griddle until dough bubbles and blisters appear, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until lightly browned on the other side.
