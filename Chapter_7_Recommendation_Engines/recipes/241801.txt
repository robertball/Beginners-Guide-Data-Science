Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's(<sup>&reg;</sup>)), or to taste
1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cut into cubes
4 slices Swiss cheese
4  honey-wheat tortillas
5  Campari tomatoes, sliced
1 cup fresh spinach, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Pour Buffalo wing sauce over tofu in a large bowl to cover completely and toss gently to coat; marinate tofu at least as long as it takes for your oven to reach temperature.
Remove tofu from the bowl and spread onto the prepared baking sheet. Coat top of the tofu cubes with extra sauce and spray with cooking spray.
Bake tofu in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip the cubes, spray tops again with cooking spray, and continue baking until firm, about 10 minutes more.
Put 1 slice Swiss cheese atop each tortilla; heat in microwave oven to melt the cheese, about 30 seconds.
Divide tomato slices between the tortillas; top with about 1/4 of the baked tofu and 1/4 of the spinach. Wrap tortillas around the fillings.

Description: 
Fast and easy. As a college student, I love being able to whip up my own spicy wraps that are relatively healthy and don't break my budget. And it has fewer calories than five wings! Dip wraps in ranch dressing, if desired.
