Ingredients:
2 lbs boiling potatoes with skins on sliced
2 C milk
1 1/2 C heavy cream
1 large clove garlic, minced
3/4 t salt
1 T butter, for dish
1/2 C Swiss cheese

Directions:
Slice the potatoes 1/8 inch thick into a large saucepan.  Add the milk, cream, garlic, and salt.  Bring the liquid to a boil over moderate heat,  stirring with a wooden spoon to prevent scorching.  Remove the pan from the heat.  Pour the potato mixture into a well-buttered gratin dish or shallow baking dish.  Sprinkle the grated cheese over the mixture and bake on a baking sheet in a preheated 400 degree F oven for about 1 hour.  The potatoes are done when they are nicely browned and the tip of a knife pierces a potato easily.  Let the dish stand fo 15-20 minutes before serving.
