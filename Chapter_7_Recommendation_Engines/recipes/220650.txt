Ingredients:
1/4 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 cups uncooked instant rice (such as Minute®)
2 1/4 cups chicken broth
1 cup vegetable juice (such as V8®)
1 1/2 teaspoons taco seasoning

Directions:
Cook and stir onion, garlic, and vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat until onions are softened, about 5 minutes.
Stir rice into onion mixture and cook, stirring often, until rice becomes slightly opaque, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir chicken broth, vegetable juice, and taco seasoning into rice mixture and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer over low heat until rice has absorbed most of the liquid, about 5 minutes.
