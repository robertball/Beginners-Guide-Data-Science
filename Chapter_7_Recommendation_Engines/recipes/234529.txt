Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
1 (16 ounce) can chili beans
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (10 ounce) container fresh restaurant-style salsa
1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning
1 (10.5 ounce) bag chili cheese flavored corn chips (such as FritosÂ®), crushed
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Stir chili beans, corn, salsa, olives, and taco seasoning into beef mixture and simmer until heated through and flavors blend, 10 to 15 minutes.
Spread about 2/3 the crushed corn chips into a baking dish and top with the beef mixture. Sprinkle remaining chips over beef.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle with Mexican cheese blend and continue baking until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes more.
