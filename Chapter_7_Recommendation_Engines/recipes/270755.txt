Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup brown rice
1 medium ear of corn
cooking spray
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1 (4 ounce) can black olives, drained
1/2 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®) (optional)
3 red bell peppers, stemmed and seeded

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine water and brown rice in a rice cooker. Cook according to manufacturer's instructions, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, husk corn and peel off the silk. Wrap in a damp paper towel and microwave for 5 minutes. Let cool for at least 1 minute. Cut kernels from the cob.
Grease a large skillet with cooking spray. Saute garlic until light brown, about 1 minute. Mix in brown rice, corn, tomato sauce, green onions, olives, taco seasoning, and hot sauce.
Spoon mixture into the bell peppers. Prop peppers up in a loaf pan so they don't fall over.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 40 minutes.
