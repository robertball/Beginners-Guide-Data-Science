Description: 
This is what we called 'Gobbledygook' when we were kids. It's actually a Southern version of very sweet, stewed tomatoes. It isn't the most attractive dish in the world, but it's delicious. Don't try making this with fresh tomatoes. It won't work. And you really do need that much sugar in there.
