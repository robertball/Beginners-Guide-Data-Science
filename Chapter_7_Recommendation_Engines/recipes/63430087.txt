Ingredients:
1 Tbsp Butter
Olive Oil

2 cups light cream
1 tbsp flour

Directions:
Drain clams-saving juice-rinse them then soak in cold salted water.
Cook linguine as package directs, add a dash of salt and dash of olive oil to the water.
While that is cooking saute onions, celery, orange pepper in butter with a splash of olive oil added.  When almost done add mushrooms and pressed garlic, cooking til just softened.
Add clam juice-a little less than all of it.
Whisk flour into cream then add that and clams.
Turn up heat and simmer maybe 10 mins.
Drain pasta and serve sauce on top.

Description: 
I wanted to make clam linguine but was missing an ingredient for every recipe I found. So I just went ahead and made my own version and my boyfriend LOVED it.  Most recipes seem to call for wine, which I did not have on hand, so this may also be good for folks who are avoiding alcohol. It's also quick to make and not too heavy.  I use canned clams as fresh are not readily available near me, so be sure to soak the clams first to remove the canned taste!
