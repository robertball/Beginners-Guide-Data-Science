Ingredients:
1, 9" or 10" un baked, (flaky) pie crust.
1 can sliced peaches in heavy syrup (or 10 slices of fresh peaches)
2/3 cup sugar
4 1/2 Tbsp flour
1/4th tsp salt
1/4th tsp cinnamon
1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Pre heat the oven to 400 degrees farenheight. Line a pie pan with the unbaked pie crust.  Arrange the peach slices on the bottom of the crust (if using canned peaches, sprinkle 2 Tbsp of the syrup from the can over the peaches as well)
In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, salt, cinnamon and cream.  Pour the mix gently over the peaches.  Let the pie sit out to thicken for 10 minutes then bake it in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until the top is golden and pie center does not giggle (like it isn't set) when it is moved around.
let the pie cool for at least 15 minutes before serving it. (It doesn't have to be refrigerated, only covered if it is being saved as a left over!)
