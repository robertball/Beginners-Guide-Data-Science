Ingredients:
1 pck Knorr (dry) vegetable soup
1 pck Philadelphia cream cheese
1 can (227 ml) water chestnuts
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 bag of spinach (at least 10 ounces)
1 large pumpernickle round bread

Directions:
Mince water chestnuts and set asside.  Shred spiach and set asside.  Mix all ingredients EXCEPT spinach.  Once mixture is creamy, add to spinach.
Cut the top and inside of the pumpernickle round bread, and place mixture inside.  I always leave the top whole, so I can cover - it's easier to carry.  Cut the inside part of the bread into pieces so people can use them to dip in the mixutre!  You can add a white baguette to the cut pieces for those who preffer white bread.
