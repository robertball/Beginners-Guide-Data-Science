Ingredients:
3/4 cup panko bread crumbs
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
1/4 cup chopped fresh chives
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 (6 ounce) halibut fillets

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Line a baking sheet with foil.
Combine panko bread crumbs, parsley, dill, chives, extra-virgin olive oil, lemon zest, sea salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Taste and adjust with more salt if desired.
Rinse halibut fillets and pat dry with a paper towel.
Place halibut fillets onto the prepared baking sheet.
Generously spoon the herbed crumbs over the fish, and lightly press crumb mixture onto each fillet.
Bake in the preheated oven until crumb topping is lightly browned and fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes.
