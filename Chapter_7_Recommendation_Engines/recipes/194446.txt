Ingredients:
Crispy Tortilla Strips:
3 (12 inch) flour tortillas
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
Chicken and Tomatillo Stew:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 cups peeled and diced sweet potatoes
1 cup chopped celery
3/4 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon finely minced garlic
1 tablespoon cumin
5 cups lower sodium chicken broth
2 1/2 cups shredded or chopped cooked chicken
2 cups diced tomatillos
2 fully ripened Avocados from Mexico, halved, pitted and diced
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
Ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
For Crispy Tortilla Strips: Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut 3 (12-inch) flour tortillas into 3/8-inch strips; cut strips into 2 inch pieces and toss with 1 tablespoon oil. Spread out on rimmed baking sheet; bake until crisp, about 7 minutes, tossing occasionally. Yields 8 servings (about 3 cups).
In large saucepan, heat oil. Add sweet potatoes, celery, onion, garlic and cumin; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Add broth, chicken and tomatillos; bring to boil; reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
Just before ready to serve, stir in 1 cup of the tortilla strips along with the Avocado and cilantro. Season with pepper, if desired.
Serve in bowls topped with remaining 2 cups tortilla strips and sour cream, if desired.
