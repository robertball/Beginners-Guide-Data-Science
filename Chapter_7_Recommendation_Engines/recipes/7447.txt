Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 1/2 cups sliced canned peaches, drained
6 cherries, pitted and halved
1/3 cup shortening
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 1/4 cups cake flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon orange zest
1/2 cup orange juice

Directions:
Spread butter or margarine in bottom of 8 inch round baking dish.  Sprinkle with brown sugar and arrange very well drained peaches and halved cherries on top.
In a large bowl, cream shortening and sugar together thoroughly.  Blend in unbeaten egg, and beat well.
In a separate bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt.  Add these dry ingredients to creamed mixture alternately with the juice.  Stir in orange rind until evenly distributed.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes, or until cake is done.  Allow cake to cool 5 to 10 minutes in the pan.  Invert over serving plate to remove cake, and allow syrup to drain a minute.
