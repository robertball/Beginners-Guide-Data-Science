Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
3 cups warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
3 tablespoons shortening
3 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
7 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the shortening, sugar, salt and 4 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Add the cheeses, garlic powder and onion powder. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Do not let rise. Divide in half; shape into two loaves. Place in two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Do no let rise. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool. Store in the refrigerator.
