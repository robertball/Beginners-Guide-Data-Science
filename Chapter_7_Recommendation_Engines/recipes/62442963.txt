Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
1 egg, beaten
1 cup milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a small bowl, mix together 1 cup brown sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon; set aside.
In large bowl combine flour, baking powder, salt and remaining 1 cup sugar.  Combine egg, milk, and oil; add to flour mixture.  Stir until just moistened.
Pour half of the batter into pan.  Sprinkle with half the reserved cinnamon/sugar mixture. Repeat with remaining batter and cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Draw a knife through batter to marble.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Wrap in foil and let sit overnight before slicing.
