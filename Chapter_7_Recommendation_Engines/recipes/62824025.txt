Ingredients:
3 zucchini
3 tablespoons butter, softened
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
The changes I made were:
2 zucchini
3--5 TB Butter
1 "around" of olive oil
1 "around" of sesame oil
2 cloves minced garlic, maybe a bit more
1 TB parsley
sesame seeds
salt and pepper
1/2 cup Grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 - 1-3 c Panko Breadcrumbs

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Slice ends off squash and then slice in half lengthwise. Scoop out seeds and pithy flesh leaving a shallow indentation on meat side. Dry well with paper towels and salt and pepper. Take a small slice off of the rounded skin side, this exposes the meat of the zucchini, then score lightly and salt again then baste with the butter mixture. Flip over and baste the meat side.
Place meat side down on grill for 4-5 minutes, basting once or twice. Flip squash then fill the indentations with the butter mixture. Then fill with the Parmesan/Panko mixture. Continue to cook another 8-10 minutes or til tender.
Using tongs and a spatula transfer to foil covered cookie sheet and slip under broiler for 3-4 minutes until golden brown. This step is a must for an attractive presentation I think!! It is lovely and crisp/tender

Description: 
Grilled zucchini slices get a savory, garlic and Parmesan cheese topping for a quick, savory side dish. This is a lovely way to use zucchini and I would definitely serve to company.Modified from: Grilled Garlic Parmesan Zucchini
