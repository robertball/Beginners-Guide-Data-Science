Ingredients:
4 pounds fresh tomatillos, husks removed
2 large onions (keep the skin on)
2 poblano peppers
1 head garlic
3 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
2 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles lager-style beer
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
4 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 pounds cubed lamb stew meat

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Arrange the tomatillos, onions, poblano peppers, and garlic on a baking sheet.
Cook the vegetables under the broiler until the skins are charred on the side facing the heater elements; turn the vegetables and continue cooking until equally charred, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
Remove and discard the root and outer skin from the onion and garlic; remove and discard the stem and seeds from the peppers.
Working in batches, combine some of the tomatillos, onion, poblano peppers, garlic, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, lager-style beer, cumin, salt, and pepper in a blender to about half full. Holding the lid in place, pulse a few times to get the mixture moving before leaving the blender on to puree to a smooth texture; pour into a slow cooker.
Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Cook and stir the lamb cubes in the hot oil until browned on all side, about 5 minutes; transfer to the slow cooker.
Cook on High for 4 hours.

Description: 
One Easter I was unable to find a leg of lamb to roast, as is traditional in my family. The best I could find was chunks of lamb, in my local Mexican market. So I decided to defy tradition and use the ingredients around me. Best Irish-Mexican Easter EVER! Serve with toasted flaked almonds, crumbled cotija cheese, and homemade croutons.
