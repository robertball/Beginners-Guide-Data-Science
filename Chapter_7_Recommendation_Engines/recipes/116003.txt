Ingredients:
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
1 (12 ounce) can fully cooked luncheon meat (such as SPAM®), cut into 1/4 inch slices
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Gently press the luncheon meat slices into the flour to coat and shake off the excess flour. Dip into the beaten egg, then press into bread crumbs. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded luncheon meat slices onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.
Deep fry the luncheon meat a few slices at a time until hot and golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel lined plate before serving.
