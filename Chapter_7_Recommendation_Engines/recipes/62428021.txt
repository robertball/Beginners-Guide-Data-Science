1 medium onion, diced
8 ounces mushrooms, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced

1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
1/2 cup light sour cream
1/2 cup light mayonnaise
1/2 cup low-sodium beef broth
6 ounces No Yolks egg noodles

Prepare noodles to package directions.
In a large skillet, over medium-high heat, saute ground beef, garlic, onion, mushrooms, mustard powder, salt and pepper until meat is browned and onion and mushrooms are tender. Drain off excess fat and liquid.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine sour cream, mayonnaise. Stir into beef mixture and let simmer about 10 minutes.
Plate noodles and top with stroganoff or mix noodles in and serve.

Description: 
I used 95-percent lean ground beef and sauteed it with fresh mushrooms and onion with garlic and mustard powder. You'll want to be sure to drain off any fat and the liquid from the mushrooms. I added a combination of low-fat sour cream, low-fat mayonnaise and low-sodium beef broth. The flavors of beef, mushrooms and sauce all came through individually and melded together wonderfully. And all for 322 calories with 13 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber.
