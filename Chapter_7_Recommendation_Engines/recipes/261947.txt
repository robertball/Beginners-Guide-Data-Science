Ingredients:
1 large onion, diced
1 pinch sea salt
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 dash garlic powder
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup water
1 large green bell pepper, diced
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chiles
6 tablespoons taco seasoning mix
1 cup cooked brown rice

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion with sea salt and cayenne pepper until softened, about 7 minutes. Add ground turkey and garlic powder; cook and stir until turkey is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Add black beans, water, green bell pepper, green chiles, and taco seasoning. Mix well. Reduce heat to low and let simmer with the lid on until flavors blend, 10 to 15 minutes.
Stir cooked rice into the turkey mixture; simmer until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand for 10 minutes.
