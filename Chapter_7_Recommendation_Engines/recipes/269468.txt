Ingredients:
1 cup confectioners' sugar, or more to taste
7 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup milk, or more as needed
1 1/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 teaspoon fine sea salt, or to taste

Directions:
Combine confectioners' sugar, butter, and milk in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in chocolate chips until melted. Reheat over low heat if frosting hardens too quickly; thin out with milk if needed. Add salt so frosting is sweet with a mild salty kick.
