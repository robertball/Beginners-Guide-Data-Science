Ingredients:
•	1 sheet 10x12 frozen puff pastry
•	8 eggs
•	1/2 cup milk
•	1/4 tsp salt
•	1/4 tsp white pepper
•	1 tbsp butter
•	4 oz cream cheese
•	2 tsp fresh chopped dill or 1/2 tsp dried dillweed
•	4 oz thinly slice smoke salmon
•	1/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
•	1 slightly beaten egg
•	1 tbsp water

Directions:
Preparation
Thaw puff pastry according to package directions. Lightly grease baking sheet; set aside.
In medium bowl beat together 8 eggs and season with salt and pepper. In large skillet bring butter and milk to a boil, add beaten eggs. Cook without stirring until mixture begins to set on bottom and around edge.
Using a spatula, lift and fold partially cooked eggs so uncooked portion flows underneath. Continue cooking about 2 minutes or until eggs are just set. Remove from heat. Dot with cream cheese, sprinkle with dill. Gently stir until combined.
Unfold pastry on a lightly floured surface; roll into a 17x12-inch rectangle. Place on prepared baking sheet (short sides may extend over sides of sheet). Arrange the smoked salmon crosswise down the center one-third of pastry to within 1 inch of top and bottom edges. Spoon scrambled eggs over salmon. Sprinkle with mozzarella. Combine the 1 egg and water; brush edges of pastry with egg mixture.
Fold a short side of pastry over filling. Fold remaining short side over top; seal. Seal ends well and brush top of pastry with egg mixture. Bake in a 375 degree oven about 25 minutes or until pastry is golden brown and filling is heated through.
