Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 pounds hot breakfast sausage
1 (2 pound) package frozen hash brown potatoes
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (7 ounce) can green chile peppers (optional)
8 large eggs
2 cups milk
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch dish with cooking spray.
Cook sausage in a large skillet, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain fat and transfer to a bowl.
Cook and stir hash browns to the same skillet until lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Place hash browns in the baking dish; top with sausage, shredded Cheddar cheese, and green chile peppers.
Whisk eggs, milk, salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder in a bowl. Pour over hash brown mixture.
Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until bubbly and the top is golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.
