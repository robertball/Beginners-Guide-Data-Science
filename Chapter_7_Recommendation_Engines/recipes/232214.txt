Description: 
This simple topping turns an average salad into something above and beyond! I pair these with my sweet sour salad dressing and they make an amazing salad!
 I like to make up a big batch of these and keep them on-hand in an airtight container to use as a salad topper. I like to toast my almonds to a nice medium-brown, they take on a bolder flavor and really mix well in any salad.
