Ingredients:
Brown Sugar Glaze:
1/2 cup catsup
4 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons white or cider vinegar
Meat Loaf:
1 medium onion, chopped
1/2 green pepper, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon season salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons prepared mustard
2 teaspoons Worchestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon Tobasco sauce
1/2 cup milk
2/3 cup quick cooking oats
1 pound ground beef
1/2 pound ground pork
1/2 pound ground veal (or use 1 pound veal & skip the pork)

Directions:
Combine glaze ingredients - stir, and set aside.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Place onion and green pepper in covered microwave container and cook for 1-2 minutes until softened. Set aside to cool.
In a large mixing bowl, stir together the garlic, eggs, thyme, salt, pepper, mustard, Worchestershire sauce, Tobasco sauce, milk and oats. Blend well. Add onions and green pepper. Add ground beef, pork and veal.
With gloved hands, work all ingredients together until completely mixed and uniform.
Pat mixture into two 9 x 5 inch loaf pans, or make one large loaf in a 9 x 13 inch pan. Spray pans with cooking spray or line with foil for easier clean up.
Brush loaves with 1/2 of the glaze.
Bake uncovered: 50 minutes for 2 loaves; 60 to 70 minutes for 1 large loaf. Remove from oven and brush with the remaining glaze. Return to oven for 10 minutes.
Remove from oven and allow meatloaf to "rest" for about 15 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
My Grandmother Nanaw Rowan made the most delicious meatloaf in the state.  When she passed away, she didn't leave me her recipe, but she left me the desire to recreate it.  I think this is it - in flavor and texture. Don't let the number of ingredients discourage you.  It's part of the magic in creating a masterpiece!
