6 ounces BAKER'S Dark Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bars
10 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar

3 whole eggs
3 egg yolks

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Grease 6 (6-oz.) custard cups or souffle dishes. Place on baking sheet.
Microwave chocolate and butter in large microwaveable bowl on MEDIUM (50%) for 2 min. or until butter is melted. Stir with wire whisk until chocolate is completely melted. Add powdered sugar and flour; mix well. Add whole eggs and egg yolks; beat until well blended. Divide batter evenly into prepared custard cups.
Bake 14 to 15 min. or until cakes are firm around the edges but soft in the centers. Let stand 1 min. Run small knife around cakes to loosen. Carefully invert cakes onto dessert dishes. Sprinkle lightly with additional powdered sugar and garnish with raspberries, if desired. Serve immediately.
