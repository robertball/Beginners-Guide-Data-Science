Ingredients:
2 ½ pounds leeks, white and light green part only
2 bay leaves
4 large sprigs fresh thyme
4 large sprigs fresh sage
4 large sprigs parsley, and chopped leaves for garnish
1 large handful celery leaves (optional)
4 tablespoons unsalted butter or extra-virgin olive oil
2 garlic cloves, peeled and very thinly sliced
8 cups vegetable stock or water
1 tablespoon kosher salt, more to taste
1 teaspoon black pepper, more to taste
1 ¾ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, halved and thinly sliced
Heavy cream, for serving (optional)

Directions:
Halve the leeks lengthwise and rinse away any grit. Thinly slice the leeks crosswise.
In a small square of cheesecloth, tie together bay leaves, thyme, sage, parsley and celery leaves if using.
Melt the butter or heat the oil in the bottom of a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the leeks and cook, stirring frequently, until leeks are soft and dark golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the garlic for the last 3 minutes of cooking.
Stir in stock or water, the sachet of herbs, the salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce immediately to medium-low; simmer for 5 minutes.
Add the potatoes and simmer soup until potatoes are very tender and falling apart, about 45 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. If desired, drizzle a small amount of cream into each bowl when serving, and top with parsley for garnish.
