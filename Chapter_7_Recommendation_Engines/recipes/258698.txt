Ingredients:
6 cups water
1 1/2 cups long grain rice, uncooked
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 1/2 cups whole milk
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cinnamon stick
8 fluid ounces coconut-flavored rum
8 fluid ounces spiced rum

Directions:
Soak rice in water in a large pot, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.
Drain the water into a medium, 2-quart pitcher.
Blend rice and cinnamon in a blender or food processor, until pasty and rice is well-broken. Transfer rice paste in the water. Let stand 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
Strain the rice water through a fine sieve or cheesecloth into a large, 3-quart pitcher. Add sweetened condensed milk, whole milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon sticks; stir briefly. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.
Stir in coconut rum and spiced rum until flavors are well-mixed.
