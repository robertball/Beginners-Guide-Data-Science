Description: 
Two of my favorite things in the world are strawberry cheesecake and baklava, so I found a way to combine them! Since Valentine's Day is right around the corner, I figured this would be a great recipe to share with the world! I garnished with blueberries, because I used all my strawberries in the recipe!
