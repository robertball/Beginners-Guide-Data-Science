Ingredients:
8 oz. pretzels, hard, whole wheat, unsalted
1 tbsp. canola oil
3 tbsp. whole-grain mustard
¼ cup + 2 tbsp. Dijon mustard
2 tbsp. water
1 ½ tbsp. red wine vinegar
4 (3 oz.) boneless, skinless chicken breasts
½ tbsp. garlic powder
½ tbsp. onion powder
¼ cup 1% milk
¼ tsp. cayenne pepper
3 oz. low fat or nonfat shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400°F. Using a food processor (or a heavy duty sealable bag and a rolling pin), coarsely grind the pretzels so that you have fine crumbs and some larger pieces. Transfer to a shallow bowl.
In a small bowl, whisk the oil, whole-grain mustard, 2 tbsp. Dijon mustard, water and red wine vinegar until smooth. Lightly whisk in the garlic and onion powder. You may also season with black pepper if desired. Pour into a shallow bowl.
Coat each chicken breast evenly in mustard sauce and then dredge the chicken in pretzel crumbs. Transfer to a baking sheet and lightly spray each piece with cooking spray. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until cooked through, turning once halfway through and re-spraying with cooking spray.
While chicken is baking, make cheddar mustard dipping sauce. Combine the remaining Dijon mustard (1/4 cup) with the milk, cayenne pepper and cheese in a small sauce pan. Allow to heat over low, stirring occasionally.
Serve Cheddar Mustard Sauce warm in a small bowl alongside the Pretzel Chicken.
