Ingredients:
2 cups water
4 tea bags (Assam, Darjeeling, or green), gluten free
2 cinnamon sticks, broken up
10 whole cloves
2 green cardamom pods, bruised
1/4 teaspoon fresh ginger, chopped
2 pinch ground nutmeg
2 whole peppercorns
star anise, optional to taste
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups milk or milk substitute (gluten free)
1/4 cup honey, optional

Directions:
In a saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, ginger, nutmeg, star anise, and peppercorn (use cheesecloth or loose tea bag if you have one). Simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and add tea bags for 3-8 minutes (depending on your preference).  Strain through a fine sieve, if necessary.
At this point, you can store concentrate in refrigerator.
Add 1/2 c. steamed or frothed milk.  Sweeten to taste.  Garnish with cinnamon.

Description: 
The original recipe is good.  However, I have compiled all the reviews into this revision.  If you are trying to be healthy, try soy milk, green tea and leave out the sugar.  Serve hot or over ice.Modified from: Coffeebar Chai
