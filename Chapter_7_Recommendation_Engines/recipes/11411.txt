Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 cups butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 eggs
4 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1/3 cup wheat germ (optional)
3 cups rolled oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium size mixing bowl sift together flour, baking soda, salt and baking powder.
In a large mixing bowl cream butter, white and brown sugars together until light and fluffy. Dribble vanilla into the creamed mixture. Beat the eggs, one at a time, into the mixture. Add the sifted ingredients to the creamed mixture. Beat until well mixed.
Pour chocolate chips, wheat germ and oats into the mixture; fold into dough until well combined. Drop the dough by rounded teaspoonful onto an ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until the edges are just slightly brown. The cookies will look undercooked but that is the correct consistency. Cool on a wire rack.
