Ingredients:
4 fresh or frozen chicken breasts cubed
3 tablespoons butter
1 medium onion, diced
2 ribs celery, sliced thin
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
3 medium (Yukon) gold potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch dice
2 cups frozen mixed vegetables (or one cup each frozen corn and peas)
5 frozen buttermilk biscuits, half thawed and cut into 9 pieces each

Directions:
Microwave chicken breast cubes in a bowl one minute at a time, then stirring, until no longer pink. Set aside.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir onion and celery until soft, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle in 2 tablespoons flour and whisk continuously to make a thick roux, about 2 minutes. Slowly pour in chicken broth, whisking to remove any lumps. Add 1 teaspoon salt, black pepper, basil, thyme, potatoes, and mixed vegetable. Cover and cook the stew over medium heat until vegetables are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in chicken meat (and any liquid in the bowl) and continue to simmer.
Drop biscuit pieces, one at a time, into the simmering stew. Cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Cover and cook until the dumplings are tender, 8 to 10 minutes more.
