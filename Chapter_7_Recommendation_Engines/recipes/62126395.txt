Ingredients:
3/4 cup peanut butter
80 buttery round crackers (Ritz crackers)
2 pounds vanilla flavored confectioners' coating

Directions:
Spread approximately 1 teaspoon peanut butter on each of half of the crackers. Top with remaining crackers to make peanut butter "sandwiches".
Melt vanilla candy coating in the top of a double boiler over hot, not boiling, water. Reduce heat and keep chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water.
Dip each cracker "sandwich" in candy coating, allowing excess to drain back into pot.
Place coated crackers on wax paper to cool. Allow coating to completely set, placing in refrigerator for 15 minutes, if necessary. Store between layers of wax paper in cool, dry place, or refrigerate.
