Ingredients:
1/2 cup sake
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon sugar
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, grated
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cubed
3 leeks, white part only, cut into 1/2 inch pieces

Directions:
In a medium dish, mix together the sake, soy sauce, sugar, garlic and ginger. Add chicken, and allow to marinate for 15 minutes.
Preheat your oven's broiler. Grease six metal skewers, and thread alternately with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 pieces of leek. Place on a baking sheet or broiling pan, and brush with the marinade.
Broil for about 5 minutes, baste again, then broil for another 5 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through. Discard remaining marinade.
