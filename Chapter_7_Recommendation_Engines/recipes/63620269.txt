Ingredients:
Bread
2 tbsp (30mL) active dry yeast (2 packages)
½ cup (125mL) granulated sugar
2 tsp (10mL) salt
6-7 cups (1.5-1.7L) Bread Homestyle White Flour
1 ¾ cups (425mL) warm milk (248ºF/120ºC)
4 eggs, lightly beaten
½ cup (125mL) butter, melted
1 tbsp (15mL) orange zest or orange lacquer
Glaze
1 ½ cups (375mL) icing sugar
2-3 tbsp (30-45mL) orange juice

Directions:
Directions:
1. Combine yeast, sugar, salt and 2 cups (500mL) of the flour in a large bowl with a whisk or in the bowl of an electric mixer with a dough hook. Add the warm milk, eggs, butter and orange zest. Mix until smooth, about 3 minutes. Add remaining flour, ½ cup (125mL) at a time (you may not need all the flour), until dough is too stiff to stir by hand or if using a mixer, it starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl. Just add enough flour to make a soft dough. Knead dough 10 minutes by hand or 5 minutes in a mixer.
2. Place dough in an oiled bowl and roll around to coat. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 – 1 ½ hours.
3. Punch dough down and divide in half. Divide each half into 3 strands and roll onto long ropes 14” (36cm) long. Braid 3 strands together and place on parchment lined baking sheet. Cover loosely with oiled plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
4. Bake in preheated 350ºF (180ºC) oven for 25-30 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 190ºF (88ºC). If making1 large bread, bake for 50-60 minutes.
5. Glaze: combine icing sugar and orange juice. Drizzle over warm bread.
