Ingredients:
8 cups water
1 cup large tapioca pearls
1 cup milk
1/2 cup powdered chai tea mix
2 cups ice
honey or sugar to taste

Directions:
In a pot, bring water to a boil. Add tapioca pearls and stir for a while to make sure the pearls aren't sticking to the pot. Cover pot and let boil for 45 minutes. Turn off heat and let sit for 30 minutes. Rinse and drain tapioca pearls. They should be squishy and black. Add some sugar or honey and stir so that the pearls are all a little bit coated.
Add milk, tea mix, and ice in a blender and blend until desired texture. You can replace the chai tea mix with powdered fruit drink mix or instant coffee drink mix if you like, or make any other smoothie or slushie to use with the tapioca pearls. If you use fruit drink mix, use water instead of milk. You could also use any iced drink instead of a slushie or smoothie if desired.
Pour the blended tea into two tall glasses and add 1/2 of the tapioca pearls to each glass. If you find that is too many pearls for each drink for you, you can blend 2 more drinks and put 1/4 of the pearls in each glass. If you can find extra wide straws, put one in each drink so you can suck the pearls up the straw and chew on them while you are drinking!
Note: Use the tapioca pearls soon after cooking them. Do not store them in the refrigerator, or they will lose their chewy texture!
