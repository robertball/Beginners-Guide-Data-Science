Ingredients:
1 cup thin red onion slices
1/2 cup lime juice
3/4 pound boned, skinned smoked trout
1/2 cup nonfat cream cheese
1 (19 ounce) can green enchilada sauce
1/2 cup fat-skimmed chicken broth
8 (6 inch) corn tortillas
3/4 cup green onions (including tops)
1/2 cup shredded reduced-fat jack cheese

Directions:
In a bowl, mix red onion slices and lime juice.
Break trout into flakes.
Cut cream cheese into 1/2-inch chunks.
Mix enchilada sauce and chicken broth and pour 1 cup of the mixture into a shallow 3-quart (9- by 13-in.) casserole.
Stack tortillas and put in a microwave-safe plastic bag but do not seal. Heat in a microwave oven on full power (100%) just until hot, 1 to 2 minutes.
Dip tortillas, 1 at a time, in sauce in casserole and turn over to coat. Stack at 1 end of the casserole. Scatter 1/8 of the trout, cream cheese, and green onions across center of 1 tortilla. Roll to enclose filling and set, seam down, in sauce. Repeat to fill remaining tortillas, pushing unfilled ones to the end of the casserole as you work.
Pour remaining enchilada sauce mixture over and around filled tortillas.
Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until sauce bubbles, 10 to 12 minutes (about 9 minutes in a convection oven). Sprinkle jack cheese over enchiladas and bake until melted, 2 to 3 minutes more.
With a slotted spoon, lift the red onion slices from bowl and scatter over the enchiladas. Serve with a wide spatula. Season to taste with lime juice from the bowl.

Description: 
In his native Veracruz, Mexico, Eligio Hernandez of Sunset's editorial services department enjoyed the taste of trout wrapped in cornhusks and cooked on a comal over a fire. This cooking method gives the fish a firm texture and smoky flavor. He also likes meats cooked in salsa verde--green chili sauce. The two components combine well in his version of enchiladas. The tortillas must be fresh; otherwise they crack when rolled.
