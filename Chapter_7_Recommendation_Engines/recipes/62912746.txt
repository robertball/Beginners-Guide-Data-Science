Ingredients:
6 Habañero peppers
1 cup pineapple
1 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup molasses
2 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp onion powder
2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
2 tsp hickory Liquid Smoke

Directions:
1. Remove the seeds from the peppers. Cut about 1/4 of the pineapple into chunks. Put both of those into a blender or food processor and liquefy.
2. Put the liquefied mixture into a pot with all the other ingredients and stir together.
3. Simmer until the sauce reaches the desired consistency, about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
