Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups white sugar, divided
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups halved and pitted cherries
1 1/4 cups cherry juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a deep 9x13-inch baking dish.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Place 1 cup sugar and butter in a separate bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in milk and vanilla extract. Add flour mixture to butter mixture; mix until batter is well blended and thick, 2 to 3 minutes.
Spread batter in the prepared baking dish; arrange cherries on top. Drizzle cherry juice over the cherries. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup sugar over the surface.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
