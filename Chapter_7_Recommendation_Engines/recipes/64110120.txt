Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
4 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. salt
2 tbs. sugar
1 1/4 cup milk
2 eggs
3 tbs. butter, melted
1-2 medium apples, grated
1 tsp. vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large bowl sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.
Make a well in the center, and pour in the milk, eggs, and melted butter; mix until smooth.
Do not overmix, or your pancakes will be very tough. When the batter is just 'mixed' carefully stir in the grated apple.
Fry the apple pancakes over a medium heat for about two minutes on each side until golden flipping once. You'll know when they are ready to turn because the top of the pancake will be covered with bubbles and edges will look dried.
Serve warm with cinnamon sugar, maple syrup or honey.

Description: 
The apples make it moist and tasty, so you don't need to drawn it in maple syrup!
I think everyone has a bulletproof recipe for pancakes; sounds crazy, but I tried several recipes until I perfected the Real Pancake Recipe.
