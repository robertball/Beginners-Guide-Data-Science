Ingredients:
6 Tbl. (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, divided
1/2 cup chopped onion
4 ounces button or crimini mushrooms, thinly sliced
2 bunches fresh spinach, stemmed, cleaned, blanched, and coarsely chopped, or one package frozen, chopped spinach, thawed
2 Tbl. chopped fresh basil or 2 tsp. dried
Salt and pepper to taste
5 large eggs
4 cups half and half, milk, or a combination
1 loaf of sordough or Como bread, crusts removed and thinly sliced
1 cup shredded Parmesan
1/2 cup shredded ozzarella
1/2 cup grated Parmesan

Directions:
Melt 1 Tbl. butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions and mushrooms and saute until soft, about 4-5 minutes. Stir in the spinach and basil and season with salt and pepper.  Set aside to cool.
Whisk eggs in a large bowl until well mixed.  Whisk in the half-and-half or milk.  Season with salt and pepper.
Grease an 8.5 by 11 inch baking dish and cut the bread to cover the bottom, fitting the pieces in snugly.  Spread the vegetable mixture over the bread and top with the cheeses.
Pour the egg mixture over and top with the remaining bread.  Press lightly into the egg mixture and dot with the remaining butter.
Cover and refrigerate overnight or at least two hours.
Preheat over to 350 degrees.  Place the baking dish in a larger roasting pan and fill the pan with hot water halfway up the baking pan.
Bake until browned on top, about 50 to 60 minutes.  Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
