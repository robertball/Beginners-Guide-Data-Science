Ingredients:
1/2 cup flaked coconut
1/3 cup finely chopped almonds, macadamia nuts or pecans
1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1 1/2 cups flour
3/4 cup sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup shortening or softened butter
3/4 cup milk
1 egg
1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400. Grease 8X8 or 9X9 square pan. In a small bowl, mix together coconut, nuts, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon melted butter. Set aside. Melt chocolate chips gently over low heat.
In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, 3/4 cup sugar, baking powder, salt, shortening, milk & egg. Beat vigorously for 30 seconds. Spread batter in pan.
Spoon melted chocolate over batter. Use a knife to cut through the batter and chocolate for a marbled effect. Sprinkle coconut mixture evenly over the top. Bake 20 to 25 minutes until cake springs back when pressed with your finger.

This cake is always a hit on a lazy Sunday morning with a fresh cup of coffee. It couldn't be easier to throw together. The coconut/chocolate topping has a hint of the famous chocolate bar.
