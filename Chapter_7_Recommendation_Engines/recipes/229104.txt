Ingredients:
6 cups water
1 cup white sugar
1 (6 ounce) package lime-flavored Jell-OÂ® mix
1 (46 fluid ounce) can pineapple juice
2 quarts orange juice
1/2 cup lemon juice
2 (2 liter) bottles chilled lemon-lime soda

Directions:
Mix water, sugar, and gelatin mix in a large saucepan and bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium and cook at a boil, whisking frequently, until gelatin and sugar have dissolved, about 3 minutes. Stir pineapple juice, orange juice, and lemon juice into gelatin mixture and transfer into resealable plastic bags. Place in freezer until slushy, about 4 hours.
Pour mixture into a large punch bowl and stir in lemon-lime soda; float a black plastic witch hat atop the punch.
