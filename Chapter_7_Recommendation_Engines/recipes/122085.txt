Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
2 cups sugar
2 eggs
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour and cinnamon; gradually add to creamed mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or until easy to handle. On a lightly floured surface, roll out to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-in. star-shaped cookie cutter dipped in flour. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until edges are firm and bottom of cookies are lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
These cookies fill your home with an irresistible aroma as they bake. My grandmother made them every Christmas when I was a child. I have fond memories of helping her in the kitchen.
