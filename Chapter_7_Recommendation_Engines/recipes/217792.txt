Ingredients:
Burger Ingredients
1 cup egg, beaten
2 tablespoons grated onion
2 tablespoons Heinz Worcestershire Sauce
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 pound lean ground beef
Crumbled blue cheese
Hamburger buns
Glaze Ingredients
2/3 cup Heinz Tomato Ketchup
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
2 teaspoons hot sauce

Directions:
Whisk the egg with the onion, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt and pepper. Crumble in the beef. Mix gently. Chill the mixture for 15 minutes; then divide into 4 equal-sized patties. Preheat the grill to medium-high and grease the grate. Set the patties on the preheated grill and cook, covered, for 6 minutes.
Flip the burgers and reduce the heat to medium. Mix glaze ingredients. Brush burgers with some of the glaze. Grill, turning and brushing with glaze, for 6 to 8 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer registers 180 degrees F (90 degrees C) when inserted into the side of the patties. Brush with any remaining glaze and top with cheese (if using) before removing from the grill. Serve on buns with traditional garnishes.
