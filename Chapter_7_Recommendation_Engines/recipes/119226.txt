Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup cold butter
1 cup golden raisins
1 3/4 cups 1% low-fat buttermilk

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add raisins. Stir in buttermilk just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; gently knead 6-8 times.
Place on an ungreased baking sheet; pat into a 7-in. round loaf. Using a sharp knife, cut a 1-in. cross about 1/4 in. deep on top of the loaf. Bake at 375 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
I'm allergic to yeast, so I appreciate recipes for quick breads, biscuits and soda breads. This tender loaf that's dotted with golden raisins is great, It's one way I can enjoy toast for breakfast.                                            --Carol Fritz of Fulton, Illinois
