Ingredients:
1 stick and 2 tbsp. Unsalted Butter
1 1/2 pint Heavy Whipping Cream
2 cups Shredded Parmesan Cheese

1/2-1 can Cream of Chicken Soup
2-4 tbsp. Basil
2-4 tbsp. Parsley
2-4 tbsp. Oregano* slightly more than other spices
Garlic Powder to taste (I add quite a bit)
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
Start Boiling the water for pasta
In another pot, melt butter over medium heat
Stir in shredded Parmesan cheese until melted
Add Heavy Cream and soup when cheese is melted (I use either a whole can of cream of broccoli or 1/2 cream of broccoli and 1/2 cream of chicken)
Add spices to taste
Set aside to thicken, keep heat low
Add pasta to boiling water, and cook until al dente; drain.
Serve with al dente pasta of your choice (I usually go with penne), garnish with cheese if desired
