Ingredients:
1 large potato, peeled and chopped
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (15 ounce) can cream-style corn
3  hard-cooked eggs, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
Â½ cup milk
1 tablespoon butter
1 (15 ounce) package double crust ready-to-use pie crust

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a saucepan over medium heat, stir together the potato, whole kernel corn, creamed corn, hard cooked eggs, salt, pepper and milk. Simmer for about 15 minutes.
Press one of the pie crusts in to the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch pie plate. I like to use clear glass so I can check the bottom crust for doneness. Pour the hot filling into the crust. Dot with pieces of butter. Cover with the top crust, and flute the edges to seal. Cut a few slits in the top crust to vent steam. Place on a cookie sheet that has been lined with aluminum foil for easy clean up.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, then reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the crust is browned. Serve hot.

Description: 
This is my mom's corn pie. We grew up eating this and loving it in the heart of Amish country. It is a very hearty dish, and easy to make.  Give this one a try before you decide you won't like it. Corn takes on a whole different flavor made this way. Some people add cooked chicken to the pie as well.
