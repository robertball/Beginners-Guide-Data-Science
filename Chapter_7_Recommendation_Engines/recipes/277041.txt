Ingredients:
Sauce:
1 (29 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
19 fluid ounces tomato juice
1 (5.5 ounce) can tomato paste
1 large onion, chopped
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
Meatballs:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
16 soda crackers, crushed
2 eggs, beaten
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 large clove garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1/8 teaspoon dried thyme
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine tomatoes, tomato juice, tomato paste, onion, parsley, salt, red pepper flakes, black pepper, thyme, and cloves in a large pot. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low and let simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
Meanwhile, combine beef, crackers, eggs, Parmesan cheese, garlic, parsley, and thyme in a bowl. Form into large meatballs and place into a broiler pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and no longer pink in the centers, about 30 minutes.
Transfer meatballs to sauce and continue to simmer, 2 to 2 1/2 hours more.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Serve sauce and meatballs over cooked spaghetti.

Description: 
I have been making this spaghetti recipe, from a dear family friend, for over 25 years. It is by far the best homemade sauce and meatballs we have ever had. I've also just fried the beef and added it to the sauce, then used it to make lasagna.
