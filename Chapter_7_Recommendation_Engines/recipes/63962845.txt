Ingredients:
2 lbs. Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and quartered

2 tbsp. low fat sour cream
2 tbsp. butter
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 c. evaporated skim milk

Directions:
Place the potatoes in a large pot of cold, salted water and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer covered for 25-35 minutes, until the potatoes are completely tender.
Drain potatoes in a colander, and then return to pot along with butter, evaporated milk, White Puree, sour cream and salt.  Mash with a potato masher until combined well.
Serve immediately.
