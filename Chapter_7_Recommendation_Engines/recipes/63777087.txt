My husband wanted an easy dinner so I thought how about soup and BLT’s… When I was at the grocery store roma tomatoes were on sale and it came to me.. Roasted Tomato Soup for dinner! I already had onion and 1/2 of a red bell pepper at home to create this flavorful soup. It is also a perfect paleo recipe for you to enjoy…
