Ingredients:
5 lb ground hamburger (no lean burger)
5 Tbsp liquid smoke (found near barbecue sauce)
5 Tbsp morton salt tender quick (found in dark blue bag in spice aisle)
2 Tbsp coarse ground pepper
2 Tbsp minced garlic
2 Tbsp mustard seeds

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix all ingredients with your hands like making meatloaf.
Cover and Refrigerate 24 hours.
Take out and knead one more time then make 4 (14x2 inch) logs.
Put them on a cookie sheet with 1-2 inch sides.
Bake at 300 degrees for 3 hours.
Take out and wrap in wax paper with aluminum foil around that.
Refrigerate until well chilled.
Serve by slicing and eating alone or with crackers and cheese.
NOTE: When rolling logs into shape, make sure you knead the meat and form a tight log so there's no cracks forming while baking.
IF USING VENISON: Venison is very lean. This recipe needs some fat in it so use 3 lbs venison and 2 lbs hamburger.
