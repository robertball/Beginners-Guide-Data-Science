Ingredients:
1/2 cup melted butter
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
12 slices good quality Italian bread
1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese
2 teaspoons dried oregano, divided
1 (24 ounce) jar vodka marinara sauce, warmed

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to middle position and turn oven to broil. Mix butter and garlic powder in a small bowl.
Place 6 slices of bread onto a foil-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle a portion of cheese over each slice. Top with the remaining 6 slices of bread. Brush tops with half the butter and sprinkle with half the oregano
Broil sandwiches until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove pan from oven, flip sandwiches, brush the other sides with remaining butter and sprinkle with oregano. Return to oven and broil until golden, about 3 minutes longer. Cut sandwiches in half diagonally, and serve with vodka sauce on the side for dipping.
