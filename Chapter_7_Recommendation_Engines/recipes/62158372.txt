Ingredients:
4 lb sirloin tip or rump roast
7 T olive oil, divided
3 T Italian seasoning
1 tsp salt
1 tsp black pepper
1 medium onion, sliced
Salt and black pepper
32 fl oz beef stock
3 T dried oregano
2 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp onion powder
2 loaves of French bread, cut into sandwich-sized pieces (4  5 inches generally)

Directions:
Rub roast with 3 T of oil, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours.
Heat 1 – 2 T olive oil to nearly smoking over high heat in an oven-proof frying pan.  Sear the roast well on all sides. Move to the oven and roast for about 1 hour at 325.  Remove from oven and chill well before slicing.
While beef is chilling, to make the au jus, sauté onion in 1 T olive oil until translucent.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Stir in the beef stock, oregano, garlic and onion powders.  Warm over low heat while slicing the roast.
Using a meat slicer or a good filet knife, slice the beef across the grain as thinly as possible. Heat the meat in batches in the au jus and serve on French bread.  Serve with mozzarella cheese, giardiniera, pepperoncini, sweet peppers, red sauce, or au jus.
