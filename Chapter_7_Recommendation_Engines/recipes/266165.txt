Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) jar tomato sauce
3 tablespoons barbeque sauce
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1 pound ground pork
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine tomato sauce, barbeque sauce, and sugar in a small saucepan. Heat just until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; let cool. Set aside 1/2 cup of the sauce.
Combine beef, pork, flour, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add the larger amount of tomato sauce and mix until thoroughly combined. Pat meatloaf mixture into a loaf pan; cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and drain off grease. Slice into serving-sized pieces and pour reserved sauce on top. Bake, uncovered, until no longer pink in the center, 30 to 45 minutes more.

Description: 
I wanted to make meatloaf for my husband but he is allergic to eggs, so after making some modifications to an eggless recipe, I came up with his now favorite dinner!
