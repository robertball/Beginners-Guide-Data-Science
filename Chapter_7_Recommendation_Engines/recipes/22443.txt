Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 egg yolks
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup finely chopped pistachio nuts
1 (10 ounce) package frozen raspberries - thawed and drained
1 cup HERSHEYÂ®'S Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
2 tablespoons chopped pistachio nuts

Directions:
Prepare Pistachio Crust:  Heat oven to 375 F.  Generously grease bottom and sides of 9-inch tart pan or 9-inch pie plate.  In small mixer bowl, beat butter and sugar until creamy.  Add egg yolks; beat until well blended.  Add flour; mix well.  Stir in pistachio nuts.  Press mixture firmly onto bottom and up sides of pan.  Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool completely.
Discard liquid from raspberries.  In food processor or blender, puree raspberries; strain to remove seeds, if desired.
In medium saucepan over low heat, place chocolate chips and butter; stir constantly until mixture is smooth.  Remove from heat; stir in pureed raspberries and vanilla.  Cool slightly.  Fold in 2-1/2 cups whipped topping; blend well.  Spread mixture over prepared crust.  Refrigerate 1 hour.  Spread remaining 1 cup whipped topping over tart.  Sprinkle with pistachio nuts.  Garnish with raspberries, if desired.  Refrigerate 2 hours or until chilled.  Cover; store in refrigerator.
