Ingredients:
Â½ lb    tvp
1 T    Olive Oil
1 envelope    taco seasoning
2 med    onions, chopped
2 cloves    garlic, pressed
4 oz    chilis, drained

Directions:
In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium high heat and cook onions till translucent. Add garlic and cook another minute. Then add turkey, and cook until browned, breaking into small pieces, as you

Heat oven to 400 degrees.
Lightly grease a 10" pie plate. Place one fourth of the tortilla pieces on the bottom of the pie plate (till covered). Spread with half of the turkey mixture; sprinkle with 1 cup of the cheese. Place
another one fourth of the tortillas on cheese; spread with beans. Place yet another one fourth of the tortillas on beans; top with roasted peppers. And finally, place the remaining tortillas on the
roasted peppers and spread with remaining turkey mixture. Top with remaining 1 cup cheese. Cover and bake 30 to 40 minutes or until cheese is melted and center is hot. Let sit 10 minutes before cutting
into your masterpiece.
Can be served with salsa and sour cream, if desired.
