Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup apple cider
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1 cup apples- peeled, cored, and finely diced
Topping:
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup rolled oats
1/3 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease the bottoms of 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Combine flour, white sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a medium bowl; mix well.
Combine apple cider, vegetable oil, and egg in another bowl; blend well. Add flour mixture all at once and stir just until moistened; batter will be lumpy. Stir in apples.
Combine brown sugar, oats, pecans, and flour in a medium bowl for topping; mix well. Mix in melted butter until all ingredients are moistened and clumpy.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. Top each with a generous amount of streusel topping.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 22 minutes. Let cool for 1 minute before removing from the pan. Serve warm.
