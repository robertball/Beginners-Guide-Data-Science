Ingredients:
1 Pork Roast (boneless butt or shoulder, 2-3 pounds)
2 cans cream of mushroom soup (10.5 ounce each)
1 packet Lipton Onion and Mushroom dry soup mix
2 tablespoons chopped garlic

Directions:
Use a large (4-6 quart) slow cooker.  Pour in 2 cans of mushroom soup, sprinkle in 1/2 packet of dry soup mix, and spoon in 1 tablespoon of the chopped garlic.  Place the pork roast on top of the mixture, fat side up.  Sprinkle the top of the pork with the remainder of the packet of soup mix and the other tablespoon of chopped garlic.
Cover the slow cooker with the lid.  Cook on low for 6 hours, and then switch to warm for 2 hours or until ready to serve.  The pork should shred easily with a fork, and will make a delicious gravy with the soup.  Serve over rice or noodles for a full meal.
