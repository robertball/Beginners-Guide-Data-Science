Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package NO YOLKS® Broad Noodles
1 pound extra lean ground beef
1 onion, chopped
2 teaspoons minced garlic
4 2/3 cups tomato and basil pasta sauce
1 cup water
2 cups 2% cottage cheese
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Prepare the noodles according to package directions. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Meanwhile, crumble the beef into a large deep skillet or Dutch oven set over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic; cook, stirring until browned. Stir in the sauce until combined; stir in the noodles.
Blend the cottage cheese with the Parmesan cheese. Layer 1/2 of the noodle mixture into a 9 x 13-inch (3 L) casserole. Top with the cottage cheese mixture. Spread the remaining noodle mixture over top. (The casserole can be covered and reserved in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. Add an extra 10 minutes to the initial baking time.)
Bake, covered, for 20 minutes; uncover and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Bake for 10 minutes or until cheese is bubbly.
