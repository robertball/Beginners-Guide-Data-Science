Ingredients:
3 egg yolks
1 cup egg white
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons light whipping cream
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1 cup vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Mix together egg yolks, egg white, salt, sugar and cream. Gradually stir in flour until dough becomes stiff enough to roll out.
Roll out paper thin and cut into triangles. (Grandma would cut a slit in the middle of each and twist a corner through the slit to make them look fancier.)
Put enough oil in a pot to cover cookie.  Heat oil until a small amount of dough placed in oil begins to fry.  Deep fry each cookie  in hot oil until light brown.  Remove cookie from oil and drain excess oil on paper towels.  Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.
