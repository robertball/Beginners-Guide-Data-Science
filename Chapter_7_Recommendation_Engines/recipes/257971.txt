Ingredients:
1 tablespoon low-sugar strawberry preserves
1 teaspoon water
2 tablespoons diced mango
3 tablespoons fat-free cottage cheese
1 tablespoon fat-free cream cheese, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1 tablespoon crushed pineapple in juice, partially drained
1 tablespoon shredded sweetened coconut
1 (9-inch) piece ready-to-use crepe (such as Melissa's®)

Directions:
Combine strawberry preserves and water in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until warm, about 10 seconds. Stir in mango.
Mix cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sugar together in a bowl until creamy and blended. Stir in pineapple and coconut.
Tear crepe gently in half. Lay halves on a flat work surface with cut sides facing away from you. Spoon half of the cottage cheese mixture into the center of each half; fold in sides, top, and bottom like an envelope. Place seam-side down on a plate.
Microwave preserves mixture to reheat, about 20 seconds. Stir and spoon over filled crepes.
