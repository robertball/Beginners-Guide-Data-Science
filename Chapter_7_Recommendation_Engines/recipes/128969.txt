Ingredients:
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 (8 ounce) package tempeh, sliced into thin strips
2 tablespoons liquid amino acid supplement
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 small onion, thinly sliced
1 medium green bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 jalapeno pepper, sliced
2 pita breads, cut in half
soy mayonnaise
4 thin slices  Swiss cheese

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the tempeh slices and cook 3 to 4 minutes, or until they start to brown.  Pour in half of the liquid aminos and cook for 1 minute.  Flip the tempeh slices and cook until toasted, 3 to 4 more minutes. Pour in the remaining liquid aminos and cook for 1 minute.  Remove the tempeh, and set it aside.
In the same skillet, heat the remaining oil over medium heat.  Cook the onion, green pepper, and jalapeno until the vegetables have softened, 4 to 5 minutes.
Spread each pita half with 1 teaspoon soy mayonnaise.  Stuff each pita with several slices of tempeh, peppers and onions, and a piece of Swiss cheese.  Toast the sandwiches in a toaster oven for 2 minutes or until the cheese has melted.
