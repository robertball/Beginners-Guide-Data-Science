Ingredients:
1 package 'Cook and Serve' pudding mix.
2 cups milk.
24 Nilla wafer cookies
4 large graham crackers
3 Tbsp. butter/margarine
3 Tbsp. light corn syrup

Directions:
In a medium saucepan,combine pudding mix with the 2 cups of milk called for.
Bring to a boil, stirring constantly.
Once it's thickened up, remove from heat.
Put the Nilla wafers and graham crackers into a ziplock bag. Cover with a towel and crush the crackers with the side of a hammer. You can use a heavy skillet (I just prefer a hammer!) You want them crushed really good...no big chunks.
Grease a 9 inch pie pan or 8x11 square pan.
In a small microwave safe bowl, melt your butter in microwave.
Add your corn syrup to the butter, mix well. Set aside.
Pour those crackers crumbs in your pan.
Add the butter/corn syrup and mix it all up so you have no dry crumbs.
Press the crumbs down evenly across bottom of pan to form a crust.(I wet my hands a little so nothing sticks to them and just press it all down with my fingers.)
Check to see that your pudding has cooled off, then pour it into your crust. Spread it evenly all around.
Chill for at least an hour before serving. (It's better the next day, though, honestly)
Top with your favorite whipped cream.
