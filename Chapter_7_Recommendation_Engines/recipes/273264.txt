Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked white rice
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried chives
3 cups water
1/2 (16 ounce) package frozen peas and carrots
1/2 (8 ounce) bag frozen corn
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (18 ounce) package boneless pork chops, cubed
1/4 cup soy sauce

Directions:
Combine rice, basil, oregano, and chives in a saucepan. Add water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Combine frozen peas, carrots, and corn in a microwave-safe bowl with a splash of water. Microwave, covered, until heated through, 6 to 7 minutes.
Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Cook and stir pork chops until no longer pink, 7 to 10 minutes. Mix in the cooked vegetables, rice, and soy sauce; heat through.

Description: 
We are a family of 5. We like quick meals, and really that is all we have time for Mon-Fri. This is very simple compared to some pork fried rice recipes. We eat it as a meal in itself. We have always used a rice cooker.
