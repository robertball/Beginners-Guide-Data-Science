Ingredients:
1/3 cup chopped green onions
1/4 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 pound ground beef or turkey
1 loaf Italian bread, cut into 1 inch slices or cubes
1 package (8 oz.) cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
1 jar (28 oz.) spaghetti sauce
1 cup water
2 garlic cloves, minced

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the onions, breadcrumbs, and Parmesan cheese.  Crumble beef or turkey over mixture and mix well.  Shape into 1" balls and place on a greased shallow baking pan.  Bake at 400 for 15-20 minutes or until no longer pink.
While the meatballs are baking, arrange bread slices in a single layer in an ungreased 13"x9" baking dish (all of the bread may not be used).  Combine the cream cheese, mayo, Italian seasoning and pepper; spread over the bread.  Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of mozzarella.
Combine the sauce, water and garlic; add cooked meatballs.  Pour over cheese and bread; sprinkle with remaining mozzarella.  Bake uncovered at 350 for 30 minutes.
