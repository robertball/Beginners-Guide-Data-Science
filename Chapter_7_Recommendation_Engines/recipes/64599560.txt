Ingredients:
2 lbs.  pre-cooked and chunked chicken breast
4 cups of your favorite jarred or homemade pasta sauce
1/2 cup to 1 cup Frank's Wings Sauce (to your personal spiciness)
1 cup low sodium chicken broth
2 good sized garlic clove, minced
1 Tbls olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
1 rib celery, small chopped
2 cups large curd cottage cheese
12 no-boil lasagna noodles
2 cups mozzarella cheese (cheddar works well too)
1/2 to 3/4 cup blue cheese crumbles

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray a 9"x13" lasagna pan with cooking spray and set aside.  In a large bowl mix the pre-cooked chicken, pasta sauce, Frank's Wings sauce, broth and garlic.  Give this mixture a good stir and set aside.
Chop onion and celery and saute in the olive oil for about 3-5 min.  Add veggies to chicken mixture.   Spread 1 cup of the chicken mixture in the bottom of the prepared pan, add a layer of 4 noodles.  Then add 1 1/2 cups chicken mixture and spread over noodles.  Spread 1/2 the cottage cheese over the chicken mixer then sprinkle with 1/2  cup of the mozzarella.  Add another layer of noodles, and repeat, 1 1/2 cups chicken sauce, 1 cup cottage cheese and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.  Add the final layer of noodles, remaining sauce, the last cup of mozzarella sprinkled over top.  Cover with foil and bake for 45 min.   Remove foil and sprinkle with blue cheese then bake for 20-25 mins.   Remove from oven and let set for 15 mins before serving.
