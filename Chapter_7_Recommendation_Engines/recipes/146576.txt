Ingredients:
3 cups hot water
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (5.6 ounce) box beef pasta skillet meal (such as Hamburger HelperÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pound ground beef
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pour the hot water into a 3 quart casserole dish. Stir the softened cream cheese into the water.  Mix in the sauce mix from the packaged dinner and the nutmeg.  Add the uncooked noodles and stir until well combined. Cover and bake in a preheated oven for 30 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, seasoned salt, and garlic powder. Mix well and form into golf ball sized meatballs. Place a cooling rack onto a cookie sheet and arrange the meatballs on the rack.  Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes.
Stir the cooked meatballs into the noodles and return the casserole to the oven. Cook uncovered for 5 to 10 minutes.
