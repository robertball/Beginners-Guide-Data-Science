Description: 
Yowzers!  Sweet and hot salsa with tangy mangoes and habaneros. Great with pork, chicken or fish or just with chips.  You can omit the habaneros and add red bell peppers for a non-spicy version, but then again, why would you want to? Remember, ALWAYS wear gloves when working with habaneros!Modified from: Avocado Mango Salsa
