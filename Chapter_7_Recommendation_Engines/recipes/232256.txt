Ingredients:
3 (15 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
2 (15 ounce) cans chili beans in spicy sauce
1 (16 ounce) jar hot salsa
1 (15 ounce) can dark red kidney beans
1 (15 ounce) can light red kidney beans
1 (15 ounce) can seasoned black beans
2 small onions, chopped
6 cloves garlic, crushed
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 teaspoon hot sauce
2 pounds ground turkey

Directions:
Combine diced tomatoes with green chiles, chili beans, salsa, dark and light red kidney beans, black beans, onions, garlic, chili powder, red pepper flakes, black pepper, cumin, taco seasoning mix, and hot sauce in a large soup pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover pot. Simmer until soup is heated and onions are translucent, about 20 minutes.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground turkey in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir crumbled turkey into chili.
Cover pot and simmer chili until flavors have blended, about 1 hour.
