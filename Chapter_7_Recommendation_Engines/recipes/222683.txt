Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garam masala
3 eggs
2 cups white sugar
1 cup applesauce
2 cups grated unpeeled zucchini
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 (11 ounce) package peanut butter and milk chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups, or line with paper muffin liners.
Stir flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and garam masala in a bowl; set aside. Beat eggs, sugar, and applesauce in another bowl until smooth. Add zucchini, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract. Stir in flour mixture until moist. Fold peanut butter and chocolate chips into zucchini batter until evenly distributed. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups about 2/3 full.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
