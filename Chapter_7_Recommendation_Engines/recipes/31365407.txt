Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup sugar
1 large egg
1 teaspoon instant coffee granules
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup white chocolate chips
1 cup dried cherries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line 2 large cookie sheets with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, combine flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl of an electric mixer, beat butter and sugar at medium-high speed until light and fluffy. Beat in egg, coffee granules, and vanilla until blended. At low speed, beat in flour mixture just until combined. Stir in semi-sweet chocolate, white chocolate, and dried cherries.
Drop dough by heaping tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart, onto prepared cookie sheets. Bake 10 to 12 minutes per batch, until tops are just firm. Cool on cookie sheets 2 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks and cool completely.
