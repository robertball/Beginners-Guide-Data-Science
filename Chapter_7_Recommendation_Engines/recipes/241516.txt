Ingredients:
1 pound rotini pasta
5 ounces tapenade (olive spread), or more to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper to taste
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and quartered (optional)
8 ounces sliced salami, cut into thin strips
8 ounces sliced baked ham, cut into thin strips
1 (6 ounce) can black olives, drained
4 ounces mozzarella cheese, cubed
4 ounces provolone cheese, cubed
1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips
1/4 bunch fresh parsley, finely chopped
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to cool.
Mix tapenade into pasta and season with pepper. Add artichoke hearts, salami, ham, olives, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, red bell pepper, and parsley to pasta mixture and toss to coat. Transfer salad to a serving bowl and top with sesame seeds.

Description: 
The great New Orleans sandwich turned into an easy cold dish. You can serve this over a bed of lettuce with a slice of French bread to make it a meal versus a side dish.
