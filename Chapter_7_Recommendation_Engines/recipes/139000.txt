Ingredients:
1 cup pepper sauce (such as Frank's Red HotÂ®)
1/3 cup honey
2/3 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Whisk hot sauce, honey, and brown sugar together in a saucepan until smooth. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes, whisking frequently.

Submitter: 
Drizzler
Description: 
This sauce tastes similar to the sauce used on the sticky fingers at one of my favorite restaurants.  It is easy to make and has endless possibilities for modification.  Try adding a bit of cinnamon or cloves to it.  Honey is used to thicken the sauce, but isn't necessary.  If not using the honey, just use extra brown sugar.
