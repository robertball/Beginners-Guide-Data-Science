Ingredients:
2 (15.8 ounce) cans BUSH'S® Great Northern Beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 pound small Roma (plum) tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, torn into 1/2-inch pieces
1 teaspoon coarse salt
Freshly ground pepper
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 small garlic cloves, minced

Directions:
Combine beans, tomatoes, basil, and salt in a bowl, and season with pepper. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Add garlic, and cook, stirring, until fragrant but not browned, 1 to 2 minutes.  Pour over bean mixture, and gently toss.  Let stand 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld.  Salad can be covered and kept at room temperature up to 4 hours.
Garnish with leeks or spinach if desired.
