Ingredients:
4 tablespoons oil
2 (2 pound) slabs baby back pork ribs
1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1 tablespoon ground chile powder
4 1/2 tablespoons oil
1 lg sweet onion or 1 teaspoon onion powder
2 cups water
1 cup ketchup
1 cup white vinegar
1 cup brown sugar
4 tablespoons honey
4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
4 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
2 1/2 teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
4 teaspoons garlic powder or 3 garlic cloves
1/2 teaspoon paprika
2 tablespoon dark molasses
1 tablespoon ground red chile powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degree F (150 degrees C).
Cut each full rack of ribs in half, so that you have 4 half racks.  Sprinkle salt and pepper (more pepper than salt), and 1 tablespoon chili powder over meat. Wrap each half rack in aluminum foil. Bake for 2 1/2 hours.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir the onions and garlic in oil for 5 minutes. Stir in remaining ingredients. Season with 2 teaspoons salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and 1/2 teaspoon ground chili powder. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat. Simmer for 1 1/4 hours, uncovered, or until sauce thickens. Remove from heat, and set sauce aside.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.
Remove the ribs from the oven, and let stand 10 minutes. Remove the racks from the foil, and place on the grill. Grill the ribs for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Brush sauce on the ribs while they're grilling,  just before you serve them (adding it too early will burn it).
