Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
14 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces
1 cup small curd cottage cheese, drained
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup raspberry spreadable fruit
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Place flour, salt, and butter in a food processor. Process until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs, then add the cottage cheese. Continue processing until the dough comes together. Divide dough into four equal portions and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Combine sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. Roll out each portion of dough on a floured surface to an 1/8 inch thick circle. Spread 1 tablespoon of raspberry spreadable fruit, then sprinkle with the sugar mixture and 1/4 cup of pecans on each circle. Gently press the filling into the dough using a rolling pin. Cut each circle into 16 wedges. Roll each wedge, starting with the wide end Place the cookie point-side down on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
