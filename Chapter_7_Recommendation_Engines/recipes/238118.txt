Description: 
This is a delightful, cool, and crisp salad with healthy fruits, vegetables, and nuts that is a great accompaniment to any entree. It's a real favorite with anyone who tries it.  This is a fun recipe as you can get creative with it. I have even made it with out the sunflower seeds, and it was still delicious.
