Ingredients:
Mince filling:
1 1/2 cups raisins
5 apples, peeled, cored, and diced
2 tablespoons grapefruit zest
1/3 cup orange juice
1/2 cup apple cider
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 graham cracker, crushed
Crust:
1/2 cup chilled butter
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cold water
Crumbly topping:
1/3 cup white sugar
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
6 tablespoons butter
1/2 graham cracker, crushed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius).
Crumbly topping: Mix sugar with flour in medium-sized bowl. Cut in butter until crumbly. Set aside.
Crust: Mix butter, flour, and salt together with a fork until very crumbly. Add only enough water to hold everything together and mix lightly with a fork. If it gets too warm and mushy, put it in the fridge until the butter cools down again.
Crust: Roll gently on a floured pastry cloth to roughly one inch larger than a pie plate. Invert pie plate over crust, hold tight together, and invert the cloth and plate carefully, settling crust into plate. Trim edge of crust to roughly 1/2 inch beyond rim of plate.  Fold up and pinch the edge at regular intervals.
Mince filling: Mix 3/4 cup sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and half a graham cracker together in a bowl.
Mince filling: Combine raisins, apples, grapefruit zest, orange juice, and apple cider in a pan.  Simmer the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally until apples are quite soft. Stir in the dry mixture from step 5 until well-blended.
Pour filling from step 6 into pie crust.  Top with crumbly topping mixture from step 2.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius) and bake until top is lightly browned (about 30 minutes more). Cool prior to serving.

Description: 
This pie has no meat in it (it's a mock mincemeat pie).  It doesn't use mincemeat mixes or prepared pie crusts.  It's homemade, like ma (or grandma) used to make.  Enjoy it!  I made it for my father for Father's Day (he loves mince pie).
