Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 cup orange juice
1 cup soy sauce
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage
1  lemon, juiced
¾ cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
4 cloves garlic
2 heads romaine lettuce
2  tomatoes, chopped
⅓ cup mozzarella cheese
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Marinate chicken in the orange juice, soy sauce and lemon-lime carbonated beverage for several hours or overnight.
Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade and drain. Place chicken on hot grill and cook for 6 to 8 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear. Remove, cool, and cut into strips.
Whisk together the lemon juice, vegetable oil, salt, pepper and garlic cloves. Allow garlic cloves to sit in dressing for a few hours and remove before pouring on the salad.
In a salad bowl, combine the lettuce, tomatoes, mozzarella, Parmesan and marinated chicken strips. Pour dressing over salad; toss and serve.
