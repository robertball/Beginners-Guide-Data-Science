Description: 
I ALWAYS looked forward to Sunday dinner at my grandparents' house, because Grandmother was the best cook anywhere.    All her meals were delicious, but I especially loved dinners featuring this savory pot roast. It's wonderful with garden-fresh vegetables on the side and a dessert made with apples. -Frances Wilson, Tulsa, Oklahoma
