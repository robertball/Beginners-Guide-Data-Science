Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups cake flour
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant butterscotch pudding mix
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice
1 cup butter, room temperature
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
4 eggs (room temp)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)
line cupcake pans with paper or foil liners. whisk together the flour, pudding mix, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ground ginger, and pumpkin pie spice in a bowl; set aside.
beat the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. the mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. add the room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to incorporate before adding the next. beat in the vanilla and pumpkin puree with the last egg. stir in the flour mixture, mixing until just incorporated. pour the batter into the prepared cupcake pans.
bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 18-20 minutes. cool in the pans for 2 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
