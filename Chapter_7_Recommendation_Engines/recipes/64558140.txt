Ingredients:
1 (18.25 oz) package Yellow Cake Mix (or Pineapple Supreme Cake Mix)
1 (20 oz) can Pineapple Slices, drained with juice reserved
1 (20 oz) can Crushed Pineapple, drained with juice reserved
1 (10 oz) jar Maraschino Cherries
1/2 cup Butter
1 cup Dark Brown Sugar

Directions:
1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. In a 9x13 baking dish melt the Butter. Once the Butter is melted sprinkle the bottom of the dish with the Brown Sugar and stir.
3. Place the pineapple Slices on top of the Brown Sugar mixture. Place a cherry in the center of each ring. Add the drained Crushed Pineapple around the slices.
4. Prepare the Cake Mix as directed on the package substituting the drained Pineapple Juice for the Water (add water if you don't have enough juice). Slowly pour the cake mix over the Pineapple.
5. Bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean.
6. Cool slightly (about 10 minutes) and turn out onto a platter.
7. Insert toothpicks all around the cake and cover with plastic wrap. For a more moist cake, cover before it has cooled completely.
