Ingredients:
3.4 cup Pace Picante Sauce
1/4 cup BBQ Sauce
6 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 1.5lbs)

Stir the picante sauce and BBQ sauce in a small bowl. Reserve half the picante sauce mixture to serve with chicken. Use the remaining mixture to baste the chicken during grilling.
Lightly oil the grill rack and heat the grill to medium. Grill the chicken for 15 minutes or until it's cooked through, turning and brushing often with the remaining picante sauce mixture. Discard the remaining picante sauce mixture.
Serve the chicken with the reserved picante sauce mixture.
