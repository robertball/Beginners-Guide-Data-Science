Ingredients:
1 c. olive oil, grapeseed, or jojoba oil
1/2 c. coconut oil
1/3 c. beeswax (I prefer the pastilles for easy melting, if using solid beeswax use 1.5 oz.)
1/2 t. Vitamin E oil (or about 5 capsules cut open and squeezed out) (optional)
2 tsp of cornstarch
20 drops (approximately) essential oil (optional)
Orange,Rose, or grapefruit are good if using on face,
lavender for hands and body

Directions:
Combine 1 C olive oil, 1/2 C coconut oil and 1/3 C beeswax pastilles into a pint sized canning jar. Put this jar into a saucepan and fill the saucepan with water until it comes 3/4 of the way up the canning jar, being careful not to get water into the oil mixture. Put on the stove over medium/low heat. Heat and stir occasionally until melted. Let cool to room temperature either by leaving out or quicken the process by putting into the refrigerator. During the cooling process, put a fork into the jar and stir vigorously every 15 minutes or so. Once at room temperature, add in the Vitamin E, corn starch,  and essential oil. That’s it. You have lotion!
