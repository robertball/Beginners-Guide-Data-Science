Ingredients:
1 (20 ounce) package bulk spicy Italian turkey sausage
1 (20 ounce) package spicy Italian ground turkey
3 eggs
4 ounces 2%-fat Cheddar cheese
1/4 onion, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix sausage, ground turkey, eggs, Cheddar cheese, onion, and black pepper in a large bowl; roll into 1 1/2-inch balls. Arrange meatballs onto baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 18 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
These meatballs with spicy Italian turkey sausage, spicy Italian ground turkey, Cheddar cheese, egg, onion, and seasoning are great for snack or in your spaghetti. I use these as a great snack item. I use small snack-size bags, place three in each bag, and freeze. I'll have one serving of three as a snack by removing them from snack bag and reheating them for 60 to 75 seconds.
