Description: 
Don't let the time frame of preparation fool you.  It takes MINUTES to make this recipe.  Soaking the cukes makes for a less watery and more creamy end product.  The french onion dip combination is amazingly simple and the sugar makes it kid-friendly, but can be omitted if you like.  This is always a huge hit at every picnic function!  We've even eaten it for dinner all by itself!
