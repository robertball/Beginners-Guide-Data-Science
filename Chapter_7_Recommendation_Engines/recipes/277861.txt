Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, or more to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
5 1/3 cups water, divided
1 (7.75 ounce) package curry sauce mix (such as S&B;速 Golden Curry速)
1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained
5 new potatoes, halved
1 (8 ounce) package sliced cremini mushrooms
2 medium carrots, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cups jasmine rice (such as Mahatma速)

Directions:
Place chicken in a large, deep skillet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Add 1/3 cup water to the pan, cover, and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.
While chicken is cooking, pour 2 cups water into a microwave-safe bowl. Break curry sauce mix into pieces and add to water. Heat in the microwave on high for 3 1/2 minutes; remove and stir until sauce mix has completely dissolved.
Remove chicken from the skillet. Cut into cubes, return to the skillet, and pour curry sauce over top. Stir in peas, potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, and onion. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring remaining water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Scoop rice into bowls and serve curry on top.

Description: 
Unlike Indian or Thai curry, Japanese curry is more savory than spicy. This chicken recipe uses Golden Curry速 brand curry cubes, that can be found in the Asian section of any grocery store. It's the definition of umami! Oishii desu ne!? (Delicious, isn't it!?)
