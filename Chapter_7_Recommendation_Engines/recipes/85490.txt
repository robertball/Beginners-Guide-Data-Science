Ingredients:
1/4 cup roasted peanuts
1 1/2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds
4 tablespoons olive oil
5 whole cloves
3 cardamom pods
1 inch cinnamon stick
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
1 curry leaf
2 medium onions, finely chopped
2 teaspoons ginger garlic paste
1 large tomato, chopped
1 teaspoon chili powder
2 green chilies, sliced lengthwise
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, finely chopped
1/2 bunch fresh mint leaves, finely chopped
4 medium potatoes, peeled and diced

Directions:
Place the peanuts and sesame seeds in a blender. Pour in enough water to not quite cover, and puree to a smooth, creamy paste. Set aside.
Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and curry leaf. Stir in onions, and cook until soft and translucent. Mix in ginger garlic paste, and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Stir in tomato, and cook about 5 minutes.
Add chili powder, green chilies, turmeric, and salt. Stir in half of the mint and half of the cilantro. Add peanut and sesame paste, stirring vigorously to prevent sticking. Stir in potatoes, mixing well to coat. Pour in enough water to not quite cover potatoes, and mix thoroughly. Stir in remaining mint and cilantro, and cover; cook on low heat, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are soft and the sauce is reduced to a creamy paste, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Diced potatoes are cooked in a creamy peanut and sesame seed sauce to create a rich and spicy dish. It takes a lot of ingredients and some effort but is definitely worth the try. All the ingredients can be found in an Indian grocery store very easily, and they are not expensive either. Bon appetite! Serve with warm pita bread/naan/wheat tortillas or with Indian fried rice.
