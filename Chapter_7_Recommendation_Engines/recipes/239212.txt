Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 cup milk
1 pinch baking powder
1 pinch ground cinnamon
2 cups sliced fresh peaches, or as desired

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place butter in a 9x13-inch baking dish and place in preheating oven until butter melts.
Whisk flour, sugar, milk, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a bowl until batter is smooth. Pour batter into prepared baking dish and top batter with peaches.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned around the edges and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cobbler comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Super easy, kid-friendly recipe that anyone can make. Can use any seasonal fruit as desired. Been making this recipe since I was about ten years old when taught by my grandma. We usually used peaches or blackberries, but you could certainly use any seasonal fruit you like.
