Ingredients:
2 (1 pound) loaves frozen bread dough, thawed
1 pound ground beef
1  onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 ½ teaspoons salt
1 ½ teaspoons lemon pepper
1 small head cabbage, chopped
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons caraway seeds
½ cup melted butter

Directions:
Saute beef, onion and garlic, salt and lemon pepper  in a large skillet over medium high heat, until beef is browned. Add cabbage, Worcestershire sauce and caraway seeds. Cook until cabbage is limp; drain liquid from mixture.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
On a lightly floured board, roll each loaf of dough into a 12 inch circle. Cut each circle into 6 wedges. Spoon cabbage/beef filling onto center of each dough piece, dividing equally. Pull three points of each wedge up to the center and pinch to seal. Place bierocks on a lightly greased cookie sheet. If desired, brush dough with melted butter or egg wash (1 egg white with 2 tablespoons water).
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve hot, or wrap and freeze for heating later.
