Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon garlic salt
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon Old BayÂ® Seasoning
1 teaspoon seasoning salt
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 medium green bell peppers, chopped
2 large tomatoes, chopped
1  red onion, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix the olive oil, garlic salt, parsley, chives, pepper, Old Bay Seasoning, and seasoning salt. Rub the chicken breasts with 1/2 the mixture, and place the breasts in a medium baking dish.
Toss the green bell peppers, tomatoes, and red onion with the remaining olive oil mixture. Arrange over the chicken.
Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, stirring the vegetables once, until the vegetables are tender, the chicken is no longer pink, and its juices run clear.

Description: 
I made this recipe with what was left in the fridge at college. It turned out a big success and everyone loves it! The tomatoes reduce to make a juice that's heavenly with crusty bread.
