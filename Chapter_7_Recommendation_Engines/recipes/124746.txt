Ingredients:
3/4 pound ground beef
1 (9 inch) unbaked pastry shell
3 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup chopped onion
4 teaspoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
In a skillet, cook the beef until browned. Meanwhile, line unpricked pastry shell with a double thickness of heavy-duty foil. Bake at 450 degrees F for 5 minutes. Remove foil; bake for 5 minutes more. Set aside. Drain beef; place in a large bowl. Add the eggs, mayonnaise, milk, onion, cornstarch, salt, pepper and 1 cup cheese. Pour into crust. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. If necessary, cover the edges of crust with foil to prevent overbrowning. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Let stand 5-10 minutes before cutting.

Description: 
This recipe has been a family favorite for years. It's easy to prepare and perfect for a busy schedule. I've also made this recipe with salmon - substituting two cans for the ground beef and adding 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice. It's great!
