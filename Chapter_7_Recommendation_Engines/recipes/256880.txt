Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/2 cups thinly sliced red onion
1 1/2 cups chopped zucchini
7 large eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 ounces BelGioioso Fresh Mozzarella Pearls cheese
3 tablespoons chopped oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
1/4 cup fresh basil, julienned

Directions:
Position rack in upper third of oven; preheat broiler.
Heat oil in a large broiler-safe nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and zucchini and cook, stirring frequently until soft, about 5 minutes.
In a bowl, whisk eggs, salt and pepper together. Pour over the vegetables in the pan. Cook about 2 minutes until nearly set. While cooking lift the edges to allow uncooked egg from the middle to go underneath. Top with Fresh Mozzarella and sun-dried tomatoes, place under broiler until the eggs are slightly browned, about 2 minutes. Let stand for 3 minutes. Top with basil. Slice and serve.
