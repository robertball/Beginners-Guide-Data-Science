Ingredients:
500 grams ground meat (any meat or combo will do)
100 grams roughly grated Parmigiano Reggiano Â®
1/8 tsp fresh ground black pepper
1 egg, beaten
1 tsp lemon zest (optional)
14 large, fresh lemon leaves
1 Tbsp baking soda

Directions:
Prepare a barbecue for grilling.
Rinse the lemon leaves under cool, running water.
Fill a large bowl with fresh, cool water and let the lemon leaves rest in the water.
Meanwhile, in a separate bowl mix together the ground meat, egg, cheese, pepper and lemon zest (if using) together until well combined. Form 7 meatballs equal in size and set aside.
Wash the lemon leaves with the tablespoon of baking soda, generously rinsing them under cool water.
Dry the lemon leaves carefully making sure no water remains.
Place one meatball on the upper side of one of the leaves and cover it with the upper side of another leaf. Do this for each 7 meatballs. Press each until the meat has covered the widest part of the leaf and has flattened slightly. There is no need to tie them up with anything.
Cook on the grill for approximately 15 minutes carefully turning over each "package" so each lemon leaf has had time to grill, allowing the flavour of each to work its way into the meat.

Description: 
This is one of my favourite grilled delights. This recipe was given to me by a family member from Sicily. Delicately seasoned ground meat mixed with a few ingredients is grilled between two lemon leaves giving the meat a lemony flavour like no other.
