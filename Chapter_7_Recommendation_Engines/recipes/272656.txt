Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (16 ounce) carton liquid egg whites
1/2 cup low-fat cottage cheese
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup packed fresh spinach, finely chopped
1/3 cup roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
1 tablespoon fresh basil, minced
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup muffin pan generously with cooking spray.
Combine egg whites, cottage cheese, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a blender; blend until smooth, about 15 seconds.
Combine spinach, roasted red peppers, and basil in a bowl. Pour in egg mixture and stir to combine. Ladle the mixture evenly into the muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full. Top each muffin with 1 teaspoon feta cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until egg white bites are set, 18 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
These low-calorie, low-fat egg bites make a quick weekday breakfast and they're equally as convenient for midday snacks. In order not to waste egg yolks and to save time, I like to use a carton of liquid egg whites. Egg whites tend to be rubbery, so adding in the cottage cheese helps make them creamier. You can store extras in the freezer and reheat as needed.
