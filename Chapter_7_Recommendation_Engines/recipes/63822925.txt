Ingredients:
12 large cabbage leaves (see below instructions)
1 1/2 lb. ground beef (I use half beef and half pork)
2 t. salt
1/2 t. pepper
1 cup cooked rice
1 small onion chopped
1 egg
1/2 t. thyme
2 T Oil
2 8oz. cans tomato sauce
1 T. brown sugar
1/4 cup water
1 T. lemon juice or vinegar

Directions:
Wash head of cabbage, partially cut core out of it. Run water into the core.Place in a large bowl with about an inch of water. Cover with plastic and microwave for about 5 minutes. This will soften the cabbage and make it easy to peel off leaves.
Mix the next seven ingredients.  Place in equal portions in cabbage leaf, folding sides in as you roll toward the thicker end. Secure with toothpick. Brown rolls in oil on stove top, or you can brown in a hot oven. Pour mixture of tomato sauce, brown sugar, water and lemon juice over rolls.  Cover pan and simmer l hour.  Or, you can place in slow cooker for a couple of hours, or in over at 300degrees for about 1 - 1/12/ hours.
