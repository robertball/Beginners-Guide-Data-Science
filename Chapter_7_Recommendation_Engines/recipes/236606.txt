Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1 spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with onion, celery, and green pepper
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, plus more for topping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour water in baking dish and place halved squash cut-sides down in the dish.
Bake squash in preheated oven until a fork pierces the skin very easily, about 45 minutes. Let squash cook while preparing remainder of recipe.
Melt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot butter until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and continue to saute until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Pour diced tomatoes over the onion mixture; season with basil. Place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the tomatoes are soft, about 30 minutes; season with salt and pepper.
Once squash is cool enough to handle, use a fork to strip flesh from the skin in strands. Stir squash and Parmesan cheese into tomato mixture. Replace cover on skillet and cook until squash is heated through, 5 to 10 minutes more. Sprinkle additional Parmesan cheese over the dish to serve.

Description: 
Very tasty twist for spaghetti squash. This will serve four as a main course with crusty bread, or more as a side to your favorite meat entree. Leftovers reheat very well, too.
