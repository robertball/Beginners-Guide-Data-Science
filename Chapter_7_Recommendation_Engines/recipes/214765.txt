Description: 
Handed down from my father, these baked stuffed chops were one of my favorites growing up. Not really 'stuffed,' but fabulous! The sherry, mushrooms, and cooking method combine for a truly rich and succulent dish that sets it apart from all others! I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!
