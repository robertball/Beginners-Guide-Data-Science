Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless top sirloin steak, about 3/4-inch thick, trimmed
1/4 cup canola oil, divided
1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/4 teaspoons salt, divided
2 medium lemons
1 (10 ounce) can tomatoes and green chilies, undrained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
6 cups hot cooked long grain rice
1/4 cup chopped cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Preheat grill or broiler. Rub both sides of steak with 2 tablespoons canola oil. Mix chili powder, cumin and 1/2 teaspoon salt; rub onto steak until well coated. Grill or broil steak 10 minutes for medium-rare, turning halfway through cooking, or to desired doneness. Place steak on cutting board and let rest 5 minutes before thinly slicing across the grain; set aside.
Meanwhile, grate 1 tablespoon lemon zest and combine with juice from two lemons and remaining 2 tablespoons canola oil in large bowl. Add tomatoes, black beans and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt and mix well. Add hot rice and toss to blend.
Place rice mixture on large serving platter and top with beef slices. Garnish with cilantro and additional lemon wedges, if desired.
