Ingredients:
1 cup margarine
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup white sugar
3 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/4 cup white sugar
1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 eggs, beaten
6 cups self-rising flour

Directions:
In a small saucepan, heat margarine and water over low heat. When margarine has melted, remove pan from heat and stir in salt and 1/4 cup sugar.
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and 1/4 cup sugar in 1 cup warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine yeast mixture and margarine mixture. Stir in beaten eggs and 2 cups self-rising flour. Beat in remaining flour 1 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition, until a stiff dough is formed. Divide dough into two pieces and place each piece in a well oiled freezer bag. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours.
Remove dough from refrigerator. Pull off pieces of dough and form into 2 inch diameter balls. Place in lightly oiled baking pans so that edges of balls are just touching. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake dough balls 15 minutes, until golden brown.
