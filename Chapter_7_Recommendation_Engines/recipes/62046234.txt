Description: 
Whenever it was a cold and rain day, my neighbor-- Wally-- would whip up this delicious and hearty soup. Chock full of beef, beans and vegetables, the kettle would be empty before we knew it. Though he is now gone, I always think of him on a rainy day and I am glad he gave me his quick and easy recipe. You can be creative with the vegetables you use, and frozen works just fine. My family usually goes for seconds and thirds, but if there are any leftovers, it freezes well.
