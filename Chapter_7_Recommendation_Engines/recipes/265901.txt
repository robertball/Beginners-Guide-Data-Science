Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup water
1 pinch salt
2 cups unsalted raw pumpkin seeds

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.
Combine sugar, water, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until sugar has dissolved and turned a golden brown color. Immediately add pumpkin seeds and mix well to coat with the caramelized sugar.
Spread the very hot pumpkin seed mix thinly onto the prepared baking sheet. Let cool to room temperature. Break or cut into bite-sized pieces. Store in an airtight container in a cool place or in the refrigerator.
