Ingredients:
1 cup semi-pearled farro, rinsed
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon
2 cups water
2/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil with garlic, drained and chopped
1 (8 ounce) package fresh mushrooms, cubed
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 pound yellow squash, cubed
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring farro, chicken bouillon, and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until farro is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain any excess water.
Cook and stir sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms with basil in a skillet over medium heat until mushrooms are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add squash and cook until tender, about 10 more minutes. Cook and stir farro with squash mixture until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle farro pilaf with Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This is a versatile dish. Substitute rice for farro if needed (though farro is worth hunting for) or add a pound of meat (diced chicken works well) to make this a main dish for 4.
