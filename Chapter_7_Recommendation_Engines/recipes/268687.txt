Ingredients:
3 cups peeled and cubed sweet potatoes
3 cups vegetable broth, divided
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 cup chopped onion
1 stalk celery, chopped
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons fresh grated ginger
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup raisins
2 tablespoons peanut butter

Directions:
Place sweet potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl and add a splash of the broth. Cook in the microwave until slightly softened, 3 to 5 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Add onion, celery, bell pepper, and garlic. Cook and stir for 3 to 5 minutes. Add softened sweet potatoes, remaining broth, chickpeas, tomatoes, lemon juice, ginger, cumin, curry powder, coriander, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cover pot. Simmer soup until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.
Stir raisins and peanut butter into soup and simmer 5 minutes more. Adjust spices if necessary.
