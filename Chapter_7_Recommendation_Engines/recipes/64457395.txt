Ingredients:
2 cups cooked Bulgur
1-1/2 cups whole wheat bread crumbs (2-3 slices of bread)
1-1/2 cups rolled oats
1 cup fire roasted tomatoes, with juice (fire roasted diced tomatoes add a lot of flavor)
1 small onion, diced
2 celery sticks, diced
1 carrot, diced
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts
3 Tbsps. soy sauce
2 tsps. Dijon mustard
1/2 tsp. dried thyme
1/4 tsp. dried sage
1/4 tsp. ground black pepper
sea salt, to your taste
1/2 cup ketchup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line the baking dish with parchment paper.
Combine all ingredients in large bowl. Mix with spoon, or do like I do and use your  hands to mix thoroughly. Press into prepared dish. Poke holes all over the top with finger, then spread a thin layer of ketchup over the top with spatula. Bake for 60 minutes. I broil mine for 5 minutes, just to get that browned top.
