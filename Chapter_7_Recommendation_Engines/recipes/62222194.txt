Ingredients:
1 cup butter, room temp
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon peppermint extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon red food coloring
1/2 cup peppermint candy canes, crushed

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugars. Beat in the egg and both extracts until well blended.
Slowly stir the flour and salt into the creamed mixture until well blended.
Take out half the batch and wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least one hour. Add the food coloring to the rest of the dough and mix until desired color. Wrap that dough and also chill.
In a blender crush the peppermint candies until it's a fine powder and put aside.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Use a greased cookie sheets or use waxed paper or Silplats.
I use a small melon ball to divide the dough into equal balls. Roll a small amount of each dough (or each ball) into a 2-4 inch long worm. If using the melon scooper and the cookies are too large for you, just cut each melon ball in half. Put each rope together and twist the rope to make the candy canes. Curve the end like a cane. Place onto prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven.
When out of the oven to cool, sprinkle cookies with crushed peppermint. Let the cookies cool on the sheet for about 5 mins before you remove the cookies to a wire cookie rack.
