Ingredients:
1/2 cup heavy cream, divided
3 tablespoons HERSHEYÂ®'S Cocoa Powder
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (10 ounce) package frozen strawberries in syrup, thawed
1 tablespoon cherry brandy

Directions:
Line two 1/2-cup coeur a la creme molds or two 6-ounce custard cups with double thickness of dampened cheesecloth, extending far enough beyond edges to enclose filling completely.
Combine 1/4 cup whipping cream, cocoa and butter in small saucepan.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until smooth.  Remove from heat; cool.
Beat cream cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla in small bowl until smooth.  Add cocoa mixture, blending well. Add remaining 1/4 cup whipping cream; beat until well blended.  Spoon mixture into prepared molds.  Fold cheesecloth over top.  Place a wire rack in a tray or deep plate; place molds on rack.
Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.  To serve, pull back cheesecloth and invert each mold onto a chilled dessert plate; carefully remove cheesecloth.  Serve with STRAWBERRY SAUCE.
STRAWBERRY SAUCE:  Puree 1 package (10 oz.) frozen strawberries in light syrup, thawed, in food processor bowl or blender container.   Strain puree through fine sieve into small bowl.  Stir in 1 tablespoon kirsch (cherry brandy), if desired.  About 1 cup sauce.
