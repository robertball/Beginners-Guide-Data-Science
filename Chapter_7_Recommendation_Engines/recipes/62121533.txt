Ingredients:
1 pre-made pizza crust
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced
Tony Chachere's creole seasoning
1 T. butter
1/2 C. hot sauce (recommended: Louisiana Hot Sauce)
Buttermilk Ranch dressing (I prefer the made from scratch)
2 ribs celery, sliced
Shredded mozzarella

Directions:
Heat your oven to 450.  Spray a skillet with nonstick spray.  Over medium to medium-high heat cook the chicken pieces.  Sprinkle Tony's over the chicken as it cooks.  Meanwhile, warm the butter and hot sauce until the butter melts.  When chicken is cooked through mix it with the hot sauce.
Spread your crust with ranch dressing to taste.  Then, place the chicken on the crust.  Don't pour it with the sauce, just use tongs or a fork to transfer.  Then, sprinkle as much cheese as you like and then sprinkle the cut up celery on top.  Place it in the overn for 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melted.  Serve with additional ranch dressing or blue cheese dressing.

Description: 
This tastes like a spicy buffalo wing and it's so easy!  It has all the flavorings of wings, but probably healthier.
