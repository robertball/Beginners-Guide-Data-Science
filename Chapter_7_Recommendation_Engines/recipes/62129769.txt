Title:
My Version of the Famous Lofthouse Cookie Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 French Vanilla cake mix (I used Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe brand)
1/2 c. flour + 3 T. flour (mix well into the cake mix)
3 eggs, large
1/3 c. oil (I used soybean)
icing:
1 stick unsalted butter, room temp.
1/3 c. shortening
1 tsp. vanilla
3 Tb. half and half or milk (this varies somewhat depending on how thick you want your icing.)
4 c. confectioners sugar

Directions:
mix well with a handmixer or Kitchen Aid.
The dough will be stiff, enough to roll into 1" balls.
I placed them on a Silpat type baking sheet.
Flatten the balls with your hand to about 1/2" thick.
Bake these off at 325* for about 12-14 minutes.
You will know they are done when they feel somewhat firm in the center.
Take them out of the oven and let them sit for at least 5 minutes to finish baking and let set up.
Transfer to a sheet of foil to cool completely. While they cool, start the icing.
Mix icing ingredients well with a hand mixer and either pipe on with a pastry bag or schmear on with a spatula. At this point, you MUST use sprinkles...if you don't, the sugar cookie faeries will come and take your cookies away, because you don't deserve them.
