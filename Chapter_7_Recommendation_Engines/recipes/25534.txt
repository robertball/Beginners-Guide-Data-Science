Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) jar whole jalapeno peppers, drained
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 pound ground pork sausage
2 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuit dough

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Slice jalapenos lengthwise to remove seeds. Stuff jalapenos with Cheddar cheese.
Divide ground pork sausage into small balls. Press the sausage balls into thin strips. Place one stuffed jalapeno onto each strip of sausage. Roll the jalapenos in the sausage, pressing it firmly.
Arrange wrapped jalapenos on a medium baking sheet. Bake 40 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, until sausage is evenly brown. Remove from heat and allow to cool approximately 10 minutes.
Arrange refrigerated biscuit dough on a medium baking sheet. Wrap one sausage and jalapeno roll in each piece of dough.
Bake in the preheated oven 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown.
