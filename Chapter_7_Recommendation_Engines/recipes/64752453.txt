1/4 cup flour plus 2 Tbsp flour, divided
1/2 pkg. (10 oz.)  spinach, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced

2 Tbsp Greek seasoning (or salt & pepper to taste)
1/2 pkg. (8 oz.) Shredded Sharp Cheddar Cheese, divided
2 Tbsp Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Grease a 9" x 13" baking dish and dust with 2 Tbsp flour. tap out remaining flour.
In a small bowl whisk half and half and remaining flour.  In large bowl whisk eggs & sour cream.  Add sour cream mixture, cottage cheese, chopped spinach, garlic, bacon and half of the cheese, mixing to combine. Pour into prepared baking dish.
Bake for 35 minutes, check with a knife in center to see if done.  Top with remaining cheese and Parmesan and bake an additional 5 minutes or until cheese is browned.

Description: 
The nice thing about this casserole is you can change it to suit your needs.  This is my wife's favorite but you can change out the meat (using ham or browned pork sausage) and you can change out the veggies(to zucchini, chopped cherry tomatoes) whatever to make your family happy.  It's also great to feed a group of people for a brunch or make it for just the two of you   and have breakfast made for the whole week.
