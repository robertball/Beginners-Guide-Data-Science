Ingredients:
2 egg whites
1 cup corn syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a bowl combine the egg whites, corn syrup, and vanilla beat on high speed of an electric mixer for about 6 to 7 minutes. The longer you beat it the stiffer it gets. So if you like a stiff frosting continue beating a little longer.

Description: 
This recipe is at least 90 years old, my grandmother says they used it a lot during the depression. Also, you can substitute lemon, almond, or whatever for the vanilla if you're so inclined, but I like vanilla the best. It's also fat free.
