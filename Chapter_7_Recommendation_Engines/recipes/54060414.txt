Ingredients:
3 cups dry navy beans, soaked overnight or boiled for one hour
1 1/2 cups ketchup
1 1/2 cups water
1/4 cup molasses
1 large onion, chopped
1 tablespoon dry mustard
1 tablespoon salt
6 slices thick cut bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 cup brown sugar
Might try using 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 tomato puree so that the beans are not so sweet.
Maybe cut back to 1/2 of the sugar.

Directions:
Drain soaking liquid from beans, and place them in a Slow Cooker.
Stir ketchup, water, molasses, onion, mustard, salt, bacon, and brown sugar into the beans until well mixed.
Cover, and cook on LOW for 8 to 10 hours, stirring occasionally if possible, though not necessary.
