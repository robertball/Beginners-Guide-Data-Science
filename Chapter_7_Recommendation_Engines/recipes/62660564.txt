Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork
4 cups shredded cabbage
1 large carrot, shredded
4 scallions, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 teaspoons fresh ginger root, grated
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 1/2 tablespoons molasses
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 (14 ounce) packages egg roll wrappers
Dipping sauces

Directions:
Cook pork in a large wok over medium-high heat. Drain and set aside.
In a large bowl, mix the cabbage, carrot, green bell pepper, onion, garlic and ginger. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch, soy sauce, and molasses until smooth.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in wok. Stir in cabbage mixture in batches, cooking each batch 3 to 4 minutes, just until tender. Return vegetables to bowl, and mix in pork. Stir in the cornstarch mixture.
Heat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit
Place about 1 tablespoon filling on each egg roll wrapper. Fold one corner of wrapper over filling. Fold wrapper sides over filling. Roll wrappers to form egg rolls.
Brush egg rolls with oil and bake 10 minutes at 425 degrees Fahrenheit, flip and bake for another 10 until crispy brown.

Description: 
These are the best tasting egg rolls you'll ever have. They're even better than the one's served at the Asian restaurants. My family just loves them. What's even better is that you can use a variety of different meats -- ground beef, pork steak, seasoned ground pork sausage, precooked shrimp -- or prepare them without meat for the vegetarians.Modified from: Cindi's Egg Rolls
