Ingredients:
1/2 peel of small mandarin orange
3 pounds whole carp, cleaned and scaled
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 cup cornstarch
2 cups sesame oil
2 1/2 tablespoons chopped garlic
3 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
1/4 cup chopped green onion
3 tablespoons dry sherry
1 tablespoon black bean sauce
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon white sugar
6 tablespoons chicken stock

Directions:
Soak the orange peel in warm water for 20 minutes or until it is soft.  Drain, and rinse the peel under running water. Squeeze out extra liquid. Chop the peel and set aside.
Make 3 or 4 slashes on either side of the fish and rub the fish with salt. Sprinkle the fish on both sides with cornstarch.
Heat oil in a frying pan or wok. When the oil is hot, deep fry the fish on both sides for approximately 4 to 6 minutes per side; both sides of the fish should be browned. Remove the fish from the pan and let it drain on paper towels
Dispense of all but 2 tablespoons of the oil (leave that oil in the pan or wok). Bring the oil back to a high heat, mix in the orange peel, garlic, ginger, and green onions. Stir fry for 30 seconds. Add sherry, bean sauce, soy sauce, sugar and chicken stock. Mix well, then add the fish to the mixture. Cover and let cook for 8 minutes. Serve immediately.
