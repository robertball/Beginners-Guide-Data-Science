Ingredients:
1 (4.3 ounce) package lemon pie filling (such as JELL-OÂ®)
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon arrowroot powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 orange, zested and juiced
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix lemon pie filling, whole wheat pastry flour, sugar, arrowroot powder, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl.
Whisk vegetable oil, orange zest, orange juice, lemon juice, and salt together in a separate bowl. Pour over lemon pie filling mixture; stir until dough is crumbly and moist throughout.
Drop 12 spoonfuls of dough 1 inch apart onto an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Transfer gently to a wire rack; let cool until firm.
