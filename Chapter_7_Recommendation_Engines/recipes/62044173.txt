2 Tbsp. sugar
8 cups torn fresh greens (we like a combination of Romaine and Boston lettuce)
1 can mandarin oranges, drained
2 Tbsp.vegetable oil
2 Tbsp. sugar
2 Tbsp. raspberry vinegar

Directions:
In non-stick skillet, heat sugar until melted and caramel color, over medium heat.  Add almonds, stirring constantly, until they are coated.  Immediately cool on waxed paper.  When cooled completely, break into coarse chunks.  Set aside.
In jar, combine oil, sugar, vinegar and salt.  Shake well.
Combine lettuce and oranges in large bowl.  Toss with dressing, then with almonds.  Serve immediately.
