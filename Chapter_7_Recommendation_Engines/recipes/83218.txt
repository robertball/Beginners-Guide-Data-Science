Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, cut into pieces
2 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
3/4 cup flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add butter, and cut in using a pastry blender or a fork until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and pour in the wet ingredients. Add coconut, and mix just enough to blend. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown.

Description: 
My best friend gave me this recipe she was given while in British Guyana. You can substitute butter with margarine if the thought of a half pound of butter terrifies you :-) These are really delicious!
