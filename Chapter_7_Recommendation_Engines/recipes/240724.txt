Ingredients:
1/2 banana, cut into chunks
1/4 cup pumpkin puree
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 eggs
2 teaspoons honey
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Beat banana, pumpkin puree, flour, eggs, honey, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl until smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by small spoonfuls onto the griddle to form 1 1/2-inch to 3-inch pancakes and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
These quick and easy pancake medallions are very healthy and delicious. My 5-year-old loves them! If you don't have pumpkin on hand, just use a whole banana instead of half. Serve warm with your choice of toppings (maple syrup, jam, fresh fruit, honey, etc.).
