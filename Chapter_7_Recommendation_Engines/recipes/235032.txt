Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef (80% lean)
2 cups fresh salsa
1 teaspoon taco seasoning mix
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups hot water
1 1/2 cups elbow macaroni
1 cup milk
1 (8 ounce) package processed cheese food (such as VelveetaÂ®), cut into cubes
4 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Return skillet to heat. Stir salsa, taco seasoning mix, and black pepper into the beef; simmer the mixture until hot, about 5 minutes.
Stir water, macaroni, and milk into the beef mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the skillet, and simmer the mixture until the pasta is tender, about 10 minutes.
Stir cheese food and Cheddar cheese into the pasta mixture; cook until the cheese melts completely, 5 to 7 minutes.
