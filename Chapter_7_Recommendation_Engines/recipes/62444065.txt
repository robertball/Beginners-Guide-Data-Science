Ingredients:
3 cups whole wheat rotini pasta
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 small onion, diced
2 1/2 cups jar spaghetti sauce
1 can (14 1/2 oz.) diced tomatoes
1/2 tsp. basil
1/2 tsp. oregano
1/2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
Shredded Parmesan cheese
4 ounces sliced turkey pepperoni
1/2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
In the meantime in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, cook ground turkey with onion until no longer pink.  Drain. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, basil, oregano and Worcestershire sauce and mix well. Set aside. Add the rotini to a spayed 9x13 baking pan. Sprinkle Parmesan on top of rotini then layer with sauce. It's only a matter of presentation whether you choose to mix the pepperoni in with the sauce or layer on top of the sauce in the pan. Then shred the mozzarella cheese over top of everything.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, until cheese is melted and golden.
