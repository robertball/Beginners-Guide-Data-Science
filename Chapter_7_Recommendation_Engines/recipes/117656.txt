Ingredients:
1 tablespoon paprika
4 teaspoons sugar, divided
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons pepper, divided
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 1/3 cups mayonnaise
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons cider vinegar

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine paprika, I teaspoon sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, garlic powder, thyme, lemon-pepper, cayenne and 1/2 to 1 teaspoon pepper; sprinkle over both sides of chicken.  Set aside.  In another bowl, combine mayonnaise, water, vinegar and remaining sugar, salt and pepper; cover and chill 1 cup for serving.  Save remaining sauce for basting.
Grill chicken, covered, over indirect medium heat for 4-6 minutes on each side or until juices run clear, basting frequently with remaining sauce.  Serve with reserved sauce.

Description: 
This spicy standout from Stephanie Kenney packs a one-two punch of flavor.  The grilled chicken is basted with a peppery white sauce.  'Plus there's plenty of extra sauce left over for dipping,' writes the Falkville, Alabama reader.
