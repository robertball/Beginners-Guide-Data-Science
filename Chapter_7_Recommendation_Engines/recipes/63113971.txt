Ingredients:
2 - 29oz cans of canned peaches in heavy syrup, drained.  (4-5 cups)
1/2 tsp of cinnamon
3 Tblsp of flour
1 cup of flour
1 cup of oatmeal
1 cup of brown sugar
1 cup of cold butter, cubed

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees.
In a medium bowl mix the flour and cinnamon. Add the peaches and mix. Then spread into a 13x9 inch pan.
Next, in a large bowl mix the 1 cup of flour, oatmeal, and brown sugar. Then cut the butter into the dry mixture (Try not to get the butter too warm. It should be crumbled and not a dough). Sprinkle evenly on top.
Place in the oven for 35-45 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 20 minutes.
Serve plain or with ice cream or whipped cream. Enjoy!

Description: 
I found this recipe years ago for a peach crisp. It is my favorite so far. It has a thick gooey sweet oatmeal cookie like crisp topping. I modified it some, for ease, but the recipe is essentially the same.
