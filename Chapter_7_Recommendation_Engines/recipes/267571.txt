Ingredients:
For Chocolate Cake:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
4 large eggs
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup Stevia In The Raw® Bakers Bag
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla
Peppermint Cream:
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup creme fraiche
2 tablespoons Stevia In The Raw® Bakers Bag
1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract
Cocoa powder
Crushed peppermint candies

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan and line with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl, vigorously whisk together eggs, sugar, and stevia, until mixture is thickened and light yellow. Whisk in butter and vanilla. Fold in dry ingredients just until combined.
Scrape batter into prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake until cake is set, 10 to 13 minutes. Do not overbake or the cake will dry out.
Run a thin knife along the pan edge to release cake from pan. Place a piece of parchment paper on a countertop and invert cake onto parchment. While cake is still hot, roll up cake tightly in parchment, starting at a short end. Let cake roll cool completely, at least 20 minutes.
Place heavy cream, creme fraiche, stevia, and peppermint extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat on medium speed until stiff.
Unroll cake and cover evenly with peppermint cream, leaving a 3/4-inch border all around. Re-roll cake tightly, but not so tightly that filling oozes out. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.
Right before serving, dust cake with cocoa powder and sprinkle with peppermint candies.
