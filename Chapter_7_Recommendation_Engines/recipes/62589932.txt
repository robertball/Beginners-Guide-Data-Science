Ingredients:
7-8 large Russet potatoes.
One stick of butter.
4 ozs of Heavy Whipping Cream.
4 ozs of Half and Half.
1/2 of a small onion, finely minced.
Paprika and/or fresh parsley for a garnish, your choice.

Directions:
Boil the whole potatoes with skins for 10 minutes. You are not cooking them long enough to mash or fall apart. Remove from pot and set aside to cool. When potatoes are just cool enough to handle, remove skin. The skin will come off easily.
Refrigerate potatoes. When cold, grate potatoes into lightly buttered 9" x 13 " dish.
Layer potatoes, minced onion, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.
Repeat layers until dish is full.
Now melt the stick of butter. Drizzle melted butter over Potatoes.
Then drizzle the 4 oz (small container) of Heavy Whipping cream over potatoes.
Lastly drizzle the 4 ozs of Half & Half over potatoes.
You can lightly dust top with paprika if you wish. Bake in 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes, till bubbly.

Description: 
My sister gave me this recipe years ago and it has become a staple of our Holiday or Company is Coming type dinner. 
Easy to assemble, can be prepared ahead of time. It pairs well with beef, ham or chicken. Leftovers, if there are any, reheat well. 
Everyone always loves the Irish Potatoes.
