Ingredients:
4 small boneless skinless chicken breasts
4 teaspoons taco seasoning mix
1/2 pound red potatoes, peeled, thinly sliced
1 cup KRAFT Tex Mex Shredded Cheese
1/2 cup salsa
1/4 cup sour cream

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Sprinkle chicken with seasoning mix. Place 1/2 cup potatoes on centre of each of 4 large sheets of heavy-duty foil; top with chicken, cheese and salsa.
Bring up foil sides. Double fold top and ends to seal each packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Place in 15x10x3/4-inch baking pan.
Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until chicken is cooked through (170 degrees F). Cool 5 minutes. Cut slits in foil to release steam before opening. Top with sour cream.
