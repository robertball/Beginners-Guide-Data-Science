Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup butter, or as needed
3 stalks celery, diced
1 large onion, diced
2 cups chopped tomatoes
1 tablespoon minced garlic
8 cups chicken broth
2 cups water
1 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/8 teaspoon saffron
salt and pepper to taste
2 pounds whiting (merluzzo), chopped into small chunks
12 mussels, in shells and cleaned
12 clams in shell, scrubbed

Directions:
Heat olive oil and butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add celery and onion and cook about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices and garlic. Simmer for 10 minutes.
Add chicken broth, water, and white wine to the pot with the vegetables and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Add parsley and saffron, and season with salt and pepper. Simmer broth 15 minutes more. Add fish to the soup.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil, about 5 minutes. Add mussels and clams, cover, and steam until shells open, 5 to 10 minutes.
Transfer steamed mussels and clams and the steaming liquid to the pot with the soup. Simmer soup 10 minutes more.

Description: 
This is a dish that is a bit spendy, so make it on special occasions. It is a wonderfully hearty yet low-cal and light soup that I find delectable! This is a seafood-lovers delight!
