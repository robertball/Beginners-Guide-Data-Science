Ingredients:
1 large eggplant
1 plum tomato, diced
1 1/2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons chopped parsley
Black pepper, to taste
Capers, for garnish, optional
Grilled pita bread, for serving

Directions:
Heat grill to medium high. Prick the eggplant all over with a fork, put in on the grill and close the cover; cook, turning occasionally, until eggplant is very soft and skin is blistered, about 15 minutes.
When cool enough, scoop out the insides of the eggplant and coarsely chop. Transfer to a bowl and toss with tomatoes, vinegar, salt, oregano and garlic. Stir in oil and parsley; season with pepper and more salt if needed. Garnish with capers if you like them. Serve with warm pita bread.
