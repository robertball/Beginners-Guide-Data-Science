Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
2 cups sugar
1 tablespoon loosely packed orange zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 table spoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon table salt
1 cup milk
8 large egg whites
shortening and flour for pans
Peppermint Ganache:
1 cup white chocolate chips
1 cups heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract
12 hard peppermint candies
Buttercream peppermint frosting:
1/2 cup butter
4 ounces Neufchatel cheese
1/8 teaspoon table salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract
16 ounces of powdered sugar
1-1.5 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Grease & flour 3 cake pans (9-in round or 8-in square).
Preheat oven to 325 F.  Cream butter at medium speed with an electric stand mixer.  Gradually add sugar, beating until light and fluffy.  Beat in orange zest & vanilla until blended.  Combine flour & next 2 ingredients; add to butter mixture alternately with milk, beginning & ending with flour mixture.  Beat at low speed just until blended after each addition.
Beat egg whites at high speed until stiff peaks form.  Stir egg whites into batter in 3 batches.  Spoon into 3 prepared cake pans.
Bake at 325 F for 25 minutes for round pans or 26-30 minutes for square pans, until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool in pans on wire racks 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks, & cool completely (about 1 hour).
Ganache:
Process peppermints in a food processor until finely crushed.  Place chips in a large bowl, or in the bowl of a stand mixer. Pour the cream into a saucepan, & bring to a boil. As soon as the cream boils up to the top of the pan, quickly remove it from the heat, & pour it over the chips. Let stand for a minute or two, then stir with a whisk, or use the paddle attachment for the mixer, to mix until smooth. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl occasionally. Stir in the extracts & ~1/4 cup crushed candies until well blended. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface, & allow to cool at room temperature, or in the refrigerator.
Buttercream:
Beat first three ingredients at medium speed until creamy.  Beat in extracts.  Gradually add powdered sugar alternately with milk, beating at low speed until smooth.
Place 1 layer on serving platter.  Spread 1 cup of ganache, repeating with second layer.  Top with last layer, the spread the top & sides with buttercream. Decora
