Ingredients:
Chocolate:
2 cups coconut oil, melted
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup raw honey, melted
2 tablespoons stevia powder (optional)
Strawberry Filling:
3/4 cup strawberries
1/4 cup coconut oil
1/4 cup sunflower seed butter
2 tablespoons raw honey
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and seeds scraped
1/4 teaspoon Himalayan rock salt

Directions:
Whisk 2 cups coconut oil, cocoa powder, 1/2 cup honey, and stevia powder together in a bowl until smooth.
Blend strawberries, 1/4 cup coconut oil, sunflower seed butter, 2 tablespoons honey, lemon juice, vanilla bean seeds, and rock salt in a food processor until smooth; transfer to a bowl and refrigerate.
Pour 1/2 the chocolate mixture into the bottoms of truffle molds or ice cube trays; freeze until partially hardened, about 10 minutes. Keep the remaining chocolate at room temperature.
Spoon 1 1/2 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon strawberry filling over frozen chocolate; top each with remaining chocolate, filling molds to the top. Freeze truffles until set, about 15 minutes more.
