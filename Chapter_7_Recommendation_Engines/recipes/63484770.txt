Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped bell pepper
1 egg, lightly beaten
8 ounces canned diced tomatoes with juice
1/2 cup quick-cooking oats
Topping:
1/3 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon prepared mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Mix all meatloaf ingredients well and place in a baking dish. Shape into a loaf.
Topping:
Mix ingredients for topping and spread on loaf. Bake for 1 hour.
** form mixture into domed or half-football shaped loaf.  This would allow the extra juices to run out of the loaf as it bakes.  Also, the loaf would develop a crust that would help the mixture to hold its form.
3. One trick to help with the slicing of meatloaf is to allow it to rest for at least 10 min. at room temperature after baking.  This lets the accumulated fluid to reabsorb into the meat.
4. I personally think that sauteing the vegetables (e.g. onion, pepper, mushrooms, shredded carrot, tomato) before adding them to the raw beef mixture improves the flavor and texture of the final product.  It is an extra step, but is worth the effort.
5. I prefer the texture of torn stale bread in meatloaf rehydrated with milk to using oatmeal as an extender.  The quality of the bread is important, however.  Wonderbread will give a soggy rubbery texture, but a whole wheat bread or a bread with plenty of crust and texture holds up well.
As with making grilled hamburgers, you need to use a ground beef with plenty of fat (~20%).  If you try to use the lean ground beef, your burger patties and meatloaf with fall apart.
