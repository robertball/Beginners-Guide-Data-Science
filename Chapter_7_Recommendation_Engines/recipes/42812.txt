Ingredients:
3 pounds pork shoulder
1 onion, chopped
4 green bell peppers, chopped

1 bunch cilantro, chopped
1 cup water
1 1/4 cups cooking sherry
1 1/2 tablespoons dried oregano
1 tablespoon salt

Directions:
Cut pork into small pieces, removing as much fat as possible.  Transfer pork to a large frying pan or Dutch oven, and cook and stir until brown.
Stir in onion, bell peppers, chile peppers, and cilantro. Add water and sherry, and season with oregano and salt.  Cover, and simmer for about 2 1/2 hours, or until pork is tender. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.
