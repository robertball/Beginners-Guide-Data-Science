Dairy-Free Biscuits Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons vegan butter (such as Earth BalanceÂ®)
3 tablespoons coconut oil
1 cup cold unsweetened almond milk, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking pan with parchment paper or a nonstick silicone baking mat, such as SILPAT(TM).
Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in vegan butter and coconut oil with a pastry blender or a fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Slowly add cold almond milk and stir until dough just comes together. It may not be necessary to use all the milk; dough will be wet and sticky.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead (fold over) 15 times. Gently roll or pat dough to a 1- or 1 1/2-inch thickness. Cut biscuits with a small biscuit cutter or a small bourbon glass. Gently re-roll the dough scraps and cut remaining biscuits.
Place biscuits on the prepared baking sheet. Be sure they are touching each other and the sides of the pan; don't be afraid to squish them in--this helps them to rise high.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
These biscuits have layers of flaky goodness with so much flavor, and most importantly they are dairy-free. The biscuits go great with butter and jam, sorghum, or sausage gravy.
