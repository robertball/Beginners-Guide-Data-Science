Ingredients:
1 pound sage pork sausage
1 small onion, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, chopped
1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 egg, beaten
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1/3 cup milk
2 cups buttermilk baking mix
1/4 cup melted margarine
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook and stir the sausage, onion, and jalapeno until the sausage is well browned, about 10 minutes. Drain; set aside to cool slightly.
Stir together the Swiss cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, hot sauce, and milk in a large bowl. Stir in the biscuit mix, margarine, salt, and parsley. Add the sausage mixture; stir until well combined. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Serve warm or cold.
