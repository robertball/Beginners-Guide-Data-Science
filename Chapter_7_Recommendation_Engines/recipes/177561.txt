Ingredients:
1/2 (17.3 ounce) package Pepperidge Farm® Puff Pastry Sheets
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons chopped garlic
1 baby eggplant , cut diagonally in 1/2-inch thick slices
1 large zucchini , cut diagonally in 1/2-inch thick slices
1 large yellow squash , cut diagonally in 1/2-inch thick slices
1 tablespoon prepared pesto sauce
4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled
1 whole roasted sweet pepper , drained and cut into thin strips

Directions:
Thaw the pastry sheet at room temperature for 40 minutes or until it's easy to handle. Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly grease or line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir the egg and water with a fork in a small bowl.
Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Roll the sheet into a 13x11-inch rectangle. Place on the prepared sheet. Brush the edges of the rectangle with the egg mixture. Fold over the edges 1/2 inch on all sides, pressing firmly with a fork to form a rim. Prick the pastry thoroughly with a fork. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Stir the oil and garlic in a small bowl. Place the eggplant, zucchini and squash in a single layer on a shallow-sided pan. Brush with the oil mixture. Turn vegetables over and brush with more oil. Season to taste. Bake the vegetables 4 minutes, turning halfway through cooking. Cool slightly.
Spread the pesto on the pastry. Arrange the vegetables alternately in rows. Sprinkle with the cheese.
Bake for 20 minutes or until golden. Sprinkle with the red pepper. Serve immediately.
