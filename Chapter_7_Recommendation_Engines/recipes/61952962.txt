Ingredients:
Sub rolls
vinaigrette salad dressing
mayonnaise
freshly ground black pepper
thinly sliced cheese
(Muenster, Swiss, or provolone)
thinly sliced tomato
thinly sliced bell pepper strips
romaine or leaf lettuce
optional:sliced black olives
sliced pickles
sliced pickled peppers

Directions:
Slice the rolls almost all the way through. Heat them briefly in a 350-degree oven if they're not perfectly fresh.
Open the rolls and spread a very thin coating of vinaigrette dressing on each half, then top with a thin layer of mayonnaise and some black pepper. Layer all the remaining ingredients on the rolls, being careful not to overstuff them. Close the sandwiches and slice them in half.
