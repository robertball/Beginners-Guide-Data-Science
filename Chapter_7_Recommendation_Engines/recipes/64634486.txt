Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked old fashioned oats
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1-2 teaspoons of cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 8oz container blueberries (or raisins and dried cranberries)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 cups milk (I used 1%)
1/2 cup applesauce (about 2 apple sauce pouches)
1 1/2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 large egg, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°.
Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Combine the milk, applesauce, butter, egg, and vanilla in a separate bowl. Add milk mixture to oat mixture; stir well.
Pour oat mixture into an 8-inch square baking dish coated with cooking spray.
Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden and slightly firm in center.  Serve warm.  Optional: pour some milk over it.
