Ingredients:
1/4 C. Chipotle in Adobo
2 Poblano Pepper (roasted skin and seeds removed)
1 lb. Extra Firm Tofu
1 tsp. Ground Cumin
1 tsp. Oregano
1 tsp. Salt
1 tsp. Tajin Seasoning
3 tbsp. Olive Oil (divided)
1 tbsp. Sugar (optional)

Directions:
Blend 1/4 cup Chipotle in Adobo Sauce, roasted poblano peppers, oregano, salt, cumin, Tajin seasoning and 2Tbsp. oil until mixture becomes a paste (if the mixture is thick add oil 1tsp. at a time until desired consistency).
Drain Tofu and pat dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture. In a bowl, scramble tofu using clean hands.
Add 2 tbsp of marinade per half pound of tofu and mix well. Add more marinade until desired spiciness and adjust with salt and/or sugar to taste. Marinade 1 to 2 hours or overnight.
Heat remaining oil in frying pan and add marinated tofu. Saute for 4-6 minutes over medium to medium-low heat, until heated through. Serve with hot rice, sour cream and salsa verde in the tortilla of your choice.
