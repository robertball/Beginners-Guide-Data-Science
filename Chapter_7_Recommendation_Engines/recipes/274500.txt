Ingredients:
1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
1 small onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, peeled
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 limes, juiced, divided
1 teaspoon ground cumin (optional)
1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano (optional)
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/8 cup water, or as needed
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, butterflied
1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped

Directions:
Combine 1 to 5 chipotle peppers with their sauce, onion, garlic, olive oil, juice of 1 lime, cumin, oregano, and salt in a food processor. Blend until smooth, adding water as needed if too thick. Reserve a small amount of marinade mixture to serve with grilled chicken.
Combine chicken with marinade in a plastic storage bag. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade and discard excess.
Place chicken breasts on the preheated grill and cook until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 8 minutes per side, being careful not to overcook.
Remove chicken from the grill and transfer to a plate. Squeeze juice of remaining lime onto chicken and garnish with cilantro. Serve with reserved marinade mixture.
