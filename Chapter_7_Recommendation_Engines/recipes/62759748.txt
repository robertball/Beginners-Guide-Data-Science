Ingredients:
1 cup Amish Friendship Bread Starter
3 eggs
1 cup oil
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup crushed pineapple, drained
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups flour
1-2 boxes vanilla instant pudding
1 cup nuts, chopped
1 cup raisins
3 medium carrots, shredded
Cream Cheese Frosting ingredients
1 stick butter, softened
3 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
a pinch of salt
1 pound confectioner’s (powdered) sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325° F (165° C).
In a large mixing bowl, add ingredients as listed.
Grease two large loaf pans.
Dust the greased pans with cinnamon-sugar mixture of 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 cup sugar.
Pour the batter evenly into loaf or cake pans and sprinkle the remaining sugar-cinnamon mixture on the top.
Bake for one hour or until the bread loosens evenly from the sides and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.
ENJOY!
Cream Cheese Frosting directions: With an electric mixer at medium speed, beat butter and cream cheese until soft and fluffy. Add vanilla extract and salt and beat well. Slowly add sugar and mix at medium speed until frosting is fluffy and spreadable.
