Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 cups cubed salami
1 medium onion, diced
1 medium green bell pepper, diced
6 cloves garlic, crushed
1 large eggplant - peeled, seeded, and cubed
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 bunch cilantro, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
dried oregano to taste
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas)
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 bay leaves
4 green onions, chopped
6 cups water
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar (optional)
hot sauce (optional)

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the salami, and cook until evenly browned. Mix in onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Cook until tender. Mix in eggplant, tomato paste, and cilantro, and season with salt, pepper, and oregano. Continue cooking 15 minutes. Mash the eggplant as it softens, and add a little water if necessary to keep the ingredients from drying out.
Stir the garbanzo beans, tomatoes, bay leaves, and green onions into the skillet, and pour in the water. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes. Stir in vinegar and hot sauce before serving.
