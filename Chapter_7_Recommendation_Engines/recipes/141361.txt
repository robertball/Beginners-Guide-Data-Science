Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
6 pounds boneless pork shoulder
1 cup ground cumin
4 dried New Mexico chiles, seeded and cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1 onion, quartered
6 cloves garlic, halved
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
6 cups water
6 tomatoes, chopped
1 onion, chopped
2 tomatillos, husked and chopped
2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1/3 cup lime juice
1 tablespoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the pork in the hot oil until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Place into a slow cooker along with the cumin, New Mexico chiles, quartered onion, garlic, and 1 minced jalapeno pepper. Pour in the water, cover, and cook on High for 6 to 8 hours, then reduce heat to Low and cook until the pork is tender and easily shredded, 12 to 16 hours more. Once cooked, remove the pork and vegetables to a large bowl and shred finely with two forks. Mix in enough cooking liquid to moisten the meat to your taste.
Prepare the pico de gallo 2 to 6 hours before the carnitas will be ready. Combine the tomatoes, onion, tomatillos, and 2 minced jalapeno peppers in a mixing bowl. Season with lime juice, salt, and pepper. Mix well, and refrigerate until ready to serve.

This recipe stems from a household that loves carnitas and has perfected it.  It makes a lot of food and I have never thrown a piece away.  My neighbors, employees, family, and friends love it.  A must for social occasions. Serve with warmed white corn tortillas, shredded cheese, sour cream, and fresh chopped cilantro.
