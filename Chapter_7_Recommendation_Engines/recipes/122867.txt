1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup finely chopped walnuts
1 (8 ounce) package milk chocolate kisses
1 1/3 cups confectioners' sugar, divided
2 tablespoons baking cocoa

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter, sugar and vanilla. Gradually add flour. Fold in walnuts. Refrigerate dough for 2-3 hour or until firm. Shape into 1-in. balls. Flatten balls and place a chocolate kiss in the center of each; pinch dough together around kiss. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12 minutes or until set but not browned. Cool for 1 minute; remove from pans to wire racks. Sift 2/3 cup confectioners' sugar and cocoa. While cookies are still warm, roll half in cocoa mixture and half in remaining confectioners' sugar. Cool completely. Store in an airtight container.
