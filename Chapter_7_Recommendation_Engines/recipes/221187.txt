Grease a 14-inch pizza pan.
Mix cookie dough, softened butter, and egg together in a bowl.
Spread cookie dough mixture onto prepared pizza pan to cover entirely.

Beat confectioners' sugar into peanut butter in a bowl until completely integrated.
Spread peanut butter mixture over cooled cookie dough crust.
Arrange halved peanut butter cups atop peanut butter layer.
Sprinkle chocolate chips around peanut butter cups.

Description: 
This dessert pizza pairs nicely with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a cup of vanilla coffee, or a tall glass of cold milk! I made this for my son's high school graduation, for Reese's® Peanut Butter Cups are his favorite! I wanted to do something different, so I thought why not make a dessert pizza from his favorite treat? I just hope I can control myself around this dessert now!
