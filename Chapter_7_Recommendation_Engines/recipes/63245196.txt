Description: 
Ahh, Vina Dosh, a Portuguese dish and tradition of my family during Christmas. It started getting passed down more than 80 years ago when my grandparents came to America from the Azore Islands! Easy to make, but lots of patience to wait for the marinade to make its magic. But… oh so worth the wait! As it was passed down to me, I share it with you.
Deus te abençoe. Divirta-se!
