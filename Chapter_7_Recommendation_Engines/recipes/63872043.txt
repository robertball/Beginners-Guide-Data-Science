Ingredients:
Cookie:
1 milk chocolate cake mix
2 eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
Frosting:
1 stick (1/2 cup) margarine, softened
1/4 cup milk
1-2 tsp vanilla (depending on your taste)
3 teaspoons cocoa
2-3 cups of powdered sugar

Directions:
Cookie
Mix all ingredients together. Roll into 1-1.5? balls. Place on cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees for  5-6 minutes.
Pull the cookie sheet out of the oven and place 6-7 mini marshmallows on each cookie. Put the cookie sheet back into the oven for 2-2.5 minutes (no longer!).
The marshmallows will kind of puff up like this.
Let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet for a couple of minutes, and then remove to wire rack to cool.
Once they are cooled completely, put frosting on top.
Frosting
Combine all ingredients with hand mixer. Frost tops of cooled cookies.
