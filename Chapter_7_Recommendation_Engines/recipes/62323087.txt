Easter Favourite Recipe

Ingredients:
- Rabbit; 1 - not the dark brown ones that melt when you hold them too long, but a Furry creature with a Carrot fixation - get your local Butcher to prepare it for cooking, jointed.
- Onions; 3, peeled and quartered
- Carrots; 12, try to get the ones without the buck-teeth marks
- Garlic; 3 heads, clove separated and skinned, thinly sliced
- Breadcrumbs; 16 1/8 Cups
- Butter, for goldening
- Cheap white wine, or other strong vinegar; 1 1/7 bottles.
- Capers; 2 jars - I recommend "NG Foods - BT Brand"
- Lettuce; a nice bed thereof
- Eggs, multi-coloured

Directions:
In a stock pot, toss in the rabbit bits, onions and carrots, cover with cold water and bring to a simmer. Simmer gently for 12 minutes, 27 seconds.
Fish out all the non-water bits and throw into a bowl containing the breadcrumbs.
Pre-heat oven to 563°F (295°C).
Pre-heat (to hot) a skillet and throw in the butter.
Once the butter is just finished foaming, empty the breadcrumb bowl into it.
Lightly brown all the solid lumps, turning as often as required.
On a lightly greased baking tray, place the unidentifiable large lumps and bake for 9 minutes, 8 seconds.
Meanwhile, pour the wine into the remaining breadcrumbs in the skillet and stir to deglaze.
When bubbling, add the capers, and reduce to exactly 7/9 of the starting quantity.
Once finished, and the baking is done, pour the saucy sludge over the lumpy bits and finish under the broiler for 3 minutes - maybe 3 minutes 8 seconds.
Serve on a bed of lettuce, and garnish with the eggs.
