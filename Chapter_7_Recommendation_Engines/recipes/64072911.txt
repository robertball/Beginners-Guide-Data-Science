1 cup water

Wash and peel carrots. Cut into rounds that are approximately 1/2 inch thick.
Combine vinegar, water, sugar and canning salt in an 8-quart Dutch oven or stockpot. Bring
to a boil and boil 3 minutes.
Add carrots and bring back to a boil. Then reduce heat to a simmer and heat until half-cooked (about 10 minutes).
Meanwhile, place 2 teaspoons mustard seed and 1 teaspoon celery seed into each empty hot pint jar. Fill jars with hot carrots,leaving 1-inch headspace. Fill with hot pickling liquid, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Remove air bubbles and adjust headspace if needed. Wipe rims of jars with a dampened clean paper towel. Adjust lids and process 25 min.

Description: 
Bought too many carrots to eat fresh so needed a way to preserve them. Thought they would be good in asian noodle salad bowls or other salads.
