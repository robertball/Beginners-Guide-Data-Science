Ingredients:
1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1/3 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup honey
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, or to taste
freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 tsp corn starch
1 Tbsp water

Directions:
Add the broth, soy sauce, honey, garlic, red pepper flakes, and pepper to the Instant Pot. Whisk together well.
Add the chicken thighs, and turn to coat with the liquid.
Lock the lid and set to manual pressure for 8 minutes.
When time is up, do a quick release of pressure. Remove chicken and set aside.
Turn the Instant Pot to saute. Make a slurry with the corn starch and water and add to the Instant Pot.
Stir the sauce until it has thickened and reduced, about 5 minutes. Remove the inner pot.
Add chicken to sauce and toss to coat well. Serve with your favorite sides.
