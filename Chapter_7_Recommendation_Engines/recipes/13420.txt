Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) whole chicken
4 cubes chicken bouillon
2 cups all-purpose flour
4 eggs
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Fill a large pot with water, and add whole chicken. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat.  Simmer until tender, about 1 to 2 hours.
Remove chicken from broth, and set aside to cool.  Reserve broth.  When cool enough to handle, remove meat from bones; cut into bite size pieces. Discard skin and bones.
In a medium bowl, stir together flour and salt.  Break one egg into flour, and stir with fork till stiff. Continue adding eggs one at a time until all are incorporated.  The dough should be very stiff.
Bring broth to a boil.  Add bouillon cubes; stir until cubes have dissolved.
Using a fork and knife, pick up dough on fork.  Hold over boiling broth, and cut off small pieces into broth until all the dough has been used.  Stir, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
Add chicken meat, and stir. Serve hot.

Description: 
This is an old family recipe developed by my grandmother, whose arthritic hands would not allow her to roll noodles. Each generation has made small changes to suit their families. A simple and wholesome chicken and dumpling soup.
