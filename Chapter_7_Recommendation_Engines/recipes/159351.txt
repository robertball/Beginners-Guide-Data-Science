Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable shortening
4 cups confectioners' sugar
5 tablespoons soy milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Beat the shortening and confectioners' sugar together until the shortening has been incorporated, and the mixture is clumpy. Pour in the soy milk and vanilla extract; beat until smooth.

Description: 
This nice icing keeps its shape.  It's great for piping on cut-out cookies, yet stiff enough for making flowers.  It may be too sugary to mound up on cupcakes, unless of course you have a strong sweet tooth! I like using pure bourbon vanilla extract in this.
