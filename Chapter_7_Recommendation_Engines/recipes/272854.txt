Ingredients:
butter
9 ounces purple carrots, finely grated
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 eggs
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/4 cup light vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon purple food coloring (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter.
Combine grated carrots, brown sugar sugar, white sugar, and lemon zest in a bowl. Toss to coat and allow the natural juices to come out. Set aside.
Mix flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl.
Whisk eggs, applesauce, oil, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Add flour mixture 1/4 cup at a time, mixing until just combined. Fold in carrot-sugar mixture with all the juice that has accumulated. Add food coloring. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
Cool cake on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges of the pan to loosen. Invert cake carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely.

Description: 
Carrot cake gets a makeover with purple carrots. This cake is light and moist, not too sweet, and has a rich purple color. Purple carrots taste exactly like their orange cousins but give such a beautiful presentation, they're nice for a change.
