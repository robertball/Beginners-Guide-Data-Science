Ingredients:
3 large tea bags
2 small (celestial seasonings) blueberry breeze tea bags
1 package unsweetened lemonade koolaid
2/3 cup splenda
2 quarts hot water
2 quarts cold water

Directions:
In hot (but not boiling) water, add the tea bags to steep 5-8 minutes.
In cold water, add koolade, splenda and mix well.
Remove tea bags from hot water but do not squeeze them as this makes tea bitter
Combine koolade mixture and tea mixture and stir well.  Serve over lots of ice and enjoy!
