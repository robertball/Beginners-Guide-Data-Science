Description: 
Mmmmmh, I enjoyed my mum's cooking for many, many years. Having moved away from home, I needed to learn how to cook Korean dishes asap. I experimented a little bit, knowing what the basic ingredients for Bulgogi were and voila! This is a delicious, melt-in-your-mouth beef dish, perfect with steamed rice!
