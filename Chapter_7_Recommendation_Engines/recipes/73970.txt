Ingredients:
3 green bell peppers, cut into large chunks
1/2 cup sliced jalapeno peppers
1 pinch dried oregano
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat a grill for medium-high heat. When the grill is hot, lightly oil the grate.
Place the pepper pieces onto the grill with the inside facing down. Cook until slightly charred, 3 to 5 minutes.
Turn peppers over, and place jalapeno slices onto them. Top with some mozzarella cheese, and sprinkle with a bit of oregano. Grill until cheese melts, then remove to a plate and serve.

Description: 
A friend made this the other day and it was great, so I had to share. The more colors you use the more colorful it is. Our friend just sprinkled oregano. We added the jalapeno for heat.
