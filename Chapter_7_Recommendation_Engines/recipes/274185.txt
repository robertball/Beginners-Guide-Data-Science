Ingredients:
Crepes:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons butter, melted
2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 lemon, zested
1 tablespoon butter, or as needed
Raspberry Filling:
1 (12 ounce) package frozen raspberries, thawed
1 (8 ounce) carton sour cream
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup powdered sugar

Directions:
Combine flour, milk, sugar, eggs, butter, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, salt, and lemon zest in an electric blender. Blend until smooth. Pour batter into a shallow pie pan.
Melt butter in a frying pan or crepe maker over medium heat. Pour 2 tablespoons of batter into the skillet and immediately rotate the skillet to spread batter out in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crepe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen crepe; flip crepe and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.
Combine raspberries, sour cream, cream cheese, and powdered sugar in a medium bowl using an electric mixer. Top each crepe with a spoonful of filling and fold over or roll up.
