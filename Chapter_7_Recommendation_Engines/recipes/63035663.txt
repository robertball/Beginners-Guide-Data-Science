Ingredients:
1 pound dry fettuccini pasta
2/3 cup butter
1 cup heavy cream
salt and pepper to taste
5/8 dash garlic salt
5/6 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
2. Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
3. In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat. Add salt, pepper and garlic salt. Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted; this will thicken the sauce.
4. Add pasta to sauce. Use enough of the pasta so that all of the sauce is used and the pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a recipe I made modifying another similar recipe from erin marie. My family absolute loves chicken Alfredo, but they are very picky as well. The only chicken Alfredo that really blew them away was Olive Gardens; until they tried mine, oh course.
