Ingredients:
4 eggs
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup water
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/3 cup almond flour
1/4 cup ground flax meal
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup Sargento Chef Blends 4 State Cheddar shredded cheese, plus a little extra to sprinkle on top
2 Tbsp chopped fresh thyme

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and place rack in middle of oven.
In a medium bowl combine the eggs, butter, water and salt and using a whisk, combine well.  Sift in the almond flour, flax meal, and baking soda and keep mixing.  Then add in the cheese and dried herbs and stir just until all ingredients are well incorporated.
Spoon batter evenly into muffin pan.  Sprinkle each muffin with extra cheese.  Bake for 13-14 minutes until just golden on top (watch closely: nut flours burn easily).  Let cool and devour!
