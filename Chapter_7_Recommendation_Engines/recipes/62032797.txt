Ingredients:
10 slices of bacon
1 head of broccoli, diced
1 head of cauliflower, diced
1 red onion, chopped
Real mayonaise
Sugar
Mozzarella cheese, finely shredded

Directions:
1  Place bacon in skillet and cook until brown and crispy.  Set aside
2  Combine broccoli, cauliflower, and onion into large bowl.
3  Spoon in mayo until creamy.  About 2-3 cups.
4  Now comes the tasting part.  Add about a cup of sugar and stir.  Now taste.  Too sweet then add more mayo, not too sweet then add sugar.
5  Add onion and mozzarella.  I measure this by color but I like alot of cheese.
6  Just before serving, crumble bacon and add to salad.  Give it a good stir.  You can always add more of the sugar and mayo.  I usually make my husband and daughter do the tasting also.  When it is to your liking then Serve!

Description: 
This recipe is my favorite salad to make.  For the longest time I would not give it out not only because it is good and I always brought it to family gatherings but because I dont measure what I put into it.  That is the best way it seems.  I finally broke down and starting giving the recipe out and now when we do have gatherings it seems we have alot of salad but they do all taste great.  Hope you enjoy!
