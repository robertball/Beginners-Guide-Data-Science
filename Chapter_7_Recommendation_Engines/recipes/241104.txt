Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) ground sausage roll
1/3 cup water
cooking spray
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent roll dough
12 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage and water in the hot skillet until sausage is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Spread crescent roll dough out into prepared baking dish to cover the inside of the dish completely. Prick dough all over with a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until slightly set, about 5 minutes.
Beat eggs, milk, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.
Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and place skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir egg mixture in hot skillet until eggs are set, 3 to 5 minutes. Break up eggs into small pieces using a wooden spoon. Spread eggs evenly over crescent roll dough, spread sausage over eggs, and top with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is browned and casserole is hot, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
This is my family's favorite breakfast recipe, always served on holiday mornings. It's great when complemented with fruit and resurrection cinnamon rolls. You can assemble this casserole, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate it overnight before baking, if desired.
