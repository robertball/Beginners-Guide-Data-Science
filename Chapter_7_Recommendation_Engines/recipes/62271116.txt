Ingredients:
3 C Sugar
3 C Vinegar
1/4 C Salt
1 Tbsp Mustard Seed
1 Tbsp Tumeric
1 Tbsp Celery Seed
pinch alum
Cucumbers
Onions

Directions:
Heat all to boiling, make sure sugar is dissolved. Slice cukes and onion and place in jars. Pour the hot mix over the sliced pickles and onions. Cap and set on the counter till cool. Then place in frigerator, the jars should seal, but if they don't, it's ok, you're not canning.  Keeps in frig(glass or plastic)for a year. Makes 2 quarts. **Do not breathe in the fumes coming off the boiling mixture. The tumeric will stain anything it touches yellow. I place the handle part of a long teaspoon in the jar so it doesn't break. I decant the pot into a heatproof glass measuring cup to pour into the jars easier.
