Ingredients:
10 leaf (blank)s fresh mint leaves
½  lime, cut into 4 wedges
2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste
1 cup ice cubes
1 ½ fluid ounces white rum
½ cup club soda

Directions:


Submitter: 
Brandy
Description: 
This is an authentic recipe for mojito. I sized the recipe for one serving, but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full. It's a very refreshing drink for hot summer days. Be careful when drinking it, however. If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing yourself, and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time! Tonic water can be substituted instead of the soda water but the taste is different and somewhat bitter.
