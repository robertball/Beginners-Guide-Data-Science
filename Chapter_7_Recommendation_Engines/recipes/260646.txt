Ingredients:
2 large zucchini
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced

1 lemon, zested and juiced
1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as SrirachaÂ®)
salt and ground pepper to taste
1 pound large cooked shrimp
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cut zucchini into noodles using a spiralizer (fitted with the large shredding blade). Let sit in a colander.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken broth, lemon zest, 1/2 the lemon juice, and chile-garlic sauce. Add the zucchini noodles; season with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Cook until tender, about 2 minutes. Add shrimp; cook and toss until warmed through, about 2 minutes more. Top with Parmesan cheese.
