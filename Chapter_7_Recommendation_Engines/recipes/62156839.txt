Ingredients:
1 lb. package of pasta (I use Cellentani)
6 tablespoons unsalted butter (not margarine)
6 tablespoons flour
3 cups milk
1 cup cream
1 1/2 lbs smoked Gouda cheese, shredded
1 tsp pepper, or to taste
2 tsp salt, or to taste

Directions:
Cook the pasta according to package directions to al dante, drain and set aside. (You may want to do this while you are preparing the sauce so the pasta does not get too soggy as it sits. You just need to have the pasta ready when the sauce is completed so it can be poured over the pasta right away.)
In saucepan make a roux by melting the butter over low heat, sprinkle flour over melted butter and stir well to blend and smooth. Turn up heat to medium and continue cooking and stirring the roux for 5 minutes. Gradually add the milk a little at a time whisking well after each addition of milk (the mixture will be very thick and pasty to begin with but will thin out as more milk is added). Cook in medium-low heat, stirring so mixture does not stick to bottom of pan or form lumps. Cook until thickened and bubbly. Add the cream, cheese and seasonings. Stir over heat until cheese is melted and blended in well. Pour sauce over prepared pasta, stir and toss until all the pasta is well coated with the sauce. (The cook time is based on preparing the pasta at the same time the sauce is being made, otherwise you will need to add more time to the preparation time if done prior.)
