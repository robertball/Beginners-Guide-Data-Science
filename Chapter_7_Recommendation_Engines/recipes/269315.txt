Ingredients:
6 cups water
1 pound pork spareribs
1 medium onion, halved and thinly sliced, divided
6 cloves garlic, sliced, divided
1 (32 ounce) container chicken broth
2 bunches mustard greens, stemmed and chopped
1 lime, juiced
3 jalapeno peppers, sliced
2 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce
1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
salt to taste

Directions:
Combine water, spareribs, 1/2 of the onion, and 3 cloves garlic in a pot over high heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until meat easily falls off the bones, about 2 hours.
Remove bones from spareribs and return meat to the broth. Add chicken broth and bring to a boil. Stir in mustard greens, lime juice, jalapenos, fish sauce, and remaining onion and garlic. Boil for 5 minutes. Stir in cilantro and season with salt.
