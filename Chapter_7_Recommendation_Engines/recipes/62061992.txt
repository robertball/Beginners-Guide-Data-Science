Ingredients:
1/4 c. balsamic vinegar
1/4 c. honey
1/4 c. olive oil
2 Tbsp. chopped rosemary
1 tsp. salt
3 lb. chicken breasts, thighs and legs

Directions:
Combine all ingredients (except chicken) in a large heavy-duty Ziplock bag.  Add chicken and seal the bag, coating each piece well.  Let chill for 2 hours (or longer) in the marinade, turning occasionally.  Remove chicken and place in a lightly greased 13 x 9 inch baking pan.  Pour marinade over top and bake at 375 for about 45 minutes, pasting often with pan drippings.

Description: 
This is a family favorite of ours!  A sweet and tender dinner that is quick and simple.  I usually marinate the chicken the night before and then just pop it in the oven for a fast and tasty dinner.
