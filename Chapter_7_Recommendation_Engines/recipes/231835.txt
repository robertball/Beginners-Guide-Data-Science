Ingredients:
2 cups chopped mushrooms
7 eggs
1/2 cup half-and-half
1 1/2 cups chopped broccoli
2/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 large green onions, chopped
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 1/4 cups quinoa flour
1/3 cup butter at room temperature
2 tablespoons water, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch pie dish with butter.
Cook and stir mushrooms in a dry skillet over medium heat until soft and mushrooms have released their liquid, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk eggs and half-and-half together in a bowl and stir in broccoli, Cheddar cheese, green onions, garlic salt, and cooked mushrooms. Refrigerate filling.
Mix quinoa flour and butter in a bowl until mixture forms small clumps; stir water into quinoa mixture until dough comes together. If dough is too dry, add more water, 1/2 teaspoon at a time, until dough holds together. Press dough into prepared pie dish to form a crust; pour filling into crust.
Bake quiche in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.

Description: 
I began cooking with quinoa recently for a friend who was gluten-intolerant and have made quiches by my own recipes and experiments. I've made quiche and dumplings so far, and am looking to see what more it can do! 

The quinoa crust is surprisingly dense, so a thinner crust does not mean a weak quiche! I prefer to use quinoa flour to quinoa flakes for this crust for consistency of crust depth and increased flakiness.
