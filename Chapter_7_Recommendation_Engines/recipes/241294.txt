Description: 
This is a terrific recipe for the bread machine. Easy to make, and taste so good!! Has a wonderful crispy crust, and so tasty on the inside! The house smells wonderful! It's terrific right out of the bread machine warm, but it taste just as good when it's cool! Makes wonderful grilled cheese and lunch box sandwiches! I've made this bread on a Monday, and I then store it in a plastic bag. We use it for sandwiches, toast, etc. It stays fresh for days. Of course, it's usually gone in a day or two at our house.
