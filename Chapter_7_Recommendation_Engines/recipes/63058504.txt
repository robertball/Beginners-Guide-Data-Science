Ingredients:
2 tablespoons lard (or bacon grease or oil etc.)
1 small onion (chopped, optional)
1 clove garlic (chopped, optional)
1 (19 ounce) can pinto beans (drained and rinsed, or black beans, etc.)
1 tablespoon chili powder (optional)
1 teaspoon cumin (toasted and ground, optional)
* water (optional)

Directions:
Heat the lard in a pan.
Add the onion and saute until tender, about 3-5 minutes.
Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Add the beans, chili powder and cumin and cook until warm.
Mash the beans until you get them to the consistency that you want. (If the beans are too thick you can add water to thin them out.)

Description: 
Refried beans are normally made with pinto beans but you can use any kind of beans that you want. I often enjoy using black beans instead of pinto beans. Simmering the dried beans to reconstitute them takes a while so I usually use caned beans, which I always have on hand, and that saves a lot of time.
