Method
1 Heat 1 Tbsp of olive oil on medium high heat in a thick-bottomed sauté pan. Add the sliced onions, stir to coat with the olive oil, and cook until golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.
2 Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C). In a large bowl put the sliced potatoes and gently toss with 1 Tbsp of olive oil, 1/2 cup grated Gruyere cheese, 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan, salt, and white pepper. (If you are making ahead, make sure that the potatoes are well coated with the olive oil, even if you have to add more olive oil.)

3 Butter a large gratin dish or 9x13 casserole lightly and line with the caramelized onions in an even layer at the bottom of the dish. Arrange the sliced potatoes (including the grated cheeses) in a pattern over the onions.
