Ingredients:
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar, or to taste
1 cup ketchup
1 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup prepared yellow mustard
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce (optional)
1 teaspoon chili powder (optional)
1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (optional)
6 (3/4 inch thick) pork chops

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Place the brown sugar, ketchup, mayonnaise, yellow mustard, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, and cayenne pepper into a bowl, and stir until blended.
Place the pork chops on the preheated grill, and cook the chops until the surface is seared but the meat is just barely pink in the middle, about 5 minutes. Brush the chops with the glaze mixture, and flip to cook the glaze onto the meat. When the glazed side shows good grill marks, flip again, brush glaze onto the pork chops, flip, and grill until the other side shows nice brown grill marks. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

We've had this recipe around for some time, but just recently updated it with some new ingredients. This is also good on pork steaks and chicken.
