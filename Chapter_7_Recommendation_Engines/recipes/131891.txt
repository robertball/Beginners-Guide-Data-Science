Ingredients:
1/2 pound bulk mild Italian sausage
1 pound cubed lean venison
2 pounds ground venison
2 tablespoons olive oil
8 ounces sliced crimini mushrooms
1 large onion, diced
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 green pepper, diced
1 red peppers, diced
2 red chile peppers, seeded and chopped
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 (28 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 (15.5 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
2 (28 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, with liquid
1 cup water, or as needed
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
2 tablespoons paprika
1 dash cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons dried oregano
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Cook sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crumbled and browned; place into a large Dutch oven. Sear venison cubes until well browned; add to sausage. Add ground venison, and cook until crumbly and no longer pink; place into Dutch oven.
Heat olive oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the mushrooms, and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Stir in onion and garlic, cook until the onion is translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the green and red peppers, red chile pepper, and jalapeno; cook until softened, then add to Dutch oven.
Stir in tomato paste, tomato sauce, black beans, diced tomatoes, and water. Season with chili powder, paprika, cayenne, and oregano. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the venison pieces are tender, about 2 hours.
Season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir in parsley before serving. To serve, sprinkle with shredded Cheddar cheese.

Description: 
This is our home made deer chili recipe. We eat venison whenever possible as it is healthier than beef. This is a great chili to serve at parties and to get friends that think they don't like venison to try it out. They will be greatly surprised! Enjoy!
