Ingredients:
5 envelopes(1 quart each) powdered dry milk
1 1/2 cups margarine (3 sticks)
1 14oz bag of coconut
1/2 cup milk
1 16 oz. pkg powdered sugar
1 tsp. almond extract
*optional hazelnuts

Directions:
In a coffee grinder or food processor chop coconut until a minced texture. Your trying to get rid of the stringy texture that it comes in from the bag. Also this looks prettier.
Set aside 1/2 cup coconut for rolling candy balls and the rest to mix into the candy balls.
In a large bowl combine dried milk, almond extract, powdered sugar, margarine and milk until smooth. I prefer using margarine instead of butter only because I am going for the milky taste instead of the butter taste. Also I think the margarine is less sticky when you are rolling the candy balls. You may want to food process this also, but by hand works fine.
Work by hand the rest of the coconut into the milk and margarine mixture.
Refrigerate for 20 min.
Roll walnut size balls and then roll them into the remaining coconut. You can put a hazelnut into the center of each ball if you like.
Keep refrigerated until you eat them. They also keep well in the freezer in zipper bags.
