Ingredients:
2 cups fresh blackberries
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Combine blackberries, sugar, lemon juice, and salt in a saucepan. Toss to coat and let sit for 5 minutes.
Bring berry mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool slightly and serve warm, or refrigerate for later use. Mixture will thicken further as it cools.

Description: 
This simple blackberry compote has the consistency of a chunky fruit syrup and is perfect on a variety of foods, such as ice cream, crepes, yogurt, oatmeal, and ricotta toast. It's a great way to use up fresh berries. Feel free to mash the berries with a fork or potato masher for a smoother consistency. The longer you simmer the compote, the more concentrated the flavors become.
