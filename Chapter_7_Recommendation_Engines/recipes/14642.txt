Ingredients:
3 1/2 pounds boneless chuck roast
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
1 1/2 cups pizza sauce
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
4 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
3 tablespoons cornstarch
3 tablespoons water
1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles

Directions:
Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, and brown meat on all sides in hot oil.
In large bowl combine tomatoes, pizza sauce, cheese, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt, oregano, and pepper.  Pour over meat.  Cover and simmer over medium heat for 2 hours, turning meat each half hour.
Remove meat from pan, and cool slightly.  Skim fat from pan juices. Measure juices, and add enough water to make 6 cups liquid.  Return liquid to Dutch oven.  Blend cornstarch and 3 tablespoons cold water; stir into pan juices.  Cook and stir till thickened and bubbly.
Slice meat thinly against the grain. Return meat to pot, and add mushrooms. Simmer for 30 minutes longer.
Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling water until done.  Drain.  To serve, place meat slices over hot noodles, and pour some sauce over. Pass remaining sauce.
