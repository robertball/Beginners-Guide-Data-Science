Ingredients:
1/2 celeriac (about 400g)
3 cups water
1 tbsp lime juice
1 tbsp olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
For the Mayo sauce:
1/3 cup vegan mayo
1 tbsp brown mustard
1 tsp horseradish powder

Directions:
Peel the celeriac. Cut it into 1/2 inch sticks. Put the celeriac in a bowl. Pour in the 3 cups of water and 1 tbsp lime juice. Mix and let sit for 20 minutes.
Preheat the air fryer to 200Â°.
Make the mayo sauce. Mix together the vegan mayo, mustard, and horseradish powder. Keep covered in the refrigerator until needed.
Drain the celeriac sticks and dry them. Put them back into a bowl. Drizzle the oil over the fries and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat evenly.
Add them to the air fryer basket. Cook for 10 minutes. Shake the air fryer basket. Check for doneness after five minutes. Remove from the air fryer when crisped and browned. They should be ready in a total of 18 minutes.
Serve immediately with vegan mayo on the side.
