Ingredients:
1 pound spelt or brown rice pasta
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 cup onions, diced
4 slices turkey bacon
3 cups sliced Swiss chard
3 cups sliced red kale
2 large eggs
2 large egg yolks
1/4 cup soy or almond milk
1/2 cup ricotta cheese
sea salt, to taste

Directions:
1. Cook pasta according to package instructions.  If using brown rice pasta, cook 4 minutes short of package cooking time. Drain, reserve 1/2 cup pasta water, and set aside.
2. Heat olive oil in a large, high-sided skillet over medium heat.  Saute onions for 4 to 5 minutes. Add turkey bacon and saute until browned. Remove turkey bacon, and set aside. In the same pan add Swiss chard and kale, and saute until tender, about 3 to 4 minutes. Crumble bacon, return to skillet, and reduce heat to low.
3. In a bowl, whisk together eggs, yolks, milk, ricotta cheese, and salt.  Slowly pour reserved pasta cooking water into the egg mixture to temper the eggs.  Remove the skillet from the heat, and toss in freshly cooked pasta as you pour over egg mixture.  The heat from the pasta will gently cook the eggs and create a sauce.
4. Serve immediately.
