Ingredients:
1/2 cup fresh mint leaves
1/2 cup fresh coriander leaves
1 green birds eye chili (optional)
2 tbsp water, divided
2 cups dahi (Indian yogurt)
10 ounces hothouse tomatoes
1 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground coriander

Directions:
Add the mint leaves, coriander leaves, and green chili to a mini food processor. Pulse until blended, adding a bit of water to create a paste. Pour into a bowl and add the dahi mixing until fully incorporated.
Cut the tomatoes in half, remove the seeds. Dice the tomatoes and add to the dahi. Add the ground cumin and ground coriander. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate for at least one hour before serving.
Cook's Note: If you canâ€™t find true dahi, strain full-fat, natural yogurt (the kind without pectin or thickeners) and add 1/2 tsp lemon juice.
