Ingredients:
1 ½ pounds lean ground beef
salt and pepper to taste

1 pound baby carrots, chopped
3 medium (2-1/4" to 3" dia, raw)s potatoes, diced

Description: 
Tomato stew with hamburger, carrots, potatoes, and green beans.  Try adding a variety of veggies, fresh or frozen.  I find it easy to keep pre-cooked ground beef in the freezer.  It will thaw in the soup base while you dice the carrots and potatoes.
