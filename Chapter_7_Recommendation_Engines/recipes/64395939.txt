Fluffy Vegan Pancakes Recipe

Ingredients:
1 tablespoon ground flax seed
2.5 T water
1 cup + 1 tablespoon non-dairy milk
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1 cup flour (all-purpose or whole wheat)
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon coconut oil

Directions:
Whisk flax and water together in a bowl and set aside to thicken.
Put the milk and vinegar in a bowl set aside to thicken.
In a medium mixing bowl, add the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt) and stir together.
Then add one tablespoon melted coconut oil and the flax egg to the milk. Mix the wet ingredients.
Now, carefully mix the two together without stressing the batter. To do this, form a “crater” in the middle of the dry ingredients, then pour the wet ingredients into the crater. Slowly stir until most of the batter is incorporated. A few small lumps are your friend, too much mixing is not.
Heat pan over medium high 3 min. Test a small pancake. If it sizzles when it hits the pan and forms bubbles in 1 or 2 minutes, it is right.
Use a 1/4 cup measurement to create the perfect 4-inch pancakes. If your pan is large enough, you can cook 2-3 at a time. Again, wait 2 minutes for large bubbles to form on the surface, then flip and cook for another 90 seconds. Store the first batches in a warm oven while you finish the rest.
