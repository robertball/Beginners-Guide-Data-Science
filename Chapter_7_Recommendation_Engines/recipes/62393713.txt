Description: 
When you're in the mood for some good finger food, turn to this recipe. Fans of mustard, dill and vinegar flavors, my family says these eggs are the best. I like them because they are easy to fill and make a popular contribution to a potluck or brunch.Modified from: Savory Deviled Eggs
