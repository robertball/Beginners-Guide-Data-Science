Ingredients:
1 tortilla
3 chicken tenders
2-3 tbsp Bleu cheese dressing
Bleu cheese crumbles to taste/consistency
1/4 c Pre-prepared Buffalo sauce (or hot sauce and butter to taste.  More butter = milder)
Chopped lettuce
Diced onion to taste
**Optional ** diced celery

Directions:
Cook frozen chicken tenders as directed on packaging.  While chicken cooks, heat up buffalo sauce in small sauce pan.  Enough to liberally coat chicken and to have it appear to be too much initially.   In a small bowl pour in the dressing and add bleu cheese crumbles and stir until evenly combined.  Then shred some lettuce, about 2 leaves was enough for me.  Cut some onion and celery to taste and set those aside.   Then dice cooked chicken tenders and put into buffalo sauce and stir until evenly coated.  Allow to simmer until it absorbs all or most of the sauce.  Heat tortilla until is soft and pliable either in pan or in oven briefly, remove and then build your wrap.
Chicken, veggies, dressing complete!

Description: 
Was hungry, it was getting late and I threw these together with staple pantry items I had laying around and was surprised how good they came out with such little effort or planning.  The only thing easier would be if someone else had made them for me.  So I had to share.   Enjoy!!
