Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter
2 3/4 cup all-purpose baking mix
1 cup mashed sweet potato
1/2 milk

Directions:
Cut butter into baking mix with a pastry blender or 2 forks until mixture is crumbly.  Whisk together sweet potato and milk, add to butter mixture, sitrring with a fork just until dry ingredients are moistened.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, knead gently 4 or 5 times. Dough will be moist. Pat or roll dough to 1/2 inch thickness; cut with a 2-inch round cutter. Place biscuits on lightly greased baking sheets.
Bake at 450 degrees for 10 minutes or until golden brown.
