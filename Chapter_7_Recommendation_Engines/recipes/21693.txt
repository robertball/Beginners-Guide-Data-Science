Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups white sugar
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 eggs
1 3/4 cups Gold Medal® all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
2/3 cup milk
1/2 cup chopped dry-roasted pistachios
1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1/3 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
3 tablespoons milk
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon corn syrup
1 teaspoon hot water

Directions:
Heat oven to 325 degrees F.  Grease and flour loaf pan, 9x5x3 inches.  Beat granulated sugar, 3/4 cup butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla and the eggs in large bowl with electric mixer on low speed 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly.  Beat on high speed 5 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally.  Beat in flour and baking powder alternately with 2/3 cup milk on low speed.  Fold 1/3 cup of the nuts into batter.  Spread in pan.
Bake 1 hour 5 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool 20 minutes; remove from pan to wire rack.  Cool completely.  Cut cake horizontally to make 3 layers.  (Mark sides of cake with toothpicks, and cut with long, thin serrated knife.)
Mix ricotta cheese, powdered sugar, 1/3 cup chocolate chips, 3 tablespoons milk and 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla.  Spread ricotta mixture over bottom and middle cake layers; stack layers.  Add top cake layer.
Heat 1/4 cup chocolate chips, 1 tablespoon butter and the corn syrup in 1-quart saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until chocolate is melted; cool slightly.  Stir in water.  Spread chocolate mixture over top of torte.  Sprinkle with remaining nuts.  Let stand until chocolate mixture is firm.  Cover tightly and refrigerate at least 2 hours but no longer than 48 hours.
