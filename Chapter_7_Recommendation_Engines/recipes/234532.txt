Description: 
I was watching King of the Hill, Peggy mentions making Frito® pie. My husband looks at me and says see if you can find something like that on the internet. Looking at other people's recipes on other sites, I decided to make my own version of Frito Pie. While Hank Hill prefers Wolf Brand Chili, I made my own. :) Hope you enjoy!
