Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons canola oil
1 cup long-grain rice
1/4 onion, diced
1 1/2 teaspoons chicken soup base (such as Better than Bouillon速)
2 cups chicken stock
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Add oil to a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select the Saute function. Add rice and saute, stirring frequently until the rice is golden, about 3 minutes. Mix in onion and saute until soft and translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in chicken base. Add chicken stock, tomato sauce, and cumin. Stir to combine.
Close and lock the lid. Select Rice function on high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Carefully release remaining pressure using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Stir and serve.
