1/2 cup white sugar
36 leaves fresh mint, or to taste
3 limes, quartered
1 cup rum (such as BacardiÂ®)

Description: 
I have served this to people who have sworn that they dislike mojitos and they love it. I believe it is the fresh ingredients and the use of sugar, instead of simple syrup, muddled together that makes this cocktail refreshing and delicious. It takes a little bit of work but the results are well worth it. Serve over ice.
