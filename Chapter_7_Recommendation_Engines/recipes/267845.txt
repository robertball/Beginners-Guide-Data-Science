Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
6 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups firmly packed brown sugar
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans

Directions:
Combine 1 cup butter and cream cheese in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until creamy. Add flour gradually, beating at low speed. Shape mixture into 48 balls and place on a baking sheet. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the cups of a mini-muffin pan. Press 1 chilled dough ball into each cup and shape into a tart shell.
Whisk brown sugar, eggs, 2 tablespoons butter, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl. Stir in 1 1/4 cups pecans. Spoon mixture into tart shells. Top with the remaining pecans.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookie shell are delicately brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
Cool in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Gently remove from pans and cool completely on wire racks, about 20 minutes.
