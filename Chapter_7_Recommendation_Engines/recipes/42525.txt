2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons dried marjoram
2 teaspoons rubbed sage
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine the first seven ingredients; rub over roast. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.
Place roast on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees for 2-1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees (63 degrees C). Let stand for 15 minutes before slicing. Refrigerate or freeze remaining pork (may be frozen for up to 3 months).
