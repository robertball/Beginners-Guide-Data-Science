Description: 
This pudding is done in a slow cooker, and tastes wonderful after a cold day in the snow, or a long walk on a cold night. Excellent for Christmas Eve. It is very inexpensive to make, and it freezes well if you want to make a double batch. It is best served warm with a pinch of nutmeg or ground cloves. Add baked apples for an extra special treat.
