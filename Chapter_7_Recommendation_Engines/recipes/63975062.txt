Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
1 medium onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
8 ounces wide egg noodles
4 ounces fresh baby spinach

Directions:
In a medium skillet, melt butter over medium high heat.  Add diced onions and sauté until lightly browned and soft.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil.  Add egg noodles and cook until done, about 8 minutes.
Add garlic to onions in skillet and sauté for just a minute, until fragrant.
Drain noodles and add back to the pot in which they were boiled.
Add fresh baby spinach to onions and sauté very briefly until just barely wilted.  Add the mixture to the cooked noodles and toss to combine.
Add salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
A wonderful side dish to ramp up plain buttered egg noodles.  We love it with Salisbury Steak, chicken or pork.
