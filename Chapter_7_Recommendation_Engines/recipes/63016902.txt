Ingredients:
10 medium sized jalapenos
1- 8 oz package cream cheese (softened)
shredded cheese
1- package bacon
your favorite jelly (optional)
toothpicks

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Cut jalapenos in halves, lengthwise, and remove insides.
Place cream cheese to a bowl and add enough shredded cheese to mix evenly with cream cheese.
Cut bacon into thirds
With a spoon, apply a thin coat of jelly (I like to use raspberry) to the bottom of the jalapeno. Next add a teaspoon full of cheese mixture. Wrap with a piece of bacon and secure with toothpick.
Place on baking sheet and bake for about 15 minutes or until bacon is cooked.
