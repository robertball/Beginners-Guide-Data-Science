Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
1 Box of your favorite brownie mix
2 Tbsp Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
1 Tbsp Brown Sugar
1 Tbsp Confectioner's Sugar
1/2 Tbsp Ground Cinnamon
1/2 Tsp Ground Cloves
1/2 Tsp Ground Allspice
1/2 Tsp Ground Nutmeg
1/2 Tsp Ground Dried Ginger
1/2 Bag Chocolate Chip (optional)
Wet Ingredients:
1/3 Cup Melted Unsalted Butter
2 Tbsp Vanilla Extract
2 Tbsp Strong Brewed Coffee
2 Tbsp Sour Cream
1 Egg

Directions:
Preheat to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine your dry ingredients. Melt butter in a microwave and add the brewed coffee, allow to for 5 minutes. After your butter/coffee mixture cools, add the vanilla and sour cream and mix thoroughly. Add to the dry ingredients along with the egg. With a wooden spoon, stir 25 times, then add the chocolate chips, stir an additional 25 times, or until mixed thoroughly (mixture will be on the thick side). Pour into a greased pan and smooth out with a spatula. Place into the preheated oven. Depending on how fudgy you like your brownies, bake until either a toothpick inserted into the center comes out a little dirty with a few crumbs attached for really fudgy to clean if you like them cake-like (about 20-30 minutes, depending on what tray size you are using). Allow to cool thoroughly before cutting.
