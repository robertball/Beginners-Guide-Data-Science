Ingredients:
1/2 cup bulgur (any grind)
Salt
1 cup ricotta cheese
1 cup sour cream or yogurt
3 eggs
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1 cup whole-wheat flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1-1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup raisins, optional
Vegetable oil, for frying
Honey or maple syrup, for serving

Directions:
Heat the oven to 200 degrees. Put the bulgur and a pinch of salt in a bowl and add 1-1/4 cups boiling water. Stir once and let sit until more or less tender, 10 to 25 minutes. If any water remains, squeeze the bulgur in a cloth or put it in a fine-mesh strainer and press down on it.
Beat together the ricotta, sour cream or yogurt, eggs and orange zest. In another bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir the dry ingredients into the ricotta mixture, blending well but not beating. Gently fold in the bulgur and, if being used, the raisins.
Put a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. When a few drops of water dance on its surface, add a thin film of vegetable oil and let it become hot. Spoon out the batter, making any size pancakes you like. Cook until bubbles form on the top and pop, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully flip the pancakes and cook until theyâ€™re browned on the other side, a couple of minutes more. You may have to rotate the cakes to cook them evenly, depending on the heat source and pan. As they finish, transfer them to a plate in the oven while you cook the remaining batter. Serve with honey or maple syrup
