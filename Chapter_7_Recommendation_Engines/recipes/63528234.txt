Ingredients:
9 oz. dry scallops
Florida seasoning (coarsely ground pepper w/ lemon & lime peel)
Balti seasoning (curry-like flavoring)
2 t. olive oil
2 T. coconut curry sauce
Lemon zest strips
Cilantro

Directions:
Rinse, then pat the scallops dry. Season lightly with Florida and Balti seasoning. Place olive oil in a non-stick skillet, heat over medium-high heat until sizzling then add the scallops. Sear until nicely browned on one side, flip and cook on the other side. Touch them to gauge their level of doneness; they need to have a little give but not too much, take care not to overcook to where theyâ€™re hard to the touch. Remove to a plate, cover.
Place coconut curry sauce in a very small bowl; heat in the microwave for a 10-15 seconds just to warm. Spoon out onto a plate and top with the scallops. Sprinkle with lemon zest and cilantro.
