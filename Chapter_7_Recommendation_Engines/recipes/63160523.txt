Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, washed, cored, and cut into bite-sized pieces
Several tablespoons Wegman's Basting Oil
1-2 tsp balsamic vinegar
1/4 - 1/2 cup shredded parmesan

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450F.
Prepare cauliflower.
In large bowl, coat cauliflower pieces with basting oil enough to coat but not so much that oil pools in the bottom of the bowl.
Spread cauliflower in single layer on cookie sheet. Lining with parchment or foil may make removal easier.
Roast at 450F for 15 mins or until just carmelized on bottom. For more browned surfaces, turn during roasting.
Transfer to serving bowl. Sprinkle with balsamic vinegar and parmesan. Toss. Serve.
