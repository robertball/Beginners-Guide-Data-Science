Ingredients:
2 kohlrabi, peeled and thinly sliced
1 pinch salt
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream, or more to taste

Directions:
Combine kohlrabi, salt, and sugar in a pot. Set aside until kohlrabi releases liquid, about 5 minutes.
Cover pot and bring to a boil over medium heat. Shake pot from time to time, so nothing sticks to the bottom. Cook for about 4 minutes. Stir in cream and simmer another 30 seconds without allowing cream to boil.
