Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 teaspoons jerk paste
1 (12 ounce) package uncooked egg noodles
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup chicken stock
1 tablespoon jerk paste
½ cup dry white wine
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
2  limes, quartered
salt and pepper to taste
½ cup heavy whipping cream
4 sprigs fresh cilantro, for garnish

Directions:
Rub each breast half with 1/2 teaspoon jerk paste, and place in a shallow dish. Cover, and refrigerate at least 1 hour.
Preheat the grill for high heat. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil, cook the egg noodles 6 to 8 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken 8 to 10 minutes on each side, until juices run clear.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, and cook the garlic for one minute. Mix in the chicken stock, 1 tablespoon jerk paste, white wine, chopped cilantro, juice of 1 lime, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and stir in the heavy cream. Cook and stir until mixture is thickened, about 5 minutes. Do not allow it to boil.
Pour the cooked egg noodles into the saucepan, and toss with the cream sauce. Divide noodles onto 4 serving plates, and top with grilled chicken. Garnish each serving with a cilantro sprig and the juice of 1/4 lime.
