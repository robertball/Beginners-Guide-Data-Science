Ingredients:
1, 9-inch, pie crust (I make mine with Â¼ of the flour whole wheat and use coconut oil for the fat- really lends itself well to this recipe)
1 C smoked or cooked ham, diced
1 C grated Mozzarella or Jack cheese
1 Tbsp chopped fresh basil OR 1 tsp dried
1 Tbsp prepared mustard (I like to use Dijon or spicy brown)
3 large eggs
3/4 C whipping cream or half and half
Dash black pepper
1 Tbsp Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Oven 400F.  Pre-bake the crust for 5 minutes.  Remove from oven and lower oven temp to 350F.
While crust is in the oven, mix the ham, cheese and basil together.  When the crust is done, spread the mustard all over the bottom of it.  Top mustard evenly with ham and cheese mixture.
Beat the eggs, cream, and pepper (I use the same bowl I mixed the ham and cheese in).  Pour over the ham and cheese in the pie crust.  Sprinkle with Parmesan
Bake in 350F oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a knife inserted halfway between the center and outer edge comes out clean.
Let it set for a few minutes before cutting into serving pieces.
