Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 cup uncooked short-grain white rice
1 3/4 cups chicken broth
1/4 cup tomato sauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is translucent. Stir in the chili powder and cumin, and cook for about 30 seconds. Add the rice, chicken broth and tomato sauce, and bring to a boil. Transfer to a 1 quart casserole dish, and cover with aluminum foil or a lid.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until liquid has been absorbed and rice is tender. Let rest for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
A very simple tomato Mexican rice recipe.  I can have this in the oven and cooking in one set of ads on the TV. If you don't have chicken stock, use hot water and chicken bouillon.Modified from: Simple Mexican Rice
