Ingredients:
3/4 cup flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon italian seasoning (Optional)
Pinch of red pepper flakes (Optional)
1/4 C Grated parmesan (Optional)
3/4 cup whole milk
1 egg, lightly beaten
4 ounces mozzarella or cheddar cheese, shredded (about 1 cup)
4 ounces pepperoni, cut into small cubes (about 1 cup)
1/2 cup store-bought pizza, marinara or spaghetti sauce
1 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil

Directions:
1) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Grease a 24-cup mini-muffin pan. Degrease the pepperoni in the microwave. In a large bowl, whisk together the first four ingredients; whisk in the milk and egg. Stir in the cheese and pepperoni; let stand for 10 minutes.
2) Stir the batter and divide among the mini-muffin cups. Bake until puffed and golden, 20 to 25 minutes.
3) Meanwhile, microwave the sauce until warmed through, then stir in 1 tablespoon basil. Serve the puffs with the sauce for dipping.
