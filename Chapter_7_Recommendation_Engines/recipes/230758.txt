Ingredients:
1 large sweet potato
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup shaved Parmesan cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Peel sweet potato with a vegetable peeler and discard skin. Continue using peeler to create thin strips of sweet potato; transfer to a large bowl. Drizzle strips with olive oil; toss to coat. Mix Parmesan cheese, kosher salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder into sweet potato strips; toss to coat evenly. Spread coated sweet potato strips evenly onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until sweet potato chips are crispy, 20 to 25 minutes.
