Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1/2 inch pieces
2 carrots, julienned
2 cloves garlic, pressed
1 teaspoon ground ginger
4 shallots, chopped
1 bell pepper, slivered
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks in natural juice, liquid drained and reserved
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat; cook the chicken and carrots in the hot oil until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the carrots are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and ginger; cook another 1 minute. Add the shallots and bell pepper; cook another 1 minute.
Whisk together 3 tablespoons of the reserved liquid from the canned pineapple chunks along with the pineapple chunks, the water, soy sauce, cornstarch, vinegar, and pepper flakes; stir into the chicken and vegetable mixture and bring to a boil, stirring until the sauce thickens.
