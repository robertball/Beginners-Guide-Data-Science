Ingredients:
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon fennel seed, crushed
1 tablespoon dried rosemary, crushed
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 (3 pound) boneless pork loin roast

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the first six ingredients; rub over pork roast. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Place roast on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), basting occasionally with pan juices. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
A handful of ingredients are all you need for this memorable entree. Treated to an herbed rub the night before, the pork needs little prep work before your dinner party. 'I've had so many compliments on how moist this roast is,' says Diane Toomey of Methuen, Massachusetts.
