Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/2 cup Kikkoman teriyaki baste & glaze sauce
1/2 cup Ranch-style salad dressing
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
3 green onions, chopped
1/2 cup bacon bits
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts, and saute 4 to 5 minutes each side, until lightly browned.
Place browned chicken breasts in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Brush with teriyaki glaze, then spoon on salad dressing. Sprinkle with cheese, green onions and bacon bits.
Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. Garnish with parsley and serve.
Can also be cooked in a slow cooker, without cooking the chicken first, on low for 8 hrs.
