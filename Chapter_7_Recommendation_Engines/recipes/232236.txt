Ingredients:
Dressing:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup sour cream
1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons milk
1/2 teaspoon honey mustard
1/2 teaspoon white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Salad:
2 1/2 cups penne pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
3/4 teaspoon minced fresh basil
2 1/2 cups cauliflower florets
2 cups halved cherry tomatoes
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
4 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into 1-inch strips
3 green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Whisk mayonnaise, sour cream, blue cheese, milk, honey mustard, vinegar, salt, garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain and transfer to a bowl.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic and basil until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour garlic mixture over penne. Mix cauliflower, tomatoes, red bell pepper, mozzarella cheese, green onion, and Parmesan cheese into penne mixture; toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate to blend flavors, about 1 hour.
