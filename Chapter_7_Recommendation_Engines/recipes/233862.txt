Ingredients:
20 ounces refrigerated cheese tortellini
2 cups halved cherry tomatoes
1 1/2 cups bite-sized broccoli florets
1 cup diced yellow bell pepper
3/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
6 ounces pepperoni sausage, cubed (optional)
1 cup Italian-style salad dressing (such as Newman's Own®)
1/4 cup Italian-style salad dressing (such as Newman's Own®) (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook tortellini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite and filling is warmed through, 5 to 7 minutes; drain.
Stir cooked tortellini, tomatoes, broccoli, yellow bell pepper, Parmesan cheese, and pepperoni together in a bowl. Pour in 1 cup Italian dressing and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. If salad looks dry, stir in an additional 1/4 cup Italian dressing before serving.

Description: 
This is a quick pasta salad that is kicked up a notch by using tortellini instead of regular pasta. It is great for a cook-out or potluck because it doesn't include mayonnaise.
