Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup chopped onion
3/4 cup matchstick-sized carrots
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon hot Madras curry powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup white cooking wine
2 cups peeled and seeded tomatoes
1 cup diced Golden Delicious apple
1 pound monkfish fillets, cut into cubes

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, ginger, cumin, curry powder, cinnamon, basil, salt and black pepper. Stir in cooking wine. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
Stir tomatoes and apple into the pot. Increase heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer, stirring frequently, until tomatoes soften and break down, about 30 minutes. Lower monkfish gently into the pot; spoon sauce over fish. Cook and stir over low heat until monkfish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes.
