Ingredients:
2 lbs ground beef
1 lb Italian sausage
6 eggs
1 cup bread crumbs
1/3 cup parmesan cheese
3 t onion powder
3 t basil
1 t garlic powder
8 cups chicken broth
6 cups chicken stock
4 cups beef broth
2 cups escarole (thinly sliced)
1 1/2 cups carrots, sliced or diced
1 cup celery, chopped
1 cup onion, diced
1 lb Acini de Pepe noodles (1 small box)

Directions:
1.  Begin heating the liquids in a large stock pot on medium to lessen the time needed to heat them to boiling later in step 5.
2.	In a large bowl, combine the meat so it is evenly mixed.  Then add the eggs, bread crumbs, cheese, onion powder, basil, and garlic powder.
3.	Shape into bite size balls and bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees. (This made about 4 cookie sheets full, and I used a baking mat so they wouldn't stick. If you donâ€™t have a mat, you probably need to spray the sheet or use parchment paper.)
4.	Set the cooked meatballs aside.
5.	In a large pot, heat the chicken broth, chicken stock, bullion cubes, and water to boiling.  Stir in the escarole, carrots, celery, onion, acini de pepe, and meatballs.  Return to boiling and then reduce heat to medium.
6.	Cook at a slow boil for 10 minutes, or until pasta is al dente.  Stir frequently to prevent sticking.
