Description: 
Mom and I formulated this recipe back in the '50s after visiting a friend's farm where they made the most delicious sour cream ever. Our first try was perfect, and these apple squares soon became a favorite to serve at social functions. Years ago, we made six pans of these squares when a young Johnny Carson presented his magic show at our card club!
