Ingredients:
1 pound country style pork ribs
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup dry white wine (optional)
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon caraway seed
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 pound sauerkraut, drained
1 medium red apple - cored and diced
1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season ribs with salt and pepper. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Cook ribs, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides. Add wine (if using), water, caraway seeds, and brown sugar; stir to dissolve sugar. Stir in drained sauerkraut, apple, and carrots, and transfer to a large casserole dish.
Bake, covered, in the preheated oven for 2 1/2 hours, adding water as needed to prevent drying out.

Description: 
This is a very mild sauerkraut recipe. It actually doesn't taste much like sauerkraut or I wouldn't like it. It took me 2 years to finally decide to give it a try and boy was it worth it! It is low calorie with vegetables and apple - an interesting blend of flavors. Serve with baked or  mashed potatoes.
