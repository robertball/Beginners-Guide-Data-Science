Ingredients:
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon grated Pecorino Romano cheese
1 clove garlic, minced
4 slices white bread
4 slices provolone cheese
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat.
Combine butter, parsley, Pecorino Romano cheese, and garlic in a small bowl. Stir to combine.
Lightly coat 1 side of each bread slice with the butter mixture. Flip bread and top 2 slices evenly with provolone cheese and mozzarella cheese. Cover with remaining bread slices, buttered-sides up.
Place sandwiches into the hot skillet. Cook until golden brown on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the second side and cheese has melted, 3 to 4 minutes more. Cut each sandwich in half and serve.
