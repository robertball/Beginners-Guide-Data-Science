Description: 
With simple stuff...comes a moist, down-home and wholesome meal, snack, or a fun side dish. I serve this up next to pulled pork sandwiches or as the main event alongside mac and cheese. Can't think of anything more Americana than beans and weenies...unless it's a chili corn dog! Top with shredded Cheddar cheese, it'll make you want to slap your mama.
