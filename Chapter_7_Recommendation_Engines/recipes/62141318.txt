Description: 
Just in time for Thanksgiving, our family has this every year. We first tasted it when I was a kid (about 20 years ago, maybe more) on the only restaurant on Tangier Island, VA, and it's been a family staple ever since. Thought I'd share. For those desperate for something different today, and chances are you have the ingredients in the back of the cabinet.
