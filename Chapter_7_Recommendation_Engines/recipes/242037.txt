Description: 
When challenged to develop a recipe using Spam® as a main ingredient for a campout, this is what I came up with. Tasty bite-size pillows filled with Spam® and pineapple are served with sweet chili sauce for dipping. These are super easy to prepare, but do take a bit of time to fill and shape the pillows.
