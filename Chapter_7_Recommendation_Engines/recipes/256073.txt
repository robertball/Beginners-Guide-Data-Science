Ingredients:
12 ounces persimmon flesh, cut into small chunks
5 ounces white sugar
3 ounces persimmon skin, finely sliced
2 tablespoons lemon juice
3/4 ounce lemon zest, finely sliced

Directions:
Combine persimmon flesh, sugar, persimmon skin, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a small pot over medium heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until persimmon flesh softens and jam thickens, about 10 minutes.
Cool jam until set, about 30 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator.

Description: 
I first fell in love with persimmons when I visited Korea. When the fresh fruit isn't available, I use frozen persimmons. It's a nice break from the other jams. Enjoy with crusty bread!
