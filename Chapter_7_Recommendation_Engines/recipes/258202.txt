Ingredients:
1 cup plain non-fat Greek yogurt
1/4 cup no-sugar-added creamy peanut butter
1 banana
2 tablespoons ground flax seeds
8 mini dogbone treats

Directions:
Blend yogurt, peanut butter, banana, and flaxseed meal in a food processor or blender until smooth. Pour into 8 lined cups of a muffin tin (silicone cupcake liners work well for these), filling cups halfway. Top each with a dogbone treat.
Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until solid, at least 2 hours. Pop treats out of tin, remove liners, and freeze in a zip-top plastic freezer bag up to 2 weeks.

Description: 
OK, I know these probably sound like a very 2007, Southern California thing, but dogs don't care what's cool and what's not. They just want to eat everything they see. My dogs love these.
