Description: 
If you're looking for a twist on regular boring pasta night, look no further! I made this pasta one day by opening the fridge and tossing everything together. No word of a lie, this pasta will make your friends' and family's eyes roll to the back of their heads (in a good way)! Sprinkle with more cheese before serving, if you like.
