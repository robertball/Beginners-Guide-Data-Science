Ingredients:
3 Tbsp all-purpose flour
8 boneless skinless chicken thighs
2 Tbsp olive oil
6 medium new potatoes, cut into quarters
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cups fresh baby carrots, halved lengthwise
1 can (4 ounces) mushroom stems and pieces, drained
4 canned whole green chilies, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 can (10-3/4 ounces) condensed cream of onion soup, undiluted
1/4 cup milk
1/2 tsp chicken seasoning
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp dried rosemary, crushed
1/4 tsp pepper

Directions:
Place flour in a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, one piece at a time; shake to coat. In a large skillet, brown chicken in oil on both sides.
Place the potatoes, carrots, onions, mushrooms and chilies in a greased 5-qt. slow cooker. In a small bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. Pour half of soup mixture over vegetables.
Transfer chicken to slow cooker; top with remaining soup mixture. Cover and cook on low for 3-1/2 to 4 hours or until a thermometer reads 170Â°.
