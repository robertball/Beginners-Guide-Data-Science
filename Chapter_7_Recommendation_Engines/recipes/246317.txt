Description: 
This is a terrific, tasty casserole for family brunches or for you! We had this for several Easter brunches when I was a kid and I loved it! When I started cooking I asked my mom for the recipe and as an adult it tastes just as good to me now as it did then! My fiance is not fond of pasta, but likes this!
