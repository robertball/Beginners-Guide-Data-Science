1/2 cup water
7 cups confectioner’s sugar

Whip the meringue powder and water on high speed for about 7-10 minutes, until it’s fluffy and has soft peaks.
Gradually add the rest of the ingredients while mixing.
Tint with food coloring, if desired.
Store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to one month.
