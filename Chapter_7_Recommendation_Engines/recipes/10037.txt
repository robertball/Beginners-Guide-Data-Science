Ingredients:
2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
40 cinnamon red hot candies

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Lightly grease baking sheet.
In a saucepan melt chocolate over low heat. Let cool.
In a small bowl mix flour, baking powder and salt.
In a medium bowl beat margarine on low speed until smooth. Add sugar and beat until creamy. Stir in egg, vanilla and chocolate.  Add flour mixture and mix well, forming a stiff dough.
To make spider, shape a 2 inch flat oval for the body. Make the spider's head by flattening a circle about 1/2 inch wide. Shape dough for legs each about 2 inches long and less than 1/4 inch wide.
Attach the head and legs to body. Put two red candies into head for eyes. Bake for 5-8 minutes.  Let spiders cool on baking sheet to avoid breaking when moving.
