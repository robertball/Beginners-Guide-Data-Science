Description: 
If you want a stew that is guaranteed to warm you from the inside this is the perfect stew for a cold day or if someone in the family is feeling under the weather. I found this reciepe years ago in a magazine, but have changed it quite a bit over the years. I hope you all love it as much as my family does! I even got a 4 year old to eat cabbage with this one and all three kids love it!
