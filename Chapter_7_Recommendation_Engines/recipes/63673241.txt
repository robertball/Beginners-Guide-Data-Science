Ingredients:
MEAT
1 whole chicken cut up into 8 pieces
BARBEQUE SAUCE
2 tablespoon tomato paste
½ teaspoon cinnamon
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
½ medium onion
3 garlic cloves
¼ cup apple cider vinegar
¼ cup chicken broth
1 teaspoon mustard powder
1 teaspoons cumin
1 teaspoon New Mexican red chile powder
¾ teaspoon smoked paprika
2 tablespoons macadamia nut oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat one side of a grill to high heat and the opposite side off and cover.
Combine all ingredients for barbecue sauce in a blender and blend until very smooth.
Before brushing the chicken pour out the portions of barbecue sauce you want to brush on as you may have leftover barbecue sauce that you can save and cook with later. Brush each piece of chicken all over with barbecue sauce but leaving enough leftover for a second brushing (you should have some left over)
Once the grill is hot place each piece of chicken on the hot side of the grill skin side down for 6-10 mins and brush additional barbecue sauce on the part of the chicken facing up. Then flip and grill opposite side for another 8-10 mins doing yet another brushing this time on the skin side. Transfer the chicken to the cool side of the grill skin side down and close the lid and let cook for 15-20 mins.
Transfer the chicken to a large platter ensuring they don’t touch each other so they keep their crispy skin and allow to rest for 10 mins. (you can skip the resting period but I prefer to do it as it the chicken keeps it’s moisture much better when you do so)
If it’s not sweet enough for your tastes you can add 3 drops liquid stevia or 1 teaspoon honey but it’s sweet enough without it in my opinion
