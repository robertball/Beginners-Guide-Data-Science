Ingredients:
6 tbsp unsalted butter, plus 1 tbsp. for pan
3/4 c all-purpose flour, plus more for pan
1/2 c sugar
1/2 tsp. baking powder
Pinch of salt
Zest of 1 lemon
2 eggs, beaten
1 tsp orange flower water, optional
1/2 tsp vanilla
Powdered sugar

Directions:
Melt 6 tablespoons butter in saucepan over medium heat; set aside.
In medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and lemon zest.
In small bowl, combine beaten eggs with vanilla and orange flower water, if using. Stir egg mixture into dry ingredients until just blended.
Add melted butter and mix slowly but thoroughly until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hour and up to a day.
Melt remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and, with a small brush, coat the inside of each mold with butter. Dust lightly with flour.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Place oven rack in middle position. Fill each mold about half full with a generous spoonful of batter. Bake for 10 to 11 minutes or until cake springs back when gently pressed with a finger.
Over a clean cloth, rap the edge of the pan to release madeleines. Dust with powdered sugar and serve immediately.

Description: 
It's worth making the extra effort because there's a bit of showmanship involved here (or perhaps it's just a cheap thrill for the baker). Once the madeleines have baked, spread a clean cloth on the counter, then turn over the pan and sharply rap its edge on the counter. The madeleines should spill from the pan like golden nuggets.
