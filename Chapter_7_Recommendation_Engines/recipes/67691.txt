Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups boiling water
1 (6 ounce) package orange or mango flavor Jell-O®
1 cup cold water
1 (15 ounce) can DOLE® Mandarin Oranges, drained
1 (8 ounce) tub frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Stir boiling water into gelatin in large bowl 2 minutes until completely dissolved.
Stir in cold water. Place mandarin oranges into 6-cup mold; spoon 2 cups gelatin mixture into mold over oranges. Refrigerate about 30 minutes or until set, but not firm (should stick to finger and mound).
Meanwhile, refrigerate remaining gelatin mixture about 30 minutes or until slightly thickened (consistency of unbeaten egg whites). Stir in 2 cups of the whipped topping with wire whisk until smooth. Pour over gelatin layer in mold.
Refrigerate 4 hours or until firm. Unmold. Garnish with remaining whipped topping. Store leftover gelatin mold in refrigerator.
Unmolding: Dip mold in warm water for about 15 seconds. Gently pull gelatin from around edges with moist fingers. Place moistened serving plate on top of mold. Invert mold and plate; holding mold and plate together, shake slightly to loosen. Gently remove mold and center gelatin on plate.
