Ingredients:
2 cups quick-cooking oats
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup cocoa powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 cup sugar
2 T ground flax seeds
2/3 cups nondairy milk
2/3 cup canola oil
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp almond extract
3/4 cup chocolate chips
1 cup dried cherries, chopped or raisins (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  You'll need two cookie sheets.
In a medium-size bowl, stir together oats, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat together the sugar, flax seeds and non dairy milk until smooth.  Add the oil and the vanilla and almond extracts and beat until well mixed.  Fold in half of the flour mixture to moisten, then fold in the remaining half. Just before the mixture is completely combined, fold in the chocolate chips and dried cherries or raisins, if desired.
For each cookie, drop 2 generous tablespoons of dough onto the cookie sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space between cookies. If desired, flatten slightly with moistened fingers or the moistened back of a measuring cup.  Bake for 10 - 12 minutes until the cookies are firm and risen.  Let the cookies rest on the baking sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to wire racks to complete cooling. Store in a tightly covered container.
