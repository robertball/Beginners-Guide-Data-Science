Ingredients:
Sauce:
1/4 cup butter
2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot
1/4 cup finely chopped garlic
6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoons dry white wine
kosher salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons chopped sun-dried tomatoes
2 tablespoons artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into pieces
Fish:
1 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste
2 (3 ounce) fillets mahi mahi fillets
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir shallot and garlic in butter until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Pour lemon juice and white wine into the skillet; season with kosher salt and black pepper. Cook the liquid at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid reduces enough to stick to the back of a spoon, 20 to 30 minutes.
Stir tomatoes and artichoke hearts into the reduced sauce; cook until warmed, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove skillet from heat, add cold butter pieces, and swirl skillet off heat until the butter melts and emulsifies into the sauce.
Stir flour and seasoned salt together in wide, shallow bowl. Dredge mahi mahi fillets in flour mixture to coat.
Heat olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry mahi mahi in the oil until the fish flakes easily with a fork in the center, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer mahi mahi to a platter; top with the sauce.

Description: 
This is an amazing way to fix fish. I use mahi mahi, but any thick white fish should work.
 Serve with rice. This is very similar to a dish served at Carrabba's!
