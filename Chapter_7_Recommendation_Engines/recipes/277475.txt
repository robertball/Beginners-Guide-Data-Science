Ingredients:
12 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, chopped
1/2 cup chopped dried cranberries
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1/2 cup chopped dried apricots

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with a sheet of waxed paper.
Place chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.
Combine cranberries, almonds, and apricots in a bowl. Add to melted chocolate and mix until well combined.
Spread chocolate onto the prepared baking sheet to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Place baking sheet in the refrigerator until chocolate has completely hardened, about 1 hour. Break into pieces.
