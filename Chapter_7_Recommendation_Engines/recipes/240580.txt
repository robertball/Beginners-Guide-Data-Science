Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup mashed avocado
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg
10 ounces chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray baking sheets with cooking spray.
Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Beat white sugar, brown sugar, butter, avocado, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy; beat in egg until smooth. Stir flour mixture, a few tablespoons at a time, into creamed mixture until dough is just mixed; stir in chocolate chips. Drop dough by the spoonful onto the baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I read that when baking you can replace half or all of the butter with mashed avocado to make it a little healthier. I got out my favorite cookie recipe from my dad and tried it. I replaced half the butter. They were still very yummy and I couldn't tell there was avocado in them.
