3 Tbsp. lemon juice
1 Tbsp. grated lemon peel

Directions:
In mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar.
Add egg yolks; mix well.
Combine flour, almond meal, baking powder, and salt.
Add flour mixture alternately with lemon juice to creamed mixture.
Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form; fold into batter with lemon peel.
