Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pound unsalted butter
3/4 cup white sugar
3 egg yolks
1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
1 teaspoon honey
Honey Syrup:
1 cup honey
1 cup water
1 cup white sugar
Topping:
1/2 cup finely crushed walnuts, or to taste
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste
1 pinch ground cloves, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk flour, cinnamon, baking powder, cloves, baking soda, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Beat butter in a separate bowl until light and fluffy; add sugar and mix well. Beat egg yolks and orange juice together in another bowl. Stir egg mixture into the butter mixture; add flour mixture slowly, mixing after each addition. Add honey. Mix until a soft dough forms.
Chill dough until firm enough to work with, about 30 minutes. Shape into small ovals and place a few inches apart on baking sheet sheets. Flatten slightly; cookies will spread.
Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat honey, water, and sugar together in a saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar is dissolved. Let syrup cool. Mix walnuts, cinnamon, and cloves together in a bowl to make the topping.
Dip cookies into the cooled syrup for 10 to 15 seconds per side. Sprinkle walnut topping over syrup and let dry completely. Store in muffin cups or between layers of parchment paper.
