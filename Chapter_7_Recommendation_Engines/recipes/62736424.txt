2 bunches greens -- collard, kale, or chard
1 yellow onion, preferably Vidalia or other sweet variety, sliced thin
1 granny smith apple, peeled and diced

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Trim and chop greens, then rinse well in a colander.  Pour greens into boiling water and blanch for a few minutes until nearly tender.  Drain and rinse with cool water.  Set aside.
Return pot to medium-low heat.  Add olive oil, a pinch of salt, and onions.  Cook slowly until onion slightly carmelizes.  Raise heat to medium; add greens and apple and cook until apple and greens are tender.  Season with vinegar, salt and pepper.
