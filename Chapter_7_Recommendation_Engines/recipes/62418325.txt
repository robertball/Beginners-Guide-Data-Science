Ingredients:
3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger root
2 tablespoons coconut oil
2 1/2 teaspoons pressed garlic
1/3 cup hoisin sauce

Directions:
Slice the chicken breasts into strips across the grain, and set aside. Peel and grate the ginger root and set aside.
Heat the coconut oil in a wok over medium-high heat until the oil is melted and hot. Stir in the ginger and garlic, and cook and stir for about 20 seconds, to release the flavor. Toss the chicken strips into the hot oil, and scoop the hoisin sauce over the chicken. Cook and stir for 5 to 7 minutes, until the sauce coats the chicken and the meat is no longer pink inside.
