Ingredients:
6 eggs
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup seedless raspberry jam
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup dark rum
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup ground walnuts
3/4 cup ground pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9 inch tube pan.
Separate the eggs. In a bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat the butter with the sugar until thoroughly creamed. Beat in the egg yolks, then the jam, vanilla extract, and dark rum.
In a small bowl, stir together the flour and baking powder.  Beat the flour mixture into the creamed mixture, then stir in the nuts. Stir about 1/3 of the beaten egg whites into the batter to lighten it and then fold in the rest gently but thoroughly.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 65 to 70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Transfer to a rack to cool. Makes about 12 servings.
