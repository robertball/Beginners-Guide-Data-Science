Ingredients:
1 Ribeye steak
1 tbsp ground coffee
1 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp seasoned salt
1 tsp black pepper
2 tsp smoked paprika
More salt and pepper to sprinkle

Directions:
Let your steak sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. After 20 minutes coat well with coffee rub mixture.
Fire up a charcoal grill and seared them quickly over direct heat for 2 minutes on each side. Place them in a cast iron skillet and put them in a preheated 375 degree oven and then turn the oven OFF. I let them sit in the oven for 8 minutes. Take out and let rest for at least 5 minutes.
