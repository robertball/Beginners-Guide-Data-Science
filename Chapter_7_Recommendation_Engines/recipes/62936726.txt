Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 pounds ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 head cabbage, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
36 frozen dinner rolls, thawed and risen

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.
Stir in ground beef, and cook until crumbly and no longer pink.
Drain any excess grease.
In a second skillet, cook the onion and cabbage mixture until softened.
Combine meat w/onion mixture.
Season with salt and pepper.
Spread the mixture onto a baking sheet to cool.
Once the mixture has cooled, divide each dinner roll in half, flatten it, and place a tablespoon of the cabbage mixture in the center. Pull the edges of the dough over the filling and pinch to seal. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
Bake in a preheated 350Â° oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.
