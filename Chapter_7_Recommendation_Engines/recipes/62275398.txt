Sherry Bacon Cream Brussels Sprouts Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
* about 1 lb of brussel sprouts, trimmed and halved
* 2-4 strips of uncooked bacon, diced
* 1-2 medium shallot, diced [originally 1.2 med. onion]
* 7-12 crimini mushrooms [+/- according to how much you enjoy mushrooms. Not part of original recipe]
**1 clove garlic, minced [I did not use this, but have added it out of respect for Ninjamama's recipe]
* 1/4 cup sherry
(not cooking sherry [I used Harvey Bristols])
* 1/2 cup cream (not half&half! [I used a local dairy's whipping cream - yum!])
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* [{herb} sea salt] salt and [freshly ground] pepper to taste

Directions:
Soak your brussel sprouts in a mixture of water and salt. I did two batches, one of which was an hour - the other overnight + 1 hour before I placed them in the oven. [I added this step]
Preheat oven to 475.
In bowl, toss halved brussel sprouts in olive oil. [I added s/p here]
Place halves sliced side down in a baking pan (I used a glass one; Ninjamama's was 9x13 - cooking times may vary for dark or non-stick pans)
Place in hot oven for 15 minutes [or until nicely browned]
Place diced bacon in cold medium skillet, and saute over medium heat until starting to brown a little on the edges
Add chopped mushrooms and shallots/onions to bacon and grease and saute until onion starts to become translucent
Add garlic, stirring well for about one minute
Add sherry, stir, then add cream and stir well
Bring to a boil over medium heat stirring constantly, and as soon as you see it bubbling, reduce heat to low (or med-low, depending on your stove) and simmer until it's reduced by about half, stirring occasionally. Once it's reduced, it will thicken up so that it coats your spoon well, but won't be thick like a white cream sauce
Salt and pepper to taste, toss roasted brussel sprouts in sauce.

Description: 
My friends & I had this as tapas @ Toro Bravo the 2nd week in January and went SO bananas over it that I order a second helping! We knew that we had to try and make it and we knew the bulk of the ingredients, so we immediately went online to see if anyone had tried making it. 

This is a variation on the Ninjamama's recipe, which can be found . A great big thanks to Ninjamama for posting this recipe!
