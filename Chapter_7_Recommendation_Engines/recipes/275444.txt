Ingredients:
Aioli:
4 tablespoons chopped peaches
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons minced fresh tarragon
1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®)
Sliders:
8 ounces ground pork
1/4 cup applesauce
3 tablespoons plain panko bread crumbs
1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 slider-size burger buns

Directions:
Combine peaches, mayonnaise, tarragon, and 1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce in the bowl of a food processor; process until smooth, about 1 minute. Place aioli in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix ground pork, applesauce, bread crumbs, 1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper in a bowl. Divide pork mixture into 4 equal portions and form into burgers.
Place burgers on the preheated grill and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 3 minutes per side.
Spread aioli onto buns and top with burgers.

Description: 
These juicy and tender mini pork burgers are awesome any time of the year, but keep them in mind for game day or tailgating food. We like them topped with red onion, a slice of sharp Cheddar, and served with a frosty mug of beer.
