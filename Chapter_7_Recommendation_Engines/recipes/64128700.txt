Ingredients:
1 6 1/2-lb bone-in pork shoulder blade roast
3 T Dijon-style mustard
1/3 C packed dark brown sugar
3 T kosher salt
2 T smoked paprika
1 T chili powder
1 1/2 t freshly ground black pepper
1/2 t garlic powder

Directions:
Trim excess fat from pork, leaving fat cap about 1/4 inch thick. Pat pork dry w/paper towels. Place on a large piece of plastic wrap. Spread mustard on pork. In a small bowl stir together brown sugar, salt, paprika, chili powder, black pepper, and garlic powder. Coat pork with all of the spice mixture. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Place on a tray. Chill at least 1 hour or overnight.
Preheat oven to 325. Line a shallow roasting pan w/foil. Place a rack in the pan. Unwrap pork; place on the rack. Roast, uncovered, 4 hrs. Wrap pork w/double thickness of foil and return to rack. Roast 2 hrs. more or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in meat registers at least 190. Remove from oven. Let stand 30 min. to 1 hr. Unwrap. Using 2 forks, pull pork apart, removing any large pockets of fat as you pull. Serve w/pickles, onion slices, spicy vinegar, barbecue sauce, and/or buns.
