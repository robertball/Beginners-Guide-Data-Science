Ingredients:
2/3 cup butter
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup finely chopped blanched almonds
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons red decorator sugar
2 teaspoons green decorator sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition, then stir in the almond extract. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended. Turn into a greased 15x10x1 inch jelly roll pan and spread evenly to edges.
Sprinkle a mixture of almonds and cinnamon over batter, then sprinkle with a mixture of red and green sugars.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges start to pull away from the sides of the pan. Cut into bars while still warm.
