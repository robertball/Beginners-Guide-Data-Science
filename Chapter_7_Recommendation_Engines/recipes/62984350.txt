Description: 
Cheeseburger Macaroni is kind of like the hamburger helper Cheeseburger Macaroni. I have not tried cooking the macaroni in the frying pan like you can with hamburger helper because I already had some cooked macaroni left over and used that, but I am sure it would work just fine. It would also be ok to maybe add some cream or sour cream to the pan. when playing around with this you need to keep in mind the salt content in the broth, the powder cheese or any real cheese you may add. I got the powdered cheese from spicebarn.com
