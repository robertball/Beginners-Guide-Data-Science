Ingredients:
4 large green bell peppers, washed and dried
1 lb ground beef
1 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese, divided
1/2 cup onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon oregano, ground
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon parsley flakes
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup instant rice
2 15 ounce cans tomato sauce
1 8 ounce can condensed tomato soup
1 bay leaf

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, onions, spices and uncooked instant rice.  Remove the tops and seeds from each pepper.  Stuff each pepper equally with the hamburger and rice mixture.  Place stuffed peppers into the crock pot.  Pour tomato sauce around peppers.  In a small bowl, combine tomato soup with just enough water to make the soup a gravy like consistency. Pour around the peppers.  Add a bay leaf to the tomato sauce/soup mixture to enhance flavor.  Top the peppers off with the remaining 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese.  Cook on high for 3 hours or on low for 6 hours.  Remove bay leaf prior to serving stuffed peppers.

Simply great for weekends!  Just prepare the peppers, place them in the slow cooker and they cook while you're out running your errands and doing activities.  There is nothing better than coming home to a house that smells of stuffed green peppers!
