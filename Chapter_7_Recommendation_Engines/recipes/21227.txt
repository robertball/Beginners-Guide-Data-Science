Ingredients:
6 parsnips, peeled and quartered lengthwise
1/4 cup all-purpose flour for coating
1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt
1/2 cup butter, melted

Directions:
In a large saucepan cover parsnips with water, cover and boil over medium-high heat until tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain.
In a plastic bag combine flour and seasoning salt.  Dip parsnips in butter and place them in the bag.  Shake bag to coat parsnips with the seasoned flour.
Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  When the butter starts to sizzle, add parsnips.  Cook, turning occasionally, until all sides are golden brown.
