Ingredients:
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 pound Brie cheese
1 cup chopped green onion
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 cups finely chopped toasted pecans
1  egg, beaten
¼ cup water
2 cups fresh raspberries
¼ cup white sugar
¼ cup water
salt and pepper to taste
½ cup olive oil

Directions:
Pound the chicken to flatten. Soften Brie in microwave; in a medium bowl combine the Brie, green onion and garlic and mix together. Spread about 1/4 cup of this mixture onto each chicken breast half. Roll up and secure with toothpicks.
Combine egg beat and water in a small bowl and whisk together to make egg wash. Place toasted pecans in a shallow dish or bowl. Dip each chicken roll in egg wash, then roll through the pecans, coating on all sides.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat and cook chicken rolls for 15 minutes, turning to brown on each side. When browned, cook for an additional 15 minutes, until cooked through and chicken juices run clear.
To Make Raspberry Sauce: Meanwhile, place raspberries, sugar and water in a blender. Blend for 3 to 4 minutes, then pour through a sieve to remove seeds.
Remove cooked chicken rolls from skillet to paper towels to drain. When drained, transfer to a serving plate and drizzle with raspberry sauce. Drizzle some sauce onto the plate in a circle, and serve.
