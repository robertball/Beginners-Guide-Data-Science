Ingredients:
1 pound or two 7.5 oz packages Friendship Farmer Cheese (dry curd cottage cheese)
1 large egg
2 cups all-purpose wheat flour
3 tbsp melted butter
1 tbsp and 1 tsp salt
sour cream or plain yogurt on the side

Directions:
Prepare the serving dish, melt butter in it, and place it near the stove.
Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add 1 tbsp of salt. Keep it boiling over medium heat.
Mix 1 tsp of salt, Farmer Cheese and egg together thoroughly, until egg completely penetrates the cheese; the mix should be even in color.
Gradually, add the flour to the cheese, until thick, play-dough like pastry forms.
Fold the cheese mix out on a smooth floured surface and proceed kneading it until it stops sticking to your hands.
With a wide blade knife, separate medium pieces of dough, and roll them out into hot-dog like rolls. Dipping the knife in flour, cut the "hot-dogs" into 1/2" dumplings.
Repeat the preceding step until all dough is cut.
Drop dumplings into boiling water about 30 pieces at a time.
Boil dumplings only until they appear on the surface of the water.
Using a slotted spoon, catch all of the cooked duplings, shake off excess water, and drop them into the serving dish where melted butter is waiting.
Repeat preceding step until all dumplings are cooked.
Serve hot, with sour cream or plain yogurt on the side.
