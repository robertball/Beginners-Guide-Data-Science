Cook linguini in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender.
Meanwhile, saute mushrooms and onion in butter or margarine with thyme.  Remove from heat.  Stir in flour.  Then stir in chicken broth and half and half.  Return to heat, and stir until the sauce boils and thickens.  Strain artichokes, and stir the liquid into the sauce.  Add the fresh Parmesan.
