Ingredients:
1 large Salmon fillet
1 - 2 apples (2 if they're small - make sure they're sweet apples)
1 large red onion
1 package of crushed peacans or almonds
1/2 stick of butter
salt/pepper
tin foil
1/2 a lemon

Directions:
line a cookie sheet in tin foil. Place your thawed Salmon in the center. Peel and slice your apple into thin wedges about a 1/4 of an inch thick @ the back wide. Chop your onion into rings (please do this it looks impressive when you serve it). Take your butter and coat the top of the salmon, salt & pepper sparingly. Cover the salmon in apples and then onions should lay all over the top. Squeeze your 1/2 lemon over the top. Seal it in with another wrap of tin foil on top of it and put it in the oven @ 350 degrees. After 30 minutes (please watch it - I never time these) open it and test it to see if it's almost done. When it's close to being done, coat the top in pecans and take the top off and turn up the oven to broil. Let the top turn golden brown and then remove from the oven. You will have a juicy fish with amazing flavors.

Description: 
It's salmon to die for, short of braising a Salmon steak at a 5 star. I've had guests request to take some home.
