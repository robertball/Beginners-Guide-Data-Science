Description: 
By far my favorite dessert - even moreso than chocolate chip cookies! - and extremely easy to make. None of my family is a big fan of pecans, but if you are add an extra cup in there. I get tons of compliments on this, and requests for the recipe every time! I actually use a graham cracker crust, I think that works best, even if it's already baked when I stick it in the oven!
