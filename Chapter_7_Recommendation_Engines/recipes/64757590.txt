Description: 
I created this original dairy-free recipe one day when I did not have butter for corn on the cob. It was a big hit and a new family favorite! I buy cold-pressed peanut oil from International Foods aisle of the grocery store for the strong peanut flavor (reminiscent of peanut butter) characteristic of some Chinese cooking. Refined peanut oil is not the same thing!
