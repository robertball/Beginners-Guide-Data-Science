Description: 
I remember my mother sending me to the store for '15Â¢ worth of store cheese'. The butcher would cut off a slice from a gigantic round of cheese covered with a wax-coated cloth. Mother would then blend that cheese into this tasty dish. Today, the memory of Mother's cooking is like food for my soul.
