Ingredients:
1 cup beer
1 cup water
2 Tbsp sugar
1 Tbsp. salt
4 bone-in chicken thighs (1-1/2 lb.)
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 Tbsp Dijon Mustard
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 tsp. chopped fresh rosemary

Directions:
Mix first 4 ingredients in a resealable plastic bag until sugar is dissolved; add chicken. Turn  over to evenly coat all sides. Refrigerate at least 1 hour to marinate (overnight is best).
Mix remaining ingredients. Heat grill to medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade. Grill  5 to 6 min. on each side or until done (160ÂºF), brushing occasionally with mayo mixture.
