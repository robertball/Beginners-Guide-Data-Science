Ingredients:
2 tablespoons lard, or more as needed
4 tablespoons sweet Hungarian paprika, divided
2 medium onions, thinly sliced
1/2 sweet red bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch dice
2 pounds boneless veal, cut into chunks
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 cup sour cream
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat lard in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until melted. Add 1/2 the paprika and stir to blend. Add onions and red bell pepper; stir to coat. Cook until just soft, about 3 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a bowl and drain lard back into Dutch oven.
Add veal and remaining paprika to the Dutch oven. Stir to coat the meat; cook until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add more lard if needed.
Return cooked vegetables and any juices to the Dutch oven. Add broth and bring just to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Add more broth if needed. Season with salt, pepper, and additional paprika.
Finish the sauce just before serving by stirring sour cream in thoroughly.

Description: 
Hungarian deliciousness made gluten free and diabetic- and keto-friendly. I sent directions to my 20-year-old non-cooking son to impress his girlfriend. He nailed it the first time. Traditionally served with dumplings but I serve with green beans, shredded Brussels sprouts, or saut√©ed cabbage. To make this Kosher, use schmaltz or duck fat and nondairy sour cream substitute. This uses quite a lot of paprika, but you would expect that from the name, yes?
