Ingredients:
2 Asian pears, peeled, cored and chopped
1/2 shallot, minced
1 1/4 teaspoons diced fresh ginger
1 cup water
1/2 vanilla bean stick, scored in half
1 1/2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
1 tablespoon mirin
1 ounce soybean oil
Salt
Black pepper
1/4 pound baby greens
1/2 carrot, shredded (optional)

Directions:
In a 1-quart saucepan, cook the pears with the shallot, ginger, and water over medium heat until soft. Strain and set aside to cool. Once at room temperature, puree one of the pears and strain through a sieve.
Remove the seeds from the vanilla bean and mix them into the puree. Discard the pod. Add the sherry vinegar and mirin and process in a blender or food processor. Slowly add the oil to emulsify. Season with the salt and pepper. Dice the remaining pear for garnish.
To serve, toss the baby greens well with the pear mixture. Divide among 4 serving plates and garnish with the shredded carrot (if using) and the diced pear.
