Ingredients:
1/2 cup salted butter
1 cup sugar
2 cups of chopped candy bars (about, more if you want toppings on the cookies)
2 eggs
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda

Directions:
In a saucepan, melt the butter, sugar, and chopped candy bars until smooth, remove from heat.
Quickly beat in eggs, one at a time, making sure the eggs don't begin to cook.
Mix in flour and baking soda, and more chopped candy bars, if you like.  The batter will be very sticky and won't really hold its own shape.
Refrigerate the dough not more than 1 hour (and if you do, let it sit out for a little).  It should be hard enough to mold like clay, but soft enough that you can easily scoop out a spoonful.
Preheat oven to 350F.  Line cookie sheets with parchment paper or spray with nonstick baking spray.
Roll half-tablespoon scoops of dough into balls onto cookie sheets, at least an inch apart.  If your dough is too cold, the cookie won't spread enough and you'll need to flatten your balls before baking, unless you want really cakey cookies.
Bake for 10-12 mins.  These cookies puff up a little, but will flatten when they cool.  These are soft, chewy cookies.  If you want cakey cookies, bake less and chill your dough longer so the cookie won't spread apart so much while baking.

Have tons of leftover Halloween candy bars to get rid of?  You can use pretty much any chocolatey candy bar: snickers, milkyway, heath, almond joy, rolos, chocolate bars, etc.  Whatever candy you use, these cookies will taste just like them!!
