Ingredients:
1/4 cup sugar
one 1/4 oz pkg active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm milk
1 egg, plus 2 egg yolks- at room temp.
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp salt
2 cups all purpose flour
5 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened
TOPPING
1 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened
1 to 2 Tbsp sugar- white, light brown, or a mixture

Directions:
Butter a 9 in. springform, tart, or cake pan.  Dust with granulated sugar. Put 1/4 cup warm water in a large bowl.  Stir in 1 tsp sugar and the yeast.  Set aside to proof.
In a separate bowl, whisk the warm milk with the eggs, and egg yolks, vanilla, remaining sugar, and salt.  When the yeast is foamy, with a mixer on low speed, beat in the milk and egg mixture.  Start adding flour 1/2 cup at a time and beat on medium until smooth.
Once all the flour has been added and the batter is smooth, scrape down the bowl once or twice to mix everything in, then beat in the soft butter.  Raise the speed to medium high and beat until the batter is smooth and glossy- 2 to 3 min.  Scrape batter into prepared pan, and smooth it out.
Let batter rise in a warm place, uncovered, for an hour.  After an hour, preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Just before baking, brush the melted butter over the top and sprinkle with sugar.
Bake in the center of the oven until springy yet nearly firm, with the sugar melted into the butter to form a glaze.  About 40 minutes.  Remove from oven, release sides of pan right away, and let cool.
