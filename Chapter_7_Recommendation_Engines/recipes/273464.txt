Ingredients:
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
½ teaspoon ground mustard
½ teaspoon parsley flakes
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 (12 ounce) boneless skinless chicken breasts
2 tablespoons butter
parchment paper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix garlic powder, paprika, mustard, parsley, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Rub all sides of each chicken breast in olive oil and coat all sides with the spice rub. Place on a baking sheet. Top each breast with 1 tablespoon of butter. Cover each breast with parchment paper and tuck the paper underneath, creating a sealed pouch.
Bake until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken from the oven and let rest 5 minutes.

Description: 
Use whichever spice combinations you prefer. The key to baking white meat without it getting dry is topping it with butter and wrapping it in parchment paper. It locks in the moisture and is tender and juicy every single time. The paper absorbs most all of the butter so  you are not actually consuming it.
