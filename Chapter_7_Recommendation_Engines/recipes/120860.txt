Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup butter
1/2 cup milk
5 eggs

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups  flour, sugar, yeast, lemon peel and salt. In a saucepan, heat butter and milk to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat until moistened. Add 4 eggs;  beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in the remaining flour. Do not knead. Spoon into greased bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Stir dough down. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Cover with a bowl; let rest for 15 minutes. Cut one-sixth from the dough; set aside. Shape remaining dough into 12 balls (about 2-1/2 in); place in well-greased muffin cups. Divide reserved dough into 12 small balls.  Make an indentation in the top of each large ball; place a small ball in each indentation. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Beat remaining egg; brush over rolls. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to wire racks to cool.
