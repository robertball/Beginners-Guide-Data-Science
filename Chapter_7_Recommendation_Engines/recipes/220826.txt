Ingredients:
2 small zucchini, cut lengthwise into slightly less than 1/4-inch slices
4 slices smoked fontina cheese, halved
8 slices thick cut bacon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place zucchini directly on oven rack near the bottom. Cook until slightly softened, 5 to 10 minutes.
Place bacon slices on paper towels. Heat in microwave on High until cooked but not crisp, about 3 minutes.
Place a layer of bacon on each zucchini slice; top with a slice of fontina cheese.
Tightly roll each layered zucchini strip and secure with a toothpick or skewer. Place on baking sheet.
Bake zucchini rolls in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
