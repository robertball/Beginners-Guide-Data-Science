Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (10.5 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1 cup white wine

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Cook the garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with the rosemary, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook until completely browned, about 5 minutes per side; transfer the chicken to a 9x13-inch baking dish, reserving the pan drippings.
Stir the cream cheese, cream of mushroom soup, white wine, and the drippings from the skillet together in a bowl; pour over the chicken.
Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is cooked completely and no longer pink in the middle, 45 to 50 minutes.

Description: 
I got this recipe from an old boyfriend's mom. It's simple and delicious and makes a great dish for company. Serve over rice or pasta. I like to use spinach fettuccine because it adds color to the dish. But it's ALL good! Broccoli or asparagus makes a great accompanying veggie. If you are making this as a company dish, you can serve it 'Family Style' by placing your rice or pasta on a large dish or platter and putting the chicken and sauce over the top.
