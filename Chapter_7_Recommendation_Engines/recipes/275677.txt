Ingredients:
1 cup Italian-style salad dressing (such as Newman's Own®)
1 cup Key lime juice (such as Nellie and Joe's)
1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®)
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, sliced
cooking spray

Directions:
Whisk Italian dressing, lime juice, tarragon, and hot pepper sauce together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Remove chicken from the marinade and place on the prepared baking sheet. Pour the remaining marinade around and on top of the chicken.
Broil in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 30 minutes, flipping pieces halfway. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
