Ingredients:
1 large or 2 small boneless skinless chicken breasts (cooked)
1/2 of a 16 oz tub of ricotta
1 egg
1/3 C of parmesan grated
1/2 C of shredded cheese (I used Jack & cheddar)
1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup undiluted
1/4 C minced onion
2 cloves of minced garlic
1 tsp of dried thyme
1/2 tsp of nutmeg
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper (or to taste)
1/2 box of Pasta shells parboiled but not fully cooked
Sauce Ingredients
1/4 stick of butter
1/4 C flour
1 1/2 C chicken broth
1/2 C white wine (I used chardonnay)
1/2 Can of remaining cream of mushroom soup
1/2 tsp garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Finely chop the chicken breast so it's almost a mince. Add the remaining ingredients and set aside. Once the shells are slightly cooked and manageable for stuffing, stuff them and place in a buttered casserole dish. Meanwhile make your sauce, start by making a roux of the butter and flour, gradually add chicken broth til it's nicely thickened. Add the wine and soup, incorporate well and add your seasonings. Pour over your shells and cover with foil. Bake in a 350 oven for 35 minutes. Uncover and top with more shredded cheese of your choice. (I used cheddar and Jack again.) Return to oven for an additional 5 minutes under the broiler to melt it and set a nice slight crust on it. Fabulous!
