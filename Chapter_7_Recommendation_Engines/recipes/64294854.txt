Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup orzo pasta
1/2 cup diced onion
1/2 cup diced carrots
1/2-3/4 cup mushrooms, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup uncooked white rice
2 cups chicken broth

Directions:
Melt the butter in a lidded skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir orzo pasta until golden brown. Stir in onion, carrots, and cook until onion becomes translucent, then add garlic, mushrooms and cook for 1 minute. Mix in the rice and chicken broth. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.
