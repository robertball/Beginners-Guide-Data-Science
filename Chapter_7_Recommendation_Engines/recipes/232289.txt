Description: 
This super easy dish was one we often had while camping as kids. My sister and I loved it. Many years later, I was challenged to come up with a dish to bring to my sister's for Christmas brunch. I was inspired and made our camper's hash. To justify this humble dish's appearance at Christmas, I called it 'Who Hash,' and a tradition was born. We must have it EVERY Christmas morning. The name of this dish came from a line in Dr. Seuss' 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' where it is described that the Grinch stole everything in the Who's house, 'the Grinch even took their last can of Who hash.'
