Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/3 cup milk
1/3 cup bread crumbs
1 egg
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 dash salt
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
2/3 cup sour cream
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, roughly chopped
1/2 cup chopped mushrooms
1/2 cup spiced rum
1/2 (8 ounce) package egg noodles

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix meat, milk, bread crumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, oregano, basil, thyme, onion powder, garlic powder, fennel seeds, black pepper, and salt together in a large bowl; do not overmix. Form mixture into 6 large balls and flatten into medium thick patties.
Heat oil in a heavy, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Place patties in the hot skillet and reduce heat to medium. Cook until browned, 5 to 10 minutes per side; don't flatten patties while cooking.
While patties are cooking, mix sour cream, water, and flour together in a bowl until smooth. Set aside.
Remove browned patties from the skillet. Drain and discard grease, but keep meat drippings in the skillet. Return skillet to medium heat and add butter and onions. Cook until onions are just starting to soften, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook 1 to 2 minutes more. Carefully pour rum into the skillet and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in sour cream mixture and mix well; cook until heated through, about 2 minutes more. Return patties to the skillet and cover with gravy. Cover skillet with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until meat is cooked through, about 30 minutes.
While meat bakes,  Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes. Drain.
Place a serving of noodles on a plate and top with 1 patty and a portion of gravy mixture. Repeat with remaining noodles, patties, and gravy.

Description: 
I was looking for something different one night and came up with this. It is Salisbury steaks meets stroganoff, and for me it is a keeper. Sprinkle with paprika before serving, if you like.
