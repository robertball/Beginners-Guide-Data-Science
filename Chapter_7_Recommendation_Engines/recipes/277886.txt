Ingredients:
21 ounces white bread flour (4 1/2 cups)
2 1/4 teaspoons instant dry yeast
2 teaspoons kosher salt
14 ounces lukewarm whole milk
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 large egg, at room temperature, slightly beaten
1/4 cup semolina, or as needed

Directions:
Place flour into a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle yeast on one side of the flour and salt on the other side. Add milk, sugar, butter, and egg; mix to make a soft dough.
Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until soft, smooth, and stretchy, about 10 minutes.
Place dough into a large oiled bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double the size, about 1 hour.
Deflate the dough and divide into 16 pieces. Press each into English muffin rings. Sprinkle both sides with semolina and let rest another 30 minutes.
Preheat a griddle to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), or a heavy-based frying pan over low heat. Cook the muffins on the preheated griddle or pan until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a muffin reaches 200 F (93 degrees C), 7 to 10 minutes per side.

Description: 
You can't make a true homemade English muffin without using bread flour. It gives the muffins the chewy texture you identify with and love. I've tried many recipes with both AP and bread flour, and this is the best of them all.
