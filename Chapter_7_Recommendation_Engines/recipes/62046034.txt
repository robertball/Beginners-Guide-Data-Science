Ingredients:
2 Lbs. Ground beef
2 large onions
1 pepper (red or green)
17 cloves garlic, minced (or 12t. jarred minced garlic)
1 cup chili powder (CVS generic is great)
1Tbl. Cumin
2 tsp. Corriander
1Tbl. Salt
1tsp. cayenne (depending on how hot you like it)
2 Tbl. vegetable oil
1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes
1 30-36 oz can of canned whole plum tomatoes, crushed with hands(I prefer Tuttrose brand)
(4) 16 oz cans of kidney beans-dark or pink

Directions:
Put the hamburg in a large pan.  Coarsley chop the onions and pepper.  Add onions and peppers to the pan with the hamburg.  Add garlic, chili powder,cumin, corriander, salt and cayenne.  Mix well. Add the vegetable oil and cook on medium low heat for about 45 minutes or until the onion is transparent.  Add the tomatoes and simmer 30 minutes.  Add kidney beans 15 minutes before serving--just enough to heat through.  Serve with white rice and cheddar cheese on top, if desired.

Description: 
This is my most requested recipe, hands down. It has won several chili cookoff's. Although a bit tedious, fresh garlic is the best.
