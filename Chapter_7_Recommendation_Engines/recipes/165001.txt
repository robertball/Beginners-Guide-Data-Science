Ingredients:
4 Mission® Jalapeno Cheddar Wraps, warmed
1 pound ground beef, chuck, raw
1 package taco seasoning
8 tablespoons refried beans, prepared, hot
4 cups iceberg lettuce, shredded, prepared
1/2 cup pico de gallo, prepared
4 tablespoons guacamole, prepared
1/2 cup grated Mexican cheese blend, prepared

Directions:
Cook 1 pound of raw ground beef and 1 package of taco seasoning per recipe instructions (follow instructions on the seasoning pack), drain and reserve hot for the recipe build.
To build 1 Taco Salad Wrap:  Spread 2 tablespoons hot refried beans over the entire wrap.
Place  of the heated taco seasoned ground beef over the beans, down the center of the wrap (forming a V, like at the 10 and 2 O'clock positions).
Evenly place 1 cup lettuce over the beef.
Top the lettuce with 2 tablespoon pico de gallo, 1 tablespoon guacamole and 2 tablespoon Mexican cheese blend.
Fold lower edge of wrap over the ingredients then roll the wrap into a cone shape, rolling the wrap from left to right.  This will create a cornucopia with a closed end.
Repeat steps 1 through 5 with remaining 3 wraps and ingredients. Serve.
