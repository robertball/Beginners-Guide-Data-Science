1 large onion, chopped
2 celery ribs, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups uncooked brown rice(may use

1 box(32-oz.)vegetable broth
1 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. pepper
6 green onions, sliced
4 Tbsp. chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add carrots, onion, celery, and garlic; cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add rice and cook 3 minutes, stirring constantly.
Add 4 cups water, broth, salt, and pepper. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is tender, about 45 minutes(reduce cooking time to 20 minutes if using white rice). Remove from heat, and stir in green onions and parsley.
