Ingredients:
- 1 lb. ground turkey breast
- 1/2 small vidalia onion, diced
- 1/4 cup fresh flat leaf parsley, finely chopped
- 2 scallons, firm green part finely chopped
- 2-3 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- A little less than 1/4 cup egg substitute
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 4 whole wheat burger buns, toasted

Directions:
Place the ground turkey breast in a large bowl, and separate just a little bit (in order to make the other ingredients distribute more evenly)
Prepare the onion, parsley, scallions and place them in the bowl with the ground turkey.
Add the Worcestershire sauce and egg substitute. Carefully mix all the ingredients together with your hands (only a little bit).
Then add the garlic powder, salt, and pepper and mix the turkey lightly with your hands again.
Divide the mixture and form 4 burger patties. Place them on another plate.
Grill the burgers on a grill or grill pan for 5 to 10 minutes per side, until well done.

Description: 
Turkey burgers can be tasty and healthy at the same time! This burger recipe is proof! I served my burgers with baked sweet potato fries. The burgers are really great with some chili sauce on top of the finished burger. Enjoy!
