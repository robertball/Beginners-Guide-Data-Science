Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1/8 teaspoon anise oil
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon bakers' ammonia
2 tablespoons anise seed, or as needed

Directions:
Beat the eggs, sugar, lemon peel and anise oil until very thick.
Blend the flour and ammonium carbonate. Add in fourths to the egg-sugar mixture, mixing until blended after each addition. Cover dough with a clean towel and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.
Shape the dough into a ball and on a lightly floured surface, knead it lightly. Roll it out to 1/4 inch thick. Press a lightly floured springerle rolling pin or mold firmly into the dough to make clear designs. Brush the dough surface gently with a soft brush to remove any excess flour. Cut the frames apart, cover with a clean kitchen towel and let stand for 24 hours.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheet and sprinkle the entire surface with anise seeds.
Lightly brush the back of each frame with water and set on the anise seed coated cookie sheet. Bake for 8 minutes. When cookies are thoroughly cooled, store them in a tightly covered container for 1 to 2 weeks before serving. To soften cookies, store them for several days with a piece of apple or orange.
