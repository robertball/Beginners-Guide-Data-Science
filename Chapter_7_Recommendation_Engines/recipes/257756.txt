Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package dried rice noodles
8 rice paper wrappers
1/2 head iceberg lettuce, finely shredded
1 (8 ounce) package bean sprouts
1 cup peeled matchstick-sized daikon
1 cup finely shredded cabbage
2 carrots, peeled and cut into thin matchsticks
1 cucumber - peeled, seeded, and cut into thin matchsticks
1 bunch mizuna
1 bunch Thai basil
Dipping Sauce:
1 cup hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons applesauce

Directions:
Place noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Set aside until noodles are softened, about 15 minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly.
Fill a shallow baking dish with hot water. Soak 1 rice paper in the hot water until softened, 5 to 10 seconds. Lay flat on a work surface. Place a thin layer of rice noodles, iceberg lettuce, bean sprouts, daikon, cabbage, carrots, cucumber, mizuna, and Thai basil near the top. Fold in sides and roll up rice paper to enclose the filling. Repeat with remaining rice wrappers.
Mix hoisin sauce and applesauce together in a small bowl. Serve alongside rolls.
