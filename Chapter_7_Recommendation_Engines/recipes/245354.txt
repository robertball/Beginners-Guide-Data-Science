Ingredients:
6 cups unsweetened vanilla-flavored almond milk
6 large egg yolks
2/3 cup coconut sugar
1/2 cup cornstarch
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup toasted unsweetened shredded coconut
1/4 cup butter
1 tablespoon bourbon vanilla extract
3 bananas, sliced

Directions:
Mix almond milk, egg yolks, coconut sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a large saucepan and, stirring constantly, bring to a boil. Cook and stir almond milk mixture until it thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir shredded coconut, butter, and vanilla extract into milk mixture. Remove saucepan from heat and allow pudding to cool to room temperature.
Divide sliced bananas between 8 serving bowls and pour pudding over top.

Description: 
Rich and creamy, with an excellent, almost butterscotch-like flavor. 
Fairly healthy for a sweet treat. I make it gluten-  and refined sugar-free, sweetening with coconut sugar.
