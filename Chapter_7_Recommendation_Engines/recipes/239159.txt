Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil, or more to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/4 teaspoons freshly grated ginger

Directions:
Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute garlic and ginger in hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Pour chicken broth into garlic mixture and bring to a boil; remove from heat and stir in couscous. Cover the saucepan with a lid and let stand until broth is completely absorbed, 5 to 7 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork.
