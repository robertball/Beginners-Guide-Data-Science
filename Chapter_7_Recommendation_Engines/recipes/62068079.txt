Ingredients:
Freshly Grated Parmigiano Reggiano Cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Grate Parmigiano Reggiano using a third cup grated for every crisp you want to make.
Cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper or silicon baking mat, and spread  the cheese into rounds or
any shape you like.
Bake in the oven until melted and browned 15-20 minutes.  Keep
a watch as the timing varies due to the thickness of the grating and general oven variations.
While the crisps are still warm they can be shaped into bowls or cones or little tacosor any other shape you like.
Allow to cool completely before eating.

Description: 
Without knowing more about the flavor of what you're talking about, I'm taking a total stab in the dark, here.  The Italian restaurants I go do dont put ANYTHING on my plate before the oil.  But perhaps this could be it?
