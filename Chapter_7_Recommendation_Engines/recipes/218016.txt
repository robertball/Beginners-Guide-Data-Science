Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
1/3 cup softened butter
1 cup milk
2 cups fresh blackberries
1 cup white sugar
2 cups boiling water

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a mixing bowl.
Cream 1 cup of sugar with the softened butter until light and fluffy. Mix in the flour mixture alternately with the milk until no large lumps remain. Pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange the berries over the batter, and sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup of sugar. Pour the boiling water over top.
Bake in the preheated oven until the batter has firmed and the berries are soft, about 50 minutes.

Description: 
This is the easiest dessert to make. If you pop it in the oven before you serve your meal, you will have a hot cobbler to plop a scoop of vanilla ice cream on for dessert.
