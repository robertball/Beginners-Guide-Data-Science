Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed light brown sugar
3 eggs
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup grated carrots
1 cup crushed pineapple, drained
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 inch round cake pans.
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, white sugar and brown sugar. Stir in the eggs one at a time beating well after each. Sift together the flour, salt, cinnamon, baking soda and baking powder, stir into the creamed mixture. Finally stir in the vanilla, carrots, pineapple and walnuts. Divide batter evenly between the two pans. Don 't worry about filling them too full, as this cake does not rise very much.
Bake for 60 to 75 minutes in the preheated oven. Test for doneness with a toothpick or knife.
