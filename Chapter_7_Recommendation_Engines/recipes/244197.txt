Ingredients:
1  large dried ancho chile pepper, torn
¼ cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
1 tablespoon lemon grass
¼ teaspoon ground turmeric
¼ teaspoon ground allspice
1 pound chicken breast, thinly sliced

Directions:
Combine ancho chile, soy sauce, brown sugar, lemon grass, ground turmeric, and ground allspice together in a large resealable bag; add chicken and shake until coated. Refrigerate and marinate chicken for at least 1 hour.
Transfer chicken to a skillet and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
Tasty marinated chicken gets a kick from smokey ancho chili peppers. Serve with a mandarin and spring green salad and a good Riesling. Alternately, you can skewer chicken on bamboo skewers which have been soaked for about 20 minutes and cook them over a small flame.
