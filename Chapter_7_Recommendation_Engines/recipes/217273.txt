Description: 
If you think green tea is boring and tasteless, then this is something that could COMPLETELY change your mind. The sparkling fizz makes it taste fresh and feel good on your throat, while the sugar, lime, and green tea add a zingy sensation to the old taste. This is a personal family favorite, and I made it up in my own kitchen! Perfect for parties, get-togethers, and family picnics on hot summer days.
