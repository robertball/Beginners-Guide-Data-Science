Ingredients:
4 tablespoons avocado oil
1 medium onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 pound beef roast, diced
10 white button mushrooms, quartered
2 carrots, diced
1 cup bone broth
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 tablespoon arrowroot powder (optional)
salt to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook until softened, 2 to 5 minutes. Add beef cubes; cook and stir until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add mushrooms and carrots; cook until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes more.
Add bone broth and turmeric to the skillet and reduce heat to very low. Partially cover skillet with a lid and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until beef is tender, about 1 hour. Add a small amount of water if mixture sticks to the skillet.
Remove the lid and increase the heat slightly if the sauce hasn't thickened sufficiently. Add arrowroot to thicken sauce, if needed. Season with salt. Garnish with parsley.

Description: 
This satisfying spin on beef goulash is the perfect new edition to your autoimmune protocol. I've swapped out paprika for turmeric for an Asian-inspired take on a classic. It's so good you won't even notice the tomatoes are gone in this flavorful stew. Serve over cauliflower rice or mashed cauliflower.
