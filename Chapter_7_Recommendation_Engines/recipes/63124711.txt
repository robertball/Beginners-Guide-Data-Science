Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons of butter
1-3 to 4 lb whole fryer chicken, cut up to serving pieces
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon of salt
1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder
1 teaspoon of Season salt
1/3 cup milk
1 egg
1 pint of Half & Half

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease with butter a 9 x 13 inch baking pan (I use my Pyrex dish for this)with butter and set aside.
Mix flour and seasoning up together in a shallow dish or bowl. Beat egg and 1/3 cup milk together in another small dipping bowl.
Cover each chicken piece with flour then dip in egg mixture then re-dip in flour. Place chicken in pan with the heavier, thicker pieces are on the outer edge of baking pan. Season chicken again with salt and pepper after all pieces are in the pan. Pour the Half & Half in pan until it covers chicken. Cover pan with piece of foil.
Remove foil about 10 minutes before removing dish from oven. Bake for about one hour.

This recipe was one from my Grandmother's Grandmother that 5 generations have now been fixed for our families. In fact it was one of my favorite dishes that my Grandmothers fix for us for Sunday Family Dinners after we had went to church services.
