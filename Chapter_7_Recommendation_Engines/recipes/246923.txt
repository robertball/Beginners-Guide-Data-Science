Ingredients:
4  bone-in chicken thighs, chopped into 2-inch pieces
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 (1 1/2 inch) piece peeled fresh ginger, chopped
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced
1 large tomato, chopped
2 teaspoons shrimp paste
2 teaspoons tamarind paste
1 teaspoon chile powder, or to taste
2 cups chicken stock
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 (20 ounce) can young green jackfruit in brine, drained
2 teaspoons Burmese curry powder

Directions:
Mix chicken, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and salt together in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to marinate, about 30 minutes.
Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomato, shrimp paste, tamarind paste, and chile powder; mix until flavors combine, about 1 minute. Stir in chicken with marinade. Cook until chicken is browned on both sides, about 5 minutes.
Stir chicken stock and sugar into the wok. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Add jackfruit; simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in curry powder. Continue simmering until the internal temperature of the chicken registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes more.
