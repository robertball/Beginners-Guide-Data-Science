Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds extra lean ground beef
1/2 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 stalk celery, finely diced
1 green pepper, diced
1 cup water
3/4 cup ketchup
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
Cider Vinegar

Directions:
Place ground beef in a large skillet. Turn heat to medium and cook and stir the mixture constantly until the beef is browned; add onion and continue cooking till onion is tender and translucent.
Stir in garlic, celery and green bell pepper; cook and stir until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 cup water and stir, scraping the pan to dissolve any brown flavor bits from the bottom of the skillet.
Mix in ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, salt, and black pepper. Add a splash of cider vinegar and return mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has evaporated and the mixture is thick, about 40 minutes.
Season with salt and black pepper to taste.

Description: 
Despite the name of this iconic retro dish, the secret to a great sloppy joe is a thick, rich, almost dry consistency, which allows the sandwich to be eaten with your hands. Serve on hamburger buns.Modified from: Homemade Sloppy Joes
