Ingredients:
7 Tomatillos (green tomatoes)
2-3 Roma tomatoes
8 Chile serrano peppers
Handful of Cilantro
1 Tbsp Kosher salt

Directions:
Put the vegetables in a plastic vegetable bag (poke holes in the top) and microwave 5-7 mins or until soft. Once soft, poke a small hole in the bottom of the bag to drain some of the liquid.
In the blender, add a handful of cilantro and salt, add the softened vegetables. Blend for 30 seconds.
Allow to cool and refrigerate.

This is an authentic spicy green salsa recipe that my cousin makes in Mexico. One of the best, and you can control the heat.
