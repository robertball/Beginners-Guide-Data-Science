Description: 
This simple recipe makes a great salmon glaze. The sugar in the seasoned rice vinegar caramelizes under the broiler and the sweet, salty vinegar works perfectly with the tangy mustard. While my original recipe only had two ingredients, I've added Sriracha hot sauce and a pinch of salt.
