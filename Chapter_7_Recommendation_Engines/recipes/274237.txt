Ingredients:
Syrup:
2 cups maple syrup
1/2 tablespoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
Waffles:
2 cups milk
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
4 eggs, separated
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup flaxseed meal
4 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 stick butter, melted
1/4 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Combine maple syrup, ginger, and nutmeg in a pitcher. Set syrup aside.
Combine milk, pumpkin puree, egg yolks, and vanilla extract in a large bowl.  Combine flour, flaxseed meal, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Stir milk mixture into flour mixture. Add butter.
Beat egg whites in a clean, dry bowl until very frothy. Add brown sugar 2 tablespoons at a time and beat until soft peaks form. Fold egg whites into waffle batter in 3 additions.
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Cook in the preheated waffle iron until waffle is golden brown and the iron stops steaming, about 5 minutes.
Serve waffles with spiced syrup.
