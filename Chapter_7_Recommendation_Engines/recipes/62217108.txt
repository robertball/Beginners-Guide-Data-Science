Ingredients:
1 (16 oz) pkg frozen chopped spinach
16 oz Bacon
2 large Vidalia Onions
2 Tbs minced Garlic
3 lb Red potatoes, peeled & diced
8 cloves Garlic
1/2 cup softened Butter
1 cup Half & Half
1 pint Sour Cream
1 Tbs dried Dill Weed
1 tsp Kosher Salt
1 tsp White Pepper
2 cup shredded Cheddar Cheese
French's French-Fried Onion Rings®

Directions:
Thaw spinach, let drain. Brown bacon, set aside to cool, then render into bits w/ food chopper.
Slice onions 0.5 - 1mm thick w/ a mandolin & use sparing amount of bacon grease to sauté in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic after 2 min & continue to cook until golden. Using a slotted or sieved tool, remove from pan to large mixing bowl. Add sparing amount of bacon grease to skillet, then add spinach and gently sauté for 3-5 min, stirring constantly. Remove to bowl with prepared onion & add bacon bits to bowl.
Meanwhile, halve garlic cloves, put them with diced potato in a large saucepan, cover with cold water, bring to boil, reduce heat, simmer until just tender (NOT watery) & drain in a collander. After draining, mash with cream & butter, then cream potato mix w/ seasonings & sour cream in a food processor to desired texture.
Stir in 1 cup Cheddar cheese and mix all thoroughly. Turn out into a greased 11x15 inch casserole, top with remaining cheese and bake 15 minutes in a pre-heated 350 oven. Interrupt cooking to top with French's Onions®, then return to oven and cook until cheese is lightly browned, another 5 - 10 minutes.
