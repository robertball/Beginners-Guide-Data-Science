Ingredients:
1/2 cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as CraisinsÂ®)
1 cup hot water, or as needed
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup oat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 (15 ounce) can sweet potatoes, undrained
3 eggs
1/4 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 6 jumbo muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Soak dried cranberries in a bowl of hot water until plump, about 10 minutes; drain.
Combine whole wheat flour, white sugar, oat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Beat sweet potatoes, eggs, and coconut oil together in a separate bowl until smooth; stir into flour mixture until batter is smooth. Fold plump sweetened cranberries and pecans into batter; spoon into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
