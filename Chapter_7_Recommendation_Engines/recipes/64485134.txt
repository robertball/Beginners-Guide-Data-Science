Ingredients:
Tangy Sauce:
1/2 C. mayonnaise
1 TBLS ketchup
1 TBLS sweet relish
Frittata:
1 lbs lean ground beef
1/2 large onion, minced
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1 C. shredded iceberg lettuce
8 large eggs, beaten
3/4 C. shredded cheddar

Directions:
Position an oven rack second from the top; preheat the broiler.
For the sauce: Stir together the mayonnaise, ketchup and relish in a small bowl. Set aside.
Heat a 10-inch nonstick oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat for 1 minute.
Add the beef, onion and salt and stir together with a wooden spoon to brown, breaking up the lumps of meat, until cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the lettuce to wilt, about 30 seconds, and then pour in the eggs.
Using a rubber spatula, push the eggs into the center, lift and let the runny egg flow underneath, turning the skillet to help distribute, and continuing until the eggs are almost set, 2 to 3 minutes.
(Lower the heat if it’s bubbling too much.)
Sprinkle the cheese on top.
Put the skillet under the broiler until the cheese melts and the egg puffs and browns, about 5 minutes. Remove the frittata from the oven, cut into wedges and serve immediately with the tangy sauce.

Description: 
There’s something about the combo of beefy, cheesy and tangy flavors that resonates deep in our collective food taste memories. This frittata is a tribute to that very all-American experience.
