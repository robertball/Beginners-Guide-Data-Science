Ingredients:
1 box of Cavatappi pasta (swirly "s" shaped pasta noodles)
1 lb Italian sausage
2 tbs butter
4 garlic cloves or 1 tbs of already crushed garlic
2 packages of fresh sliced mushrooms....I usually try to use 2 different types
2 tbs flour
1 c chicken broth
1 c heavy cream
2 c (1 package) of Italian blend cheese mix
1 Lg can diced tomatoes (drain the juice)
1/2 c shredded Parmesan (or more if you like)
Dash of hot sauce

Directions:
Cook pasta 8 minutes.
At the same time, brown the sausage.  Once cooked, set off to the side on a plate.
In the same pan you cooked the sausage, put both packages of mushrooms.  Add a splash of olive oil, the butter, and the garlic. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Saute for 3-5 min.
Once the mushrooms have sauteed, add the flour and stir, cook 2 min. Whisk in broth, then stir in cream. Bring creamy mixture to a bubble. Stir in 1.5 cups of cheese blend and 1/4 cup of the Parm. When cheese is melted, stir in the drained can of tomatoes. When the sauce comes to a bubble , remove from heat and add a few dashes of hot sauce (a must!).
Combine mushroom cheese sauce, sausage, and pasta into a baking dish.  Sprinkle with remaining .5 C of cheese blend and 1/4 C. Parm.  Broil in oven till golden brown.
