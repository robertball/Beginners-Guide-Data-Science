Description: 
Take all the yummy fillings from a chicken burrito and morph them into a chicken burrito bowl. Pressure cooking will allow dinner to be done that much quicker! This uses an elevated trivet, and a pot-in-pot method to allow multiple ingredients to cook at once. I also used small silicone bowls to heat the corn and black beans
