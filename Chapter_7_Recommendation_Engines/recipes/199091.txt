Ingredients:
1 egg
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons tapioca flour
1/4 cup cold water
4 cups chicken broth
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
1/8 teaspoon minced fresh garlic
2 tablespoons chopped green onion
1/4 teaspoon Asian (toasted) sesame oil (optional)
1 pinch white pepper (optional)

Directions:
Beat the egg and salt together in a bowl until well mixed. In a separate bowl, combine the tapioca flour with the cold water and stir to dissolve.
Bring the chicken broth, ginger, and garlic to a full rolling boil, remove from the heat, and stir in the dissolved tapioca starch. Boil until the soup has thickened and is no longer cloudy, about 1 minute; remove from the heat. Pour the egg into the soup in a thin line, and gently stir the egg in a figure 8 shape, making sure not to overmix the egg too much. Sprinkle the soup with the chopped onions, sesame oil, and white pepper, and serve.

Description: 
Trust me, one egg is enough to make a sumptuous Egg Drop Soup! The problem I find with egg drop soup recipes is that the timing for the egg drop is never right, so the egg never separates into true ribbons. My Chinese father taught me the trick to this soup, which I now pass to you!
