Ingredients:
2 cups fresh bread crumbs
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1 teaspoon minced fresh dill weed
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (14.75 ounce) can salmon, drained
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, place 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs. Set aside remaining 1/2 cup. Add eggs, parsley, green onions, dill weed, lemon juice and black pepper. Mix well.
Add salmon and mix with hands, breaking up salmon into small pieces. Form into 8 patties; each about 1/2 inch thick.
Place remaining 1/2 cup bread crumbs on a plate and dip both sides of the salmon cakes into crumbs.
Chill cakes for 1 hour.
In a large skillet, melt butter. Fry salmon cakes over medium heat for about 3 minutes or until golden brown and crisp.  Turn, adding more butter if necessary, and fry about 3 minutes on other side.
