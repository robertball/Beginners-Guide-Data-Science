Ingredients:
5 cups cauliflower, chopped
3 cups potatoes, diced
4 cups fat free chicken broth
4 cups water
10 cloves garlic, smashed
3 tsp salt
1 tsp white pepper
1 tsp dried thyme

Directions:
In a large pot, add the potatoes and cauliflower. Add chicken broth and water, adding more water if needed to cover the potatoes and cauliflower.
Bring to a boil over high heat. Turn the heat down to medium and add garlic, salt, pepper and thyme.
Cover and simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until potatoes and cauliflower are soft.
Remove from heat. Allow the mixture to cool for a few minutes, then using a hand wand, potato masher or heavy whisk, mash the contents until pureed.
Return the pot to medium heat. Let contents simmer for an additional 30 minutes. Adjust seasonings to taste.

Description: 
This recipe is the result of my desire to lighten one of my favorite comfort foods - potato soup. Cauliflower adds bulk and nutrition, while the potato keeps the strong flavor of the cauliflower from overwhelming the dish.
