Ingredients:
2 cups water
5 tablespoons brown sugar
5 tablespoons vinegar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons corn syrup
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon salt
MEAT LOAF:
2 eggs
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 pound ground pork

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the first seven ingredients; bring to a boil.  Cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened; set aside.
In a large bowl, combine the first six meat loaf ingredients; add 2/3 cup of the reserved sauce and mix well.  Crumble beef and pork over mixture and mix well.  Pat into two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans.  Pour the remaining sauce over loaves.  Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 50 minutes or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees (72 degrees C).  Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
