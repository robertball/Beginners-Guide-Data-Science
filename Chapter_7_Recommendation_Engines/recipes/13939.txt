Description: 
A quick side dish with an Asian flair. A change from fried rice. Other vegetables may be used in place of or along with the green onion and bean sprouts, including sliced mushrooms, pea pods, slivered carrots, etc. Any large vegetables should be precooked in a little oil and then added to the pasta mixture.
