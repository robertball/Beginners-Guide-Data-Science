In a bowl, beat together the egg and milk. Stir in cheese, oats, onion, and salt. Add beef and mix well.
Shape into eight loaves; place in a greased 13x9x2 inch baking dish.

Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or until the meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees.

Description: 
I've made this recipe multiple times and I always use this as a base, as I always try to make it different by adding new flavors to it.  I recommend adding 1/2 cup chopped bell pepper and 1 1/2 tsp worcestershire sauce.  A little extra cheese never hurt anyone either. You could also experiment by adding your choice of liquid smoke and grilling these in foil packs.....
