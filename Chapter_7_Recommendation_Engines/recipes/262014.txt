Ingredients:
3 pounds beef short ribs
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 Asian pear, cored and diced
1/2 small onion
2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic
1 tablespoon chopped ginger
2 green onions, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
1 tablespoon honey
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Place ribs in a bowl and cover with water; soak until water turns pink, about 1 hour. Drain and rinse in cold water.
Combine soy sauce, Asian pear, onion, garlic, and ginger in a food processor. Pulse until smooth.
Combine green onions, sesame oil, brown sugar, sesame seeds, honey, and black pepper in a large bowl; mix well. Add ribs and coat thoroughly with the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cook ribs on the grill until slightly charred and tender, about 4 minutes per side.

Description: 
On my half-day off, I decided to relax by making my favorite Korean meat dish, kalbi (marinated short ribs). Serve with white rice and kimchi. If serving small children (and wanting to prevent a mess), it's best to cut the meat off the bone and slice into bite-sized pieces. The dark marinade can stain clothes, so be careful.
