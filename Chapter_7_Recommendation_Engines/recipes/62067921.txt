Ingredients:
Chicken and Broccoli Dijon
1 pound sliced chicken breasts, or 3 half-breasts, sliced
salt and pepper to taste
4 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
1/2 cup sliced green onion
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
16 ounces fresh precut broccoli,
16 ounces frozen tortellini
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup heavy cream (or 1 cup evaporated skim milk combined with 2 teaspoons flour)
Salt and pepper to taste
Freshly grated Parmesan or Romano cheese

Directions:
Place a large pot of water over high heat and bring to a boil.
Place chicken pieces in a medium bowl, season with salt and pepper, and coat with the Dijon mustard. Saute the chicken in the butter or margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat, until chicken is no longer pink. Lower the heat and stir in the green onions and garlic, sauteing about 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, add the linguini to the boiling water and cook for 3 minutes. Add the broccoli and cook until done.
Add the broth and cream to the chicken mixture and heat thoroughly.
Drain the pasta and broccoli and return them to the large pot. Pour in the chicken and sauce, tossing to coat. Season to taste with salt, pepper and Parmesan or Romano cheese.
Makes 6 servings.
