Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/4 cups water
8 ounces pearl (Israeli) couscous
1 teaspoon garlic base (such as Better Than Bouillon® Roasted Garlic Base)
1/2 cup sliced portobello mushrooms

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select the Saute function. Melt butter and add garlic. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add water, couscous, and garlic base. Stir to combine. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Fluff with a fork and add sliced mushrooms. Select Saute function and quickly stir the couscous for 3 to 5 minutes. The goal is to warm the mushrooms, but not to the point of softening.

Description: 
This quick side dish is cooked in the Instant Pot®. Feel free to add in Parmesan cheese if desired, but it's amazing on its own! I don't add salt or pepper, as the ingredients seem to have enough flavor on their own.
