1 C Walnut Pieces
1/2 tsp. Garlic Powder
Dash Salt
Dash Ground Pepper
1 Egg
1 1/4 lb. Boneless Skinless Chicken Tenders/Strips OR Breasts cut into strips

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 450 degrees. Lay a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with non-stick cooking spray
Put cereal and walnuts into a gallon-sized zip-lock plastic bag. Press air out of bag and close.
Using a rolling pin, press and roll over ingredients in the bag until cereal is finely crushed and walnuts are in rice-sized pieces.
Add garlic powder, salt, and pepper to bag. Shake to mix.
Crack egg into medium-sized bowl and beat.
Dip chicken strips in egg to coat. Let extra egg drip off, then put in bag one at a time and gently shake until chicken is covered in walnut/cereal coating.
