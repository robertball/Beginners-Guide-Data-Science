Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) jar HERDEZ® Tomatilla Verde Mexican Cooking Sauce, divided
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
2 tomatoes, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and chopped
1 1/2 cups refried beans
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
4 flour tortillas
1 teaspoon butter
4 eggs, or more to taste

Directions:
Combine half the cooking sauce and sour cream in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Mix remaining cooking sauce with tomatoes, onion, and avocado in a separate bowl. Set aside.
Heat refried beans with 1 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese in a saucepan over medium-low heat until cheese is melted and bean mixture is hot and smooth, about 5 minutes.
Lay a tortilla out onto a serving plate; spread tortilla with a generous spoonful of refried bean mixture, leaving about 1 inch of tortilla bare around the edge.
Melt butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat until hot and foamy; gently crack eggs into the hot butter. Cook until egg whites are firm on the bottom and starting to set on top, about 3 minutes; gently flip and cook eggs on the other side until whites are set, about 2 more minutes.
Place a fried egg into the center of the tortilla on top of bean mixture. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of remaining Cheddar cheese over the egg. Spoon a ring of tomato mixture onto the bare edge of the tortilla; drizzle egg with sour cream mixture. Repeat with remaining ingredients; serve immediately.

Description: 
One of my favorite breakfasts! The HERDEZ® sauce was fun to work with and added a nice little kick to the flavors. You can substitute black beans for the refried beans and it would be just as tasty!
