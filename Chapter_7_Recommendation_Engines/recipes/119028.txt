Description: 
Laura LeMay from Deerfield Beach, Florida recalls, 'I created this recipe a few years ago when I was craving something different to do with hard-cooked eggs. I combined three of my favorite foods - bacon, eggs and cheese - in these deviled eggs. I've shared them at parties and have received many compliments on their eggstra special taste.'
