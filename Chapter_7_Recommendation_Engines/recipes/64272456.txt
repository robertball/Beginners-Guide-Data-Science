Ingredients:
3 Tbs. olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
2 carrots, diced
6 oz. ham or dried beef, cubed
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
2 32 oz. containers low sodium chicken broth
2 tsp. chili garlic paste (from an Asian food store), optional
2 cans great northern beans, navy beans or cannellini beans
freeze dried refried beans, optional

Directions:
Saute the onion, carrot, garlic, red bell pepper and meat in the olive oil for 10 minutes.  Add the remaining ingredients and simmer for 45-60 minutes until all vegetables are tender.  Add the dried beans for thickening, if desired, and the red chili garlic paste for spiciness. Use a whisk to stir the dried beans into the simmering soup, so that they don't clump up.
