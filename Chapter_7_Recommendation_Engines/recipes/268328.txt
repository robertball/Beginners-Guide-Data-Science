Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups teff flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 cups lukewarm water
1 teaspoon oil, or as needed

Directions:
Combine all-purpose and teff flours in a bowl. Add salt and mix well. Gradually add water, stirring slowly with a wooden spoon until incorporated.
Cover bowl with a clean dish towel and leave to ferment at room temperature, 4 to 5 days. Gently agitate the mixture every morning; mixture will appear bubbly and smell sour as it ferments.
Cook the injera on the 4th or 5th day. Mix batter until smooth. Lightly oil a large pan over medium heat. Add a scoop of batter in a spiral motion, working from the outside to the inside of the pan. Cover and cook until bubbles appear on the surface and steam rises off the top, about 30 seconds.
Transfer injera to a platter and repeat with remaining batter, adding oil to the pan as needed.
