Ingredients:
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 (16 ounce) New York strip steaks
Chimichurri Sauce:
8 cloves garlic, peeled
1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves
1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Mix together 3 tablespoons olive oil, cumin, red pepper flakes, oregano and salt to taste in a bowl and coat the steaks in the mixture.
Heat a large frying pan on high heat and fry the steaks on each side for 2 to 3 minutes until they are browned.
Place two 1 1/2 to 2 feet long sheets of Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil on a table and place each steak in the center of the foil and fold up the ends and the outside of the foil to create a packet.
Bake the steak for 10 minutes for a medium-rare internal temperature. Add 5 more minutes of baking to achieve a medium internal temperature.
Remove the steaks from the packets and let them rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.
Combine the garlic, parsley, cilantro, red wine vinegar, remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and salt and pepper in a food processor and process on high speed until it becomes like a paste.
Serve the steak alongside the Chimichurri Sauce.
