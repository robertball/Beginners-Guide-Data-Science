Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 package yellow cake mix
2 eggs, divided
2 packages, 8 ounces each, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 tbsp zest and 3 tbsp juice from lemon
2 1/2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Line a 13x9 inch pan with foil with ends extending. In a large bowl, melt butter in the microwave.  Add cake mix and one egg. Beat well with an electric mixer. Press 2/3 of the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan.
Beat softened cream cheese and sugar with a mixer until well blended. Add last egg, zest and juice and mix well. Pour over the crust. Top with berries. Pinch small pieces of remaining cake mix between your fingers; press lightly into the cream cheese layer.
Bake at 350 degrees for 55 minutes to one hour, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool completely. Use foil to lift from the pan. Cut into bars. Keep refrigerated.
