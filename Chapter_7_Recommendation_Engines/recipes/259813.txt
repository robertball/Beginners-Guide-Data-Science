Ingredients:
6 cups fresh raspberries
1 1/4 cups white sugar, divided
1/4 teaspoon lemon juice
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 1/2 cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste

Directions:
Combine raspberries, 1/2 cup sugar, and lemon juice in a saucepan over low heat. Cook and stir until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes.
Press raspberry mixture through a strainer into a bowl. Discard seeds. Refrigerate raspberry puree.
Combine remaining 3/4 cup sugar, heavy cream, and milk in a saucepan over low heat. Cook and stir until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Stir in vanilla bean paste. Pour into a bowl and refrigerate until cool, about 1 hour.
Pour cream mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze to soft-serve consistency according to manufacturer's instructions, 15 to 20 minutes. Pour into a freezer-safe container; swirl in the raspberry mixture. Freeze until firm, 8 hours to overnight.

Description: 
After finding wild raspberries, I wanted to make a dessert that hubby would be able to eat. He cannot have seeds and I had some heavy cream to use so it wouldn't go bad. Playing around with the ingredients I had on hand led to this incredible ice cream.
