Description: 
This is one of the dishes Grandma served to our family during the holidays. Now, when the family gathers and I prepare this for my grandchildren, memories of those special times at Grandma's house fill my mind. I usually double this recipe, because the leftovers are fabulous when warmed in the microwave.
