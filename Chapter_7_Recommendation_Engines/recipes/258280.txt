Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) package campanelle pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste
4 cloves garlic, sliced
2 (3 ounce) fillets salmon fillets
2 cups frozen peas
1 cup diced sugar snap peas
1 cup sliced green onions
1/4 cup stone-ground mustard
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon fresh dill, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook campanelle in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until sizzling. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add salmon; cook until browned and flaking apart, about 5 minutes per side.
Transfer salmon fillets to a bowl with pan drippings. Pour frozen peas on top; let thaw as salmon cools, about 10 minutes. Add campanelle pasta, sugar snap peas, green onions, mustard, lemon juice, and dill; toss gently. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
My children just love tuna salad, but I needed something to do with the salmon I had in the fridge and I hate mayo.  So, this was my compromise. This recipe is easy and will keep them coming back for seconds.
