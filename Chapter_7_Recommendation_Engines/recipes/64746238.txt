Ingredients:
1 lb. Radishes, halved
1 Tbsp Olive oil
½ tsp Salt
¼ tsp Pepper
3-4 Garlic cloves, minced
2 Tbsp Chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
In a bowl, combine your radishes, olive oil, salt, pepper, and minced garlic.
Spread radishes out on a large tray lined with parchment paper. (Be sure to give them enough space so they get nice and crisp!)
Bake for 20-25 minutes, and be sure to toss them every 10 minutes or so to make sure they don’t burn.
Once they’re golden brown, and you can easily slide a fork into the center — pull them out.
Top with fresh chopped parsley, serve, and enjoy!

Description: 
This is my go-to radish recipe. It’s a new spin on radishes that’s popping up on menus everywhere  and it’s bound to be the star of any plate.
Plus, while you get to enjoy the delicious flavor and you will have the chance to soak in the incredible nutrients. Every time I make this dish for friends and family..they ALWAYS think they’re about to bite into a potato! But unlike potatoes, these radishes are low in carbs, calories.
