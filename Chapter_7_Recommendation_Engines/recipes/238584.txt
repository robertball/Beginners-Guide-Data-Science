Ingredients:
5 potatoes, sliced 1/8-inch thick
1 onion, sliced
2 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Spread a piece of aluminum foil on a work surface. Arrange potatoes, onion, bacon, and garlic in the middle of the foil. Drizzle olive oil over potato mixture and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Wrap foil around potato mixture to form a packet.
Place packet on the preheated grill and cook until potatoes are tender and bacon is cooked, about 15 minutes. Carefully open packet by slicing foil with a knife.

Description: 
Packet cooking is an excellent idea. By using your barbeque to prepare even your side dishes, it keeps your kitchen cool during hot weather and cleanup is a cinch. I hope you enjoy this simple, easy side dish!
