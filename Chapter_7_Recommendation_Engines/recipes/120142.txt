Ingredients:
6 cups water
1/2 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
4 bacon strips
3/4 cup Italian salad dressing

Directions:
In a saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add beans; cover and cook for 3 minutes. Drain and set aside. Cut bacon in half lengthwise; place on a microwave-safe plate.
Microwave on high for 2-1/2 to 3 minutes or until edges curl. Place four or five beans on each bacon strip; wrap bacon around beans and tie in a knot.
Place bundles in an 8-in. square baking dish. Drizzle with salad dressing. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until beans are crisp-tender. Broil 4 in. from the heat for 2-3 minutes or until bacon is crisp.

Description: 
To make green beans fit the new baby theme dinner, I baked them in little bundles, secured with strips of bacon. A few minutes under the broiler makes the bacon crispy. The dish gets its tang from Italian dressing, which the beans are baked in. -Ame Andrews, Little Rock, Arkansas
