Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 green onion, chopped
2 teaspoons water
1 teaspoon butter
1 (7 inch) prebaked Italian bread shell crust
1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup pizza sauce
12 slices pepperoni sausage

Directions:
In a small bowl, whisk the eggs, onion and water. In a small skillet, heat butter until hot. Add egg mixture; cook and stir over medium heat until eggs are partially set.
Place the crust on an ungreased baking sheet. Sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons cheese and drizzle with about 2 tablespoons pizza sauce. Top with scrambled egg mixture. Drizzle with remaining pizza sauce; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Top with pepperoni. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until crust is slightly crisp. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
