Ingredients:
1 teaspoon shortening, or as needed
1 (18 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 (15 ounce) can canned solid-pack pumpkin
1 3/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips
2 eggs
1 tablespoon milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets with shortening.
Whisk cake mix, cinnamon together in a bowl, breaking up any lumps. Beat pumpkin, eggs, milk, and vanilla into the cake mix mixture; stir in chocolate chips until evenly distributed through the dough.
Drop rounded tablespoons of dough 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies begin to brown and spring back when touched. Cool 2 minutes on the baking sheet before to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
As a child, every year for Christmas my 'Big Nana' gave me a pair of homemade mittens with quarters in them and a plate of pumpkin chip cookies. I always ate the cookies cold from the fridge. I looked forward to them every year and this recipe tastes just like the ones I remember.
