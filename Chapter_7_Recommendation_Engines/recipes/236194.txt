Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed
1 (8 ounce) package tempeh, cut into 1/8-inch thick strips
2 dashes tamari, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook tempeh in the hot oil until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drizzle tamari over cooked tempeh.

Submitter:

Description: 
Easiest way to prepare tempeh. Pile it on a BLT (or, more accurately, a TLT).  Even non-vegetarians will (maybe) like this. Soy sauce can be used in place of tamari if desired. Stores well in a covered container in the refrigerator.
