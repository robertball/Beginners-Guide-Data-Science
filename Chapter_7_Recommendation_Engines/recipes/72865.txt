Ingredients:
2 cups shredded carrots
2 eggs
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 medium onion, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 clove garlic, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
6 cups soft bread crumbs
4 cups whole wheat flake cereal, crumbled

Directions:
Preheat the oven  to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place carrots into a bowl, cover, and heat in the microwave until tender, 2 to 3 minutes.
In a large bowl, stir together the eggs, mayonnaise, onion, olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and carrots. Mix in bread crumbs until evenly blended. Shape into 12 patties. Pour the cereal onto a plate, and dip the patties into the cereal to coat. Place the patties on a greased baking sheet.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, turning once, until golden brown.

Description: 
This wonderful meatless dish is quite tasty, and a great alternative to beef burgers when served on a bun with tomato and lettuce with mayo or stone ground mustard.  Good served hot or cold. We have used these as main entrees or served a smaller version as side dishes.  You may want to experiment with different spices that appeal to your family or even different vegetables such as zucchini. Cheese is another tasty add-in.
