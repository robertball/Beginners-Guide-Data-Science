Ingredients:
4 cups reduced sodium soy sauce
3 cups white sugar
a few dashes of onion powder to taste
a few dashes of garlic powder to taste
dash of Cajun seasoning (optional)
1 teaspoon black food color paste (not liquid)
4 lb bag of chicken wings

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375
Mix all the ingredients (except the wings) in a bowl, taking time to be sure the black food coloring paste completely dissolves.  Carefully open the bag of chicken wings so that it will seal again.  Pour in the liquid, seal the bag, and lay it flat in the fridge.  Marinate for at least 2 hours, turning every so often so that every piece gets coated and dyed.
Pour everything into a 9x13 pan and bake for 15 minutes.  Turn the wings and bake for another 15 - 20 minutes.
Take the wings out of the sauce and place them in a bowl or on a platter labeled "Bat Wings".  If some of the skin tears, the flesh underneath may turn pink, purple, or green.  This is perfectly normal and part of the fun!
