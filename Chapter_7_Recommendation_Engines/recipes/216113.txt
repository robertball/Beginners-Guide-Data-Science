Description: 
A co-worker brought this and I could not believe it wasn't pork! The ingredients surprised me...but this is a fab slow cooker recipe!  Not exactly low cal...but full of protein for sure. Tweaked a bit to make it mine. Can you say Keeper? Make your sandwiches with coleslaw if you're from the south! The recipe freezes very well.
