Ingredients:
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup canola oil
1/4 cup honey
1/2 cup minced green onion
1 1/4 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
12 white mushrooms, halved
12 thick slices bacon, halved crosswise
20 cherry tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained
1 green bell pepper, cut into bite-sized pieces
12 (10 inch) skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes if wood or bamboo

Directions:
Whisk cider vinegar, soy sauce, oil, honey, and green onion together in a large bowl. Add chicken and mushrooms; toss to coat. Chill, covered, for 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat (375 to 450 degrees F (190 to 230 degrees C)).
Drain chicken and mushrooms over a small saucepan. Bring marinade to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer for 10 minutes. Pour 1/2 into a small bowl for basting kebabs.
Thread chicken, mushrooms, bacon, cherry tomatoes, pineapple, and green pepper onto skewers.
Lightly oil grill grate. Grill kebabs, turning occasionally and brushing with reserved marinade, until chicken is no longer pink and bacon is crisp, 12 to 15 minutes. Serve with remaining marinade.
