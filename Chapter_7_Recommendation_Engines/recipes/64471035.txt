2 eggs
1 egg yolk
50 grams of shredded pecorino cheese
50 grams cubed pancetta

Directions:
Cut the zucchini using a spiralizer or mandolin cutter.
Whisk the eggs and the egg yolks together in a small bowl. Then add the cheese and mix. Set aside.
In a large wok or skillet, heat the oil and add the pancetta. Saute until cooked through but not crispy. Add the raw zoodles and saut√© until the zucchini is warm but not soft and the pancetta is slightly crispy. Turn off the heat source and add the whisked egg mixture stirring to evenly distribute the sauce covering the zoodles uniformly. Serve immediately with the black pepper and ground Parmigiano cheese on top.
