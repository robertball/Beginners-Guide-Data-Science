Description: 
My mother's very best cookie recipe.  I grew up eating the raw cookie dough! I use the Crisco sticks for this recipe since they are so easy to use. I switch up what kind chocolate chips I use, but like to use half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate. I use a small ice cream scoop for uniform cookies.  I am now creating the homemade cookie memories for my own daughter!
