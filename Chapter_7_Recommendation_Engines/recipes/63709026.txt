Ingredients:
1/2 cup sugar
2 tbsp water
4 1/4 tsp salt, divided
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
4 10 oz NY strip steaks
2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
3 ears sweet corn
1 small red onion, cut into 1/2 inch slices
1/4 cup fresh basil

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium high.  Brush with oil.
Heat sugar, water, and 1/4 tsp salt in a small saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat to medium high and boil until the mixture turns light brown, about 5 minutes.  Turn off heat and whisk in vinegar until smooth.
Combine brown sugar, remaining salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a bowl.  Press 1 tbsp rub on each side of each steak.
Stir butter into remaining rub and brush onto corn.
Grill steaks, covered, for 3 minutes per side (for medium rare).  Remove steaks from grill, tent with foil, and let rest 5 minutes.  Grill corn and onions, covered, turning often, until slightly charred, 6-8 minutes.
Cut corn from cobs, chop onion, and toss together with basil.
Top each steak with corn mixture and drizzle with sugar and vinegar sauce.
