Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds Italian turkey sausage links, casings removed
1 large onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
6 1/2 cups reduced-sodium beef broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
2 cups thinly sliced carrots
1 cup thinly sliced celery
1 cup ketchup
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
2 cups sliced zucchini
1 medium green pepper, chopped
2 cups frozen cheese tortellini
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a Dutch oven or large saucepan, cook the sausage, onion and garlic over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Add the broth, tomatoes, carrots, celery, ketchup and Italian seasoning. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
Add the zucchini and green pepper; cook 5-7 minutes longer or until green pepper is tender. Stir in tortellini and parsley. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; cook, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until tortellini is tender. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese just before serving.

Description: 
We take turns cooking Sunday meals at my church, and this soup is always popular. It's a smart way to use zucchini, and people seem to enjoy the cheese tortellini as well as the Italian turkey sausage. -Pamela Smith of Flushing, New York
