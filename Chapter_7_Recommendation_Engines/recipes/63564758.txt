Ingredients:
2 lbs plum tomatoes, cored and halved
2 medium carrots, sliced 1/2 inch thick
1 large or two small parsnips, sliced 1/2 inch thick (you can leave this out or sub more carrots)
1 small red onion, thickly sliced
8 garlic cloves
1 1/2 TBL extra virgin olive oil
2-3 cups low sodium chicken broth, vegetable broth, low-sodium tomato juice, or water
3 cups cooked Black Beans (from about 1 1/4 cups dry or 2 15oz cans no or low sodium black beans rinsed and drained)
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
2 tsp balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup fresh chopped basil leaves

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400
Place the tomatoes, carrots, parsnips, onion, and garlic in a large bowl. Add 1 TBL of the olive oil and stir to coat well. Transfer the vegetables to a shallow baking dish and bake until the vegetables are softened and browned in spots, about 1 hour.
Transfer the vegetables to the work bowl of a food processor. Pour 2 cups of chicken broth into the baking dish and use a wooden spoon to scrape any browned bits from its bottom (place the pan over los heat if necessary to help scrape the bottom clean). Transfer the stock and drippings to the food processor.
Process the vegetables until smooth. Transfer the puree to a saucepan. Stir in the beans, oregano, salt, and pepper. Add up to 1 more cup of broth if necessary to thin the soup. Bring to a simmer and simmer for 15 minutes.
Stir in the vinegar, remaining 1/2 TBL of olive oi, and basil. Divide among four bowls and serve!
