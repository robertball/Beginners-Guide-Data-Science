Ingredients:
4 cups shredded cabbage
1 large sweet onion, thinly sliced
4 garlic cloves, minced
4 tilapia fillets, or any other white fish (6 ounces each)
1/4 cup pitted Greek olives, chopped
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
4 tsp olive oil

Directions:
Cut heavy-duty foil (or parchment paper) into four 18x12-in. pieces; place 1 cup cabbage on each. Top with onion, garlic, tilapia, olives, cheese, salt and pepper; drizzle with oil.
Fold foil over fish. Bring edges of paper together on all sides and crimp to seal, forming a packet. Repeat with remaining packets. Place on baking sheets.
Bake at 450Â° for 12-15 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Open packets carefully to allow steam to escape.

Description: 
My wife loves seafood and we both agree that this is one of the best things we have ever eaten. It is so very easy and if you can eat it right out of the foil, so clean-up is a breeze! There only two of us now so she gets to take the leftovers for lunch the next day.
