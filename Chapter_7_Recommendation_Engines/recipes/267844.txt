Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups mashed very ripe bananas
1/4 cup low-fat buttermilk
4 egg whites
1 1/2 tablespoons grapeseed oil
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats
1/2 cup sucralose and sugar blend for baking (such as Splenda® sugar blend)
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat an 8x4-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
Combine bananas, buttermilk, egg whites, and oil in a medium bowl. Mix well.
Combine flour, oats, sucralose blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center; add banana mixture all at once and mix well.
Reserve 1/8 cup pecans and stir the remainder into the batter. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle reserved pecans on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes.

Description: 
A modified version of banana-chocolate chip bread from the American Diabetes Association's 2004 'Healthy Calendar Diabetic Cooking,' this version cuts carbs and fat even more by using Splenda® baking mix, better oil and less of it, and pecans instead of chocolate chips.
