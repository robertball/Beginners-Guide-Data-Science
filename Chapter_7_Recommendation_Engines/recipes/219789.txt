Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
2 cups water
2 chicken bouillon cubes
2 (14 ounce) cans pumpkin puree
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 tablespoons orange juice
1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the melted butter until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir the water and chicken bouillon cubes into the mixture; cook and stir until the bouillon cubes have dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir the pumpkin puree, coconut milk, ginger, orange juice, pumpkin pie spice, and chili powder into the liquid. Bring the soup to a simmer, and cook until heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour the soup into a blender pitcher to no more than half full. Hold down the lid of the blender firmly in place. Start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth, and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup in the pot.
Return the pureed soup to medium heat; bring to a simmer and cook another 10 minutes.

Description: 
I modified another Allrecipes pumpkin soup recipe past recognition and decided to add it here to share. It has a little bit of a kick to it from the chili powder, and the orange juice and pumpkin pie spice really bring out the flavors.  It was originally based on 'Daddy's Pumpkin Soup.' I think some lemon juice or orange zest would do as well for the orange juice.
