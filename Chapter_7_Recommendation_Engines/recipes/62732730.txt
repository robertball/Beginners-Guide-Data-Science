Ingredients:
3/4 cup milk ( I used soy milk)
2 tablespoons white vinegar ( I used lemon juice)
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar (1 T vs. 2)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
2 tablespoons butter, melted
cooking spray

Directions:
Combine milk with vinegar in a medium bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to "sour".
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk egg and butter into "soured" milk. Pour the flour mixture into the wet ingredients and whisk until lumps are gone.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side.
