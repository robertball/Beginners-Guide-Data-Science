Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
3/4 cup sugar
1 egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon rum extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
FROSTING:
1/3 cup butter, softened
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon rum extract
1 tablespoon half-and-half cream

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add egg and extracts; mix well. Combine the flour, nutmeg and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture.
On a lightly floured surface, shape dough into 1/2-in.-wide logs. Cut into 2-in. pieces. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 11-14 minutes or until center is set and edges are lightly browned. Cool for 2 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
For frosting, in a mixing bowl, combine the butter, confectioners' sugar, extracts and enough cream to achieve a spreading consistency. Frost cooled cookies.

Description: 
Every bite of these cookies tastes like a sip of eggnog, so it's no wonder we make them each Christmas. Other cookie recipes come and go, but this is a timeless classic.
