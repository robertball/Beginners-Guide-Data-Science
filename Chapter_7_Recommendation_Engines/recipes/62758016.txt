Ingredients:
1 1/2	sleeves  Ritz crackers  (50 crackers), pulsed in food processor to coarse crumbs
2/3	cup  milk
2	large  eggs
1/2	cup  mayonnaise
8	slices  hearty white sandwich bread
6	slices  deli American cheese
34	quarts  peanut or vegetable o

Directions:
1. ASSEMBLE SANDWICHES Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread cracker crumbs in shallow dish. Whisk milk and eggs in medium bowl. Spread mayonnaise on 1 side of each slice bread. Arrange 1½ slices cheese on 4 slices bread and top with remaining 4 slices bread, mayonnaise side facing cheese. Cut each sandwich diagonally into quarters. One at a time, dip sandwich quarters into egg mixture, then coat with cracker crumbs, pressing to adhere. Refrigerate on prepared baking sheet until set, about 1 hour.
2. FRY SANDWICHES Pour oil into large Dutch oven until it measures 2 inches deep. Heat oil to 375 degrees over medium-high heat. Fry half of chilled sandwich quarters until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towel-lined plate and repeat with remaining sandwich quarters. Serve.

Description: 
This recipe didn't specify a brand of cracker, but we like Ritz here. Try dipping the sandwiches in ketchupa Frenchee fanatic told us that's how she ate them growing up in Oklahoma.
