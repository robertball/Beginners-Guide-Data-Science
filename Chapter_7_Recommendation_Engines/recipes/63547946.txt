Ingredients:
1-1/2 pounds cubed beef stew meat
2 Tbs all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1-1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1-1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
2 large potatoes, cubed
1/2 tablespoon dried parsley
3/4 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 cup boiling water
1 (1 ounce) envelopes onion soup mix
1-1/2 tablespoons butter
1-1/2 large onions, diced & sauté
1 tablespoons minced garlic, sauté
1/2 cup burgundy wine
1 (6 ounce) packages fresh button mushrooms, halved
1/2 cup frozen green beans
1/4 cup frozen corn
3 Tbs warm water
1-1/2 tablespoons cornstarch

Directions:
Toss the beef, flour, and salt in a sealable bag until the beef is coated.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Combine the beef and Worcestershire sauce in the skillet; cook until the beef is evenly browned on all sides; transfer to a slow cooker, but do not clean the skillet. Add the carrots, potatoes, parsley, and pepper to the slow cooker.
Combine the boiling water and soup mix in a small bowl; add to slow cooker.
Melt the butter in the skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onion and garlic (salt to taste) in the melted butter until soft; transfer the onion and garlic to the slow cooker and return the skillet to the heat. Combine the wine and mushrooms to the skillet; cook until the mushrooms begin to absorb the wine; pour the mixture into the slow cooker.
Place the cover on the slow cooker and set to High; cook for one hour. Reduce heat to Low and cook until the beef is fork-tender, 6 to 8 hours. Add corn and green beans two hours before finished cooking. Whisk together the warm water and cornstarch; stir into the stew; cook uncovered until stew thickens, about 15 minutes.
