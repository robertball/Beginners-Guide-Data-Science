Ingredients:
1 Tbsp olive oil
7 oz kielbasa, thinly sliced
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
2 16 oz packages of frozen perogi (I use potato and onion but any will do)
12 oz red cabbage, cored and thinly sliced
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1 16 oz can sauerkraut, drained
2 Tbsp whole-grain mustard
1 cup fresh flat leaf parsley, chopped
6 oz cheddar cheese, grated

Directions:
Heat oven to 450.  Bring large pot of water to boil
Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat.  Add kielbasa and cook until browned on one side, about 3 minutes.  Stir in onions and cook covered, stirring occasionally, until tender, 6 to 7 minutes.
Boil pierogies according to package directions, drain.
Add cabbage and cider to onions and cook, tossing occasionally, until they begin to soften, about 4 minutes.  Stir in sauerkraut, mustard and parsley.
Arrange 1/3 of pierogies on bottom of 7x11 baking dish.  Top with 1/3 of cabbage mixture and then 1/2 cup cheese.  Repeat twice and bake until cheese melts, 8 to 10 minutes.
