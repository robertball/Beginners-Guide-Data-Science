Ingredients:
1 yellow cake mix
1 egg
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 8 ounce package cream cheese, softened
3 eggs
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 15 ounce can of pumpkin puree
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 16 ounce box confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan.
In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine cake mix, egg and butter and mix well.  Pat into the bottom of prepared pan and set aside.
Still using an electric mixer, beat cream cheese until smooth; add eggs, vanilla, pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice. Dump in confectioners' sugar and beat well. Reduce speed of mixer and slowly pour in butter.  Mix well. Pour filling onto cake mixture and spread evenly.
Bake for 40-50 minutes.  Don't be afraid to make a judgement call on the cooking time, because oven temperatures can vary. You want the center to be a little gooey, so don't bake it past that point!
Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely. Cut into squares.
