Ingredients:
1/4 cup coarse sea salt
2 Tbsp chipotle sauce from a jar of canned chipotles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 240 degrees.
Mix the salt and chipotle sauce until well combined. Spread it out evenly on a small baking sheet lined with foil.
Place the baking sheet in the oven for 30 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and stir the salt occasionally until it is cool.
Once it is cool enough to handle, use your fingers to break apart any large chunks
The salt will keep indefinitely stored in a cool, dry place, a pepper grinder works great.
