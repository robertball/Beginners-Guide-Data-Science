Ingredients:
1 pound goat cheese
1 cup mixture of finely diced carrot, celery and onion
1 package frozen kataifi dough, defrosted
Unsalted butter, melted

Directions:
Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
In a bowl, mix the cheese and vegetables together. Set aside.
Pull off a piece of kataifi, and spread it out to measure 1 x 4 inches. Brush it with melted butter. Roll some of the cheese mixture into a 1 x 1/2-inch cylinder, and wrap it up in the dough. Repeat with the remaining filling and kataifi.
Bake on a baking sheet for about 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and serve warm.

Description: 
Kataifi is just shredded phyllo dough. This was one of the hors d’oeuvres at the tribute dinner honoring Emeril Lagasse at the Loews Miami Beach in 2009. We chose this as a vegetarian option, but it’s really the perfect canapé: it’s crunchy and bite-size, and the warm, tangy, salty goat cheese simply explodes in your mouth. And it goes so well with Champagne!
