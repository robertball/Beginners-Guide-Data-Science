Ingredients:
4 cups water
2 1/2 cups chicken broth
4 tablespoons chicken soup base
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 large carrots, finely chopped
4 potatoes, peeled and diced
1 large onion, diced
2 stalks celery, finely chopped
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 cup mayonnaise
8 ounces processed cheese food (eg. Velveeta)
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese
1/4 cup dry potato flakes

Directions:
In a large stock pot, combine water, chicken broth, chicken soup base, black pepper, carrots, diced potatoes, and onions.  Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat.  Simmer 15 minutes, or until vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally.
Add celery and red bell pepper, and simmer for 5 minutes.
Gradually add mayonnaise to hot soup, whisking until smooth. Reduce heat to medium low.  Gradually stir in processed cheese, sharp Cheddar cheese, and Swiss cheese; continue stirring until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.
Mix in potato flakes.  Remove from heat, and let sit for 15 minutes before serving.
