Ingredients:
1 pound 85% lean ground beef
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 small onion, diced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup uncooked long grain rice
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can vegetable broth
2 (1 ounce) packets taco seasoning
1/4 cup chopped cilantro, or to taste
8 (10 inch) burrito-size tortillas, or as needed
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend
2 tomatoes, diced, or more to taste
1 avocado, diced, or more to taste
1/4 cup sour cream, or to taste
2 green onions, chopped, or to taste

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function; if available, select "more" option. Add ground beef, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir beef until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until starting to soften, 1 to 3 minutes more. Add olive oil and rice. Cook and stir until some grains start to turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in beans, tomatoes, broth, and taco seasoning.
Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 7 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Fluff burrito bowl filling with a fork and add cilantro.
Serve filling in tortillas with Mexican cheese blend. Garnish with fresh tomatoes, avocado, sour cream, and green onions.
