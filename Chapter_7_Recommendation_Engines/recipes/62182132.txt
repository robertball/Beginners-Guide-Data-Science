Ingredients:
For Chocolate Mousse:
6 oz. semsisweet baking chocolate: chopped
3 table spoons butter @ room temperature
3 large eggs; separated
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 cup heavy cream, cold
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Chocolate Whipped Topping:
1/2 pint heavy whipping cream
1/3 cup sugar
2 tablespoons powdered sugar
1 pinch salt
2 tablespoons cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon vanilla
(1 bowl must be chilled)

Directions:
Chocolate Mousse:
*Melt the chocolate and butter together (either with a double boiler or over simmering water, stirring with a wooden spoon), then remove from heat once it's smooth, and let cool slightly.
*Grab a wisk and beat the egg yolks into the chocolate, 1 at a time, beating until smooth after each addition. Then set aside.
*In another bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks for. Gradually beat in 1/4 cup of sugar and continue beating until soft peaks form.
*In a chilled bowl, beat the heavy cream until it begins to thicken up. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and the vanilla and continue beating until cream holds soft peaks.
*Now gently fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Then fold in the whipped cream. Take care not to over work the mousse or it will be heavy. Spoon into a chocolate pie crust and put in refrigerator.
Chocolate Whipped Topping
In large bowl, beat the mixture together until you get soft peaks. Spoon on top of the pie and garnish with some finealy chopped chocolate and fresh raspberries.
