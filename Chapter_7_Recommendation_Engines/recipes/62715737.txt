Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil mayonnaise
2 tbsp chopped sundried tomatoes
juice of 1/2 lemon
2 cloves garlic, finely minced
1 tsp chopped fresh rosemary
salt and black pepper
1 pound lean ground chicken
4 whole-wheat or potato buns (or even English muffins), split
2 cups arugula, baby spinach, or mixed greens

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, sundried tomatoes, lemon juice, garlic, and rosemary.  Season with a pinch of salt and black pepper.  Set the aioli aside.
Preheat a grill, grill pan, or cast-iron skillet.  Combine the ground chicken with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper and mix gently.  Without overworking the meat, form into four patties until the chicken just comes together.
When the grill or skillet is hot (if using a skillet add a touch of oil), add the burgers.  Cook on the first side for 5 to 6 minutes, until a nice crust forms.  Flip and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, until the burgers are firm but ever so slightly yielding to the touch and cooked through.  Remove the burgers.  While the grill or pan is hot, toast the buns.
Layer the bottom buns with the arugula, top each with a burger, then slather the aioli over the top of each.  Crown with the bun tops and serve.
