Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 sweet yellow onion (such as Vidalia®), thinly sliced
4 patty pan squash, sliced to 1/2-inch-thick pieces
3 cloves garlic, crushed, or more to taste
1 dash lemon pepper
1 1/2 cups packed fresh spinach (optional)
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 1/2 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat until foaming, 1 to 2 minutes. Saute onion in the olive oil-butter until tender and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add squash and garlic; season with lemon pepper. Saute mixture until squash is easily pierced with a fork, 5 to 6 minutes.
Mix spinach, parsley, and basil into squash mixture; saute until spinach wilts, about 1 minute. Squeeze lemon juice over mixture and sprinkle in Parmesan cheese; stir well. Season mixture with salt and black pepper.

Description: 
Rarely can you find patty pan (aka scalloped) squash in the grocery store. However, many farmers markets have them. In Texas, it seems that every farmers market is overflowing with squash come June. However, if you can't find them, any summer squash will do. I also have made this recipe using yellow squash and zucchini and it was quite delicious. The freshness of the ingredients scream “summer”.
