Ingredients:
5 cups peeled and cubed potatoes
3 eggs
1/3 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons seasoning salt
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1/3 cup chopped celery
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes; cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, and transfer to a large bowl.
Place eggs in a saucepan, and cover completely with cold water. Bring water to a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, and cool. Peel,  chop, and add to potatoes.
In a small bowl, combine lemon juice, oil, sugar, seasoned salt, Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder and black pepper; mix well.  Blend in mayonnaise.  Pour lemon dressing over potatoes, and stir to coat.
Mix in green onions, celery, and parsley.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
