Ingredients:
3/4 cup individually wrapped caramels (such as KraftÂ®), unwrapped
1/4 cup half-and-half
1 cup butter, softened
1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar
1 egg
3/4 teaspoon sea salt
3 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine caramels and half-and-half in a saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring until caramels are melted, about 5 minutes.
Beat butter and brown sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy. Beat in egg and salt. Beat in fluid caramel sauce. Add flour; beat until combined.
Fill a cookie press with the dough and press onto baking sheets, 1 to 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 8 to 10 minutes.
