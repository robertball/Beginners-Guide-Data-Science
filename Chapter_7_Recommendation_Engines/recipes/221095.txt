Description: 
We host a Kentucky Derby Party every year, and have for 10 years. When each guest arrives they are given a real Churchill Downs commemorative mint julep glass to which they then add a self-stick name tag on which they print their name. This serves as their glass, name tag, and souvenir of the party. Many still have one from each year of the party as Churchill Downs produces a new one each year!!!
