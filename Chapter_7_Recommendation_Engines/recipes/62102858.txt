Ingredients:
1 chicken breast, grilled and diced
1.5 cups of cooked broccoli, diced
8 oz. shredded cheddar cheese
1 can cream of chicken soup
1/4 cup of diced white onions
1 - 8 ct. roll of croissants, ready to bake
salt and pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven according to the directions on the roll of croissants. Combine chicken, broccoli, 1/2 of the cheddar cheese, cream of chicken soup and onions in a bowl. Salt and pepper. Roll the croissants between two sheets of wax paper so they are about twice their original size. Place 1 heaping tablespoonful of the mixture at the wide end of each croissant and roll, placing them in a 13"x9" baking dish. Sprinkle with the remaining cheddar cheese and bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
