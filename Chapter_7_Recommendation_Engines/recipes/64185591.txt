Ingredients:
1 12-14lb turkey, rinsed and patted dry
3 tsp kosher salt
1 1/2 tsp black pepper
11 Tbsp butter

1 bay leaf

Directions:
1.  Preheat oven to 350F.
2.  Remove neck, giblets, and gizzards from cavity.
3.  Season turkey with salt and pepper all over skin and inside cavity.  Using fingers, gently lift skin and rub butter underneath.  Stuff turkey with stuffing.  Truss the turkey and place on a rack in the roasting pan.  Cook in oven for 3-3 1/2 hours.
4.  In a saucepan over low heat, combine maple syrup, chicken stock, orange juice, and bay leaf.  Bring to a low simmer, then remove from heat.  Baste turkey every 30 minutes with the maple syrup mixture.
