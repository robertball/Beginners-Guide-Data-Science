Ingredients:
1 cup margarine, softened
1 cup peanut butter
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together the margarine, peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Combine the flour and baking soda; stir into the peanut butter mixture. Mix in chocolate chips. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned at the edges. Allow cookies to cool on the cookie sheets for a minute before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
