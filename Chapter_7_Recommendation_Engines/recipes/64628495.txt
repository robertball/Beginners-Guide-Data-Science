Ingredients:
2 1/8 C flour
1/2 t salt
1/2 t baking soda
12 T butter (1 1/2 sticks, 185g)
1 C brown sugar
1/2 C white sugar
1 large egg
1 large egg yolk
2 t vanilla
2 C chocolate chips (I used semi sweet, buy you can use what ever suits your fancy)

Directions:
1. Melt your butter in the microwave. Add the brown sugar, white sugar, egg, egg yolk, and vanilla to the butter. Whisk it around until well combines.
2. In a separate bowl combine the dry ingredients.
3. Add the butter mixture to the dry ingredient and stir just until combines.
4. Fold in your chocolate chips.
5. Line a 9×13 pan with tin foil. Spray it down with some cooking spray and press your cookie dough into the pan. The tin foil is going to make it super easy to pull these bars out of the pan.
6. Bake at 325 for 24-28 minutes.
7. Let your pan cool on a wire rack for a bit. I didn’t let mine get all the way cool before I cut them, and it worked out fine. I like to eat my cookies warm.
