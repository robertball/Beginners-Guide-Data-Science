Reduce heat to medium. Add the onion. Cook until softened, about 2 minutes.
Add the garlic. Cook 1 minutes more.
Add the flour, stirring until it is fully mixed in.
Add the broth and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer about 5 minutes.
Add the spinach and fold in carefully until wilted.
Add the heavy cream and gnocchi, stir.
Pour the mixture into a 9 x 12 baking pan.
Top with bacon pieces and Parmesan cheese.
Bake 30 minutes or until cheese is golden brown.
