Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup chopped onion
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons tomato paste
1 (15.25 ounce) can kidney beans, drained with liquid reserved
1 cup uncooked white rice

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Saute onion, bell pepper and garlic.  When onion is translucent add salt and tomato paste.  Reduce heat to low and cook 2 minutes.  Stir in the beans and rice.
Pour the liquid from the beans into a large measuring cup and add enough water to reach a volume of 2 1/2 cups; pour into beans.  Cover and cook on low for 45 to 50 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed and rice is cooked.

Description: 
I originally got this from a Cuban friend, but made some changes to it.    I have had it many times, the leftovers are very good wrapped in a tortilla, too.  Very filling dish.
