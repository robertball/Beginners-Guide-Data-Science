Ingredients:
1 TBSP finely grated peeled fresh ginger
1/2 TBSP fresh lime juice
2 TSP curry powder
Half an onion, diced
6 chicken thighs
1/2 TSP salt and 1/4 TSP pepper

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine ginger, lime juice, curry powder, onion, salt and pepper (I added a tiny bit of water - the mix is quite strong).
Season chicken with a little salt and pepper on both sides. Rub ginger mixture under the skin and out a little bit on top.
Place on baking sheet and cook for approx 1/2 hour. Broil on both sides for 3 - 5 minutes each to make the skin crispy.
