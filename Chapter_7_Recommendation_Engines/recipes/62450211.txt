Description: 
My cousin Sherry told me about Taco's de Lengua. I thought wow this is a perfect way to use beef tongue because it is so economically priced. She likes to top hers with Salsa Verde, but I chose to do it with the Pico de Gallo. I think either one goes terrific with this taco dish. The squeeze of lime is a nice finishing touch.Modified from: Delicious Beef Tongue Tacos
