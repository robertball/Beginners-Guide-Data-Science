Ingredients:
Reynolds Wrap® Pan Lining Paper
8 ounces dried fettuccine or linguine pasta
1 cup shredded carrots*
1 cup fresh or frozen peas
1 cup sliced yellow squash
1 cup fresh asparagus spears, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup lowfat milk
1/2 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
4 ounces herbed goat cheese
1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1 tablespoon snipped fresh basil
1 tablespoon snipped fresh oregano
1/4 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a 2-quart rectangular baking dish with Reynolds Wrap(R) Pan Lining Paper, parchment side up. No need to grease dish.
Cook the pasta according to package directions in a Dutch oven, adding the carrots, peas, squash, and/or asparagus for the last 3 minutes of cooking time. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of the pasta water. Return the pasta mixture to the Dutch oven. Cover and set aside.
Melt butter in a medium saucepan; whisk in flour and salt. Whisk in the milk, chicken broth, and goat cheese. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 1 minute more. Stir in the reserved pasta water, tomatoes, 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese, basil, and oregano.
Pour milk mixture over the pasta mixture, tossing to coat. Spoon pasta mixture into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with the almonds and remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until the mixture just starts to turn golden and the sauce is bubbly.
