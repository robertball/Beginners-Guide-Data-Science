Ingredients:
1 cup red lentils
1 slice ginger, 1 inch piece, peeled
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
4 teaspoons vegetable oil
4 teaspoons dried minced onion
1 teaspoon cumin seeds

Directions:
Rinse lentils thoroughly and place in a medium saucepan along with ginger, turmeric, salt and cayenne pepper.  Cover with about 1 inch of water and bring to a boil.  Skim off any foam that forms on top of the lentils.  Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until beans are tender and soupy.
Meanwhile, in a microwave safe dish combine oil, dried onion and cumin seeds.  Microwave on high for 45 seconds to 1 minute; be sure to brown, but not burn, onions.  Stir into lentil mixture.
