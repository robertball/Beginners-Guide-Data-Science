Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup unsalted butter - melted, cooled, and divided
1 1/2 cups sour cream
4 scallions, thinly sliced (optional)
1/2 teaspoon Hungarian hot paprika, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and baking soda together in a large bowl. Drizzle in 6 tablespoons melted butter and mix lightly with your hands to distribute butter. Make a well in the center of the bowl; add sour cream and scallions. Mix with a wooden spoon until no dry spots remain and a shaggy dough forms.
Drop 1/2-cupfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them at least 1 1/2 inch apart. Brush tops with remaining 2 tablespoons butter; sprinkle with paprika.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops and bottoms are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
