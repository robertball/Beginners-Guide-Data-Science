Ingredients:
1 lb. strawberries, roughly chopped
2 apples; peeled, cored, and roughly chopped
6-8 green onions; sliced, white and pale green parts only
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 packets granulated beef bullion (about 1/2 ounce)
4 cups water

Directions:
1. Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan and stir to combine. Heat over high until boiling, then reduce the heat to medium. Simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
2. Once the chutney has reduced to where there is only a small amount of liquid remaining, reduce the heat to low and simmer for another 30 minutes. Stir occasionally.
3. Chutney can be refrigerated for future use, or used right away while still warm. Spoon over grilled pork, use as a sauce in sandwiches and wraps, or serve as a savory dip.

Description: 
Late summer produce goes into this autumn spiced chutney. Use as a milder substitute for cranberry sauce -it is very versatile! Dollop on top of your favorite white meat, spoon into turkey wraps, or serve it as a dip with sweet potato or apple chips... or both!
