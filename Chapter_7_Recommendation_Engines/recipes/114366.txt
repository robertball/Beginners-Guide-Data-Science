Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds ground ham
1/2 pound ground pork
1/2 onion, chopped
2 cups rolled oats
2 eggs
2 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups evaporated milk
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1/4 cup cider vinegar
Horseradish Sauce:
3/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup sour cream
5 tablespoons prepared horseradish
1 tablespoon lemon juice
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine the ground ham, ground pork, onion, oats, eggs, parsley, ground mustard, pepper, and evaporated milk in a large bowl.  Mix well.  Form in to 2 loaves; place into 9x13 inch baking pans.
Bake loaves in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Stir the brown sugar and vinegar together in a small saucepan; boil for 1 minute.  Remove loaves from oven, and pour brown sugar mixture over. Return loaves to oven; baste frequently with the pan juices until browned and cooked through, 30 to 45 minutes longer.
Combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, horseradish, and lemon juice in a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve sauce over sliced ham loaf.
