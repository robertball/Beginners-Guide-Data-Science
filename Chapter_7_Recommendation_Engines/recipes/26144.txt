Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package spice cake mix
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 cup water
1/3 cup molasses
2 tablespoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, stir together the cake mix, baking soda and ginger. Make a well in the center and pour in the water, molasses and vanilla. Mix until thoroughly blended. Roll into 10 balls and place them 3 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Flatten slightly.
Bake for 13 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops are cracked and cookies are firm. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
