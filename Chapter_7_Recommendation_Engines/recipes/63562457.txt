Ingredients:
1 	 medium red onion, chopped
1 	 green bell pepper, chopped
4 	 garlic cloves, chopped
1 	 tablespoon chili powder
1 	 tablespoon ground cumin
2 	 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 	 teaspoon ground cinnamon
kosher salt and black pepper
1 	 28-ounce can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
1 	 15.5-ounce can black beans, rinsed
1 	 15.5-ounce can kidney beans, rinsed
2 	 medium sweet potato (about 8 ounces), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces

Directions:
1. In a 4- to 6-quart slow cooker, combine the onion, bell pepper, garlic, chili powder, cumin, cocoa, cinnamon, 1 teaspoon salt, and Â¼ teaspoon black pepper. Add the tomatoes (and their liquid), beans, sweet potato, and 1 cup water.
2.  Cover and cook until the sweet potatoes are tender and the chili has thickened, on low for 7 to 8 hours  or on high for 4 to 5 hours (this will shorten total recipe time).
3.  Serve the chili with the sour cream, scallions, radishes, and tortilla chips.
