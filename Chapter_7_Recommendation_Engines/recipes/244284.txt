Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup water
2 egg whites
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup chopped almonds
1/2 cup chopped fresh figs
1/2 cup chopped raisins

Directions:
Bring sugar and water to a boil, without stirring, in a saucepan until syrup is 238 degrees F (114 degrees C) or until a small amount of syrup dropped in cold water forms a soft thread, 7 to 10 minutes.
Slowly pour syrup over egg whites in a bowl; stir in vanilla extract and continue to beat until thick and cold. Add baking powder and beat until filling/frosting is thick enough to spread without running. Fold almonds, figs, and raisins into filling/frosting.
