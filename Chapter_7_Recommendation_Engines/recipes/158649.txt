Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large red onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 minced red chile pepper
2 pints cherry tomatoes, quartered
1 1/2 cups canned crushed tomatoes
1 cup chopped fresh basil
2/3 cup kalamata olives, sliced
1 (16 ounce) package fresh gnocchi
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the onion, garlic, and chile pepper; cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high, and stir in the cherry tomatoes. Cook until the tomatoes have lost their form and are beginning to make a sauce, about 5 minutes. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 10 minutes.
While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the fresh gnocchi, and cook until the gnocchi float to the surface, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently strain out the gnocchi and place into a serving dish.
Stir the basil and olives into the simmering sauce, and cook for one minute. Pour the sauce over the drained gnocchi and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve.
