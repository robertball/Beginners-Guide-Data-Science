Ingredients:
1 cup orzo pasta
1 basket assorted cherry tomatoes
fresh basil, chopped (about 12 leaves)
2 cloves chopped garlic, divided

3 or 4 ounces crumbled gorgonzola (to taste)
3 TBS Olive Oil, divided
1 1/4 cup vegetable broth
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, heat 1 1/2 TBS Olive Oil.  Add orzo pasta (dry) and cook, stirring (with a wooden spoon) for about three or four minutes until lightly browned; add onion and cook for three minutes, then add 1/2 the garlic, stirring until fragrant (about 30 seconds).  Add vegetable broth and salt and pepper to taste, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for about 12-14 minutes.  Meanwhile, cut the cherry tomatoes in half, and add to a separate bowl along with remaining garlic, olive oil, and half the basil. Toss well.  When orzo is done, spoon into a bowl, top with tomato mixture, crumbled gorgonzola, and fresh basil. Serves 4--Enjoy!
