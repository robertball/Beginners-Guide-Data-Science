Ingredients:
Cucumber Wasabi Dip:
1/2 cup ranch dressing
1/4 cup peeled, seeded, and minced cucumber
1 tablespoon whole milk
1 1/2 teaspoons prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon Japanese wasabi powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste
Green Bean Fries:
2 cups water
2 cups chicken broth
8 ounces fresh green beans, trimmed
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon whole milk, or more as needed
1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
1/2 cup crushed French-fried onions
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup all-purpose flour
8 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Blend ranch dressing, cucumber, 1 tablespoon milk, horseradish, vinegar, wasabi powder, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and cayenne pepper together in a food processor until dip is smooth. Transfer dip to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.
Bring water and chicken broth to a boil; add green beans and cook until slightly tender, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Whisk egg and 1 tablespoon milk together in a bowl. Combine bread crumbs, French-fried onions, 3/4 teaspoon salt, onion powder, black pepper, and garlic powder together in a separate bowl. Place flour in a third bowl.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Press green beans in flour until evenly coated. Dip coated green beans in egg-milk mixture, allowing excess liquid to drip back into bowl. Transfer green beans to bread crumbs mixture and press to coat, shaking off excess. Arrange coated beans in 1 layer on a plate or in a colander.
Working in batches, fry coated green beans in the hot oil until crisp, about 1 minute 30 seconds. Transfer green bean fries to a paper towel-lined colander using a slotted spoon. Serve green bean fries with dip.
