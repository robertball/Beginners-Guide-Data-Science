Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup shortening
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
1 teaspoon baking soda
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Combine milk with vinegar to make sour milk.  Let stand for 5 minutes.
In a large mixing bowl, combine sugars, shortening, eggs, and vanilla.  Add flour, soda, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.
Stir in sour milk and mix well.  NOTE:   Dough will be very sticky and hard to handle.  You could refrigerate it for a few hours, or just use plenty of flour when rolling out.
Roll on well floured board to 1/2 inch thickness.  Cut with cookie cutters to desired shapes (large cutters work best).
Bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes or until lightly brown on bottom.
Frost with Sugar Cookie Frosting (see recipe) and decorate.
