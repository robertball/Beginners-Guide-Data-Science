Ingredients:
2/3 cup shortening
1 1/4 cups sugar
4 eggs
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups mashed ripe bananas
2 (8 ounce) cans crushed pineapple, drained
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 (10 ounce) jar maraschino cherries, drained and chopped
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream shortening and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with banana and pineapple. Fold in the chocolate chips, cherries and walnuts. Pour into two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 60-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.

Description: 
I developed this recipe in an effort to add pizzazz to my plain banana bread. I was pleased with the results, and so were my family and friends.
