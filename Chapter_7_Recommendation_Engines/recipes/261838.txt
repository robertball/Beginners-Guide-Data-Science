Ingredients:
1/2 pound mild or spicy Italian sausage links
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups chicken broth or more as needed
1 head cauliflower, broken into small florets
3 cups baby kale
1 (14 ounce) can navy beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup heavy whipping cream
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook Italian sausage in a large Dutch oven until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain excess fat and place cooked sausage on a paper towel-lined plate.
Heat olive oil in the Dutch oven over medium heat and cook onion and garlic until soft and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in cauliflower florets and cook until slightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and bring to a boil. Cook until cauliflower is tender, about 10 minutes.
Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Stir in cooked sausage, kale, and beans; cook until kale begins to wilt, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream and heat through, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
A copycat of a famous Italian restaurant soup, but with cauliflower and small white beans instead of potatoes. Easy way to sneak more vegetables into food. Kids and hubby loved it!
