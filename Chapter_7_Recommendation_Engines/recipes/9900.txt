Ingredients:
1 (19.8 ounce) package brownie mix
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 cup white chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
In large bowl, combine brownie mix, oil and eggs.   By hand, stir until well-blended. Stir in chips.
Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in heated oven for 8-12 minutes or until set. Cool 1 minute; remove from baking sheets.

Description: 
I also use cake mixes with chocolate chips or M and M's. My personal favorite is to use Spice Cake mix (sans chips), then sprinkle cinnamon-sugar on cookies prior to baking.
