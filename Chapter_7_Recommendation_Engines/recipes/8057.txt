Description: 
A friend made this for our group and we have been hooked on it ever since. Try it. It's so rich, moist, and easy, you'll be hooked too!                                       Note: I have replaced the sour cream with 16 ounces of plain yogurt, (not fat-free!), with great success. The taste is just as good to me with a lot less fat. However, do not use low-fat or fat-free sour cream, as it will NOT turn out well!
