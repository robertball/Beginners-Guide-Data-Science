Ingredients:
2 T olive oil
1 large onion (chopped coarsely)
1 green bell pepper (chopped coarsely)
1 lb chicken breast(skin off) cut into 1-in. pieces
1/2 lb chorizo sausage thinly sliced (casing removed)
1 can chicken broth
1/2 t salt
1/2 t turmeric OR 4 strings saffron
1 c long grain rice
1 c frozen peas
1 can italian style stewed tomatoes
1/2 lb jumbo shrimp(I keep the tails)

Directions:
In a dutch oven on medium-high heat, place olive oil, onion & bell pepper and let cook for two minutes. Add chicken and sausage and cook for an additional 8 minutes.
Add your rice, chicken broth, turmeric and salt, blending well. Turn heat down to a simmer, cover and let the combination cook for 20 additional minutes.
At the end of your 20 minutes add your frozen peas, canned tomatoes and the shrimp. Let simmer for an additional 8-12 minutes until the shrimp turns pink.
Remove from heat after shrimp is thoroughly cooked because sometimes the rice will puff up with all of the liquid used.
Serve while hot and enjoy!

Description: 
Delicious dish that I copied from one of the chefs from the cooking channel. It was a while ago and I don't remember the show but I make this each month and my picky eater loves it. Protein, fiber, starch and vitamins make this a one-stop does it all meal for my family.
