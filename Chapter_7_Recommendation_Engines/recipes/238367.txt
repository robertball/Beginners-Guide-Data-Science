Ingredients:
2 tablespoons melted butter
1 (16 ounce) package Brussels sprouts, halved
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons cracked black pepper

1 lime, halved

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Brush butter over Brussels sprouts and season with garlic powder, black pepper, and seasoned salt.
Place sprouts on the preheated grill and cook until tender and grill marks appear, about 10 minutes. Squeeze lime juice over sprouts before removing from grill.

Description: 
I grill anything and just tried this recipe one night for a change. Works great on your indoor plug-in, lean-mean grill also. These are great with a wasabi dipping sauce (half wasabi paste and half sour cream).
