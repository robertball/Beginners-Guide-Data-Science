Ingredients:
1 tbsp. olive oil
1 tbsp. butter
6 cups carrots, peeled and chopped
3 large leeks (white and pale green parts only), cleaned and chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
4 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp. dried crushed red pepper flakes (or to taste)
1 carton chicken broth
juice from one fresh lime
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1 tsp grated lime zest

Directions:
Heat oil and butter together in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add carrots and leeks and sauté until leeks begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant. Add cumin and crushed red pepper.
Stir in chicken broth and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until vegetables are very tender, about 30 minutes.
Purée soup in batches in blender until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Soup can be transferred to a large bowl and kept covered in cling wrap in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, or frozen for future use.
Just before serving, stir in lime juice, drizzle with yogurt and garnish with lime zest and cilantro. If soup is too thick, use additional Chicken Broth to thin to desired consistency.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe for a Soup Supper my church had during Lent one year.  Making a soup hearty with no meat can be difficult.  I believe this fits the bill.  I had many requests for the recipe and have been asked to bring it back year after year.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
