Ingredients:
For Pie Crust:
2 1/4 C flour, plus more for dusting
3/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cinnamon
3/4 C shortening
7-8 tsp ice water, or as needed
For Apples:
6 medium apples
1/2 C brown sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/8 tsp cloves
2 Tbsp butter
For syrup:
1/2 C white sugar
1/2 C light corn syrup
1 C water
2 Tbsp butter
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp nutmeg

Directions:
1. Whisk together flour, salt, and cinnamon for pie crust.  Cut in shortening until ingredients are very crumbly.  Sprinkle enough water over mix to just hold dry ingredients together; mix together and form into a ball.  Wrap with wax paper and allow to chill in fridge for 20 minutes.
2. Roll out dough (1/2 batch at a time) to 1/8" thickness and cut into 7" squares.  Any extra dough may be reserved for decorative garnish if desired.
3. Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves for apples.
4. Peel and core (and slice if desired) apples.  Place each apple in the center of a square of pastry dough.  Fill empty center of each apple with 1/6 of the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Dot top of apple with 1 tsp of butter.  Bring opposite corners of square together at top of apple and press to seal seams.    Place in baking dish, not allowing dumplings to touch.
5. Preheat oven to 500° F.  Combine all syrup ingredients in pan and bring to a boil.  Allow to boil for 3 minutes.  Pour syrup mixture over the top of all of the dumplings.  Bake immediately, for 5-7 minutes until the crust begins to show slight coloring.  Reduce oven temperature to 350° F and bake for an additional 30-35 minutes.  Occasionally spoon hot syrup from bottom of pan over the top of dumplings while cooking.  Serve warm.
