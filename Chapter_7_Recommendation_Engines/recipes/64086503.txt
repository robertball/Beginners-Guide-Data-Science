Ingredients:
1 egg white
1/4 tsp cream of tartar
1 cup powdered sugar
dash of salt
1/4 tsp vanilla

Directions:
In a small bowl beat egg white, salt and cream of tartar until stiff peaks form. Add vanilla. Gradually beat in just enough sugar so icing is stiff but still thin enough to push through 1/16 inch decorating tube. Cover icing with damp cloth until ready to use.
