Ingredients:
Filling:
2 cups frozen blueberries
1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons almond extract
1 teaspoon lemon juice (optional)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Topping:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/8 cup brown sugar
1/8 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 stick cold butter, cubed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Toss blueberries, sugar, almond extract, lemon juice, and vanilla extract in a medium bowl. Pour into two 6-ounce ramekins.
Mix flour, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in another medium bowl. Cut in butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle evenly over the blueberry mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and blueberries are bubbling, about 25 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature.
