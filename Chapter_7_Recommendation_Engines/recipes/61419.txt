Ingredients:
2 cups pecans
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3 eggs
6 (1 inch thick) pork chops
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
Italian flat leaf parsley

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Spread the pecans on a baking sheet, and bake until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Set pecans aside to cool.  Raise the oven temperature to 375 degrees (190 degrees C).
Chop pecans finely, and then combine in a shallow bowl with the salt and pepper. Place the flour in another shallow bowl. In a third bowl, whisk the eggs together until well blended. First dip each pork chop into the flour, shaking off any excess.  Then dip the chops into the egg, and finally into the finely chopped pecans.
In a large oven-proof frying pan, melt the butter over a medium heat. Arrange the pork chops in a single layer in the pan. Cook, turning once, until golden on both sides, 5 to 6 minutes total.
Place the frying pan in the preheated oven, and bake until firm to the touch and pale pink when cut in the center, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Do not allow the nut coating to burn. Transfer the pork chops to a warmed platter, and garnish with parsley sprigs. Serve immediately.
