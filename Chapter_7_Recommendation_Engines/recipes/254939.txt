Ingredients:
1/4 cup orange juice
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
12 chicken drumsticks, patted dry

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine orange juice, honey, Dijon mustard, garlic powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Add chicken; coat thoroughly. Place chicken, skin side down, in a baking pan. Reserve the honey mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; remove from oven. Turn chicken skin side up; baste with honey mixture. Bake, basting once, until chicken is no longer pink and an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This chicken is good and garlicky with a hint of sweetness. The honey coating becomes rich, sticky, and crispy in the oven, but if you want to go healthier, remove the skins. This works well in the winter served hot, or make ahead and serve cold at a picnic. It's delicious right away, or for more flavor allow it to marinate over night.
