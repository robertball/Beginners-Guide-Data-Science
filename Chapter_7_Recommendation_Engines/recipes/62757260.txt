Ingredients:
1 (14.5 oz) can chicken broth plus enough water to make 2 cups
1/2 tsp. dry oregano leaves
1 tsp. dry basil leaves
1/4 tsp. crushed dry rosemary
1 (10 oz) box dry couscous (about 1 1/2 cups)
2 cups diced tomatoes or 1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes, halved
1 medium cucumber, diced
1/2 cup diced red onion
1/2 cup kalamata olives, pitted and halved
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
Vinaigrette:
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 tsp. lemon zest
1 Tbsp. red wine vinegar
2 garlic cloves, pressed or finely minced
1/2 tsp. kosher salt
1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Place the chicken broth and water, oregano, basil, and rosemary in a small pot on the stove top. Bring to a boil. Add the couscous, cover the pot with a lid, and remove from heat. Let sit for at least 5 minutes and then fluff with a fork. Cool to room temperature.
Combine cooled couscous, tomatoes, cucumber, onion, olives, feta, and parsley. Set aside.
In a small jar, combine vinaigrette ingredients and shake until combined. Pour over salad, stir, and then refrigerate 2 hours before serving. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.
If desired, garnish with fresh parsley, extra feta cheese, and lemon slices for squeezing on top.
