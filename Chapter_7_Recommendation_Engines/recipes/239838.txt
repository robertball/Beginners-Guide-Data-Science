Description: 
I just love nuts, especially cashews! So, about 15 years ago I started experimenting with making a cashew cookie based on the Betty Crocker® peanut butter cookie recipe. Over time, I have become gluten-free, so I've also tried a variety of gf flours. Finally, I meet with success! This is a moist cookie that holds up to dunking in tea or coffee with a nutty, light, mildly sweet flavor that is a bit exotic. Make these for afternoon tea parties or pull some out for surprise guests.
