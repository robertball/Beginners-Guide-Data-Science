Ingredients:
4 white fish fillets (whiting or tilapia)
salt & pepper
4 tbs evoo
1 clove garlic
2 tsp rosemary, fresh or dried
2 tsp thyme, fresh or dried
2 tsp mint, fresh or dried
4 bay leaves
1 large tomato
1 lemon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400*.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Rinse and pat the fillets dry - arrange them on the lined baking sheet.
Chop or crush all of the herbs except the bay leaf.
Mix herbs in a small bowl with the evoo and set aside.
Cut the tomato and lemon into thin rounds and place in the center of each fillet.
Drizzle the evoo mixture evenly over each fillet.
Break each bay leaf in half and place on each fillet.
Bake for 10-15 minutes - fish is done when it flakes easily with a fork.
