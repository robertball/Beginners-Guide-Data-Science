Ingredients:
2 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces and pounded thin
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
Â½  onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2  flour tortillas, or more as desired
1 (5 ounce) package crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
1 cup cooked spinach

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add chicken; cook until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
Place 1 tortilla on prepared baking sheet; layer with 1/2 of the Gorgonzola cheese, spinach, and chicken mixture; top with remaining Gorgonzola cheese. Place remaining tortilla on top and gently press down to flatten the quesadilla.
Bake quesadilla in preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes; cut into triangles.
