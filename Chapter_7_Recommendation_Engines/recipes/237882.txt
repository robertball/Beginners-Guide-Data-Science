Ingredients:
1 pound walleye fillets
2 12x12-inch squares aluminum foil
5 tablespoons butter, melted
1 pinch seasoned salt, or to taste
1 pinch garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. DashÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
Place walleye, skin-side down, in the center of one aluminum foil square. Brush fillet with butter; season with seasoned salt and garlic and herb seasoning blend. Place second aluminum foil square over the fish and fold edges of the two pieces of foil together to form a secure packet.
Cook on the preheated grill until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 7 minutes per side.

Description: 
I got this recipe from a guy I fish with up north, I love them; they are absolutely great, and I can't get enough of them. 
We call them 'Scooby Snacks' and usually have them around the campfire. Be sure your foil is good and sealed. When done, it will be puffed up like a pillow! You can use any white, flaky fish in place of walleye fillets.
