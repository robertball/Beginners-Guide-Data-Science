Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
1 cup coconut flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup applesauce
1 cup pumpkin puree
3/4 cup almond milk
4 eggs, slightly beaten
1/4 cup coconut oil
1/4 cup agave nectar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place cupcake liners in 18 muffin cups.
Mix rolled oats, coconut flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt together in a bowl.
Mix applesauce, pumpkin puree, almond milk, eggs, coconut oil, agave nectar, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until thoroughly blended. Add flour mixture and stir just until flour is incorporated into the batter, about 1 minute. Fill muffin cups evenly with batter.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
