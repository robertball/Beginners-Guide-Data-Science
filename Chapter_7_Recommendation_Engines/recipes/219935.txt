Description: 
This is a dip that I like to bring tailgating because when asked how to make it -- it's easy enough that my football pals can even remember it while usually a little lightheaded from other beverages.  :)  Serve with your favorite taco dipping chips. Truthfully, put it in a bowl and stir.
