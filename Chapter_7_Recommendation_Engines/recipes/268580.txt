Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 eggs
2 egg yolks
1/4 cup granular sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
2 cups whole milk
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 cup blueberries, or to taste

Directions:
Spray 8 ramekins with cooking spray. Fill a roasting pan halfway with water.
Combine eggs, yolks, and sweetener and whisk until thick and pale.
Bring milk and cream to a boil in a saucepan. Remove from heat and slowly drizzle mixture into the egg mixture; whisk briskly to combine without cooking the eggs. Stir in vanilla extract. Strain custard mixture through a sieve if desired.
Place 2 or 3 blueberries in the bottom of each ramekin. Pour custard mixture to within 1/2 inch from the top. Sprinkle with nutmeg. Place ramekins in the prepared roasting pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 45 minutes.
