Ingredients:
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling
1 (16 ounce) can whole cranberry sauce
½ cup golden raisins
2 tablespoons cornstarch
¼ teaspoon ground ginger
6 tablespoons orange juice
1 tablespoon milk
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
Make piecrust dough, substituting orange juice for ice water; allow to chill at least 45 minutes before rolling.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a large bowl, stir together cherry pie filling, cranberry sauce, golden raisins, cornstarch, and ginger.
Divide dough into two unequal pieces, about 55 %/45 %. Roll larger piece to 1 1/2 inches larger than a 9-inch pie pan. Place crust in pie plate leaving one inch overhang, and brush with egg white. Spoon filling into pie crust.
Roll second crust to 12-inch round. Cut into 14 strips to make a lattice top. Moisten edge of bottom crust with water. Place 7 strips across pie; do not seal ends. Fold every other strip back halfway from center. Place center cross strip on pie and replace folded part of strips. Now fold back alternate strips. Place second cross strip in place. Repeat to weave cross strips into lattice. Seal ends. Turn bottom crust edge up over ends of strips, and pinch to seal. Make high fluted edge. Brush pastry with milk, and sprinkle lightly with sugar.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake an additional 35 minutes, or until filling begins to bubble and crust is golden brown. (Cover crust edges with foil if they're getting too brown.) Cool pie on wire rack.

Description: 
This is my favorite recipe to make for the holidays. It tastes too good to be this easy. Don't make your own dough?  Just use dough mix or refrigerated crusts--it tastes just as delicious. Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com.
