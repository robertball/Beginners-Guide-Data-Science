2 eggs
1/4 cup white wine or chicken broth
1/4 teaspoon salt

1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 cup chopped green pepper
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 teaspoon butter
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
2 teaspoons minced fresh basil

Directions:
In a bowl, whisk the eggs, whites, wine or broth, salt, pepper and garlic powder; set aside. In a large nonstick skillet, saute the green pepper, onion and mushrooms in butter and oil for 3 minutes or until crisp-tender.
Reduce heat to medium. Stir in the egg mixture; cook and stir until eggs are completely set. Sprinkle with cheese and basil. Cover and remove from the heat; let stand for 5 minutes or until cheese is melted.
