https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
4 ears corn, kernels cut from cob
2 leeks, white parts only, thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 avocados - peeled, pitted, and diced into 1-inch chunks
1/2 lemon, juiced
5 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon
2 (6 ounce) cans lump crabmeat, drained and flaked

Directions:
Place corn kernels in a colander to filter out small pieces; transfer to a bowl. Add leeks and garlic; stir to combine.
Toss diced avocado with lemon juice in a separate bowl to avoid browning.
Heat vegetable oil in a wok over high heat; cook and stir corn mixture until corn is uniformly browned, 4 to 8 minutes.
Fold corn mixture, avocado, rice vinegar, basil, salt, and tarragon together in a serving bowl. Sprinkle with crabmeat.

Description: 
My favorite summer recipe I created. It's refreshing and very tasty. Must be served immediately. Try with scallops instead of crab!
