Image:

Ingredients:
3 egg yolks
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon cream
Dash of cajun seasoning (or cayenne)
Dash of dill or parsley
1/2 cup melted unsalted sweet cream butter, heated
1 1/3 tablespoon lemon juice or white wine vinegar

Directions:
Allow yolks and cream to reach room temperature, and then pour them into a blender along with the salt and seasonings.
Blend on high for about 3-5 seconds or until the mixture is smooth.
Heat butter on the stove or in the microwave until bubbly, but not brown.
Add half of the hot butter to the blender while mixing on a high setting, in a steady stream; this will thicken the sauce as well as give it heat, so you want to make sure the butter is very warm.
After half of the butter is added, quickly pour in the lemon juice or vinegar, and then continue with the rest of the butter, still blending on high.

Description: 
A rich (but not overly rich), lemony Hollandaise that can be prepared in under 2 minutes. Comes out perfectly every time! Be careful when you scale down this recipe, because it doesn't get the same consistency as when you prepare it this way.
