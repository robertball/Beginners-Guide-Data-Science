Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 cup orange juice
1/4 cup milk
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 teaspoons finely grated orange peel
ORANGE SAUCE:
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup orange juice
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons finely grated orange peel

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first four ingredients. In another bowl, combine the egg, orange juice, milk, oil and orange peel; add to dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto a lightly greased hot griddle. Turn when bubbles form on top; cook until second side is golden brown.
For orange sauce, combine sugar, cornstarch and salt in a saucepan. Stir in the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve warm with pancakes.

Description: 
I found this recipe in an old cookbook given to me by my mother-in-law. The light, delicate pancakes have a nice citrus flavor that the tangy orange sauce complements.
