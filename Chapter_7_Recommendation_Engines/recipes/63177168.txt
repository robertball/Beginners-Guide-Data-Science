Ingredients:
2 wedges The Laughing Cow Light Creamy Swiss cheese, room temperature
1 zucchini, ends removed, finely diced
2 large portabella mushrooms, stems chopped and reserved
1 tsp. finely chopped onion
1/2 tsp. chopped garlic
1/8 tsp. salt, or more to taste
Dash ground thyme, or more to taste
1/2 tbsp. reduced-fat Parmesan-style grated topping
Optional: black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
In a bowl, combine cheese wedges, zucchini, chopped mushroom stems, onion, garlic, salt, and thyme. If you like, season with pepper. Mix well. Set aside.
Lay a large piece of heavy-duty foil on a baking sheet. Lightly spray both sides of the mushroom caps with olive oil nonstick spray, and place next to each other on the foil with the rounded sides down.
Spoon veggie-cheese mixture into the mushroom caps -- there will be a lot, so pack it in! Sprinkle with Parm-style grated topping.
Place another large piece of foil over the caps. Fold together and seal all four edges of the two foil pieces, forming a well-sealed packet.
Bake in the oven for 23 - 25 minutes, until mushrooms are tender.
Allow packet to cool for a few minutes, and then cut to release steam before opening it entirely. (Careful -- steam will be hot.) If you like, season to taste with additional salt and thyme. Enjoy!
