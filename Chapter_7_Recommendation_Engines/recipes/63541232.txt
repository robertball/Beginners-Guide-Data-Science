Ingredients:
5 medium baked red skin potatoes
6 oz. bacon
2 T. fresh flat leaf parsley, minced
1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 stalks celery, finely chopped
cracked black pepper and sea salt
2 c. chicken broth
2 c. water
1/2 c. (1 stick) butter
1/2 c. flour
4 c. milk
1 1/2 c. freshly shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1 lb. mini meatballs (homemade or frozen)

Directions:
Bake potatoes ahead of time. Cut into cubes when cool enough to handle (I use red skin potatoes and leave the skin on.)Make meatballs ahead as well. (I use my recipe for Italian Meatballs, omitting the Italian Seasoning)
Fry bacon in heavy skillet until crisp.  Remove to paper towel lined plate to cool.
Add parsley, onion, celery,and salt and pepper to drippings in skillet. Saute' until onions are translucent.
Put onion and celery mixture into soup pot or dutch oven.  Add chicken broth and water.  Heat to boiling then reduce heat and simmer covered until veggies are tender.
While broth is simmering, melt butter in heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Add flour, whisking vigorously so it is smooth.  Allow to bubble and thicken, but watch so it doesn't burn, for about 1 minute.  Add milk to pan while whisking, and whisk almost constantly until the sauce begins to thicken.  Add shredded cheddar a half cup at a time and stir well so it is completely incorporated.  Stir into simmering broth.
Add baked potato cubes, meatballs and crumbled bacon to soup.  Heat through. Add additional salt and pepper if needed.
Serve with additional shredded cheddar, chives, and a dollop of sour cream if desired.
