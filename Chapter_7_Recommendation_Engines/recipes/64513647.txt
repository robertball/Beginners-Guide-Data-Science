Ingredients:
3 medium-sized beets (about 3 cups cooked and pureed)
1.5 cups all-purpose flour
0.5 cups whole wheat flour
1.5 cups white sugar
1 cup butter
1 cup bittersweet chocolate chips
3 eggs
4 oz unsweetened baking chocolate
1 T vanilla
2 t baking soda
0.25 t salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 F.  Grease a 9x13 inch pan with butter.
Boil beets for 30 minutes.  Once cool enough to handle, remove skin and puree in blender or food processor.
Melt butter in saucepan over low heat.  Add chocolate and stir until melted.  Set aside to cool.
In small mixing bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt.
In large mixing bowl, beat together eggs and sugar with electric mixer.  Next add beets, chocolate mixture and vanilla.  Beat until combined.
Stir flour mixture and chocolate chips into beet mixture until just combined.
Pour mixture into prepared pan and bake for 40 minutes, or until a fork inserted into center comes out clean.
