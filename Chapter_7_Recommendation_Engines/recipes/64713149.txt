Ingredients:
1 pack Cube Steak
2 cups Flour
Salt
Pepper
Creole Seasoning
1 cup Milk
1 Large Egg
Oil for frying
~GRAVY~
1 Large Onion - sliced thin and cut in half
1 1/2 cup Land o Lakes Butter Salted
1/4 cup Flour
1 8 oz can Milk
2 cups Whole Milk
Salt
Pepper

Directions:
First I like to sauté my onions for the gravy and set them aside.
•In large skillet melt 1/2 cup butter
•Add onions
•Add salt and pepper
•Cook for about 5 minutes
•Remove and set aside for use later
To cook meat
•I use the same frying pain that I cooked the onions in
•Cut Cube Steak into bite size pieces
•Mix together the milk and egg
•Mix together flour, salt, pepper, creole seasoning
•Dip steak pieces into milk/egg mixture then
•Dip steak into flour - coat well
•Fry in oil until golden brown
•Remove steak from oil and set aside
To cook Gravy
•Melt 1 cup Butter
•Add salt and pepper
•Add Flour and stir until flour is no longer visible
•Pour in the can milk
• Pour in the whole milk
•You will need to constantly stir this gravy to keep it from burning
•I cook gravy on high for about 3 minutes or until it gets really hot. Then turn to medium-low (4 on my gas stove)
•Cook Gravy until the desired consistency.
•It normally takes about 8 minutes to get gravy thick but pourable. You do not want gravy to thick or to this.
•Once Gravy is done Add the sautéed onions and the cube steak.
•Let sit for about 5 minutes before serving so the steak absorbs the gravy and this will make the steak the most tender and juicy.
•I don’t tell you how much salt and pepper because it is per your taste.

I forgot to take a photo. I just grabbed one of the web. This is not what it will look like. I will post one next time I cook it.
