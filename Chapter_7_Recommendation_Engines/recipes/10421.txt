Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 egg, separated
1 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup pink decorator sugar

Directions:
In mixer bowl, beat butter, granulated sugar, cream cheese, egg yolk, 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, vanilla and salt until well blended.  Add flour, mix well.  Chill 2 hours.
On floured surface, knead dough to form smooth ball.  Divide into thirds. On floured surface, roll out each portion to 1/8 inch thickness.  Cut out heart shapes with cookie cutter.
Place 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.  Brush with slightly beaten egg white and sprinkle with colored sugar.  Bake in preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oven for 7 to 10 minutes.  Cool.
In saucepan, combine condensed milk, whipping cream and remaining 1/2 teaspoon almond extract.  Over medium high heat, cook and stir until mixture comes to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium; cook and stir until thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.  Cool.  Sandwich "two hearts together" with caramel mixture.  Store tightly covered.
