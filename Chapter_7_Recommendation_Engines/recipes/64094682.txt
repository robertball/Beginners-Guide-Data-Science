Description: 
Everybody has their own take on the best pizza crust.  I worked during college at a pizza place and left with this recipe that I hold among the top 5 I use.  Having a pizza oven that gets as hot as you really need (regular ovens really can't cut it) or using a pizza stone helps as well.
