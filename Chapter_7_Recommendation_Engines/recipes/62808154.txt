Preparation
Separate the onion slices into rings. Put them in a shallow dish and pour the milk over them. Soak for 30 minutes, turning once or twice.
Mix the flour with a sprinkle of salt, and dip the rings into this mixture, coating them all over.
Heat oil to 370Â°F and deep-fry the rings several at a time until golden on both sides. Pat free of oil, keep warm while frying the rest, and sprinkle with more salt, if desired, before serving.
