Ingredients:
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the ramekins
unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting the ramekins
2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1 & 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
sweetened whipped cream, for garnish
chocolate shavings, for garnish

Directions:
reheat oven to 350Â°. Butter two 5-ounce ramekins. Dust with cocoa powder and shake out the excess.
Place chocolate and 2 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat at half-power in microwave in 30-second increments until butter has melted and chocolate melts when stirred. Stir until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat sugar, brown sugar, egg, vanilla, and salt until combined. Add chocolate mixture and mix until smooth.
Divide batter evenly between prepared ramekins.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until cakes are set.
Serve warm in the ramekins. Garnish with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.
