Ingredients:
4 green onions
1 cup water
1 pound thin asparagus spears, trimmed
1 medium sweet red pepper, julienned
1 medium sweet yellow pepper, julienned
2 medium carrots, julienned
12 thyme sprigs
1 1/3 cups white wine
3 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Trim both ends of onions; cut the green tops into 7-in. lengths. In a saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add onion tops; boil for 1 minute or until softened. Drain and immediately place onion tops in ice water.  Drain and pat dry. Chop white portions of onions and set aside.
Divide asparagus, peppers and carrots into 12 bundles. Top each with a thyme sprig. Tie each bundle with a blanched onion top.
In a large skillet, place wine or both, chopped onions and vegetable bundles. Bring to a boil. Cook, uncovered, for 5-7 minutes or until vegetables are tender and liquid is reduced by two-thirds.  Carefully remove bundles with a slotted spoon to a serving plate.  Add butter to skillet, cook and stir until melted. Spoon over bundles.
