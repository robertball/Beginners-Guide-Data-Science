Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste
1/2 cup canola oil
1 (8 ounce) package flour tortillas, cut into 2-inch squares

Directions:
Stir sugar, cinnamon, chili powder, and black pepper in a shallow bowl until thoroughly combined.
Pour canola oil into a separate bowl.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Dip tortilla squares into canola oil on both sides and press into the seasoned sugar mixture; arrange coated chips on baking sheets.
Broil chips until sugar bubbles and chips are crisp, about 2 minutes; watch carefully to prevent burning. Turn the chips over and broil other sides until browned, another 2 minutes. Let cool before serving.
