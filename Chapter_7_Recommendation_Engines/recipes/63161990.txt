Description: 
One traditional custom is the blessing of of the Easter basket which contains all the essentials for Easter breakfast.Paska is the most symbolic of these foods.Nothing can be eaten Easter morning until after a long resurrection service and the colorful baskets are blessed.As a child I remember being so hungry.Finally getting home to eat I thought the food tasted so much better after being blessed!Now I think I was starving!
