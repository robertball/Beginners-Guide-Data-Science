Ingredients:
5 cups sliced peaches
3/4 cups sugar
1/3 flour
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1 T. lemon juice
2 T. butter
1 T. grenadine
2 packages of roll-out premade pie crusts (2 pack each for total of 4)

Directions:
Slice peaches into a large bowl that has lid (I use tupperware cake carrier).
Add sugar, flour, cinnamon, melted butter, grenadine and lemon juice.
Put on lid and shake till peaches are well coated and sauce is mixed well.
Preheat oven to 425' and roll out pie crusts into pie pans.
Pour peach mix into each pie until slightly above rim.
Place second pie crust over top, pinch sides together, cut vent holes in top and place in oven and bake for 30-35 minutes or until crust is nice dark golden brown all over.
Let cool to set and then serve warm.
