Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/3 cup sliced almonds
2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon water
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 (12 ounce) package fresh green beans, trimmed and halved crosswise
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (12 ounce) package fresh cremini mushrooms, sliced
1/2 cup sliced shallots
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
1 cup unsweetened almond milk
1/4 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a small baking sheet with foil and coat with cooking spray.
Toss almonds with brown sugar, 1 tablespoon water, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Spread on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring once, until toasted, about 10 minutes. Let cool; break apart clusters.
Cook green beans in lightly salted boiling water in a large skillet, covered, about 5 minutes. Drain. Transfer beans to a large bowl of ice water; drain again. Place in a large bowl.
Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, shallots, garlic, thyme, and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until mushrooms are browned and tender and any liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes. Add to beans and toss to coat. Transfer to a 1 1/2- to 2-quart baking dish.
Whisk almond milk, wine, cornstarch, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a small bowl. Add to skillet; cook, stirring, over medium heat until thickened and bubbly, scraping up any browned bits, 4 to 7 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in chives. Pour over bean mixture in the baking dish.
Bake until bubbly, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle with almonds. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
