Ingredients:
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as NutellaÂ®)
1/3 cup finely chopped, roasted hazelnuts

Directions:
Lay puff pastry flat onto a work surface. Spread chocolate-hazelnut spread over puff pastry and sprinkle with hazelnuts.
Starting with a long edge of the pastry, roll pastry tightly around filling, stopping in the middle. Repeat with the opposite long edge, meeting the first roll. Refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Cut pastry into 3/4-inch slices. Arrange slices on prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until golden, 6 to 7 minutes. Flip cookies and continue baking until crisp, 4 to 5 minutes more.
