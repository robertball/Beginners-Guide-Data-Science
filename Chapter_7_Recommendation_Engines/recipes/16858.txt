1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 1/2 cups chicken broth

1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 1/2 cups canned peeled and diced tomatoes
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup shrimp
1/2 pound cod fillets
3/4 cup plain nonfat yogurt

Directions:
Spray a large saucepan with the vegetable cooking spray over medium high heat. Add the onions and saute, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and chili powder and saute for 2 more minutes.
Then add the chicken broth, chile peppers and cumin, stirring well. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
Next, add the tomatoes, green bell pepper, shrimp and cod. Return to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for another 5 minutes. Gradually stir in the yogurt until heated through.

Description: 
A delicious fish soup that's low in fat! Having grown up on the Texas/Mexico border, I like foods spicy, but you can adjust the seasonings to taste. I also splash in a drop of hot pepper sauce in each bowl.
