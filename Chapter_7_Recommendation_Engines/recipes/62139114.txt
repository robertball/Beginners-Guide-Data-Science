Ingredients:
6 eggs
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 Tbsp dark rum
2 Tbsp butter
2 tsp confectioners sugar

Directions:
Separate the egg yolks from whites. Beat the yolks with the granulated sugar and rum until well blended. Beat the whites until they are firm but not stiff. Gently fold the whites into the yolk mixture.
Melt the butter in a 10 or 12 inch oven proof skillet. When butter sizzles, turn the eggs into a skillet and cook over a low flame, for about 7 minutes.
Sprinkle the omelet with confectioners sugar and pass it under the broiler for about two minutes, until glazed. Serve immediately.
