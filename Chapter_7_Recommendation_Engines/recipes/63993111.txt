Ingredients:
9 ounces Chocolate Chips
1 Cup Heavy Cream
1 Tbls Dark Rum (optional)

Directions:
1. Place the chocolate into medium bowl.  Heat the cream in a small sauce pan over medium heat.  Bring just to a boil, watching very carefully: don't let it boil out of pot.  Add chocolate and wisk until smooth.  Stir in the Rum if desired.
2.  Allow the gananche to cool slightly before pouring over cake.  Start at center of cake and work outward.  For fluffy frosting of chocolate filling, allow it to cool until thick, then whip with a wisk until light and fluffy.
