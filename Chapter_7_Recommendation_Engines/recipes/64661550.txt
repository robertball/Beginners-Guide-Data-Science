Ingredients:
1 salmon filet, 1-1.5 lbs
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
Juice of 1 lemon
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 fresh garlic clove, finely sliced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/2-1 tomatI, cut into thin slices or wedges

Directions:
1. Mix together olive oil, lemon juice, celery salt, pepper, and garlic slices.
2. Place salmon in a glass baking dish, pour oil mixture over fish.  I spooned the juices over the filet several times and spread the garlic slices out evenly over the top of the fish.
3. Sprinkle chopped parsley over top of fish.  Spread out tomato slices over perimeter of fish, or over the top for preference.  (I just had some wedges I placed along the edges of he filet. It looked pretty.). Cover fish either with Saran Wrap or a lid.
4. Allow salmon to marinate for at least an hour.
5. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  Spoon juices over top of fish again.
6.  When oven is preheated, place salmon in the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes (depending on the size of your filet).
7.  Fish should flake off with fork when completely cooked.  Serve and enjoy!

The hubs is Turkish and i’ve gotten fairly immersed in Turkish cooking and just love a lot of Turkish recipes.  I’ve become bored of the same ole salmon, so decided to try something a little different.
