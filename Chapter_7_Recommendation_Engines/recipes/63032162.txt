2 lbs ground beef
1 tsp Herbs de Provence
1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1 bottle (11-12 oz) of stout (Guinness suggested)
1 onion, diced
3 carrots, diced
1 cup frozen peas, thawed
2 cloves (1 tsp) garlic, minced
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp pepper
1½ lbs mashed potato
2 oz Cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375°F
In a medium or large skillet brown the meat then drain and remove to a 3 quart casserole dish.  Add the Worcestershire sauce, Herbs de Provence and the stout mixing it all together then smooth into an even layer.
Next add the onion, carrot, peas, garlic, salt and pepper to the skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the onions are transparent.  Remove to the casserole dish and make a smooth layer on top of the meat & stout.
Smooth the mashed potatoes into an even layer on top of all the other ingredients.
Cover the casserole and bake at 375°F for 45 minutes.  Uncover and sprinkle with the grated Cheddar cheese then bake uncovered for a further 15 minutes.
