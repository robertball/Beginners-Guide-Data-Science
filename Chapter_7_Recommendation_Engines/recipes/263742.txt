Description: 
Looking for a new way to prepare your garden's zucchini harvest? Make low-carb zucchini noodles, aka zoodles, with a spiralizer! You can make this dish in 25 minutes, with no waiting for the water to boil. The uncooked zucchini is tossed with hot olive oil and a blend of parsley, ground walnuts, and Parmesan cheese, and then topped with fresh tomatoes and olives. The hot olive oil makes it warm, but this is not a hot dish.
