Ingredients:
2 cups buckwheat flour
1 teaspoon gluten-free baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
3/4 cup light sour cream
1/4 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Stir buckwheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in sour cream and milk with a fork until dough forms a ball.
Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface and knead about 5 times. Pat out to 3/4-inch thickness. Cut into rounds with a 2- or 3-inch cutter. Transfer biscuits to a nonstick baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are nicely browned, about 15 minutes.
