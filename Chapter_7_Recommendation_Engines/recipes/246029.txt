Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) boneless pork loin roast, trimmed of fat
Marinade:
1/4 cup rice vinegar
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons Asian fish sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons sriracha hot sauce, or to taste
1 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
1 tablespoon vegetable oil for pan roasting

Directions:
Place the roast on its side and split in half lengthwise with a sharp knife. Make shallow slashes in a diamond pattern on both sides of each piece. Transfer halves to a flat dish.
Whisk rice vinegar, garlic, fish sauce, soy sauce, sriracha, salt, pepper, and Chinese 5-spice powder together in a bowl. Pour sauce over the meat; turn each piece over several times to thoroughly coat. Let meat marinate for about 30 minutes at room temperature. (Or transfer to a zip top bag and refrigerate for 3 or 4 hours.)
Heat a heavy cast iron skillet over medium-high heat; add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Brown meat on each side, 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Transfer to a plate to rest at least 5 minutes before slicing.
