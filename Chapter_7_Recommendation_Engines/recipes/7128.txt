Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
6 eggs
6 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 cup evaporated milk
1 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
2 quarts vegetable oil for frying
2 cups white sugar

Directions:
Dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in 1/4 cup warm water; set aside.
In small bowl, beat eggs until thick.
Put flour in large bowl, making a well in the center. Into the well add yeast, eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, melted butter, milk, 1 cup water, and salt.  Beat thoroughly to form a soft, smooth dough. Cover, let dough rise until doubled.
Heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drop dough by big teaspoonfuls into oil, fry until golden brown. Drain on paper towels, shake in a bag of sugar to coat, and serve hot.
