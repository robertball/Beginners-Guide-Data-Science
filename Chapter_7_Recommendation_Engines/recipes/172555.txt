Ingredients:
1 (1 pound 1.5 ounce) pouch Betty Crocker® chocolate chip cookie mix
1/2 cup butter
1 egg
4 cups ice cream, frozen yogurt, sherbet or sorbet
Multi-colored candy sprinkles or miniature chocolate chips, if desired

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Make cookies as directed on pouch, using butter and egg, except drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake 11 to 13 minutes or until edges are light golden brown. Cool 1 minute before removing from cookie sheet. Cool completely, about 30 minutes.
For each ice cream sandwich, place 1 scoop of ice cream (about 1/3 cup) between 2 cookies. Gently press cookies together (ice cream should spread to edge of cookies). Roll ice cream edges in sprinkles. Eat immediately, OR to save for later, wrap sandwiches individually in plastic wrap. Place in resealable freezer bag, and freeze until needed.
