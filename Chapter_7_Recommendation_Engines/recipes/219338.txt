Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 (3 pound) sugar pumpkin - peeled, seeded, and cut into matchbox-size pieces
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon yellow curry powder
20 ounces chicken broth
2 tablespoons pumpkin seed oil
sour cream
toasted pumpkin seeds

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the pumpkin, brown sugar, and curry powder to the butter; cook and stir until the pumpkin caramelizes, 6 to 10 minutes. Pour the chicken broth over the mixture; bring to a boil, and cook until the pumpkin is tender, about 20 minutes more.
Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway. Hold the lid of the blender in place with a towel; start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Process in batches until smooth.
Garnish each portion of soup with 1 teaspoon pumpkin seed oil, a dollop of sour cream, and a few pumpkin seeds.

Description: 
Use the bright orange hubbard pumpkins (Red Kuri, Baby Red Hubbard, or Orange Hokkaido) or small, fresh butternuts for a great taste! The butternuts are great because you don't have to peel them!
