Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup leeks, white and light-green parts only, thinly sliced crosswise
2 English cucumbers - peeled, quartered and chopped
8 green grapes
1/4 cup slivered blanched almonds
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/3 cup creme fraiche
1 cup French bread cubes
2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
1 1/2 cups cold water, or more as needed
salt, plus more to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir leeks until soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove to a plate and allow to cool.
Place cucumbers in a blender with grapes, almonds, 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, creme fraiche, bread cubes, vinegar, cooled leeks, and water. Puree until smooth, about 1 minute. Strain through a fine mesh sieve. Cover and chill for 1 to 2 hours.
Taste and season with salt and cayenne pepper. If needed, add some more vinegar. Serve garnished with dill oil (see note), thinly sliced grapes, slivered almonds, and fresh dill.
