Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) can Pillsbury速 refrigerated crescent dinner rolls or Pillsbury速 Crescent Recipe Creations速 refrigerated seamless dough sheet
4 teaspoons sugar
1 cup milk
1 (4-serving size) package vanilla instant pudding and pie filling mix
1 cup whipped topping or whipped cream
1 1/2 cups sliced strawberries

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees F.
If using crescent rolls: Unroll dough; separate into 4 rectangles. Press perforations to seal. If using dough sheet: Unroll dough; cut into 4 rectangles.
Cut each rectangle into quarters. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Press each rectangle to form 3x2-inch rectangle. Sprinkle each with sugar.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, in medium bowl, beat milk and pudding mix with wire whisk until mixture begins to thicken. Fold in whipped topping.
Just before serving, place 8 baked dough rectangles on serving platter or tray. Reserve 1/2 cup pudding mixture. Divide remaining pudding mixture onto rectangles; spread to edges. Reserve 8 strawberry slices for garnish. Divide remaining strawberries onto rectangles. Top with remaining 8 baked dough rectangles. Garnish each with 1 tablespoon reserved pudding mixture and 1 strawberry slice. Store in refrigerator.
