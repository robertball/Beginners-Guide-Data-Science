Ingredients:
1 tablespoon macadamia nut oil OR avocado oil (or other healthy cooking oil), divided
3 large eggs
5-6 scallions (aka green onions), root and 2 inches of green top removed, chopped (about 1/2 cup)
1 large carrot, shredded or julienned (about 1/2 cup)
1/2 cup frozen peas
2 cups cooked brown rice
3 tablespoons organic tamari (gluten-free soy sauce) or low sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon rice vinegar (no sugar added)
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
sea salt
fresh cracked black pepper

Directions:
Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil over medium heat. In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs into a uniform mixture until well combined and season with a small pinch of sea salt and fresh black pepper.
Add the eggs to the pan and scramble. Once cooked, remove the scrambled eggs from the pan to a plate and reserve for later.
Add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to the pan over medium heat; add the scallions and carrot and sauté 3-4 minutes until softened. Add the frozen peas to the pan, then add the rice, tamari, rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil and ginger. Stir well to combine, the heat from the pan will quickly defrost the peas.
Turn off the heat and stir in the scrambled eggs. Season with a pinch of sea salt if needed–it will depend on the sodium content of the tamari and other ingredients.
Turn the heat to low and cook another 5 minutes until the entire dish is warmed through.
Water chestnuts, bean sprouts, edamame and just about any other veggie you like would also be a delicious addition to this dish.
