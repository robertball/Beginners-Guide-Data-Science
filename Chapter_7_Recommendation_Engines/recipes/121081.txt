Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup quick-cooking oats
2/3 cup sugar

2 tablespoons orange juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup fresh or frozen unsweetened raspberries

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients.  Combine the egg, milk, oil, orange juice and vanilla; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.  Fold in raspberries and chocolate chips.  Fill paper-lined muffin cups or cups coated with nonstick cooking spray two-thirds full.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.  Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
