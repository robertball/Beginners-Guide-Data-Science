Ingredients:
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
25 pitted Medjool dates
25 pecan halves
2 tablespoons sweetened shredded coconut (optional)

Directions:
Place the chocolate in a glass or plastic bowl. Heat in the microwave for about 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds, or until almost melted. Stir until smooth.
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Stuff each date with a pecan half and place onto the baking sheet. Drizzle the stuffed dates with melted chocolate, then sprinkle with coconut. Place into freezer, and freeze for 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
This chocolate-covered, nut-filled date candy is straight from Israel, an idea I received from my Yemenite neighbor. It's easy and delicious!
