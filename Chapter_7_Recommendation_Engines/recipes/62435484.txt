Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
pepper
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 egg whites
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 pound tilapia fillets
1/4 cup dried bread crumbs
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees Celsius).
Sift or stir flour, salt, pepper, onion and garlic powders together in a shallow dish, and set aside. In a bowl, beat egg whites until white and frothy, stir in lemon juice. In another bowl, combine bread crumbs with basil, cornstarch, and cayenne.
To bread the fillets, dip first into flour, shaking off any excess, then into egg whites, then into bread crumb mixture.
Spray a shallow baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. Lay fillets flat in the dish, tucking under any thinner ends or edges for more even cooking. Drizzle lightly with olive oil. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 or until fish flakes easily with a folk, then set oven to broil until breading is golden brown and crispy.
