Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 cups arborio rice, rinsed in a colander until water runs clear
1 quart low-sodium chicken broth
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper
Salt, to taste

Directions:
Heat butter and oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion; saute until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add rice; stir to coat. (Can turn off heat and let stand several hours.)
Add broth, cover, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until stock is absorbed and rice is creamy and soft with a little "chew" at the center, about 12 minutes. Stir in cheese and pepper; add salt, if necessary. Serve hot.
