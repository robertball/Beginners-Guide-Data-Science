Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 eggs
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 1/2 cups flour
3/4 cup dried unsweetened coconut
1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine butter and sugar in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs one at a time and beat well after each addition. Mix in lemon juice. Mix flour, coconut, cream of tartar, baking soda, lemon zest, and salt in a separate bowl. Add to butter mixture and beat on low speed until everything is well mixed, about 2 minutes.
Drop rounded teaspoonfuls of dough onto 2 ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
