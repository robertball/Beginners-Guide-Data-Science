Description: 
Growing up in South Bend, Indiana, Polish dinner buffets are extremely common at weddings and funerals. Polish noodles are a staple at these events and served alongside Polish sausage, green beans, mashed potatoes and chicken gravy, and fried chicken. While at a Polish meat market, an elderly Polish lady passed this recipe on to me upon request.
