Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter (optional)
1/2 cup chopped onion (optional)
10 cups chopped zucchini
2 cups chicken broth, or more as needed
2 cups beef broth
1 cup cubed beef
3/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 (8 ounce) package kluski noodles

Directions:
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Combine onion, zucchini, chicken broth, beef broth, beef, basil, thyme, rosemary, and white pepper in a stockpot; simmer until beef is cooked through and zucchini is tender, about 30 minutes. Add more chicken broth if mixture becomes too thick.
Bring soup to a boil, add noodles, and cook until noodles are tender, yet firm to the bite, 15 to 20 minutes.
