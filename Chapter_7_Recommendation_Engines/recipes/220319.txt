Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) packages tri-color pasta
1/3 cup olive oil
3 cups fresh broccoli florets
2 (14 ounce) cans water-packed artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
2 cups fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
2 cups chopped fresh parsley
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives
2 cups grated Parmesan cheese
2 cups mayonnaise
1 cup sour cream
1/3 cup red wine vinegar
1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook tri-colored pasta at a boil until tender yet slightly firm, about 10 minutes.
Drain the pasta and rinse in cold water until chilled; drain again.
Transfer the pasta to a very large salad bowl and toss with olive oil until coated.
Mix broccoli florets, artichoke hearts, asparagus, parsley, spinach, and olives into the pasta until thoroughly combined.
Stir Parmesan cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, red wine vinegar, ranch dressing mix, black pepper, and salt together in a bowl until smooth.
Pour the dressing over the pasta mixture and toss to coat. Cover bowl and refrigerate for 12 hours to blend flavors before serving.

Description: 
I make tons of this pasta salad whenever there is a large potluck type gathering, and there is almost always never any left to bring home after.
