Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
4 roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
1 small green bell pepper, diced
1 (14.5 ounce) can fava beans, drained
1 small onion, diced
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/2 cup grated halloumi cheese
1/4 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and return the water to a boil. Stir the olive oil and garlic into the pasta and water; continue cooking until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Reduce the heat to medium-low and return the pasta to the pot.
Stir the tomatoes, bell pepper, fava beans, onion, and lemon juice into the pasta; simmer together until hot and the flavors have melded, 7 to 8 minutes. Top with halloumi cheese and sliced almonds to serve.
