Ingredients:
Chicken Marinade:
3 (5.3 ounce) containers Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1/2 lemon, juiced
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
2 pounds chicken breasts
Quinoa:
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup quinoa
2 cloves garlic, minced
Bowl:
3 small cucumbers, quartered and chopped
2 roasted red peppers, drained and sliced
1 pint grape tomatoes, halved
1 1/4 cups Kalamata olives, sliced
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1/2 cup diced red onion
Dressing:
1 1/4 cups olive oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1 (4 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese
1 lemon, juiced
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic

Directions:
Mix Greek yogurt, oregano, lemon juice, black pepper, and granulated garlic together in a large bowl. Add chicken and coat with yogurt mixture. Cover and refrigerate; let marinate 1 1/2 hours.
Combine chicken broth, quinoa, and garlic in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place peppers with cut sides down onto the prepared baking sheet.
Cook under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Let peppers cool for a few minutes before slicing and placing in a bowl.
Place tomatoes, chickpeas, olives, and onion each into a separate bowl.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Combine olive oil, vinegar, feta cheese, lemon juice, black pepper, oregano, dill, and granulated garlic in a bowl. Whisk dressing, making sure to break up feta cheese.
Grill chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 8 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from heat and let rest about 10 minutes.
Assemble 6 bowls by spooning quinoa into the bottom. Add cucumbers, roasted peppers, tomatoes, olives, chickpeas, and red onions around the perimeter of the bowl. Add chicken.
Whisk dressing really well and spoon equally over bowls.
