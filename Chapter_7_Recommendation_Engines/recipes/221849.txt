Ingredients:
2 pounds carrots, peeled and shredded
1 quart milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup white sugar
10 pods cardamom, crushed, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat a large saucepan over medium heat. Add carrots and milk; cook and stir until milk is absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes. Add oil. Cook, stirring constantly, until carrots are softened and golden-orange, 7 to 10 minutes. Add sugar; cook and stir until dissolved, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle cardamom on top.

Submitter: 
nausheen
Description: 
A popular dessert, especially in winter when carrots are more readily available. The bright color spreads real warmth in the cold winter season. You can serve it with some table cream also. It is also delicious served cold (though traditionally it is served steaming hot).
