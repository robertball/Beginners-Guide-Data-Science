Ingredients:
3 cups white sugar, divided
3/4 cup margarine, divided
2/3 cup evaporated milk, divided
6 ounces semisweet chocolate pieces
1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme (such as Kraft Jet-Puffed), divided
1 teaspoon vanilla extract, divided
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter

Directions:
Combine 1 1/2 cups sugar, 6 tablespoons margarine, and 1/3 cup evaporated milk in a heavy 1 1/2-quart saucepan; bring to full rolling boil, stirring constantly. Continue boiling over medium heat, stirring constantly to prevent scorching, for 4 minutes.
Remove from heat; stir in chocolate pieces until melted. Add 1/2 jar of marshmallow creme and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract; beat until well blended. Pour into a greased 9x13-inch baking pan.
Repeat process with remaining ingredients, substituting peanut butter for chocolate pieces. Spread over chocolate layer.
Let cool at room temperature until set; cut into squares.
