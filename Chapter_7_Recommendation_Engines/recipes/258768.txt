Ingredients:
1 1/2 ounces fresh yeast
1 1/2 cups warm water, divided
5 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup lard, at room temperature, divided
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons grated pecorino Romano cheese
1 (4 ounce) package salami chunks
6 eggs

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm water.
Sift flour and salt onto a clean work surface; make a well in the center. Add yeast mixture and 1/4 cup lard to the well. Mix, adding remaining 1 cup water gradually, until dough comes together. Knead until dough is soft and smooth, about 10 minutes.
Transfer dough to an oiled bowl. Cover with a clean, damp cloth. Let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 90 minutes.
Place dough back on the work surface. Punch gently to deflate; roll into a big rectangle. Brush 1/4 cup lard on top; cover with Parmesan cheese and pepper. Fold dough in half to make a smaller rectangle. Brush 1/4 cup lard on top; cover with pecorino Romano cheese and pepper.
Fold dough again into a smaller rectangle. Brush remaining 1/4 cup lard on top; cover with salami chunks. Cut off a small portion of the dough; reserve.
Roll dough into a long cylinder. Place cylinder a grease ring cake mold. Cover with a damp cloth. Let rise in a warm place until more than doubled in volume, about 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Tuck whole eggs into the ring of dough at even intervals. Divide reserved dough into 12 pieces; roll into small ropes. Lay 2 ropes in a cross shape over each egg to hold them in place.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 1 hour. Let cool before slicing.
