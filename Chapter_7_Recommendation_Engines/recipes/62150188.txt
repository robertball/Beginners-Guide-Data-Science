Southern Cabbage for the Pressure Cooker Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 head of cabbage (chopped into 1 to 2 inch pieces)
3 slices of smoked bacon (cut into 1/2 inch pieces)
1/4 cup salted butter
2 cups chicken broth or stock
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In an 8 quart pressure cooker, sautee the bacon until tender over medium heat.  Do not crisp the bacon, unless you just like it that way.  Add the butter and stir until melted.
Add the cabbage to the pot and pour the chicken broth over the cabbage.  Add salt and pepper to your taste and toss the cabbage until coated with the prior ingredients.
Secure the lid to your pressure cooker, place the regulator on top (depending on the type of pressure cooker you have), and place it on high heat.  When the regulator begins to rock, lower the heat enough to maintain a gentle rocking motion (15 lbs. of pressure).  Important - once the regulator begins to rock, the cooking will be completed in 3 minutes.  After 3 minutes, immediately remove the cooker from the heat and use the quick cool method to reduce the pressure and immediately open the cooker.
Serve immediately with cornbread.
*To make a complete meal, chunk some cooked ham and place it in the pot before cooking.
