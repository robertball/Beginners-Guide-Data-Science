Ingredients:
8 cups fresh apricots, pitted and coarsely chopped
3 tablespoons lemon juice
4 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup heavy cream, whipped (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Toss the apricots with the lemon juice in a bowl; set aside. Combine oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg in a bowl. Cut in the butter with a knife or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Set 2 cups of the oat mixture aside in a bowl. Mix the water into the remaining oat mixture until well blended; pat mixture into the prepared baking dish to make a crust. Spread the apricots evenly over the crust, and top with the reserved crumble mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until the topping is lightly browned, 35 to 40 minutes. Served hot with whipped cream.
