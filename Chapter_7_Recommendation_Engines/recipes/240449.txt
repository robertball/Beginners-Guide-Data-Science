Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 onions, chopped
1 large clove garlic, minced
2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
6 cups vegetable broth
2 cups salsa
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons lime juice

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until soft and translucent, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir sweet potatoes into onion mixture until potatoes are coated completely.
Mix broth into potato mixture, bring to a simmer, and cook until potatoes are soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat; stir salsa, salt, and black pepper into soup.
Pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return to saucepan over medium-low heat; when soup is hot, stir in lime juice.

Description: 
A little bit sweet and a little bit spicy - but you can make it anywhere from mild to wild! Although relatively low-fat, low-calorie and high-fiber, it is delicious, flavorful and satisfying. You may choose to only partially puree for a chunkier texture. This soup freezes very well. Garnish with sour cream, cilantro, sourdough croutons, and cheese.
