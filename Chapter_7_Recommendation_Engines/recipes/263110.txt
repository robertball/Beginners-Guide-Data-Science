Description: 
These cilantro shrimp tacos are sort of a work in progress; I've only made it twice, so I haven't had much time to try different methods. I made it one day when trying to think of something to make for dinner, and I thought it turned out really well. I think it can be easily adjusted to suit different tastes. Serve with lime wedges.
