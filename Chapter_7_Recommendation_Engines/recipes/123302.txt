Ingredients:
1 cup water
6 tablespoons butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 eggs
FILLING:
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons baking cocoa
GLAZE:
1 (1 ounce) square unsweetened chocolate
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
In a saucepan over medium heat, bring water and butter to a boil. Add flour and salt all at once; stir until a smooth ball forms. Remove from the heat; let stand 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Beat until smooth.
Cover a baking sheet with foil; grease foil. Drop batter into six mounds onto foil. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F; bake 30 minutes longer. Remove puffs to a wire rack. Immediately cut a slit in each for steam to escape.
In a mixing bowl, beat cream until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar and cocoa, beating until almost stiff. Split puffs and remove soft dough. Add filling; replace tops. Melt chocolate and butter; stir in sugar and water. Drizzle over puffs. Chill.
