Ingredients:
3/4 cup grated Cheddar
1/2 cup grated Monterey Jack
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp white pepper
1 1/2 cups half and half
1 4 oz can diced green chilies
3-4 Tbsp chopped ripe olives
4-5 Tbsp chopped green onions, whites and greens
chopped jalapenos to taste (optional)
pastry for a deep dish pie

Directions:
Pre-bake the pie crust, 6 - 8 minutes or until lightly browned.
Mix cheeses together and spread on bottom of pastry shell.
In medium bowl, mix eggs, salt, pepper, half and half, chilies, olives and onions.  Pour into pie shell.  Use a crust guard to prevent over-browning.
Bake in pre-heated, 350 oven for 45 minues to one hour or until knife comes out clean. (In my oven, it's usually 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes.)
Let sit 5-10 minutes to set.
Serve with sour cream and salsa.
