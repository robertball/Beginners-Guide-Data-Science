Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 (2 pound) boneless pork loin roast, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 (14.5 ounce) cans enchilada sauce
3 (15.5 ounce) cans white hominy, drained
1 onion, sliced
1/2 cup green chilies, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat the canola oil in a skillet over high heat. Add the pork; cook and stir just until meat is browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.
Place the meat in a 4 quart slow cooker. Pour the enchilada sauce over the meat. Top with the hominy, onion, chilies, garlic, cayenne pepper, and oregano. Pour in enough water to fill the slow cooker.
Cover, and cook on High for 6 to 7 hours. Stir in the salt. Cook on Low for 30 minutes more.
