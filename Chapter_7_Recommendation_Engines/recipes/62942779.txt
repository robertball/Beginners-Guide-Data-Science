Ingredients:
1 (29 ounce) can pumpkin puree
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1   teaspoon vanilla extract
salt to taste
1 1/4 cups white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
3 eggs
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix with pudding
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a mixing bowl, blend pumpkin, spices, vanilla, salt, sugars, eggs and milk. Pour mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Using a pastry blender, cut in 1/2 cup of softened (not melted) butter into the dry cake mix until crumbly. Sprinkle the cake mixture and nuts over the batter. Drizzle 1/2 cup of melted butter evenly over the cake.
Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 60 minutes and let cool. The cake will be "liquidy" at first, but will solidify as it cools.
