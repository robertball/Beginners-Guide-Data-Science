Ingredients:
5 matzo sheets
1 cup milk, or more as needed
2 eggs
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon, or to taste
2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Pass each matzo sheet under cool running water briefly, then crumble into a large bowl. Stir in 1 cup milk, eggs, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla extract to form evenly moistened batter. Add more milk if batter is too dry.
Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Scoop a generous spoonful of dough onto skillet and flatten with a spatula. Cook until golden brown on each side, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining batter.
