Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups pecans
1 tablespoon canola oil
1/4 cup dark maple syrup
2 tablespoons Dutch-processed unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoons hemp protein powder
10 dried apple slices, minced
2 tablespoons flax seeds
2/3 cup honey graham cracker crumbs
2 tablespoons hulled unsalted sunflower seeds
2 tablespoons finely chopped walnuts
2/3 cup puffed quinoa cereal
1/4 cup almond flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir pecans until toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Combine toasted pecans and canola oil in a mini food processor and pulse until smooth (a little graininess is fine).
Mix pecan mixture, maple syrup, cocoa powder, and hemp protein powder together in a bowl. One by one, add apple slices, flax seeds, graham cracker crumbs, sunflower seeds, walnuts, and puffed quinoa.
Whisk almond flour and cinnamon together in a small bowl.
Form pecan mixture into 1-inch balls and roll in the cinnamon mixture until coated. Freeze energy bites until firm, at least 1 hour.
