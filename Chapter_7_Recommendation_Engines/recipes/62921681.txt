Ingredients:
Romaine Lettuce 10oz bag
1 can black beans drained and rinsed (15 oz)
Cherry tomatoes sliced in half
Frozen corn 10 oz (I leave frozen for crunchiness)
3/4 cup thinly sliced radishes
1/2 small red onion chopped
1 ripe avocado cubed
1 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup feta Cheese (crumbled)
Dressing:
1/4 cup Crisco Vegetable Oil
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
2 tbsps honey
2 tbsps finely diced cilantro
2 tsps minced garlic (in jar)

Directions:
Put all of salad ingredients together, except corn.
Mix dressing ingredients separately and add to salad right before serving (otherwise salad will wilt rapidly)
Add frozen corn right before serving as well.
