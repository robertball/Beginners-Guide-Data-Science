Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound processed cheese (such as Velveeta®), cubed
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chiles (such as Rotel®)
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
1/2 cup sour cream
1/3 cup 2% milk
1/3 (8 ounce) package cold cream cheese, cubed
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 poblano pepper, seeded and chopped
1/2 yellow onion, chopped
2 small jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped
1/3 cup canned chopped green chiles
2 teaspoons garlic, minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 cup Mexican-style shredded four-cheese blend

Directions:
Turn a slow cooker (such as Crock Pot(R)) on High; coat lightly with cooking spray. Fill with processed cheese, mushroom soup, diced tomatoes with green chiles, evaporated milk, sour cream, milk, and cream cheese. Cover with the lid. Cook until mostly melted, about 1 hour.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute poblano peppers, yellow onion, and jalapeno peppers until softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to the slow cooker; add green chiles, garlic, and cilantro. Cover and continue cooking until cheese is completely melted, about 20 minutes. Add the Mexican cheese blend; stir until heated through, about 10 minutes more.

Description: 
After lots of tweaking trying to replicate my favorite Mexican restaurant's recipe, I came up with this masterpiece! It's quite addictive - just warning! And I think it turned out even better than my favorite restaurant's version. I'm confident this will become your go-to queso recipe. Enjoy!
