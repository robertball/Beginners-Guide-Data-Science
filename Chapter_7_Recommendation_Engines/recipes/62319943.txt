Ingredients:
1 T EVOO
1 onion, chopped
2 C rice (white or brown)
1/2 C slivered almonds
4 t chicken bullion (or equivalent to make 4C broth total)
1 T Italian seasoning
4 C cold water

Directions:
This recipe was made using a simple rice cooker - just one button with 'cook' and 'warm' settings.
Plug in the cooker, switch to 'cook' and add oil and onions - leave lid up.  Cooker will slowly heat and in around 5 minutes start to sautee.  *Be sure to use a wooden or plastic spoon to protect your non-stick finish!* Sautee onions for just a couple of minutes, until they just begin to soften.  Add rice and mix well.
Continue to sautee until cooker switches itself to 'warm'.  Add bullion, italian seasoning and almonds.  Stir well, and cook for 1-2 minutes more (cooker will still be hot).
Add cold water and stir.  The water will cool the cooker enough that you can close the lid, switch to cook, and leave the pilaf until it's done!
Allow appx. 20-30 minutes cooking time for white rice, and 40-50 min for brown.  You can make this rice slightly ahead of time, because the cooker will keep it nice and hot while you finish dinner - enjoy!

Description: 
Cooking the whole dish in the rice cooker saves you another pot to wash, and you don't have to watch the stove!  This recipe also works on the stove-top with no changes to ingredients!
