Ingredients:
1/2 lb. bacon
1 14-oz. can Frank's sauerkraut (or other brand)
1/2 c. light brown sugar

Directions:
Brown bacon strips in frying pan until very crisp.  Remove bacon from pan and allow to drain on paper towel.  Place sauerkraut in medium saucepan.  Add 1/4 cup bacon drippings and brown sugar.  Stir well and heat through.  This is best prepared a day in advance to allow the flavors to "marry."

Description: 
Even those who would normally say no thank you to a portion of sauerkraut are turned on to this delicious and simple twist of this usually harsh condiment that is an acquired taste.
