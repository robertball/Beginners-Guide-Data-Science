Ingredients:
1 pound swordfish, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 pound halibut, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 pound squid, cut into thin rings
3 limes, juiced
1 bunch cilantro, chopped
1/2 cup bloody mary mix (such as Mr. & Mrs. TÂ®)
1/2 cup chopped pimento-stuffed green olives
1/2 cup chopped black olives
1/2 cup chopped yellow onion
1/2 cup chopped pimento peppers
1/2 cup diced canned jalapeno peppers
1/4 cup frozen corn kernels, or to taste
1/4 cup frozen peas, or to taste
1 tablespoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon ground cumin, or as needed

Directions:
Put swordfish, halibut, and squid in a large, resealable plastic bag; add lime juice and mix to coat seafood with the lime juice, squeeze bag to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours to overnight.
Pour seafood mixture into a large serving bowl. Stir cilantro, bloody mary mix, green olives, black olives, yellow onion, pimento peppers, jalapeno peppers, corn, peas, cumin seeds, and Worcestershire sauce with the seafood mixture. Sprinkle ground cumin over the mixture to cover completely.

Description: 
Uncle Bob makes his ceviche with fresh fish straight off the boat on Catalina Island, but he promises that you'll have good results if you make good friends with your local grocery store's fishmonger, too! Serve with tortilla chips.
