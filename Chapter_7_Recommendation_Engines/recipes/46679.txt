Ingredients:
9 lasagna noodles
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (16 ounce) can refried black beans
2 3/4 cups canned tomato sauce
1/2 cup salsa
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided
1 1/2 cups cottage cheese
1 cup ricotta cheese
1/4 cup sour cream
8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
1/4 cup sliced ripe olives
8 sprigs fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Coat a large skillet with non-stick cooking spray, and place over medium heat. Saute onion, red bell pepper, corn and garlic until tender. Stir in black beans, refried beans, tomato sauce, salsa and 1/4 cup cilantro. Cook until heated through and slightly thickened; set aside.
In a large bowl, combine cottage cheese, ricotta, sour cream, shredded Monterey Jack cheese and remaining 1/4 cup chopped cilantro; set aside.
Coat a 9x13 inch casserole dish with non-stick cooking spray. Arrange 3 of the cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of the dish, cutting to fit if necessary. Spread with 1/3 of the bean mixture, then 1/3 of the cheese mixture. Repeat layers twice more.
Cover, and bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. Garnish with sliced black olives and sprigs of cilantro.

Lasagna with a Southwest twist. This can be frozen unbaked and kept for up to a month. Simply thaw in refrigerator overnight and bake as directed.  Tastes even better reheated the second day!
