Ingredients:
Fruit Mixture
3 apples, peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
3 pears, peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
1 tbsp. lemon juice
1 cup cranberries
1/3 cup granulated white sugar
1 tbsp. cornstarch
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
Dash salt
Topping
1/2 cup Fiber One Original bran cereal, lightly crushed
1/4 cup old-fashioned oats
2 tbsp. brown sugar (not packed)
2 tbsp. light whipped butter or light buttery spread (like Brummel & Brown), room temperature
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/8 tsp. salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray an 8" X 8" baking pan with nonstick spray and set aside.
Put apple and pear slices in a large bowl and toss to coat with lemon juice. Add all remaining ingredients for the fruit mixture. Toss until thoroughly mixed. Transfer to the baking pan, and cover pan with aluminum foil.
Bake in the oven for 30 minutes, or until fruit mixture has softened. (Leave oven on after removing the pan.)
Meanwhile, in another bowl, combine all ingredients for topping. Stir until well mixed and crumbly. Set aside.
Once fruit mixture has softened, carefully remove foil from the pan and mix well. Smooth surface with the back of a spoon or spatula. Sprinkle topping over the fruit mixture.
Return pan to the oven and bake, uncovered, until top is slightly crisp, about 15 minutes.
Allow to cool slightly. Then dig in!
