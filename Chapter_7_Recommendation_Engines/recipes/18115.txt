Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups buttermilk baking mix
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
2/3 cup milk
1/2 tablespoon malt vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease two baking sheets.
In a large bowl, stir together baking mix, baking powder and salt. Mix in milk and vinegar until a loose dough forms. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly; about 10 times. Break dough apart into 12 equal pieces and place on prepared baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until light brown.
