Ingredients:
6 to 8 tart apples, peeled, cored, and thinly sliced (6 cups) (we used Granny Smiths)
1 c sugar
2 T flour
1 t ground cinnamon
1/8 t ground nutmeg
Dash of salt
2 T butter
Pastry for a 2-crust pie (see "Grandma's Pastry Crust"

Directions:
Combine sugar, flour, spices and salt; mix well.
Add to sliced apples; toss to coat well.
Set aside while preparing pie crust.
Line pie plate with pastry, fill with apple filling and dot with butter.
(If not baking right away, brush bottom crust with beaten egg whites before adding filling.  This keeps the bottom crust from getting soggy.)
Add top crust of pastry, seal edges and poke holes in top for venting of steam.
Sprinkle with sugar.
Bake at 400 degrees for 50 minutes or until golden brown.
