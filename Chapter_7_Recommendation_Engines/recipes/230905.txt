Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 teaspoons Asian (toasted) sesame oil
2 teaspoons molasses
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
6 thin slices fresh ginger, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 1-inch-thick tuna steaks, thawed

Directions:
Mix soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, sesame oil, molasses, cayenne pepper, ginger, and garlic together in a bowl.
Place tuna steaks in a large resealable bag or airtight container; pour marinade over steaks. Marinate steaks at room temperature for 20 minutes.
Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Remove steaks from marinade and arrange in the hot pan; gently shake pan to avoid sticking. Cook approximately 1 1/2 minutes and flip. Cook other side until tuna is desired doneness, 1 to 2 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).

Description: 
These marinated tuna steaks, served rare, taste 'fancy' but are very easy to cook. Even my husband, who doesn't like most cooked fish, enjoys these steaks. A sprinkling of cracked black pepper is a good finisher for this dish.
