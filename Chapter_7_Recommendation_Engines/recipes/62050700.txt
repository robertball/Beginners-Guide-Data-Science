Ingredients:
1 Angel Food Cake Mix
2 T. Powdered Sugar
1 pt. fresh Strawberries
1 pt. Whipping Cream
1 1/2 T. Powdered Sugar
Red Food Coloring

Directions:
Lightly grease a 17"x11 3/8"x3/4" jelly roll pan.  Line bottom with waxed paper.  Prepare cake mix according to package directions & spread 3/4 of batter in pan.  Bake at 375 for 15-17 minutes or till firm to touch.  Do not overbake.  While cake is baking, sift 2 T. powdered sugar onto clean cloth towel (big enough to hold cake).  When cake is done, loosen cake & turn onto "floured" towel.  Peel waxed paper off.  Carefully trim brown edges off.  Roll cake in towel from narrow end. Cool on rack, seam side down for 20 min.
Stem & wash berries.  Retain a few whole berries for garnish; slice remaiing berries & add 2 T. powdered sugar, coating berries well.  Whip cream until soft peaks form.  Set aside 1 1/2 C. whipped cream.  Fold sliced berries into whipped cream.  Unroll cooled cake & spread berry/whipped cream mixture to within 1/2" of edges; reroll.  Add a couple of drops of food coloring to reserved whipped cream to tint pink.
Place seam side down on platter.  Frost with pink tinted reserved whipped cream.  Garnish with reserved whole berries.
