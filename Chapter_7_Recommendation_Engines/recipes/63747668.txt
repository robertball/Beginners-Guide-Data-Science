8 oz ricotta cheese
1 tbsp olive oil
6 eggs whisked

Place sliced tomatoes in other half, cook approximately 1 minute on each side.  Remove tomatoes from pan. Spread onion over bottom of pan. Pour beaten eggs over onions; arrange tomatoes evenly over eggs; tear basil leaves and dot evenly over frittata. Take spoonfuls of ricotta and place evenly over egg mixture. Turn heat to medium low, cook until bottom of eggs begin to set; remove from burner and place mixture in oven for 18-20 minutes.

Description: 
Easy frittata; can easily substitute asparagus, broccoli--whatever left over veggies you have from last night's dinner. Please, place ricotta cheese in spoonfuls randomly over dish.  Gives the taste buds a cheese explosion.
