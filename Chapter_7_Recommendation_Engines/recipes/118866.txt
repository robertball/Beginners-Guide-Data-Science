Ingredients:
8 ounces uncooked linguine
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 cup water
1/2 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 1/2 pounds boneless beef top sirloin steak, cut into thin strips
2 tablespoons canola oil
1/2 cup julienned green pepper
1/2 cup julienned sweet red pepper
2 cloves garlic cloves, minced
2 cups fresh or frozen snow peas, halved if large

Cook linguine according to package directions; drain. In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch, pepper and cayenne. Stir in water and soy sauce until smooth; set aside.
In a large nonstick skillet or wok, stir-fry beef in hot oil for 4-5 minutes or until no longer pink. Using a slotted spoon, remove meat and set aside. Add the peppers and garlic; stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the snow peas and mushrooms; stir-fry for 2-3 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender.
Stir soy sauce mixture and add to vegetables. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Stir in beef and linguine; heat through.
