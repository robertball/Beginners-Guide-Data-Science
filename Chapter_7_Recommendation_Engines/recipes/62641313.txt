https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 lbs pickling onions, peeled
1 1/2 pints malt vinegar or 1 1/2 pints pickling vinegar
2 tablespoons ready-mixed pickling spices (OR 2 tablespoons of your your own mix using -- green, white and black peppercorns, coriander seeds,)

Directions:
Peel the onions and pack one third of them tightly into a large Kilner jar or preserves jar. (You can also use several smaller jars if you wish.).
Scatter one third of the pickling spices over the top of the first layer of onions and continue packing the onions in to the jar - adding two more layers of pickling spices as you go.
Pour the malt vinegar into the jar, making sure that all the onions are covered by the vinegar.
Add some extra vinegar if there is not quite enough.
Seal the jar and store in a dark, cool place for at least 6 weeks before using the pickled onions.
Brining Notes:.
You need to begin 2 days ahead by placing the onions in a large non-metallic bowl. Then mix 2 pints of water with 4 ozs of salt together, pour this over the onions and leave them covered with a cloth for 2 days.
Drain the onions and dry them well, continue as above. These onions will last for up to 2 years + in ideal conditions - a dark and cool pantry or store room.

Description: 
Please note, this is an easy and therefore a NON BRINING method; they will last for about 6 to 9 months in ideal conditions, a cool and dark pantry or store cupboard. If you wish to make these in bulk to last a couple of years, you need to brine the onions first; I have added brining notes at the end of the recipe instructions.
