Ingredients:
2 sticks butter melted
1 egg
1 tbsp vanilla extract
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup cocoa powder
1 1/2 cups cake flour
1 pound of strawberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Melt butter. let cool slightly.
In seperate bowl whisk eggs and gradually whisk in little of the melted butter. Add to the rest of the butter. (This keeps the egg from cooking) stir in vanilla.
Puree two strawberries and mix in with liquid mixture.
With a mixer add sugar and cocoa to the liquid mixture.
Gradually add in the cake flour. If nessecary add a little more flour. You want this mixture to be in between a cake batter and a cookie dough. It needs to be a little dryer due to the strawberries.
Cut up strawberrys and stir into brownies.
Pour into a buttered pie pan or if not available a baking dish.
Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out pretty much clean. (about 30 minutes standard. Though if it is really humid out it could take a little longer.)

Description: 
These brownies are light and crumbley, with a punch of strawberry flavor. I made them one night with my boyfriends daughter trying to teach her that there are no limits on what can be used when baking and cooking. I decided to use the fresh strawberries I had just purchased. I wouldn't suggest using frozen strawberrys but if you do defrost and drain well.
