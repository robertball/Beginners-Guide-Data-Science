Description: 
This is a delicious soup.  It is nothing like chili if made per directions. I came up with this because I had some steak I needed to use and I didn't feel like browning ground beef before making a taco soup.  I like to top it with sour cream, cheddar cheese, and corn chips.  It also goes great with corn bread. Perfect for a chilly night.  I hope you enjoy it.
