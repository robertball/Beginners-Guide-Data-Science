Ingredients:
One jar Herdez Roasted Pasilla Chile Cooking Sauce
3 pounds of beef ribs
8 cups of beef broth
1 onion, sliced

cilantro, to garnish

Directions:
Place broth in a big pot.
Add onion and beef.
Add water to cover beef.
Bring to boil.
Turn down the temperature and simmer on low heat until the meat pulls away from the bone. (This will take 3 to 4 hours.)
Remove beef and place in a baking dish.
Mix sauce and brown sugar. Pour over meat.
Bake at 450 degrees farenheit, until hot. (About 15 minutes.)
Sprinkle with chopped cilantro to garnish.
