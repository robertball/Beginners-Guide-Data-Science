Ingredients:
4 pounds tri-tip roast
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect heat, and lightly oil grate.
In a small bowl, mix together the garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, and salt.  Rub mixture all over the roast.
Place the roast, fat side up on the hot grill with a pan underneath it to catch the drippings. Bake/roast for 4 to 6 hours, or until done. Check for doneness with a meat thermometer. Minimum temperature should be around 165 degrees F (78 degrees C).
