Description: 
What works with cabbage as well as bacon? Smoked turkey, of course. You won't believe how satisfying this low-carb soup is! It starts with smoked turkey legs, carrots, onions, and celery slow-cooked in a chicken broth with cabbage added at the last hour.  You can serve with toasted french or ciabatta bread if you really need to carb it up.
