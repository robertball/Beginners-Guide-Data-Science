Ingredients:
1/2 cup diced fresh pineapple
1/2 cup diced fresh mango
1/2 cup peeled and diced cucumber
1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
4 teaspoons fresh lime juice
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
salt and pepper to taste
1 pound sea scallops, rinsed and drained

Directions:
Combine the pineapple, mango, cucumber, bell pepper, bell pepper, cilantro, lime juice and jalapeno. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and set aside.
Heat a large, nonstick fry pan over medium-high heat. Coat the pan with cooking spray. Season the scallops with salt and pepper. Add half of the scallops to the pan; sear until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the scallops to a warmed plate; set aside. Repeat with the remaining scallops.
Divide the scallops among four warmed plates. Spoon the salsa over the scallops, and serve immediately.

Description: 
The delicious taste of scallops is perfectly complemented by a wonderful fresh fruit salsa in this quick but elegant dish. Be sure to use large, plump sea scallops rather than smaller bay scallops and take care not to overcook the scallops; they should remain tender and moist. Feel free to substitute any of your favorite exotic fruits for the pineapple and mango in the salsa.
