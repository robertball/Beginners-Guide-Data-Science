Ingredients:
1 1/3 c butter, cold, cut into small cubes
1 c sugar
1 c brown sugar, packed
2 eggs, room temperature
2 tsp vanilla
2 T evaporated milk
1 t soda
1/2 t sea salt
3 c all purpose flour
12 oz chocolate chips (I used minis)

Directions:
Cream butter and sugars 2-3 min or until light and fluffy.  Add eggs, vanilla, and milk; mix well.  Whisk dry ingredients together in a small bowl, then add to creamed mixture.  Stir until just combined.  Refrigerate the dough, well covered, for 48 hrs.
Preheat oven to 350.  Form rounded balls of dough about 1 1/2 inches in diameter and bake about 8-9 min.  (Remove when edges are beginning to become a little brown, but center does not look done).  Keep on cookie sheet 2-3 minutes or until set.  Remove and cool on paper towels.
This cookie is flat, but has crisp edges with a soft, gooey center.  Fabulous.

Description: 
I combined some recipes into this version.  Really really really good.  But the secret is to refrigerate the dough 48 hrs before baking.  Patience patience.
