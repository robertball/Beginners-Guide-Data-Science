Ingredients:
25 ounces Yukon Gold potatoes
1 tablespoon rock salt
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
2 cloves garlic, peeled and slightly crushed
2 green onions (white part only), chopped
1/2 cup very finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:
Combine potatoes and salt in a large pot filled with cold water. Bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender, but not mushy, about 10 minutes depending on size. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.
While potatoes are cooking, whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil and white wine vinegar together in a small bowl. Add  garlic and set aside.
Peel cooked and cooled potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine potatoes, green onions, and parsley in a bowl and lightly toss. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil mixture and lightly toss, taking care not to break the potatoes.
Top with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and red pepper flakes right before serving.

Description: 
Born vegan, this is a classic potato salad that can be found on Italian tables from the North to the South. In Italy, you'll find it everywhere: formal luncheons, family get-togethers, weeknight dinners, and even in hospital and school cafeterias. Many Italians add cooked green beans. Leftovers are delicious tossed with pesto and pasta. Buon appetito!
