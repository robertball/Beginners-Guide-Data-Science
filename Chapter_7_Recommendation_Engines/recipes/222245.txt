Ingredients:
6 cups all-purpose flour
3 cups cornmeal
1 cup white sugar
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup baking powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
5 eggs
3 bell peppers, minced
3 onions, minced
1 (14 ounce) can cream-style corn
1 (14 ounce) can whole kernel corn
1 cup chopped pimento peppers
2 quarts vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Mix flour, cornmeal, sugar, Parmesan cheese, baking powder, salt, black pepper, eggs, bell peppers, onions, cream-style corn, whole kernel corn, and pimento peppers in a large bowl.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Drop 6 to 8 tablespoon-sized balls of batter into the hot oil; fry until each hush puppy is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove hush puppies with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with any remaining batter.
