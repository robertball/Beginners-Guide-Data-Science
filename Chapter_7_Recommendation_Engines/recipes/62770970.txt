2 pounds ground turkey
1 envelope Ranch dressing mix
8 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl.
Form mixture into 6 large patties, or 5 smaller ones, ensuring even thickness.
Place onto a foil lined cookie sheet and freeze for one hour.  Preheat a grill to medium-high.
Remove the patties from the freezer and place on grill.  Cook for 6-8 minutes per side, depending on thickness of patties, or untill no longer pink in the middle.
Remove from heat and allow to rest 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
These turkey burgers have the cheese and bacon built right into the patty, ensuring they never dry out.  And the ranch flavour is so good, you won't want to put anything else on them.
