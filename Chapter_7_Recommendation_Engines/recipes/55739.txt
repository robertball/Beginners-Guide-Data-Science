Ingredients:
1/2 cup fat-skimmed chicken broth
2 (7 ounce) packages fresh udon noodles
1 teaspoon Asian (toasted) sesame oil
1 cup shredded skinned cooked chicken
1/4 pound shelled cooked tiny shrimp, rinsed and drained
1 cup diagonally sliced green onions (including tops)
2 teaspoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon prepared sweet-hot mustard

Directions:
In a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat, bring broth and noodles to a boil; stir gently to separate noodles. Boil until liquid is almost gone, about 4 minutes, then add oil.
Stir often until noodles are lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Add chicken, shrimp, and green onions, and stir until hot.
Spoon into wide bowls. Mix soy sauce and mustard and add to taste.
