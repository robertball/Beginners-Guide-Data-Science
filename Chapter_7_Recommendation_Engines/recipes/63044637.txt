Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil
2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
1/2 tbsp ginger, minced
1/2 cup carrot, finely diced
1/4 cup onion, finely diced
1/2 cup celery, finely diced
1 can (284 ml/10 oz) chicken broth
1 box (900 ml) of beef broth
1/4 tsp cumin
1 tbsp parsley (dried or fresh)
pepper to taste
1/2 to 1 cup red or white wine (optional and to your preference for added flavour)

Directions:
On medium to high heat, in a saucepan heat up olive oil than add minced garlic and ginger.  Toss around for a minute and add diced onions, carrots and celery.  Once they get softened up (not browned) throw in your cumin and some pepper to taste.  Do not use salt as the broth will provide plenty. Give your spices a stir through the veggies, and add your wine now if you want the wine flavour.  Next add your broth and parsley.  Stir and simmer for about 15 minutes and transfer to your fondue pot.  You can make this ahead and when you are getting ready to serve you can heat it up and transfer broth to the fondue pot.

Description: 
This is the fondue broth recipe I used for a New Year's Eve party.  Everyone loved this simple recipe. We cooked thinly sliced fondue beef, cubed chicken, mushrooms, onion, thinly sliced carrots, peppers, and fresh tortellini three cheese pasta. You could also use it with seafood. It was delicious and so much fun!
