Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 large onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
6 cups chicken stock, divided
2 cups chopped fiddlehead ferns
1 carrot, diced
1 potato, diced
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce (optional)
1 tablespoon soy sauce (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat until foamy, about 1 minute. Stir in onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes.
Pour 4 cups chicken stock into the onion mixture, and bring to a full boil; stir in fiddleheads, carrot, and potato. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.
Blend soup until smooth with a hand blender. Stir in cream; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Taste soup, and stir in Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. If you prefer a thinner soup, add additional chicken stock up to 2 cups. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with Cheddar cheese.

Description: 
Early spring in New Brunswick is fiddlehead season. They grow wild in swampy areas and are only available for a short time. This recipe is one of the best soups I have ever made and always gets rave reviews.
