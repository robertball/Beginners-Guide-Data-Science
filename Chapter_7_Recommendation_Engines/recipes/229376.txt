Ingredients:
1 cup cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup beer (brown ale- or pilsner-style)
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 eggs, beaten
1/3 cup white sugar
4 green onions, chopped
1 fresh jalapeno pepper, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan.
Whisk cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
Mix buttermilk, beer, and melted butter in a separate bowl; gradually stir into the cornmeal mixture to incorporate into a batter. Add eggs and sugar to the batter; stir. Fold green onions and jalapeno pepper through the batter; pour into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
