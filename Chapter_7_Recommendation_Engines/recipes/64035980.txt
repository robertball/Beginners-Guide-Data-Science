Ingredients:
1 cup Black chickpeas
1 1/2 teaspoons Salt
1/2 teaspoon Baking soda
1 Medium-sized onion, peeled and chopped
1 Fresh ginger about 1 inch - peeled and chopped
3 tablespoons Vegetable oil
A generous pinch ground asafetida or tiny lump asafetida
1/4 teaspoon Whole cumin seeds
4 Medium-sized potatoes - peeled and quartered
1 teaspoon Ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon Ground turmeric
1 teaspoon Garam masala
1/4 teaspoon Cayenne pepper
3 tablespoons Tamarind paste

Directions:
Sort and clean the chickpeas and wash them under cold water. Drain. Soak for 24 hours in a bowl containing 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, the baking soda, and a quart of water. Place chopped onion, garlic, and ginger in the container of a blender with 3 tablespoons of water. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste. In a 4-quart pot, heat the oil over a medium-high flame.
Once oil is very hot, put in asafetida and cumin seeds. After a few seconds, when the asafetida expands and the cumin darkens, put in the paste from the blender, but take great care to avoid splatter. Fry, stirring, for about 5 minutes. Now drain the chickpeas and add them to the pot. Also put in the potatoes, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, 1 teaspoon salt, the cayenne pepper, and 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil. Cover, and allow to simmer gently for 1 hour. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons of tamarind paste to chickpeas according to tartness desired. Stir. Check salt. Cook for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Can be served with either chapati/roti or basmati rice.
