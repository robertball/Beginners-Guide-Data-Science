Ingredients:
4 chicken thighs,
1 (6 oz) frozen lemonade concentrate, thawed
5 Tbsp brown sugar
1/4 cup ketchup
2 Tbsp white vinegar
2 Tbsp cornstarch
2 Tbsp cold water
Sesame seeds

Directions:
Spray slow cooker with non-stick cooking spray. Place chicken thighs in the bottom of your slow cooker. Combine lemonade, brown sugar, ketchup, and vinegar in a bowl. Mix well and pour over chicken thighs. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or high 3-4 hours. Remove chicken from the slow cooker and shred Set aside and keep warm. Mix cornstarch and cold water together. Simmer the remainder of the sauce over medium heat on your stove top and add cornstarch mixture to the sauce, stirring until incorporated. Let sauce cook over medium heat for a couple minutes (about 5) or until the sauce has thickened. Pour sauce over chicken, sprinkle with sesame seeds, and serve.
*If you didn’t want to cook your sauce on your stove top, you could take your chicken thighs out of the slow cooker and add your cornstarch mixture to the sauce that is left in the slow cooker. Stir it in, then cook it on high for about 30 minutes. It should thicken up during that time
