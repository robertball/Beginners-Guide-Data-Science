Image:

Ingredients:
1 pound ground chicken
1/2 cup minced onion
1 clove minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper (white or black)
1 egg
2 tablespoons parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons unseasoned bread crumbs
2 bell peppers

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Spray 8" x 8" baking pan with vegetable spray.
Cut off both ends of the peppers and remove the cores without tearing pepper.
Cut each bell pepper crosswise into 1 to 1 1/2 in rings and set aside.
In a medium bowl, mix all ingredients until well blended.
Place one pepper ring into your palm and using a large spoon, fill it with one fourth of the chicken mixture.
Make sure to press the mixture into the pepper so that it fills the entire ring evenly with a slightly rounded top.
Place in prepared pan and spray the top of each chicken ring with vegetable spray.
Since there is no fat in the mixture, the vegetable spray will produce a nice, evenly browned top.
Bake 45 - 50 minutes.

Description: 
This delicious recipe is one I concocted as a substitute for the more fat laden family meat loaf.  It's low calorie, low fat and very pretty cooked in bell pepper rings. Red bell peppers are milder in flavor than green, so they are my preference, but you can use red, green, yellow, orange or even purple.
