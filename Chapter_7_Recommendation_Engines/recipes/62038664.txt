Ingredients:
2/3 cup heavy cream
9 oz. unsweetened chocolate, broken into squares
3 T. dark rum or Kahlua
3-4 T. chocolate sprinkles
3-4 T. unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
1.  Pour cream into a heavy-bottomed saucepand and bring just to a boil over low heat.
2.  Remove from heat and, using a wooden spoon, stir in chocolate.  Return to heat and stir until chocolate melts.
3.  Remove from heat and stir in rum or Kahlua.  Pour mixture into small, deep bowl and then cover.  Set aside to cool for about 1 hour, then chill mixture for at least 1 hour or until chocolate has set.
4.  Using melon scoop, scoop out balls of mixture and place on waxed paper (dip scoop in warm water before each truffle so they come out more easily).
5.  Roll truffles into sprinkles.
6.  Sprinkle cocoa powder over truffles.  Store truffles in airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to gift wrap.
7.  Wrap each truffle in a square of foil and place in stocking or gift container.
