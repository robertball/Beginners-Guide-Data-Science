Ingredients:
3 pounds pork back ribs, separated and fat trimmed
1 (12.5 ounce) can pineapple tidbits, drained
1 cup apricot jam
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange ribs in a single layer in a roasting pan.
Stir pineapple, jam, soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl; pour over ribs.
Bake in the preheated oven, basting every 15 minutes, until ribs are glazed and pull away easily from the bone, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
