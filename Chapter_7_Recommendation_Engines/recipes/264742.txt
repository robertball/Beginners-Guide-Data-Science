Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
lemon, juiced
3 cloves garlic, pressed, or more to taste
salt and pepper to taste
16 chicken wings
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Combine olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Add chicken wings, cover with a plate or plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Remove chicken wings from the marinade and place on the prepared baking sheet
Broil until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, approximately 7 minutes, flipping chicken wings once after 4 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with parsley.
