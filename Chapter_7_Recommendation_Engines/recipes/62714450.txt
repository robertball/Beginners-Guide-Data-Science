Ingredients:
6 large uncooked potatoes
1-2 c. sun dried tomatoes (to taste)
Freshly chopped basil (to taste)
1 tsp. sea salt
1/2 tsp. freshly ground pepper (or to taste)
4 oz, low-fat Swiss cheese
4 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan cheese
4 tbsp. bread crumbs
2 c. sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat a 9x13 inch baking pan with cooking spray; set aside.
Peel and cut potatoes crosswise in 1/4 inch thick rounds; place in saucepan and add enough water to just cover.  Cook over medium-high heat and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are fork-tender (don't over-cook) about 8 minutes.
Drain and let cool and transfer to a large bowl.
Add sun dried tomatoes, sour cream, basil, salt and pepper and gently toss to combine.
Either shred Swiss cheese and incorporate into the above mixture and transfer to baking dish or transfer the potato mixture to the dish and top with with Swiss cheese.  Combine bread crumbs and Parmesan and sprinkle mixture over top of potato mixture.  Bake until top is golden brown, 40 minutes.  Cut into 12 slices and serve.
