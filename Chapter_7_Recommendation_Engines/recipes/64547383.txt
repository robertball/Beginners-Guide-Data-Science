Ingredients:
3 Tbsp olive oil
1/2 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into small pieces
1 small cabbage

3 Tbsp paprika
1 can (15 oz) stewed tomatoes
3 bay leaves
1 cup chicken stock
salt, pepper
chopped fresh parsley to garnish

Directions:
Heat large saute pan on medium-high heat. Add olive oil and chicken. Fry for 5-7 minutes or until browned.
Meanwhile, slice the cabbage into thin strips, just like you would for coleslaw.
Add cabbage and paprika to the chicken. Stir, and saute for another five to ten minutes.
Add tomato, chicken stock, carrots and bay leaves. Season with some salt and pepper. Stir everything together. Reduce heat to low, and cover with a tight lid.
Cook stirring occasionally for about 45 minutes, until there is no liquid remaining.
Garnish with fresh parsley.
