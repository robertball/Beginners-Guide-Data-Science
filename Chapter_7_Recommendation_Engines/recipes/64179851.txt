Ingredients:
INGREDIENTS:
3 cups chicken meat, diced
1/2 cup butter
2 cups diced onions
2 cups sliced celery
1/2 cup flour
1 quart chicken stock
2 cups sliced carrots
2 cups diced potatoes
2 cups biscuit mix
1 tsp salt
1 tsp black pepper

METHOD:
NOTE: Prepare 2 cups of biscuit mix such as Bisquick, according to package directions. Once biscuit dough is formed, place in a bowl, cover with clear wrap and set aside.
In a 7-quart cast iron Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add chicken and sauté 5-10 minutes until cooked and lightly browned. Add onions and celery. Sauté until vegetables are wilted, approximately 3-5 minutes. Sprinkle in flour, and blend well into the vegetable mixture. Add chicken stock, one ladle at a time, until all is incorporated. Bring mixture to a rolling boil and reduce heat to simmer. Add carrots and potatoes. Continue to cook 10-15 minutes. Season mixture to taste using salt and pepper. Spoon the biscuit mix into the pot in the shape of dumplings. Cover and cook approximately 1 hour. Serve in a soup bowl with a generous amount of the vegetables and a couple of the dumplings.

Description: 
Prairie chicken was abundant in America’s Heartland and made a great soup or stew, especially when mixed with fresh spring or winter vegetables. This recipe is particularly good in the fall or winter and can be prepared with game birds as well
