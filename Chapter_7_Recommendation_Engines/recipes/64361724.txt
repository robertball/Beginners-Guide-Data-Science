Ingredients:
* 6 to 6 1/2 cups all purpose flour
* 6 eggs
* 3/4 cup water
* 2 teaspoons olive oil
Sauce:
* 1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes
* 1 1/2 cups tomato puree
* 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
* 1/3cup water
* 1/3 cup tomato paste
* 3 Tablespoons sugar
* 2 Tablespoons minced fresh basil
* 1 Tablespoon minced fresh parsley
* 1 Tablespoon minced fresh oregano
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper
Filling:
* 1 carton (15 ounces) ricotta cheese
* 2 cups (8 ounces) shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese.
* 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese
* 1 egg, lightly beaten
* 2 teaspoons minced fresh basil
* 1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley
* 1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
1) Place 6 cups flour in a large bowl. Make a well in the center. Beat the eggs, water and oil, pour into well. Stir together, forming a ball. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes, adding remaining flour if necessary to keep dough from sticking. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.
2) Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven, combine the sauce ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
3) In a large bowl, combine the filling ingredients. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
4) Divide pasta dough into fourths; roll one portion to 1/16 in thickness, (keep pasta covered until ready to use). Working quickly, place rounded teaspoonful's of filling 1 inch apart over half of pasta sheet. Brush around filling with water to moisten. Fold sheet over; press down to seal. Cut into squares with a pastry wheel. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
5) Bring a soup kettle of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli. Reduce heat to a gentle simmer; cook for 1-2 minutes or until ravioli float to the top and are tender. Drain. Spoon sauce over ravioli.
