2 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1 tablespoon butter
4 medium eggs
1 cup shredded mild Cheddar cheese

1 small tomato, chopped
1 small bunch fresh cilantro, chopped, or to taste (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste (optional)
1 dash hot sauce, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Place tortillas on a microwave-safe plate. Place shredded Cheddar cheese in the center of each tortilla, towards 1 end. Microwave on high power to melt cheese, 20 to 30 seconds.
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat. Whisk eggs together in a bowl. Pour into the skillet; cook and stir until eggs are set, about 5 minutes.
Place eggs over melted cheese on tortillas; top each with avocado, tomato, and cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. Top with hot sauce.
