Description: 
I have made this recipe for my family for several years now and it never disappoints. My kids take it on ski trips to share with the team and everyone always loves it! They always want to know why our hummus is a dark brown color. It's the olives! 
The recipe is equally great without the olives and/or feta. Wonderful with pita bread, chips, crackers, or veggies!
