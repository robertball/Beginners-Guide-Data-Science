Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
4 slices Cheddar cheese
6 ounces dry bread stuffing mix
1/4 cup melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place the chicken breasts in a 9x13 inch baking dish. On top of each breast place a large spoonful of soup and a slice of cheese. Crush the stuffing mix and sprinkle on top of the cheese, then drizzle with the melted butter or margarine. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour (don't overcook the chicken!). Let cool and serve.

Description: 
This is an easy recipe and is really loved by my family and everyone in the senior trailer park in Florida.  We had to make duplicate copies to pass around to everyone there. It is absolutely scrumptious!
