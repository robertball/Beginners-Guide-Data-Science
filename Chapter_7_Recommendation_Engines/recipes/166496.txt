Description: 
A real banana bread for those that don't want the sticky wet quick banana bread. You'll get a better flavor from this banana bread. Spread this with cream cheese and you'll never want to do quick bread again! And, no need to mash the bananas...the machine will mash them as it mixes the bread.
