Ingredients:
½ cup plain whole-milk yogurt
¼ cup vinegar-based hot sauce
2 Tbsp olive oil
4  finely chopped garlic cloves
1 Tbsp finely chopped fresh oregano
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1/2 tsp garam masala
8  chicken thighs
Vegetable oil (for grilling)

Directions:
Combine yogurt, hot sauce, olive oil, garlic, oregano, pepper, and garam masala in a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken and turn to coat. Seal bag, pressing out air; chill chicken 8–24 hours.
Prepare grill for medium heat; lightly brush grate with vegetable oil. Remove chicken from marinade, wiping off any excess, and grill, skin side down, until skin is lightly charred and releases from grate without tearing, 10–15 minutes. Give thighs a quarter turn and continue to grill until skin is nicely charred and crisp and thighs are starting to firm up (they should be springy when pressed), 15–20 minutes. Turn chicken over and grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thigh registers 165°, 10–15 minutes.
Place chicken on a platter skin side up; let rest 10 minutes before serving.
