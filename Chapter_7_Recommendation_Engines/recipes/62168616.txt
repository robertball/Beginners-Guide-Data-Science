Ingredients:
1lb lean ground beef
3 tablespoons thick teriyaki sauce
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons curry powder
1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
1 can sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup frozen vegetables
1 cup unprepared white rice. (At least 1 1/2 cup prepared.)

Directions:
Cook rice according to directions. Any kind of white rice will do.
In a large pan or wok, brown ground beef with 1 tbsp curry powder, 1 tbsp teriyaki sauce, and a sprinkle of soy sauce. Drain.
Rinse mushrooms and add to beef. (I said canned, but fresh is okay, too) Cook another minute.
Turn heat to medium-low and add vegetables. You can pre-heat them, but I don't really bother. Cook until heated.
Fold in rice. Add everything else and mix until even. Add more curry/soy sauce to taste.

Description: 
A quick and easy fried rice recipe any Canadian can make with stuff they have lying around. Too tired to go to the grocery store? Have some spicy, salty, Dawn Fried Rice! Perfect easy recipe for students that re-heats well. 

While the ingredients below are based on my own preferences, you can choose to exchange/exclude what you like. I usually like to use a typical pea/carrot mix for the vegetables. The important part is the beef and the rice.

Thick teriyaki sauce is also key, since it's just great. I prefer Golden Dragon sauce, but VH is also good.
