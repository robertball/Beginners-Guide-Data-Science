Ingredients:
1 cup of rice
1 medium tomato - diced (small)
1/2 medium onion - diced
2 garlic cloves - coarsely chopped
1 small carrot (about 1/4 cup) diced
1/2 cup fresh or frozen green peas
1 cups of hot chicken broth
1 cup of hot water
1 t. powder cumin
2 T. olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a medium pan, heat the oil on medium heat until hot but not smoking.
Add the rice and stir constantly until the rice takes a light brown color (around 10 minutes) Do not panic if the rice start smoking a bit - you want the nutty flavor of the toasted rice.
Add the onions and the garlic to the rice being careful with the steam that will generate. Stir for around 2 minutes until the onion is slightly translucent.
Add the carrots, the tomatoes, the peas and stir for another 2 minutes.
Heat the chicken broth/water liquids and add the cumin to the water. Let rest for 1 minute before adding to the rice.
Very carefully, add the chicken broth/water to the rice, bring to a boil, stir, season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan.
Lower the heat to simmer, and cook covered for around 15 to 20 minutes, or until the rice is soft.
Remove from the heat and let the rice rest for a couple of minutes (2 min.) before carefully stirring and serving. ver.

Description: 
This recipe was made by the 90+ old mother of my best friend Terie; she was Mexican. Although her memory falted and could not remember who had taught her how to make it, she knew it by heart, and I was lucky enough to measure her ingredients and duplicate the recipe.
