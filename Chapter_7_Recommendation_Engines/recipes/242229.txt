Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
2 tablespoons honey mustard
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1 (1 pound) (3/4-inch thick) salmon fillet

Directions:
Grease one side of a sheet of aluminum foil with vegetable oil.
Stir honey mustard, soy sauce, lemon juice, dill, rosemary, and thyme together in a bowl. Place salmon fillet onto prepared aluminum foil sheet. Brush honey mustard mixture over salmon. Wrap foil around salmon and seal edges to form a packet; let marinate for 20 to 30 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cook salmon in the foil packet until it flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 13 minutes. Open packet and let salmon cook until the moisture atop salmon dries slightly, about 2 minutes more.
