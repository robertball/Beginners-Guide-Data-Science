Ingredients:
8 cups yellow pear tomatoes
1 large yellow bell pepper, quartered
4 Tbls grapeseed or other cooking oil
Salt
Pepper
1 large yellow or white onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 1/2 cups chicken stock
1/2 cup grated parmesan
Splash of cream
1/4 cup cilantro, green onions, or fresh basil to garnish

Directions:
Toss tomatoes and yellow bell pepper with 2 Tbls of the oil, salt, and pepper, and spread evenly on a baking sheet. Roast in the oven at 425Â° for 15-20 minutes, or until tomatoes begin to pop and slightly brown.
While tomatoes are roasting, heat the remaining 2 Tbsp of oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook onions and garlic until translucent, but not brown, about 5-7 minutes, seasoning with salt and pepper along the way. Add chicken stock.  When tomatoes are done roasting, add them to the pot and let the soup simmer on low while you remove the skin from the peppers (placing them in a bowl and covering it with plastic wrap for 10 minutes will make peeling easier). When peeled, roughly chop them and add them to the pot.
Using an immersion blender or a regular blender, puree the soup, then strain it with a sieve to get the majority of the seeds and pulp out. Once strained, add parmesan and cream to taste, and garnish with fresh herbs.
