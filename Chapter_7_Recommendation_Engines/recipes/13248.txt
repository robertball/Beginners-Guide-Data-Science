Description: 
This is an elegant version of the old-fashioned tomato and rice soup, studded with fresh seafood.  If you want a simpler dish, omit the seafood.  If you are lucky enough to have a garden full of fresh tomatoes, you can substitute them for the canned variety.   Use about 1 and 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes, cored and chopped.
