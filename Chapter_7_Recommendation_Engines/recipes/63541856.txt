Ingredients:
2 lbs. potato, peeled (russet or yukon gold)
2 Tbs. vegetable oil
2 Tbs. butter, unsalted
1 tsp. caraway seed, whole
2 Tbs. onion, chopped fine
1/2 tsp. garlic powder (optional)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Peel potatoes and cut into halves. Then half the halves and slice into about 1/2" thick pieces.*
Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil.
Add the potatoes to the boiling water, and boil the potatoes for 7 minutes or so, being careful not to over cook them. Potatoes should still be firm and just a bit undercooked. Drain when done.
Allow the potatoes to steam off in a colander, or spread out on a cookie sheet or rack to allow potatoes to dry.
Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat. When hot add the oil and butter.
Add the potatoes to the hot oil/butter mixture and fry until the potatoes begin to brown.
Once the potatoes have begun to brown, turn them over with a spatula to brown the other side.
Sprinkle caraway, salt and pepper over the potatoes and add the onions and garlic powder (if using).
Once the potatoes have browned on both sides, turn the temperature down to medium low. Occasionally stir the potatoes to prevent burning. Cook until onions are browned a bit, but not burned.

Description: 
The smell of frying potatoes was a common scent in Bavaria around noon time. The caraway used in this dish is what truly makes it German Style.
