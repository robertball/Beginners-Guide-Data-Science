Ingredients:
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
5 (14 ounce) cans navy beans, rinsed and drained
2 (14 ounce) cans white corn, drained
2 (4 ounce) cans chopped green chilies
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon dried minced onion, or to taste

Directions:
Place chicken and chicken broth in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil and cook until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.
Transfer chicken and broth to a slow cooker. Stir in navy beans, corn, green chilies, garlic, cumin, red pepper flakes, oregano, salt, and onion powder. Cover and cook on Low until flavors are blended, 8 to 9 hours.

Description: 
This version won our chili cookoff at work a few years ago in the non-traditional category. Once the weather turns cool, this is one of the first things we make! Also great for a group.
