Combine all ingredients and mix well.
Form into small balls and flatten slightly (about golf ball size).

Description: 
Tender, flakey tilapia pressed into a patty with diced onion and bell pepper.  Great light meal or appetizer - especially for fish haters.  My ingredients were more or less eyeballed, so adjust as desired.
