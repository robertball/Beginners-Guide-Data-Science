Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) fillets salmon
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon dried dill, or to taste
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Tear off 4 sheets of aluminum foil, large enough to wrap each steak. Grease one side of each piece of foil.
Place one salmon filet on each and drizzle a little olive oil on top of each piece of salmon. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and dill weed to taste. Drizzle a bit of the lemon juice over each piece of salmon.
Wrap up the steaks, carefully sealing each foil packet. Test each packet by pressing on it. If air escapes, re-wrap it. Put on the top rack of the dishwasher and run for a full cycle, with heated drying. Salmon will be done when the dishwasher runs the full cycle.
