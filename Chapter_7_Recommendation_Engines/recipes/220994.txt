Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
5 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup sour cream
1/3 cup dried currants
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Whisk flour, white sugar, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl. Cut in butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Stir together 1/2 cup milk, sour cream, and currants in a small bowl; stir into flour mixture with a fork until just moistened and holding together.
Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and pat into rectangle.
Fold the rectangle in thirds. Turn dough a half turn, gather any crumbs, flatten back into a rectangle, and repeat. Cut into eight pieces and place each scone on a silicone baking mat.
Whisk egg and 1 tablespoon milk together in a small bowl; brush mixture on top of each scone.
Bake scones in the preheated oven until risen and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove and transfer to cooling rack.

Description: 
This recipe is very slightly adapted from one by someone called Friendlyfood on Allrecipes, who claims it was adapted from a version made at the Savoy Hotel in London. I have to say, I am very impressed. It was light, tender, moist and very delicious.
