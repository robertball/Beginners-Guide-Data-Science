Ingredients:
3 tbs canola or olive oil
2 cups chopped yellow onions
3 tbs diced garlic
1 tbs cumin
1 tbs garam masala
1 tsp cardamom
1 tbs oregano
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tbs pureed chipotle peppers; From can - use the  peppers, not just the sauce
2 lbs ground beef or turkey
2 cans pinto beans; 15 oz can
1 can black beans; 15 oz can
1 can diced tomatoes; 15 oz can
1 tsp salt
2 tsp ground black pepper
1 can tomato paste; 12 oz can

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. When oil has warmed, add the onions, garlic, cumin, garam masala, cardamom, oregano, and cayenne. Cook the onion mixture, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened.
Increase heat to medium-high, add the ground beef or turkey and season with half of the salt and ground pepper.
Cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until just beginning to brown.
Add pureed chipotle peppers, beans, diced tomatoes (with the juice), and tomato paste. Add rest of salt and pepper. Stir occasionally and bring to a very gentle boil.
Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Turn off heat and let sit for 30 minutes before serving or refrigerating (chili gets better with at least 24 hours to sit.)
Serve chili in bowls with condiments: cheese, a dollop of sour cream, diced fresh green onion (chives if you must), fresh diced onion, avocado (my favorite!).
Chili is GREAT with fresh, warm cornbread, served with butter and honey.
