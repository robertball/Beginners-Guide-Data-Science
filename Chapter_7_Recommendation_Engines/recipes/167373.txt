Ingredients:
3 pounds pork back ribs, cut into serving size pieces
1 cup ketchup
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring

Directions:
Place the ribs into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium and simmer until tender, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, stir the ketchup, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, salt, and liquid smoke in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered, stirring frequently, until thickened, about 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a baking sheet with foil.
Drain the ribs and place meaty-side-up onto the prepared baking sheet. Brush the ribs with half of the barbeque sauce. Broil in the preheated oven until the sauce has turned sticky and lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Turn the ribs over and brush with the remaining sauce. Continue to broil until the sauce has turned sticky, about 7 minutes.
