Ingredients:
4 cups chopped fresh broccoli
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
¼ cup mayonnaise
2 cups dry bread crumbs
½ cup melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart casserole dish.
Put broccoli in a large microwave-safe bowl with a small amount of water in the bottom; cook in microwave until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain liquid from bowl. Stir mushroom soup, Cheddar cheese, and mayonnaise with the broccoli until evenly mixed; pour into prepared casserole dish.
Mix bread crumbs and melted butter together in a separate bowl; spread evenly over the broccoli mixture.
Bake in preheated oven until the surface is bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is our family version/replacement of the traditional green bean casserole that everyone always brings. I am seriously in trouble if this is not on the holiday table!
