Ingredients:
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 egg
6 tablespoons Irish cream liqueur
1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix without pudding
1 (3.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix
3 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup Irish whiskey

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as a Bundt(R)) and coat inside of pan with unsweetened cocoa powder.
Beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, 1 egg, and Irish cream liqueur in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Set aside.
Beat chocolate cake mix, chocolate pudding mix, 3 eggs, and vegetable oil in a separate bowl until batter is thick and smooth. Slowly beat Irish stout beer into the batter.
Spoon 1/3 of the cake batter into the prepared pan; layer the Irish cream filling on top. Spoon remaining cake batter over the filling.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.
Loosen the edges of the cake from the pan with a thin spatula; let cake rest in pan 15 minutes. Invert pan over a wire rack to release cake and allow to cool completely on the rack.
While cake is cooling, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat and stir in white sugar and Irish whiskey. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar, reduce heat to low, and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.
Transfer cake to a serving platter. Generously brush whiskey glaze over cooled cake several times and allow glaze to soak into cake.

Description: 
An Irish car bomb is a drink that has a shot of Irish cream liqueur and Irish whiskey dropped in the shot glass, down into a glass of Guinness® beer. There are several recipes that replicate this flavor out there, but this is different in that there is no icing and lends itself to being taken to the pub easier.
