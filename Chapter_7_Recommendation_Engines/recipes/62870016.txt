Ingredients:
1/2 lb of okra
1/2 to 3/4 lb of potatoes, diced or julienned
2 T oil
1 tsp cumin seed
1 tsp black mustard seed
8 curry leaves
1 med onion (to taste), diced
2 - 3 cloves garlic, crushed or minced
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp turmeric
1 to 3 fresh green chilis
1/4 tsp ground fenugreek
2 T cilantro, coarsely chopped

Directions:
Wash the okra and let it dry completely before cutting into wheel-shaped rounds about 1/4" thick
While the okra is drying, pan fry the potatoes until nearly done, with as little oil as possible.  Set aside.
When the okra has been cut up, heat 2 T oil in a large skillet or wok.
Add the cumin seeds
As soon as the cumin starts to brown, add the mustard seeds.
As soon as the mustard seeds start to pop, add the curry leaves.  If the mustard seeds don't pop, turn up the heat until they do.
As soon as you put in the curry leaves, add the okra
Stir fry over a medium high to high heat, or turn heat to medium and fry, stirring occasionally, until the okra is brown and crispy.  Wok is faster, but if you don't have one, you can still do it in a regular skillet or saute pan.
DO NOT USE A LID!  This will trap steam and will make your okra gooey and slimy.
Add the onions, chilis, salt, and garlic and fry until the onions begin to brown.
Add the dry spices and stir well to coat evenly.
Add the cilantro
Serve over rice or with chapatti, puri, or naan.
