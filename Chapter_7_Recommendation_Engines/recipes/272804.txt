Ingredients:
1/3 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons dry sherry
1 tablespoon hoisin sauce, or more to taste
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1/3 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/4 cup thinly sliced green onions
2 cloves garlic, minced
8 ounces snow peas, ends trimmed
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 1/2 cups cooked brown rice, warmed

Directions:
Combine chicken broth, soy sauce, sherry, hoisin sauce, and cornstarch in a bowl. Set aside.
Heat sesame oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in bell pepper, onions, and garlic; fry until softened, 2 to 3 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium. Add snow peas and cook, covered, until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in shrimp and fry until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir in chicken broth mixture. Bring to a boil. Stir until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and serve over cooked brown rice.
