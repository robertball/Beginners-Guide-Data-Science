Ingredients:
10 ounces unsweetened flaked coconut
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
3 drops orange food coloring (optional)
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon rose water (optional)

Directions:
Combine coconut and cardamom in a pan over medium heat. Mix well and heat for 1 minute, but do not let coconut brown. Add food coloring. Add condensed milk. Cook and stir until coconut begins to stick together, 5 to 8 minutes. Add rose water; cook and stir until flavors blend, 8 to 10 minutes more.
Let mixture cool until safe to handle, but still warm. Roll mixture into balls; place ladoos in cupcake liners or on a baking sheet. Serve immediately or refrigerate up to a week.
