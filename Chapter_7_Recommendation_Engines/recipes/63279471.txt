Ingredients:
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, grilled or broiled and shredded
4 cups cooked brown rice
3/4 cup frozen corn
1 15-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup plain greek yogurt (you can use sour cream)
1 4-ounce can green chilis
1/2 cup chunky salsa
1 cup grated cheddar & monterey jack cheese (low-fat cheese works too!) + more for topping if desired
cilantro for garnish

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine all ingredients except for cilantro and mix thoroughly to combine. Make sure the yogurt and cheese is stirred in throughout the entire bowl. Season with salt and pepper if desired.
2. Transfer to an oven-safe dish and top with extra cheese if you would like. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until heated through. Garnish with chopped cilantro.
