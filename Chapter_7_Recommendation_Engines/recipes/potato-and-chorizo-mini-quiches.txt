Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 teaspoons olive oil
4 ounces Spanish chorizo sausage, finely diced
1 russet potato, peeled and finely diced
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2/3 cup grated Manchego cheese, divided
8 large eggs
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat 24 mini-muffin cups with cooking spray.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir chorizo in the hot oil until golden brown, about 4 minutes.
Stir diced potato into chorizo; increase heat to medium and cook potatoes until tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
Sprinkle 1 to 2 teaspoons of grated cheese in the bottom of each muffin cup. Top with 1 to 2 tablespoons chorizo mixture.
Beat eggs, cayenne pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl until combined. Pour egg mixture evenly into muffin cups. Lightly tap the pans to remove any air bubbles. Transfer to a baking sheet and top with any remaining cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs golden brown and just set, about 17 minutes.

Description: 
This little baked bite is very loosely based on the Spanish Tortilla, and not only is it dead simple to make, but the versatility of the technique allows this to be adapted to any occasion.
