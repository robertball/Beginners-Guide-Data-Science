Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
11 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons cocoa powder
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add melted butter, brown sugar, and white sugar; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Add egg and vanilla; beat until combined. Mix in cocoa powder until incorporated. Stir in chocolate chips and cinnamon.
Drop hazelnut-sized balls of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are firm, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
