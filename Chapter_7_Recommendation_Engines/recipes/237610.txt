Ingredients:
¼ cup chicken broth

1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 3/4-inch pieces
1 clove garlic, minced
1  red bell pepper, cut into 3/4-inch pieces
⅓ cup dry roasted peanuts
2  green onions, sliced

Directions:
Mix chicken broth, soy sauce, cornstarch, sugar, vinegar, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl until sauce is smooth.
Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat; saute chicken and garlic until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Add red bell pepper and saute until slightly tender, about 1 minute.
Stir sauce into chicken chicken mixture and cook until thickened, about 1 minute. Stir peanuts into chicken mixture and garnish with green onions.
