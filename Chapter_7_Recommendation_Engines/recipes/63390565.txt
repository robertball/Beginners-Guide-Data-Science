Ingredients:
(quantities fill a 5 quart crock pot)
Approximately 16 apples peeled, cored and sliced.
1 cup Water (Can use unsweetened apple juice for this)
1/2 cup Brown Sugar
2 Tablespoons Cinnamon
2 teaspoons Vanilla

Directions:
Peel, core and cut your apples.  (It takes approximately 25 apples in the 6 quart crock pot and 16 apples in the 5 quart crockpot.) (Golden Delicious Apples, Gala, Red Delicious and Fuji are all good apples to use, although any apples work. Granny Smith are ok, if you are looking for a tart sauce)
Fill the crockpot to the very top ( apples will shrink as they are cooking).   Then add in the water, brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla (Vanilla really enhances the flavor).
If desired you can completely omit the brown sugar and your final result will still be sweet.  I only use it because we prefer the texture of the applesauce when sugar is added during it's cooking time.
Cover and cook on low for 4 hours. Check to see if the apples are soft.  If not, cover and cook for another 1-2 hours and check again. Depending on the crockpot it can take 4-6 hours to cook completely.
Once the apples are soft, use a potato masher and smash them until you get the desired consistency.  If you prefer no chunks in your applesauce, you may want to use a hand blender.
Enjoy! DO NOT eat a spoonful of applesauce right out of the crockpot.  It will be hot!
