Ingredients:
1 whole chicken breast cooked and cut; or 2 cans (5 ounces each) of canned white chicken meat  (I usually use the Tyson frozen strips and cut them into chunks, but have also just boiled a chicken breast - I have not made it with the canned chicken)
2 tablespoons of toasted sesame seeds
2 ounces of slivered almonds, toasted
1/2 head of cabbage, shredded fine (I use 1 bag of the already-shredded cabbage for a single recipe).
2 green onions chopped fine
1 package of chicken-flavored Ramen noodles, uncooked
Salad Dressing:
1/2 package Ramen noodle seasoning mix
3 tablespoons sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3 tablespoons of rice or wine vinegar
1 teaspoon salt (I don't use the salt)
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Combine the chicken with sesame seeds, almonds, cabbage, onion and uncooked noodles which have been broken apart.
Add the dressing; toss to blend.  Cover.  Refrigerate until serving time.  Serve cold.
