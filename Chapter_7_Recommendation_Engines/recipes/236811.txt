Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
¾ cup coconut oil
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 cup finely chopped pecans
1 cup brown sugar
1  egg
¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine flour, 3/4 cup coconut oil, and cream cheese together in a bowl; form into 36 balls. Press each ball into the cup of a miniature muffin tin, creating small crusts.
Melt 2 tablespoons coconut oil in a saucepan over low heat. Add pecans, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract; stir until filling is evenly combined. Fill each crust 3/4-full with filling.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling puffs up, about 12 minutes.

Description: 
Nut cups are like mini pecan pies, but much easier and travel like a cookie. Substitute butter for the coconut oil if desired. Any variety of nut can be used in place of the pecans.
