Ingredients:
4 pounds rump roast
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup red wine
1 cup red wine vinegar
2 cups water
2 cloves garlic, minced
3/4 cup sliced onion
2 bay leaves
10 black peppercorns
1/4 cup white sugar
3 whole cloves
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons bacon grease
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons water
1 1/2 cups sour cream

Directions:
Rub the roast with salt and pepper and place in a large non-metal bowl.  In a medium saucepan, combine wine, vinegar and 2 cups water and bring to a boil.  Stir in garlic, onion, bay leaves, peppercorns, sugar and cloves and pour the marinade over the beef.  Cover and refrigerate 12 hours or overnight.
Remove the meat from the marinade and thoroughly pat dry.  Dredge in 1 cup flour (may use more or less if necessary).  Heat bacon grease in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Brown roast in drippings on all sides.  Pour in half the marinade, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until tender, 3 hours.
Remove meat to serving platter.  Increase heat to medium-high; mix 2 tablespoons flour with 2 tablespoons water and add to pan, stirring until gravy thickens.  Stir in sour cream.  Pour sauce over sliced meat.
