Ingredients:
Broth:
4 cups chicken stock
4 cups vegetable broth
3 large shallots, sliced
3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
3 tablespoons fish sauce
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
5 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cinnamon stick
2 star anise
Pho:
1 (8 ounce) package dried rice noodles
1/2 pound raw shrimp
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce, or to taste
1 clove garlic, or to taste
2 cups bean sprouts
4 green onions, sliced
1 cup fresh basil leaves
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
2 sprigs fresh mint, or more to taste
2 limes, cut into wedges, or to taste

Directions:
Combine chicken stock, vegetable broth, shallots, soy sauce, fish sauce, ginger, rice vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, pepper, cinnamon stick, and star anise in a large pot. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until flavors combine, 1 to 2 hours. Strain out solids and return broth to the pot.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add rice noodles and cook until opaque, 4 to 5 minutes.
While noodles are cooking, saute shrimp with soy sauce and garlic in a skillet until shrimp are cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.
Drain noodles and rinse until cold water. Divide among 6 large soup bowls. Ladle hot broth over noodles and top with shrimp, bean sprouts, and green onions. Serve basil, cilantro, mint, and lime wedges alongside.
