Ingredients:
1  (3.75-ounce) package uncooked bean threads (cellophane noodles)
2  tablespoons  rice vinegar
2  tablespoons  fresh lime juice
1 1/2  tablespoons  fish sauce
1  teaspoon  sugar
2  teaspoons  sambal oelek (ground fresh chile paste) or chile paste with garlic
2  cups  shredded skinless, boneless rotisserie chicken breast
1/2  cup  matchstick-cut or grated carrot
1/2  cup  red bell pepper strips
1/3  cup  thinly sliced shallots
2  tablespoons  fresh cilantro leaves
1  tablespoon  chopped fresh mint
1/2  cup  chopped unsalted dry-roasted peanuts

Directions:
1. Place noodles in a large bowl. Cover with very hot tap water, and let stand 15 minutes.
2. While noodles soak, combine vinegar and next 4 ingredients (through sambal), stirring until sugar dissolves. Combine chicken and next 5 ingredients (through mint), tossing well.
3. Drain and rinse noodles with cold water; drain well, squeezing to remove excess water. Snip noodles several times with kitchen shears. Combine noodles and chicken mixture, tossing well to combine. Drizzle noodle mixture with vinegar mixture; toss well to coat. Top with peanuts.

Description: 
To ensure the noodles get soft, soak them in the hottest water you can get from your tap. The salad is moderately spicy; reduce the chile paste by 1 teaspoon or omit it for a milder dish
