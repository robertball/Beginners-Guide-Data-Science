Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix
1 (16 ounce) package uncooked tri-color rotini pasta
1 (16 ounce) bottle French salad dressing
1 (14 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (8 ounce) package shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
6 cups shredded lettuce
1 cup chopped tomato
1 cup sliced green onions
1 (8 ounce) package nacho cheese-flavored corn chips (such as DoritosÂ®), crushed

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and taco seasoning; saute until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and let cool, about 10 minutes.
Combine cooled beef and rotini with French dressing, black beans, and Cheddar cheese. Mix well and chill until ready to serve.
Fold in lettuce, tomato, and green onions. Sprinkle crushed chips on top or serve on the side.
