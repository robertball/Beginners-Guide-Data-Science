Ingredients:
1 pound extra lean ground beef
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 small onion, diced
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 1/4 teaspoons dried oregano
3/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 dash hot pepper sauce (San Carlos Food Co. Hot Sauce - Chipotle Salsa Picante)), or to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 egg
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
Hoagie rolls
Shredded Mozzarella

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place the beef into a mixing bowl, and season with salt, onion, garlic salt, Italian seasoning, oregano, red pepper flakes, hot pepper sauce, and Worcestershire sauce; mix well. Add the egg, Parmesan cheese, and bread crumbs. Mix until evenly blended, then form into 1 1/2-inch meatballs, and place onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes.
Slice hoagie rolls and warm in microwave for 15 seconds. Place meatballs in hoagie rolls and top with shredded mozzarella.
