Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Spread 1/2  teaspoon of honey onto one side of each pork chop. Sprinkle a pinch of dill over the honey.
Place the pork chops honey side down in the skillet, and coat the top sides of the chops with remaining honey and dill. Cook for 5 minutes on each side, or until browned on the outside, and chops have reached your desired degree of doneness.
