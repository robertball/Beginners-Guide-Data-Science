Ingredients:
2 cups biscuit
3/4 cup buttermilk
1 cup cheddar cheese, shredded
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon parsley flakes, crushed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400
Combine the baking mix, milk and cheddar cheese in a medium bowl. Mix by hand until well combined.
Divide the dough into 12 equal portions (about 3 tablespoons each) and spoon onto a lightly greased or nonstick cookie sheet. Flatten each biscuit a bit with your fingers.
Bake for 18-20 minutes or until the tops of the biscuits begin to brown.
In a small bowl, combine the butter with the garlic powder. Heat the mixture for 30 seconds in microwave, then brush a light coating over top of each biscuit immediately after removing them from the oven. Sprinkle with a dash of parsley.
