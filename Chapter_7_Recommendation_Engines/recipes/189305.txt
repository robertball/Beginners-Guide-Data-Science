Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 onion, diced
1 1/2 cups pearl barley
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 1/2 cups chicken broth
1/4 cup slivered almonds
1/4 cup raisins (optional)

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet placed over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and barley; cook, stirring frequently, until the onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the allspice, turmeric, curry powder, salt, and black pepper.  Pour in the chicken broth, and bring to a simmer.
Cover skillet with lid, and reduce heat to low; simmer until the barley is tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.  Fluff the pilaf with a fork, and gently stir in the slivered almonds and raisins.
