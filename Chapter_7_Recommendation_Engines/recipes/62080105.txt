Ingredients:
1 lb. bag pinto beans
1 pack pork chorizo
1 pack hotdogs (sliced)
1 lb. cooked ham (sliced)
1 pack bacon (diced)
1 small onion (diced)
2-3 Jalepenos (diced)
salt (pinch)
1 cilantro bunch (diced)

Directions:
1.) Clean pinto beans, boil till tender with the diced onion, salt, and diced jalepeno. (You can add 2 garlic teeth to reduce gas)
2.) Dice bacon and cook on stove top withe chorizo. When fully cooked add in sliced hotdogs and diced ham, cook until hotdog and ham warmed all through.
3.) Once the beans are fully cooked add your meat mixture and bring the beans to a boil again. Taste and see if you need more salt ( I let the person add the extra salt in their bowl)
4.) Once all boiled remove the garlic and smooch it till it is smooth and no large chunks are visible. Add it back to bean soup lower beans to a simmer.
5.) Serve with your favorite mexican meat dish or by itself with warm corn tortillas and a slice of lime.

Description: 
This bean soup is great with carne asada or picadillo as a side instead of the noraml refried beans and rice.  You can serve with a little lime juice and warmed corn tortillas, my husband loves this soup especially on a cold day.
