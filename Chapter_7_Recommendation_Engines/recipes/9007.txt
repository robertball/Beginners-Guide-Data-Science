Add mushrooms to skillet and saute for 3 to 4 minutes over medium high heat. When mushrooms appear slightly browned, add heavy cream and cognac, STIRRING CONSTANTLY so that cream does not curdle.
Reduce sauce until desired consistency is reached. Add chicken strips to skillet, stirring so that they are coated with sauce. Cover and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside.
