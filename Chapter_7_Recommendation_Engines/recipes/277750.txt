Description: 
This cheesecake ball recipe is super easy, and very good! I've been making this for several years now for holiday and special occasion parties. I always get requests to bring this cheese ball! Serve with cookies. Be creative! I usually serve with graham crackers, animal crackers, leftover Oreos速, and vanilla wafers.
