Ingredients:
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cut into chunks
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of chicken soup
1 1/4 cups sour cream
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1 small onion, chopped (or frozen chopped onion)
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies, drained
1 (1.25 ounce) package mild taco seasoning mix
1 bunch green onions, chopped, divided
1 cup water
1 teaspoon lime juice
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
8 (10 inch) corn (not flour) tortillas
3 cups Cheddar cheese, shredded, divided
1 (10 ounce) can green enchilada sauce
1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives

Directions:
Place the chicken, water, cream of chicken soup, chili powder, onion, chopped green chilies, taco seasoning, half of the bunch of chopped green onion, water, lime juice, onion powder, and garlic powder in the crock pot and cook on high for 4 hours on hight or low for 8 hours. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread some soup mixture on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.  Fill each tortilla with chicken mixture. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the chicken filling before folding the tortillas, reserving half of the shredded cheese for topping the enchiladas.  Fold tortillas over the filling and place seam-side down in the prepared pan.
Pour enchilada sauce evenly over the enchiladas. Cover with the remaining 1 1/2 cups of Cheddar cheese. Sprinkle the reserved chopped green onions and the sliced olives on top of the cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is heated through and the cheese is melted and bubbling, about 25 minutes.
