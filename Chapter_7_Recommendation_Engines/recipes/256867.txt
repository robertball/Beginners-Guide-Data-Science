Ingredients:
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 clove garlic, or to taste, minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, thinly sliced
4 cups warm cooked rice
8 (8 inch) soft flour tortillas
1/2 cup carrot matchsticks, or to taste

Directions:
Mix honey, soy sauce, cornstarch, and garlic together in a small bowl.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken until no longer pink, 5 to 8 minutes. Pour honey mixture over chicken; cook and stir until sauce thickens and coats chicken, 3 to 5 minutes.
Divide warm rice among tortillas; spoon chicken on top. Cover chicken with carrots. Roll up wraps.

Description: 
My hubby and I invented this recipe to use up some leftovers. Now it is my 2-, 5-, and 7-year- olds' favorite finger food. But it is also good served whole over a bed of rice with the salad on the side.
