Ingredients:
10 cherry tomatoes, halved
2 celery ribs, thinly sliced
1 medium green pepper, sliced
1 medium red bell pepper, sliced
1 medium red onion, sliced and separated into rings
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Divide the vegetables between two pieces of heavy-duty foil (about 18 in. square). In a small bowl, combine the remaining ingredients; drizzle over vegetables. Fold foil around vegetables and seal tightly. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 10-15 minutes or until the vegetables are crisp-tender.
