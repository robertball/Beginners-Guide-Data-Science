Ingredients:
1 cup bulgur
1 cup boiling water
1 (1 pound) package frozen shelled edamame
2 cups halved cherry tomatoes
2 cups chopped fresh parsley
1 cucumber, seeded and chopped
1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced
1/4 cup olive oil, or as needed
2 large lemons, juiced
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Stir bulgur and boiling water together in a pot; cover and remove from heat. Set aside until water is absorbed, about 1 hour.
Bring a separate pot of water to a boil; cook edamame in the boiling water until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Mix cooked bulgur, edamame, tomatoes, parsley, cucumber, and green onions together in a large bowl.
Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, and vinegar in a separate bowl; pour over bulgur mixture. Season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate to blend flavors, at least 6 hours.

Description: 
This is my own version of traditional tabbouleh. The addition of soybeans makes it a meal in itself. It gets better after chilling for a day or two.
