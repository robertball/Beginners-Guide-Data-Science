Ingredients:
4 cups Fresh Raspberries
2 cups Granulated Sugar
1 cup All Purpose Flour
2 Marie Callender's frozen pie shells
1/4 cup evaporated milk
1 Large cookie sheet covered in aluminum foil.
1 Basting Brush
1 Fork

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450*F.
Open pie shells, take one shell out of the pan it comes in and set aside.
Leave other pie shell in the pan and pour in 1 cup of raspberries.
Cover raspberries with 1/4 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of sugar.
Repeat this layering process until raspberries, flour and sugar are all in the pie shell, then set aside.
Remaining pie shell should be at or near room temperature now and more pliable.
Dip basting brush into evaporated milk and generously brush edges of both pie shells.
Place the empty pie shell on top of filled pie shell.
Use fork to press both edges firmly together, insuring a tight seal.
Cut slits into top pie shell then use basting brush, brush the rest of the evaporated milk on the top pie shell.
Place pie on cookie sheet and place in oven. Turn temperature down to 375*F.
Bake until juice is running from slits in pie crust and crust is golden brown, about 45 - 50 minutes. Remove from oven, set aside to cool for at least 15 minutes.
