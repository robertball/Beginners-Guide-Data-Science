Ingredients:
Cake
2 c  sugar (may cut the sugar to 1 cup - 1 1/2 cups as it is very sweet)
2 c  flour
2  eggs
2 tsp  baking soda
1/2 tsp  salt
2 tsp  vanilla
1/2 c  nuts
1 can(s)  20 ounces crushed pineapple - undrained (i use pineapple in it's own juice)

1 pkg  8 ounce cream cheese - softened
1 3/4 c  powdered sugar
1/4 c  butter or margarine
1/4 tsp  salt
1/2 c  nuts
2 tsp  vanilla

Directions:
PREACHER CAKE: Combine dry ingredients; add remaining ingredients, and mix by hand.
Bake in a 9 x 13 prepared pan at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.
FROSTING: Mix ingredients well and spread on cake in pan. Enjoy!
If you would like to save calories, instead of using the frosting, just sprinkle top of cake with a bit of powdered sugar and enjoy!
There is NO milk, butter, or oil in the cake.
You may add other fruits or coconut if you like: some suggestions are: dried cranberries, raisins, currants, tub of mixed dried fruit, and even fresh blueberries.
You may cut the sugar to 1 cup as it is very sweet.
