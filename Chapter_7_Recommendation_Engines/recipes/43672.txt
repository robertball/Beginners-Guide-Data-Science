2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

In large bowl, mix together crabmeat, mayonnaise, green onions, cilantro, lime juice, ginger, hot pepper sauce, and salt and pepper. Shape into 12 patties.
In a shallow dish, lightly beat eggs. Place bread crumbs in another shallow dish. Dip patties into egg, then press into bread crumbs to coat all over.
In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Cook crab cakes in oil, adding remaining oil as needed, for 2 minutes per side or until golden.
