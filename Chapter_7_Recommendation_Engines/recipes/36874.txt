2 tablespoons Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
3 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
4 (6 ounce) swordfish steaks (about 1 inch thick)
1 cup water
2/3 cup uncooked couscous
1/2 teaspoon grated lemon rind
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1/2 cup dried currants
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
1/2 cup fresh orange juice
2 tablespoons coarsely chopped toasted walnuts
1 tablespoon honey
Cherry tomatoes (optional)

Directions:
Combine first 6 ingredients in a bowl. Stir in 1 teaspoon oil. Rub spice mixture over both sides of swordfish. Cover and chill 30 minutes.
Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan; gradually stir in couscous. Remove from heat; cover and let stand 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Stir in lemon rind, lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and mint. Set aside, and keep warm.
Combine 1 teaspoon oil, currants, orange rind, orange juice, walnuts, and honey in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer. Set aside; keep warm.
