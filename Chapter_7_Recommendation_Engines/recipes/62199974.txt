Ingredients:
1 1/4 lbs. fresh broccoli florets and tender stems
1/2 cup butter
1 cup chopped onion
1 1/2 cup minced button mushrooms
2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour
2-12 oz. cans evaporated milk
2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
2 cups 5 cheese Italian blend, shredded
3 cups cooked brown rice
salt and white pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Butter a 2 1/2 quart baking dish.
Steam broccoli until almost tender (5-7 minutes).  Chop broccoli after steaming.
Melt butter in skillet over medium heat.  Stir in onions and mushrooms and cook until softened, about 7-10 minutes.
Sprinkle flour over the mushrooms and onions, stir and continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes.
Stir in milk, salt and pepper and continue cooking until sauce is lightly thickened about 3-5 minutes.
Reserve 1/2 cup of each cheese (1 cup total), and add the remainder of the cheese to the sauce.  Remove from heat and stir until cheese is melted.
Mix together chopped broccoli, rice and mushroom/onion/cheese sauce and pour into baking dish.  Sprinkle reserved cheese over top, cover and bake until heated through, about 25 minutes.
