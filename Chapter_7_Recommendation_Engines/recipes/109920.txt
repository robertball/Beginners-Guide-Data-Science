Ingredients:
1 large eggplant
2 tablespoons tahini
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/3 cup olive oil
salt to taste

Directions:
Pierce the eggplant 4 or 5 times with the tip of a paring knife.  Microwave on High for 6 to 8 minutes until softened, then place on a plate, and allow to cool to room temperature.
Peel off the skin and stem, discard.  Roughly chop the eggplant and place into the bowl of a blender along with the tahini, lemon juice, garlic, and olive oil.  Puree until smooth, adding water if needed to make a thick paste; season to taste with salt.

Description: 
This is a healthy and delicious Middle Eastern recipe that can be used as a dip with pita bread or served as a side dish. Sometimes I like to add parsley to this dish. Just chop up the parsley with the other ingredients. It makes it look pretty and taste good!  Enjoy!
