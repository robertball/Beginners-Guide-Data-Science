Ingredients:
1 tablespoon soy sauce, less sodium
1/2 tablespoon oil, dark sesame
1/4 teaspoon ginger, ground
1/2 pounds beef, sirloin cut into 1/2-inch wide strips
1/2 teaspoon oil, olive, extra-virgin
4 ounce(s) peas, sugar snap strings removed
1 cup(s) lettuce, radicchio shredded
1 cup(s) sprouts, mung bean
1 tablespoon vinegar, rice
6 leaves lettuce, Boston

Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger. Add the beef and toss to coat.
In a large nonstick skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add half the beef and cook until browned, about 1 minute on each side. With a slotted spoon, transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with the remaining beef.
In a small pan of boiling water, cook the snap peas for 30 seconds. Drain, rinse under cold water, and drain again. Transfer the snap peas to the bowl with beef.
Add the radicchio, sprouts, and vinegar and toss well. Divide the beef mixture evenly among the lettuce leaves and serve. Enjoy 3 lettuce cups per serving.
