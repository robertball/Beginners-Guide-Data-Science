Ingredients:
10 pounds potatoes
1 cup water
1 cup white wine vinegar
1 cup white sugar
2 onions, diced
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon celery seed
2 cups mayonnaise

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to cool.
Slice cooled potatoes and layer in a large bowl or dish.
In a saucepan combine water, vinegar and sugar.  Bring to a boil and cook for one minute.  Remove from heat and pour over potatoes. Cover and chill for at least 12 hours.
Drain excess marinade and add onions, salt, pepper, celery seed and mayonnaise. Mix well and serve chilled.

Description: 
This is my Dad's potato salad recipe.  I have never seen it made this way, and whenever I take a bowl of it somewhere it always leaves empty.
