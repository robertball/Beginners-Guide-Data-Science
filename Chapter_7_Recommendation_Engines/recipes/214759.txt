Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
In a bowl, thoroughly mix together the turkey, coriander, salt, brown sugar, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Cover the bowl, and refrigerate the sausage overnight.
The next day, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Form the sausage into thin patties, and fry until browned and no longer pink inside, 2 to 5 minutes per side.

Description: 
My father-in-law is known for his Sunday breakfasts.  Homemade sausage, fluffy eggs and tender fried potatoes and onions...yum.  My kids loved spending time at Gramma's and Grampa's farm with the horses and other animals, and always came home talking about breakfast -- which was normally served well after 11 a.m.! (I have mixed all the ingredients together and fried right away -- tastes great, but don't tell Grampa!)
