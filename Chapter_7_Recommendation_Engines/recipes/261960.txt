Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
Combine turkey, onion, salt, black pepper, oregano, garlic powder, cinnamon, cumin, and cayenne pepper in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until turkey is browned, about 10 minutes. Add spaghetti sauce, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Pour over rotini.
