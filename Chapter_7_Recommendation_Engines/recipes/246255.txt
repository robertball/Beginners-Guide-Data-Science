Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 pound deli sliced corned beef or pastrami, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 cup sauerkraut, drained well, squeezed very dry
1/4 cup sweet pickle relish
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons sour cream
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
4 ounces shredded Gruyere cheese
4 ounces shredded Emmenthaler cheese
Crackers and bread for serving

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place cream cheese in a large bowl; add chopped meat and sauerkraut, sweet pickle relish, mayonnaise, sour cream, ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and shredded cheese. Mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon until well blended, 2 to 3 minutes.
Transfer mixture to an ovenproof baking dish. Distribute evenly and smooth out the top. To increase the surface exposure, add texture, and encourage browning, roughen up the surface a bit with the tines of a fork.
Bake in preheated oven until bubbling and browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
The classic sandwich is converted to dip form, but I used pastrami instead of corned beef which is a little spicier. No matter which you use, you're going to enjoy this truly delicious hot dip, which is also great warm. Or room temperature.
