Ingredients:
1	tablespoon  pickling spice
2	pounds  boneless beef chuck-eye roast , trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
Salt and pepper
2	tablespoons  vegetable oil
2 1/2	cups  water
1 1/2	cups  ketchup
1	tablespoon  cider vinegar
1	teaspoon  dry mustard
8	hamburger buns , toasted

Directions:
1. BROWN BEEF Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Tie pickling spice in cheesecloth to make sachet. Pat beef dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Cook half of beef, turning occasionally, until well browned all over, about 8 minutes. Transfer to large bowl. Repeat with the remaining oil and beef.
2. BRAISE BEEF Stir water into pot, scraping up any browned bits. Add beef, along with any accumulated juices, to pot and bring to boil. Transfer pot to oven and cook covered, stirring occasionally, until meat is nearly tender, about 1 hour. Stir ketchup, vinegar, and mustard into pot. Add pickling spice sachet and continue to cook, covered, until meat is fork-tender, about 1 hour longer.
3. SHRED AND SERVE Discard sachet. Using slotted spoon, transfer beef to plate. When cool enough to handle, shred beef into bite-sized pieces. Return beef to pot and stir until coated with sauce and warmed. Season with salt and pepper. Serve on hamburger buns.

Description: 
Donâ€™t let the simplicity of the ingredients fool you; the deep flavors of the finished dish are complex and varied. It is similar to other barbecued beef sandwich recipes, but there are some key differences.
