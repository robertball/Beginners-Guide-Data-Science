Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 cup oil (coconut or olive)
1 cup unsweetened coconut milk***
8 eggs
1 cup almond meal*
1 cup flax meal
1 cup protein powder**
1/8 cup (3T) baking powder
1-2 T cinnamon (optional)
1-2 T ground chia seeds (optional)

Directions:
Dump all ingredients in bowl. You can mix wet ingredients first, then add in dry ingredients, but it really isn't necessary.
Mix with electric hand mixer for at least 2 minutes. May start thin and then thicken over time. That's perfect.
Use a 1/3 cup to pour amount in preheated waffle maker.
If pancakes are desired, use a microwave save dish (suggest round shape). Lightly oil the dish and pour in 1/3 cup of batter. Micro for 1 minute, then 30 seconds. If center is still wet, then micro in 20 second increments. You can do two at a time if your microwave has space.
Use Spatula to lift waffle or pancake onto plate.
Top with fruit, nuts, and syrup. Enjoy! Footnotes: *can substitute flax meal if you don't have almond, **Vanilla is best but you can also sub coconut flour and add 2 more eggs, ***Any milk is fine

Description: 
Who said eating healthy meant deprivation? These fluffy gluten free waffles/pancakes taste as good or better than the others! It's a family favorite every Saturday morning topped with blueberries and walnuts at least. No guilt in eating two, but be warned, one will fill you up, so eat it slow and enjoy!
