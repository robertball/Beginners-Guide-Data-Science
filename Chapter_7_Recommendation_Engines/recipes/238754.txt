Ingredients:
Reynolds Wrap® Pan Lining Paper
2 pounds parsnips and/or carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup whipping cream
5 tablespoons butter, chopped and divided
3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
1/2 cup pecans, chopped
2 tablespoons maple syrup

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a 2-quart rectangular baking dish with Reynolds Wrap(R) Pan Lining Paper, parchment side up. No need to grease dish.
Add parsnips and/or carrots to a large microwave-safe bowl. Add 1/4 cup water and cover with wax paper. Microwave on high for 5 minutes. Uncover and add sweet potatoes. Cover and microwave 15 minutes more or until tender, stirring once. Drain and return vegetables to bowl.
Pour broth and cream into the bowl with vegetables. Use a potato masher to mash to desired consistency. Stir in 3 tablespoons butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Transfer to prepared baking dish.
Combine brown sugar, flour, rosemary, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Using a pastry blender, two forks, or your fingers, cut in 2 tablespoons butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in pecans and maple syrup and sprinkle over sweet potato-mixture.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until pecan mixture is just starting to brown.
