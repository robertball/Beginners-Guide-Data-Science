Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 (8 ounce) package sliced mushrooms
1 large onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, diced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 pounds beef sirloin steak, cut into 1 inch cubes
1 cup white wine
2 cups beef bouillon
1 teaspoon crumbled dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups half-and-half cream

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the mushrooms, onion and garlic in the butter until tender. Reserving the liquid in the saucepan, remove the mushroom mixture to a bowl. Return the butter mixture to medium-high heat.
Whisk together the flour and half-and-half until smooth; set aside.
Season the beef with salt and pepper; cook the beef in the reserved liquid until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir the wine, beef bouillon, thyme, basil, oregano, bay leaves, and pepper; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes. Slowly stir in the flour mixture and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, 20 to 30 minutes. Add the mushroom mixture and stir.

Description: 
Based on a dish I had a pub in Scotland, this beef stroganoff is best served with rice instead of noodles.  The sauce is not very thick, so it coats the rice nicely.
