Ingredients:
2 pounds fresh strawberries, hulled
4 cups white sugar
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 tbsp butter

Directions:
In a wide bowl, crush strawberries in batches until you have 4 cups of mashed berry. In a heavy bottomed saucepan, mix together the strawberries, sugar, and lemon juice. Stir over low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Add butter. Gradually increase heat to high, and bring the mixture to a full rolling boil. Boil, stirring constantly for 10 minutes, or until the mixture reaches 220 degrees F (105 degrees C). Test 1 tsp on frozen plate until jam thickens upon cooling. Transfer to hot sterile jars, leaving 1/4 to 1/2 inch headspace, and seal. Process any unsealed jars in a water bath. If the jam is going to be eaten right away, don't bother with processing, and just refrigerate.

Description: 
This is by far the easiest recipe I have found for strawberry jam without using a pectin.  The jam is soft, spreadable and delicious.Modified from: Strawberry Jam
