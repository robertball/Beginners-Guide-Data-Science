Ingredients:
4 Cups Oatmeal
4 Cups Oatbran
1 Cup Almonds
1 Cup Craisins
1 Cup Sunflower Seeds
1 Cup Lecithin granules
1 Cup Flax Seed

Directions:
Combine ingredients and store in the refrigerator.  When ready to use, measure out 1/3 cup per serving.  Then cover with 1/2 C of Water.  Mixture should stand overnight.  Flax must soak to become biologically useful.
Add fresh or frozen fruit to taste.  Frozen berries are wonderful.
Mix in yogurt or milk, soy or rice milk as well.
DO NOT add sugar or honey or sugar substitute.  Do Not toast the ingredients.    You can heat the cereal but it will destroy the lecithin.
