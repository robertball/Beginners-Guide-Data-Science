1 cup dry black beans
Rice:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/4 cups chopped onion
1 cup chopped celery
1 1/2 tablespoons minced seeded jalapeno pepper
3/4 teaspoon salt
4 cloves garlic, chopped
2 bay leaves
1 1/2 cups uncooked basmati rice
3 1/2 cups water
Remaining ingredients:

1/2 cup chopped yellow bell pepper
3/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

Sort and wash beans, and place in a medium saucepan. Cover with water to 2 inches above beans; bring to a boil, and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat; cover and let stand 1 hour.
