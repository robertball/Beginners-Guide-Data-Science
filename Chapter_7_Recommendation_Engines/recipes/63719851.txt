Ingredients:
1 - (18.5 ounce) box white cake mix (without pudding)
1 - (3 ounce) package strawberry jello
1 - tablespoon self rising flour
4 - teaspoons granulated sugar
3/4 - cup vegetable oil
4 - eggs
1/2 - cup water
5 - ounces frozen strawberries, thawed and well drained (reserve any juice)
Strawberry Butter cream Frosting:
1 - stick (1/2 cup) real butter, softened
1 - 16 oz box (3 3/4 cups) powdered sugar
1/4 - cup strawberries with juice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
To make the cake, combine to cake mix, Jello, flour and sugar in a large bowl. Mix well.
Add the oil. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition Add the water and strawberries and mix well.
Divide the batter evenly into two 9 x 1.5 inch or two 10 -inch round baking pans that have been greased and floured.
Bake for 25-35 minutes, or until a tooth pick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean and the layers pull away from the sides of the pan.
Transfer the layers from the oven to wire racks. Let them cool, still in their pans, for 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes, run a knife around the inside edge of each pan, then UN mold each layer onto the racks to cool completely.
To prepare the frosting beat the butter on medium speed until fluffy. Add sugar and strawberries and beat until creamy (adding more sugar if the frosting is too thin).
Frost cooled cake.
