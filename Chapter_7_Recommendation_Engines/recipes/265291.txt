Ingredients:
2 cups tapioca pearls
5 medium potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or to taste
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 cup chopped peanuts, divided
2 green chile peppers, chopped, or more to taste
7 fresh curry leaves, chopped, or more to taste
salt to taste
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 cup chopped cilantro (optional)
2 tablespoons lime juice

Directions:
Rinse tapioca in a large container. Drain. Cover and let stand, 8 hours to overnight.
Rinse tapioca again before starting to cook. Drain, cover, and set aside.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add potatoes; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain.
Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds; cook until dark, about 30 seconds. Add potatoes, 3/4 cup peanuts, green chile peppers, and curry leaves. Season with salt. Saute until flavors combine, 7 to 10 minutes.
Add sugar to the potato mixture; mix well. Add tapioca and remaining 1/4 cup peanuts. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, until tapioca looks transparent, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in cilantro and lime juice. Mix well. Add a bit more salt if desired. Serve hot.
