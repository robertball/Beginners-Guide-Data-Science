Ingredients:
2 packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110-115)
1 cup whole wheat flour
3 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 sticks butter, divided use
1 egg
1 cup warm milk

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in water; let stand until bubbly, about 15 minutes.  In another bowl stir together 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup of the all-purpose flour, sugar, and salt until well mixed.  Pour these dry ingredients into the yeast mixture and add 6 tablespoons of melted butter, the egg, and milk.  Beat 5 minutes to blend well.  Gradually beat in remaining 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour.  Cover bowl with damp towel or plastic wrap and let dough rise in warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Melt the remaining butter and pour half of it into 9 x 13 pan, tilting pan to cover the bottom and onto the sides. Beat down dough and form into twelve balls, placing them into the buttered pan.  Drizzle the remaining butter over dough.  Cover lightly and let rise in warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes.  Bake at 425 for 12-17 minutes or until lightly browned.  Serve hot!

Description: 
This recipe has been around longer than bread machines, so pull out your mixer!  You won't need butter on the table for these rolls!  My family wants to know why I keep trying new recipes when this one is perfection.  The best part?  No kneading necessary!
