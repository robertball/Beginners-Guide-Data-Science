Description: 
I received this recipe from a friend of mine several years ago.  I believe she got the recipe from the Rothschild brand hot pepper peach preserves she purchased at a local restaurant.  It's a great dish for holiday gatherings or just about any party!  The mixture of sweet and spicy together is amazing!
