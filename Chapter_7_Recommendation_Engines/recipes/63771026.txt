Ingredients:
2 tsp olive oil, separated
1 pound ground chicken
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 medium zucchini, diced
1 can corn, drained
1 can tomatoes and chiles, drained
1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup salsa
2 cups quinoa, cooked in chicken or veggie broth
3/4 cup shredded cheese (I use Mexican blend)

Directions:
Drizzle a large skillet with 1 tsp of olive oil.  When it's heated, cook the ground chicken (seasoned with the cayenne and garlic) over medium heat.  Drain and set aside.   Drizzle the pan with the remaining olive oil and reheat, then add your zucchini.  Saute for approximately 4 minutes until it begins to soften.  Add the chicken back to the skillet and add the remaining ingredients.  Let the flavors combine for a a few minutes, then top with the cheese and cover until it melts.  Great served with chips, stuffed in half a zucchini (and baked), in a tortilla or just by itself!
