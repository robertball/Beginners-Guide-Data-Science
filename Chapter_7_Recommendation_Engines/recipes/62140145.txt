Ingredients:
1 lb. ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 Tbl. flour
6 Tbl. catsup
1 Tbl. prepared mustard
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper
1 cup sour cream
8 hamburger buns

Directions:
Brown the meat along with the chopped onions in a skillet.  Drain off the extra fat, then add the flour and stir to absorb the remaining juices.  Add the rest of the ingredients except the buns.  Simmer 5-10 minutes and serve on toasted split buns.  Better yet, refrigerate, re-heat and serve the next day - yummm.

Description: 
My mom used to make this in the 70's - it's a delicious combination of ground beef and sour cream, reminiscent of stroganoff on a bun.  Over the years I've had many requests for the recipe - hope you enjoy it as much as we have.
