Ingredients:
1 pkg (8 oz) refrigerated vegan sausage
2 slices sandwich bread
5 teaspoons powdered egg replacer
1/2 cup ketchup
1/3 cup olive oil (I used less)
1 pkg (12 oz) frozen vegan burger crumbles
1 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped, fresh parsley or oregano (I used cilantro because that's what I had)
3/4 tsp dried thyme
1/8 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp ground black pepper

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 and spray 8x4" loaf pan with Pam
2. Finely chop sausage and set aside
3. Pulse bread in food processor to make crumbs
4. In a large bowl mix 1/3 cup water and egg replacer. Stir in ketchup and oil.  Add sausage, bread crumbs, and remaining ingredients.  Mix until well blended.
5. Scrape mixture into pan, packing gently and mounding top.  Cover with foil and put on a baking sheet.
6. Bake 60-70 minutes.  Remove foil last 20 minutes and spread 1/4 cup ketchup over top to make a glaze.
7. Let cool until just warm.  == I didn't do that!

Description: 
Best veggie meatloaf ever.  I put it in the fridge before baking it and then baked it a little longer than it said because of that because I wanted it to hold up.
