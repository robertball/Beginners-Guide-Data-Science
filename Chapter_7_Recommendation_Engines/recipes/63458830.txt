Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
5 pounds pork butt (shoulder roast) cut into 2-inch slices
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2teaspoon minced ginger
2 cups water, more if needed
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup white (shiro) miso paste

Directions:
Heat canola oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until hot. Sear pork slices until well browned on both sides, then remove. Stir in the garlic and ginger, cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the water, soy sauce, brown sugar, and miso; bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pan to dissolve the caramelized juices.
Place pork into pot, add additional water if needed to cover pork with the sauce. Then, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 3 hours until the pork is tender, and the sauce has thickened.

Description: 
This rich, sweet-and-salty Japanese braised pork is as comforting as it is easy to make. The recipe will also adapt well to a slow cooker, just do the searing and sauce-making on the stove, then pour it all into a slow cooker, and go do something fun while dinner cooks!Modified from: Miso Braised Pork
