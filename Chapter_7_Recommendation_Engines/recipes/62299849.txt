Directions:
This is very simple and tastes amazing!
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Boil water in a big pot for the pasta.
All of the ingredients sans pasta can easily go in a blender liquid and powdered this is by far the easiest way and the only was I do it.
Once pasta is cooked drain I and put it in the baking pan pour the  cheese sauce over the pasta.
Bake until the top of the pasta looks slightly browned and crispy  about 15 minutes
