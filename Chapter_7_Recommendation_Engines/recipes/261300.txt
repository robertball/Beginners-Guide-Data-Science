Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups freeze-dried raspberries, divided
2 cups white sugar
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch-process)
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
4 eggs
2 cups flour
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Pulse 1 1/2 cups raspberries in a blender or food processor until reduced to a powder.
Put white sugar, cocoa powder, oil, baking powder, vanilla, salt, and 1/4 cup powdered raspberries in a large bowl. Beat together with a mixer until well blended. Mix in eggs 1 at a time, waiting until each addition is incorporated before adding the next. Add flour; mix on low speed until incorporated. Cover with plastic wrap. Chill 4 to 8 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.
Put confectioners' sugar in a small bowl; put remaining powdered raspberries in another small bowl.
Roll walnut-size pieces of dough into a ball, then roll each ball partly in powdered raspberries and partly in powdered sugar. Arrange on prepared sheet and bake until barely set and crackled on top, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on sheet 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
With the addition of freeze-dried raspberries (found at natural-food markets and well-stocked grocery stores), this take on the classic chocolate crinkle cookie is absolutely addictive. I used the Chocolate Crinkles II recipe from Allrecipes as the base, then gave it a color and flavor boost with the berries.
