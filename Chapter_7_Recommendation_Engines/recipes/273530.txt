1/4 medium onion, chopped
1/8 cup green olives, diced
1/8 cup crumbled feta cheese
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tablespoons pine nuts
1/2 cup grated Asiago cheese, divided
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Trim ends from zucchini and cut each squash in half lengthwise. Scrape out centers of squash and place in a mixing bowl. Add onion, olives, feta cheese, garlic, pine nuts, 1/2 the Asiago cheese, basil, and oregano and mix well. Place mixture back into zucchini shells. Top each with a small amount of Asiago cheese and place zucchini boats on a baking sheet.
Cook under the preheated broiler until cheese browns, about 10 minutes.
