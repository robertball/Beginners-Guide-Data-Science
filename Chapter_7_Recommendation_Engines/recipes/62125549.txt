Ingredients:
2 Cups flour
1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/4 tsp. salt
1 Cup butter, unsalted and softened
1 Cup sugar
2 egg yolks
2 tsp. vanilla
2 Tbsp. grated lemon zest
1/2 Cup dried blueberries or cranberries
confectioner's sugar

Directions:
Sift the flour baking powder and salt into a medium bowl.
Beat the butter until creamy, 1 minute.
Add the sugar and beat until blended.
Add the egg yolks one at a time, the vanilla, lemon zest and blueberries.
Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat for another minute.
Reduce the speed of the mixer to low and add the dry ingredients, mixing just until a smooth dough forms.
Divide the dough in half and shape into logs, 1 1/2 inches in diameter and about 10 inches long.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours or until firm,(up to 3 days)
Dough can be frozen at this point and thawed when ready to bake.
Preheat the oven 350 and place the oven rack in the center position.
Unwrap one log and slice into 1/4 inch thick rounds.
Bake on ungreased baking sheet one inch apart for 9-11 minutes or until the edges of the cookies just start to turn golden.
Remove to cooling rack and dust with powdered sugar when cool.
