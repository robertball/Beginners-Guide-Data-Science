Ingredients:
16 oz Milk
5 egg yolks
8 oz whipping cream
4 oz sugar
1 fresh Vanilla bean or vanilla eccense
4 sheets of Gelatin or 1small packs granular.

Directions:
Reconstitute the Gelatin in Cool Water and set aside.  mix half the Milk with the sugar and Vanilla and heat to a near Boil.  Whip the Cream with a pinch of salt to stiff peaks  but do not over beat. Set aside. (refrigerate);   the other half of milk mix thoroughly with the yolks and begin slowly cooking as it begins to thicken mix in the other Milk part and continue cooking under watchful stirring,  until a obvious cream consistency  is obtained.  (  it should coat the back of a Wood spoon and "Rose" when firmly blown on). at this point remove from the heat and add the drained Gelatine,  continue mixing until completely dissolved.  quickly pour through a Screen Strainer to remove any lumps.  set  on an ice bath to rapidly cool.  making certain the Cream is still whipped,  begin folding the Egg cream carefully into the Whipped Cream.  When  completely incorporated set aside. (refrigerate) for 10-15 min.  Now divide the product into glasses or Bowls.
it may also be poured into a mold.   Refrigerate at least another 2 hours.
* There are variations "Viennese" with krokant and "Parisienne" with Caramel.  and of Course "Creme Russe"  with a portion of the whipped cream  substituted with Sour Cream; traditionally served (Layered) with fresh Black Currant.
