Ingredients:
CAKE:
1 (18.25-oz.) pkg. yellow cake mix
1 egg
1 stick butter, melted
FILLING:
1 (8-oz.) pkg. cream cheese, softened
1 (15-oz.) canned pumpkin (NOT pumpkin pie filling)
3 eggs
1 tbls. vanilla
1 stick butter, melted
1 (16-oz.) box powdered sugar
1 tbls. pumpkin pie spice or cake spice
1/2 cup chopped pecans (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. To make the cake: Combine the cake mix, egg, and melted butter. Mix well and pat the mixture into the bottom of a lightly greased 13 x 9-inch baking pan.
To prepare the filling: Beat the cream cheese and pumpkin until smooth in a large bowl. Add the eggs, vanilla and melted butter, then beat together. Add the powdered sugar and spice, and mix well. Stir in pecans if using. Pour and spread pumpkin mixture over cake batter and bake for 40-50 minutes. Make sure not to over-bake as the center will be a little gooey and firm upon cooling.
