Description: 
A quick, easy, and very delicious recipe that can be eaten for cold cereal, topping on yogurt or even for a snack. Because it does a better job than honey, I use part maltose syrup (purchased at Asian markets) to help bind the ingredients together instead of using all honey. Virgin coconut oil has many healthy properties and enhances the taste of the granola, but if that cannot be found you can substitute it with any other oil. Enjoy!
