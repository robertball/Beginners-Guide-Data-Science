Ingredients:
2 cups pecan halves, broken into coarse pieces
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup light corn syrup
3/4 cup dark corn syrup
4 eggs
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
8 half pint canning jars with lids and rings
cooking spray
2 unbaked 9-inch pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread pecans on a baking sheet.
Bake pecans in the preheated oven until lightly toasted, 6 to 8 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
Bring sugar, light corn syrup, and dark corn syrup to a boil in a saucepan; boil for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly, about 10 minutes.
Whisk eggs in a large bowl until frothy. Add syrup mixture slowly, whisking constantly to prevent eggs from curdling. Whisk in butter, vanilla extract, and salt until batter is smooth.
Spray 8 small jars with cooking spray. Press pieces of pie crust dough into bottom and sides of jars. Add a layer of toasted pecans to each jar. Spoon in batter, leaving 1/4 inch rim at top.
Bake in preheated oven until darkened on the top, about 40 minutes. Cool to room temperature before serving.

Description: 
Traditional Pecan Pie in a Jar has a deeply toasted, sweet, luxurious flavor. Just break through the caramelized, crispy pecan topping to expose the amber-colored rich filling and flaky crust inside. Serve with sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, if desired.
