Ingredients:
6 slices (1/2-3/4") Italian or French bread
3 medium tomatoes, diced small
1 clove minced garlic
3 T olive oil
1 T freshly chopped basil (dry can be used * or 1 tsp basil pesto)
1 T Balsamic vinegar
Salt
Pepper

Directions:
In a small bowl add (in order) oil, garlic, basil (or pesto), chopped tomatoes, salt, pepper, and balsamic vinegar.  Mix ingredients and let stand 15 minutes to infuse all the flavors.
In the meantime, arrange bread slices in single layer on cookie sheet.  Brush tops lightly with olive oil if desired.  Bake at 350 for approximatly 10 minutes, or until lightly golden.
Remove bread slices from oven and top with tomato mixture before serving.
** Delicious option:  After topping with tomato mixture, cover each slice of bread with one slice of mozzarella.  Return to oven and bake (or broil) until cheese is melted.
Buon appetito!
