Ingredients:
1/2 pound sliced bacon
1 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 cups diced peeled potatoes
1 cup water
2 cups frozen corn
1 (14.75 ounce) can cream-style corn
1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
6 ounces smoked sausage links, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 teaspoon dill weed

Directions:
In a large saucepan, cook the bacon until crisp. Remove to paper towels; crumble and set aside. Drain all but 2 tablespoons of the drippings. Saute celery and onion in drippings until onion is lightly browned. Add potatoes and water. Cover and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Stir in corn, milk, sausage, dill and bacon. Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
'EVERYONE in my wife's family is a corn lover, so her mom came up with this wonderful recipe to satisfy their appetites. With the bacon, sausage and potatoes, it's hearty enough to be a one-pot meal, but it's also really good with the chicken.'
