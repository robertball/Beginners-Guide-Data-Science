Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup corn flakes cereal
6 tablespoons milk or water
1/4 cup celery, finely chopped
2 tablespoons minced onion
1 pinch salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
Worcestershire sauce
30 ounces tomato sauce
4 tablespoons packed brown sugar
1 bay leaf

Directions:
Combine beef, cereal, milk, celery, onion, salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce together in large bowl.  Shape mixture into small balls and brown on all sides in frying pan.
Add in remaining ingredients; stir to mix ingredients and to remove flavourful brown particles from the bottom of frying pan.
Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat, cover and simmer at least 30 minutes so that the flavours are enhanced.  Discard bay leaf.  Bring to a boil, then simmer for 1 minute.
Serve with fettuccine, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese before serving.
