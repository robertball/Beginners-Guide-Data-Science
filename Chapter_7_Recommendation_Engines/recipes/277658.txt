Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 small onion, diced
1 small red bell pepper, diced
2 (12.5 fl oz) cans chicken breast chunks, drained
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO*TEL®)
1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup green (mild) hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®)
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
10 (6 inch) flour tortillas
1 cup Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and bell pepper; cook and stir until onion has browned, about 5 minutes. Add drained chicken breast and flake it apart with a fork. Stir in taco seasoning and cook until until vegetables have softened, 3 to 5 minutes.
Mix condensed soup, diced tomatoes, Greek yogurt, milk, hot pepper sauce, lime juice, oregano, chili powder, and cumin together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer sauce for 10 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Wrap chicken mixture in tortillas and arrange in a 9x13-inch baking pan. Pour sauce on top and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
