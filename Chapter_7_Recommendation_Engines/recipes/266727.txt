Ingredients:
toothpicks
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
10 banana peppers
10 slices peppered bacon, or to taste

Directions:
Soak toothpicks in water for 15 minutes.
Combine cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and cilantro in a large bowl. Mix well.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cut a slit lengthwise through each pepper without slicing it in half. Cut another slit about 1/4 inch from the stem across the previous slit, forming a 'T'. Remove seeds, as desired, using a paring knife.
Fill each pepper with the cream cheese stuffing mixture using a small spoon. Wrap each pepper with a slice of raw bacon. Slide 1 toothpick through the center of each pepper to hold onto the bacon and keep pepper closed.
Grill stuffed peppers for 15 minutes. Turn and cook until bacon is crisp, about 10 minutes more.

Description: 
Spicy meets sweet and creamy in these stuffed banana peppers. Makes a great snack or an appetizer for a party. Great for large groups as you can easily control the amount of spiciness. This is one of my favorites!
