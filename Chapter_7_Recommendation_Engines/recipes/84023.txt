Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds cubed beef stew meat
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup all-purpose flour for coating
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle beer
1 1/2 cups water
1 tablespoon crushed dried rosemary
1 pinch dried dill weed
2 medium onions, chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Season the beef with salt and pepper, then dredge in flour to coat. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the meat, and cook until browned on all sides, turning as needed. Remove the meat from the pot, and set aside.
Add the onion and garlic to the pot; cook and stir until clear and starting to brown. Return the meat the pot, and pour in the beer and water making sure to loosen any bits of food from the bottom of the pan. Season with rosemary, dill and parsley.
Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat for 1 1/2 hours.

Description: 
Cubed beef is simmered in beer with lots of onions. What else is better then that? Served with boiled carrots that you can add right in the pot. The gravy this makes tastes awesome on mashed potatoes!
