Ingredients:
6 tablespoons butter
2 large onions, sliced
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 (28 ounce) bottle ketchup
3 tablespoons cider vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons spicy brown mustard
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce
1 pound kielbasa sausage, cut into 1 inch pieces

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Saute onions until tender.  Stir in brown sugar, ketchup, vinegar, mustard, Worcestershire sauce and pepper sauce.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.
Place sausage in a slow cooker with the sauce and onions.  Cook on low for 4 to 5 hours.  The longer it simmers the better!
