Ingredients:
1 pound dry kidney beans
1/4 cup olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 stalks celery, chopped
6 cups water
2 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried sage
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
2 tablespoons chicken base (better than bouillon)
1 pound andouille sausage, sliced
2 teaspoons salt
4 cups water
2 cups long grain white rice

Directions:
Rinse beans, and then soak in a large pot of water overnight.
In a skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Cook onion, bell pepper, garlic, and celery in olive oil for 3 to 4 minutes.
Rinse beans, and transfer to a large pot with 7 cups water. Stir cooked vegetables into beans. Season with bay leaves, cayenne pepper, thyme, sage, parsley, chicken base and Cajun seasoning. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 2 1/2 hours.
Mash some of the beans to make the liquid creamy.
Stir sausage and salt into beans, and continue to simmer for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the rice.  In a saucepan, bring water and rice to a boil. Reduce
heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.  Serve beans over steamed rice.
