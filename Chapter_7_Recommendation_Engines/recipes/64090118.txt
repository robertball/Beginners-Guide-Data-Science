Ingredients:
2 Cups Stone ground grits or quick grits (not instant)
6 Cups Water
Butter to taste
1 tsp Salt
1/4 Cup Heavy cream
Up to 1 cup Milk - to add at the end (optional)

Directions:
Place water and grits (if using stone ground, remember to soak them overnight) in slow cooker. Let grits settle to the bottom and then using a strainer, fish out the grits that float to the top.
Add salt to slow cooker. It's important to salt now as opposed to after.
Turn slow cooker on high and set for 2.5 hours. Remember to stir or whisk grits well before putting lid on (to avoid clumps) and stir every 60 minutes during cooking.
At 2 hours check on your grits. Stir grits. You want to see a fairly thick, creamy, uniform consistency. (If not, set timer for an hour more and check back in thirty minutes to complete recipe.)
Depending on the texture and flavor you desire, you may add some milk to even out consistency and give the grits a richer flavor (this is particularly good when making shrimp and grits).
Also be sure to add the cream now and mix in well. You may also add in butter now if you wish.
Cover slow cooker and allow to cook for remaining time.
Season as you wish with cheese, bacon, chives, pepper, etc.
