Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 stalk celery, sliced
1 yellow onion, chopped
1 carrot, peeled and diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
4 potatoes, peeled and cubed
4 cups chicken stock
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground thyme
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1 egg
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups diced cooked ham
4 cups milk
1 head broccoli, chopped
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat butter in a large stock pot over medium heat. Cook and stir celery, onion, carrot, and garlic until the onion is translucent. Stir in potatoes, chicken stock, cayenne, thyme, and parsley. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat. Simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
Mix egg and flour together in a bowl using a fork until the mixture resembles grains of rice.
Stir ham and milk into the stock pot and allow the soup to return to a simmer. Slowly sprinkle the flour mixture into the soup, stirring constantly to prevent clumps. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in broccoli and Cheddar cheese. Cook until the broccoli is tender and the Cheddar cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This is a soup for when the weather is bitter and you crave serious, starchy comfort food. I put this together one night when I couldn't decide whether to make potato, ham, or broccoli-cheese soup - the result is a complete meal in a bowl.
