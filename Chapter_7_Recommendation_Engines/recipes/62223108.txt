Ingredients:
1 8oz package of linguini noodles
4 cloves fresh garlic finely chopped
3 tbsp butter
1/4 cup soy sauce
fresh ground pepper

Directions:
In a medium pan, bring water up to a rolling boil.  Cook noodles until desired texture (I like mine al-dente which takes about 8 minutes with linguini).
Drain noodles and leave them in strainer.  Melt butter in the pan on low heat, add fresh garlic and stir. (Be careful not to burn butter and garlic.) Toss in pasta noodles until coated in butter.
Add soy sauce and toss until fully coated with all ingredients.  Top with ground pepper to your taste.  Enjoy!
