Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/3 cup milk
1/4 cup shortening
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
1 1/2 cups blueberries
2 eggs, beaten
1 1/4 cups ricotta cheese
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch square baking dish.
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, 3/4 cup of sugar, and baking powder. Add the milk, shortening, 1 egg, and lemon extract, and use an electric mixer to mix on low speed for 1 minute, then on medium speed for 1 minute. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and spread evenly. Sprinkle blueberries over the batter.
In a medium bowl, stir together 2 beaten eggs, ricotta cheese, 1/3 cup of sugar, and vanilla extract. Spoon this mixture over the blueberries, and spread evenly.
Bake for 55 to 60 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool completely before cutting into squares and serving.
