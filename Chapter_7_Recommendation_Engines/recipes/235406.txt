Ingredients:
1 red bell pepper, cut into matchstick-sized pieces
1 small onion, cut into matchstick-sized pieces
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 1/3 tablespoons olive oil
3 1/3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 eggplant, sliced lengthwise 3/8-inch thick
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
1/4 cup grated mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Mix red bell pepper, onion, and garlic in a large mixing bowl; season with basil, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Drizzle olive oil and balsamic vinegar over the pepper mixture; toss to coat the vegetables evenly.
Brush eggplant slices with olive oil to coat thinly.
Spread about 1/3 of the pepper mixture into the bottom of a square glass baking dish; top with a layer of about 1/3 of the eggplant. Repeat layering twice more. Top final layer with mozzarella cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is browned and the vegetables are bubbling, 35 to 40 minutes.
