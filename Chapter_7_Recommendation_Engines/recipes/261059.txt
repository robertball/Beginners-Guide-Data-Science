Ingredients:
1 cup ghee (clarified butter)
1 cup flour

Directions:
Preheat a small saucepan over medium-low heat for 2 minutes. Add ghee; cook and stir until melted, about 2 minutes.
Whisk flour into the melted ghee. Cook and stir until fully absorbed and lightly browned, about 3 minutes.
Remove from heat; cool and refrigerate until needed.

Description: 
Not sure where I learned this from, but using the clarified butter, ghee, sets it apart from every other roux out there. When pre-seasoning this roux for a specific purpose such as a bechamel sauce, gravy, or soup, letting it cool and sit for a bit before use really enhances the flavor of the dish. Cook until lightly browned for a nuttier flavor. Desired thickness really depends on dish requirements and amount of flour added; for a thinner roux, use less flour, for a thicker roux, use more.
