Ingredients:
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups cottage cheese
1 1/2 cups quick rolled oats
3 tablespoons wheat germ (optional)
1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
1 teaspoon dried thyme
2 tablespoons vegetable oil (for frying)
1 (10 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat eggs into a large bowl. Stir in cottage cheese, rolled oats, wheat germ, dry onion soup mix, and dried thyme. Form into 8 patties.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place patties in oil, and brown on both sides. Remove patties to a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Pour condensed soup into a small bowl. Stir in 1/2 can of water (or milk) to dilute, then pour over patties.
Bake in a preheated oven until the soup is bubbly, about 20 minutes.
