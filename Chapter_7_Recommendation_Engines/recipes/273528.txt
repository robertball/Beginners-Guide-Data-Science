Ingredients:
10 strips bacon
30 garlic-stuffed green olives
30 toothpicks

Directions:
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Cut each bacon strip into 3 pieces. Wrap 1 piece of bacon around an olive and secure with a toothpick; place on a broiling pan. Continue with remaining bacon pieces and olives.
Broil in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp, but not burned, 10 to 15 minutes.
