Ingredients:
4 jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced
3 tablespoons prepared horseradish
1/4 cup roasted garlic
1 cup mayonnaise
4 (6 ounce) salmon fillets

Directions:
In the container of a food processor, combine the jalapeno peppers, horseradish, garlic and mayonnaise. Set aside 3/4 of the mixture in the refrigerator. Brush or spread the remaining 1/4 onto the salmon fillets. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to marinate.
Preheat a grill for medium-high heat. When hot, lightly oil the grate.
Grill the salmon fillets until they are able to be flaked with a fork, about 7 minutes per side. Baste occasionally with the remaining marinade.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe for my Husband's boss who can not get enough heat or garlic in his food.  He still requests this dish often, according to this wife. Warning: I would not recommend this recipe for a first date or a romantic evening.  You will love it if you love garlic and very spicy food.  It's also very good on French bread for a spicy garlic bread alternative.
