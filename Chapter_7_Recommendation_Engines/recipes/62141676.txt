Ingredients:
2 lbs. lamb
3 1/2 cups beef broth
1 large onion, chopped
3 potatoes, diced (I don't peel them.)
1/2 tsp. of marjoram
1 tsp. of celery seed
1 tsp. of thyme
salt & pepper to taste
1 10 oz. package frozen peas, partially thawed
6 tbsp. flour

Directions:
Brown the meat first in a skillet.
Put onions and potatoes in the bottom of a crock pot.
Place lamb on top.
Put everything else in except peas and flour.
After 8-10 hours, add the peas and flour and break up the meat with two forks.
Turn crock pot on high and cook 15-20 minutes more.

Description: 
This is so EASY. Put it together in the morning and forget about it. You cannot screw this up. The recipe called for cutting up the lamb into bite-sized pieces first. I don't do that. I do that about 8 hours into cooking. It is MUCH easier. Just pull out the lamb and pull apart. Put it back in for awhile. Serve it up with a nice Cabertet Sauvignon.
