Ingredients:
500gr dry black eyed peas1 large zucchini type Caserta4 carrotssalt1/2 teaspoon sugar2 slices of lemonGarnish:2 large tomato1 finely chopped onioncapersolive oillemon juicesalt

Directions:
Rinse the black eyed peas well and bring them to boil in a large, deep casserole in 6 -7 cups of warm water for 30 minutes. While the beans are boiling add two slices of lemon and half teaspoon of sugar. You will notice that the boiling water gets a dark color through out. After the 30 minutes, remove your casserole from the fire , rinse your black eyed peas and drain them well. Bring them again to boil for another 30-40 minutes.While your beans are boiling, cut the carrots and the zucchini in squares and add them to the casserole. Add salt and let them to cook slowly.Once the beans have the desired tenderness, remove them from fire and serve them.I like to garnish my plate with chopped onions, tomatoes and capers! Of course I add at the end lots of lemon juice, olive oil and salt!!!If you like fish, you can add some smoked tuna or smoked sardines!!
