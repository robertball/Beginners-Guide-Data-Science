Ingredients:
3 nectarines, pitted and cut into bite-size pieces
3 tart plums, pitted and cut into bite-size pieces
1/2 pint fresh raspberries
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2/3 cup cold unsalted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread the nectarine and plum pieces into the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking dish. Sprinkle the raspberries over the fruit. Whisk together the flour, white sugar, brown sugar, ginger, and cinnamon in a bowl; cut the butter into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter until it resembles coarse crumbs. Spread the crumb mixture evenly over the fruit and raspberries.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, and turn the dish around in the oven for even cooking. Bake another 10 to 15 minutes; if crumb topping is pale, place dish under broiler for 1 to 3 minutes to brown.

Description: 
This tart fruit and juicy base has the sweet top that balances it out.  It's so easy that a non-baker like me can whip it up!  For a change, switch the ginger for half a teaspoon of nutmeg.
