Ingredients:
1 cup coconut milk
¼ cup water
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground chili pepper
1 teaspoon salt
½ bunch cilantro
3 large garlic cloves
¼ cup lemon juice
¼ cup lemon juice
¼ cup olive oil
½ bunch cilantro
? teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons erythritol

Directions:
With a sharp knife, separate the wings into wing and drummets. Combine the ingredients for the Tikka Chicken marinade in a large plastic zip-loc bag and add the wings. Marinate for 24-48 hours.
Remove the Tikka Chicken wings from the marinade and dry off with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and let warm up to room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat the grill.
Oil the grill grate and cook the wings until completely cooked through. While the wings are cooking, combine the ingredients for the sauce in a blender and blend. Taste. Adjust seasoning. It should taste both tart and sweet.
Remove the Tikka Chicken wings from the grill and either pour the sauce over and serve or serve the sauce on the side.
