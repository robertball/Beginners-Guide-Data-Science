Ingredients:
1 egg
2 tablespoons water
1 cup medium grind yellow cornmeal
1/2 cup corn flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup soy milk or silk
2 tablespoons lemon juice or vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease six muffin cups or line with muffin paper.
In a small glass add lemon juice to soy milk and let sit for 5 minutes.
In a small bowl, beat together egg and water. In a separate bowl, combine cornmeal, flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Add egg, oil and turned soy milk; stir until smooth.  Let sit for at least 10 minutes.  Spoon batter into prepared muffin tins using approximately 1/2 cup for each muffin.
Bake in pre-heated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
