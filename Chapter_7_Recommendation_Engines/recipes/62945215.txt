Ingredients:
6 Slices thick cut bacon
2 Cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 Cup finely shredded sharp cheddar or cheese mixture
1 stick (1/2) cup unsalted butter,softened and cubed
1 large egg
1 egg yoke
2 tbs heavy cream
1 tsp Hickory Salt (optional)

Directions:
Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium high heat until very crisp. Transfer and place on paper towel to dry. Finely chop.
Place flour, cayenne pepper, butter, eggs,salt, and cream in the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix all ingredients together until well combined.
Pour in cheese and bacon, and mix on low speed until combined.
Thurn the dough out onto a lighly floured surface and roll into a log about 1 1/2 inch around. Wrap the log in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Preheat your oven to 350F during the last 30 minutes of chilling.
Remove the chilled log, and slice into 1/4 inch thinck rounds. Place them slightly apart on an ungreased baking tray. Press the biscuits down gently with a fork, if you like.
Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the cookies are just golden around the edges and firm to the touch.
Cool on a wire rack. These bacon cheddar biscuits will keep well in an airtight container for at least a week.
