Ingredients:
2 cups canned chickpeas
3-4 cups white vinegar
1 tsp Coarse sea salt
2 tsp extra virgin olive oil

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with tin foil or parchment paper.
Take chickpeas and vinegar and place in a medium sized pot. Add a dash of sea salt. Bring to a boil and then remove from heat. Let sit in pot for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400F (reduced from 425F).
Carefully drain chickpeas.
Place on lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil and sea salt. Massage with fingers until fully coated. Roast for 30-40 minutes, flipping once half way through. Keep a careful eye on them after 25 minutes of cooking to ensure they don’t burn. The goal here is crispy and golden chickpeas, not black…lol.
Enjoy as a high protein snack or as a side to a lunch or dinner.
