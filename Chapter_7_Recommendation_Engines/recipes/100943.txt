Ingredients:
1 quart low-sodium chicken broth
3 cups low-fat milk
4 tablespoons butter, divided
1 medium onion, cut into small dice
2 stalks celery, cut into small dice
1 cup uncooked white long-grain rice
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups shredded cooked chicken
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper

Directions:
In a microwave safe glass bowl, heat chicken broth until steamy hot. Heat milk in a microwave safe glass bowl until steamy hot as well.
Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a Dutch oven or small soup kettle over medium heat. Add onions and celery; saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in rice, broth, poultry seasoning and thyme; cook until rice is tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.
Heat remaining butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in flour; cook until golden, about 1 minute. Stir in hot milk, and bring it to a simmer; stirring occasionally, cook until smooth and thick. Add milk mixture and chicken into cooked rice; heat through, about 2 to 3 minutes. Season soup with salt and pepper, and serve.
