Ingredients:
3  cups coarsely grated zucchini
1/2  teaspoon salt
1  cup fresh breadcrumbs (from a baguette)
1  egg
2  green onions, thinly sliced
1/4  cup diced red bell pepper
1 1/2  teaspoons Old Bay seasoning
1  teaspoon Dijon mustard
1  tablespoon mayonnaise or plain yogurt
1/8  teaspoon red pepper flakes
2  tablespoons vegetable oil, for frying
1  teaspoon butter

Directions:
Place grated zucchini in a colander; sprinkle lightly with salt and let stand 30 minutes. Press with paper towels to remove as much liquid as possible. Zucchini should be fairly dry, and you should have about 2 cups. Place zucchini and remaining ingredients (except oil and butter) in a bowl. Mix well. Form into 8 patties the size of crab cakes. Chill.
Heat oil and butter in a skillet.
Add patties to skillet and cook on both sides until browned. Drain on paper towels.
