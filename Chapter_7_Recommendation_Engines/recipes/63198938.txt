Ingredients:
Pillsbury Buttermilk Biscuits
Shredded Cheese (I had Mexican style on hand)
Frozen Shredded Hash Browns
1 package of Cooked Bacon
6 Scrambles Eggs
One Egg for top of Biscuits

Directions:
Cook your bacon until crisp so it will break easily into pieces. Cook your Hash Browns. Cook the eggs and have the shredded cheese ready. Stretch out one of the biscuits, don't be afraid. Make them flatter and bigger about 2 1/2 to 3 inches side to side. Put a little bit of Hash Browns, Bacon, Scrambled Eggs and Cheese on top. Grab the sides and start pulling them to the top and then pinch to close.  Don't be afraid to pull out those sides and up. Turn pinched side down on a greased pan. Beat one egg and add a Tablespoon of water. Brush tops of Biscuits with egg to give it a nice brown to it. Season with salt and pepper. Cook at 425 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes. Every oven varies so I would check at 8 and if they aren't brown yet wait and check again until they are done.  These freeze well, and can be reheated straight from the freezer. About 50 seconds in the microwave.
