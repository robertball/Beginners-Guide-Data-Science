Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 small onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
2 cups blueberries
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute onion, garlic, and ginger in hot oil until the onion begins to turn translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir salt, cinnamon, cloves, cumin, cayenne pepper, and celery seed into the onion mixture; continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is completely softened, 2 to 3 minutes more.
Stir blueberries and brown sugar into the onion mixture. Mash the berries as they cook until completely softened, about 10 minutes.
Blend the blueberry mixture with an immersion blender until the mixture is thick with no large chunks. Stir balsamic vinegar into blueberry mixture, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until thickened to your liking, 10 to 15 minutes more.

Description: 
Wonderful twist on a condiment staple! We have tripled the recipe and then canned the ketchup; our desired consistency yielded five half-pint jars.
