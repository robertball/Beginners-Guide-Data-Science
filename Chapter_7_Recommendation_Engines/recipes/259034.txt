Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 apples - peeled, cored and sliced, peel reserved
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup brandy
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pastry for 9-inch double-crust pie
1/2 (8.5 ounce) package corn muffin mix (such as JiffyÂ®)
1/4 cup milk
4 nectarines, peeled and sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate.
Combine apple peels, white sugar, brown sugar, water, brandy, cinnamon, and vanilla extract in a saucepan;  bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and simmer until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove apple peels with a fork.
Roll 1 crust into a 12-inch circle; place in the prepared pie plate. Roll out second crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut a few slits in the center to vent steam.
Mix corn muffin mix and milk in a bowl. Pour into pie plate.
Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from oven. Layer apple slices and nectarine slices on top. Pour sugar mixture slowly over fruit; cover with second crust. Press crusts together to seal; flute edges.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until top crust is golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes. Let cool to room temperature before slicing, about 1 hour.
