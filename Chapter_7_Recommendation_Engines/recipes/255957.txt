Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 cup apple cider
4 eggs
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 (4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
Glaze:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
3/4 cup apple cider

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray.
Combine cake mix, 1 cup apple cider, eggs, butter, and vanilla pudding mix in a large bowl; mix until smooth. Pour batter into the tube pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
Stir confectioners' sugar and 3/4 cup apple cider together in a small bowl to make the glaze.
Pour glaze over the cake and let soak into the cake and down the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes. Invert onto a plate and cool completely, about 30 minutes.
