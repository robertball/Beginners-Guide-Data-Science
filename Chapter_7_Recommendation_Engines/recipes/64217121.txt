Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons honey
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 shallot, finely chopped
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
16 cups (8 ounces) spring lettuces such as baby arugula, Bibb, red leaf

Directions:
In a jar with a lid, combine the honey, Dijon, salt, and shallot. Add the lemon juice, vinegar, and oil and shake well until lightly thickened. Place the salad greens in a large bowl and drizzle with the dressing (you can use all, or, if you less if you prefer). Toss well to coat and serve.
