Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans.
Mix pumpkin pie filling, sweet potato pie filling, water, and oil together in a bowl; add flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Stir well. Pour mixture into the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into each loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Description: 
I didn't have an extra pie crust. I had leftover pumpkin and sweet potato pie filling. I didn't want to throw it out, so I decided to experiment with it. It turned out better than expected. I'm sure it will work using either pumpkin or sweet potato pie filling. Can add nuts, raisins, etc. if desired.
