Ingredients:
2 bone-in chicken breast halves
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 1/2 teaspoons butter or margarine
1 small onion, thinly sliced
1 celery rib, thinly sliced
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup apple jelly
3 tablespoons orange juice
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme

Directions:
Sprinkle chicken with salt if desired. In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat; brown chicken on all sides. Remove and keep warm. In the pan drippings, saute onion and celery until tender. Add the remaining ingredients; cook and stir until jelly is melted. Return chicken to pan. Cook, uncovered, for 30-35 minutes or until meat juices run clear. Remove skin if desired. Top chicken with onion mixture.
