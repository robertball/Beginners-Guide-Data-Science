Ingredients:
1  loaf white bread, or
if you don't have white bread, use soda crackers, like Saltines and oyster crackers or melba toast, instead. approx. 23 saltine crackers per cup

Directions:
Push chunks of white bread through the shredding disk of a food processor to make coarse crumbs.
Spread the crumbs on a baking sheet and bake at 300 F degrees until the crumbs are dry but not toasted, about 6 to 8 minutes. Shake the sheet twice during baking. Be careful not to let the crumbs brown!
Immediately remove bread crumbs from oven and allow them to cool.
Once cooled, crumbs may be stored in the freezer, in a resealable plastic bag for as long as several months.

Description: 
Here is your chance to control the ingredients in yours. Any white bread will do for making panko. An Asian chef I once worked with swore that the best homemade panko came from Wonder Bread! The yield will vary according to how large you make your crumbs,23 min | 15 min prep | 3 -4 Cups 1  loaf white bread, or  
 if you don't have white bread, use soda crackers, like Saltines and oyster crackers or melba toast, instead. approx. 23 saltine crackers per cup, I am guessing.
