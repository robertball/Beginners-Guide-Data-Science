Ingredients:
1 lb zucchini
1/2 cup whole wheat panko bread crumbs
1/4 grated parmesan cheese
2 or 3 eggs

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 425°F and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spray the sheet with non-stick cooking spray and set aside. Cut zucchini into thick “fries” and blot dry. Whisk the eggs together. In a separate bowl, mix the grated parmesan and bread crumbs together. Dip the zucchini in the eggs and then shake the sticks to remove any excess egg. Roll the zucchini in the bread crumbs and then place them on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining zucchini, making sure the zucchini pieces aren’t touching each other. Bake for 10-12 minutes in the prepared oven then remove from oven, flip the fries, and bake for another 10-12 minutes or until the zucchini is not soggy and the coating is crisp and golden brown.

Description: 
Cravings can get the best of us, especially when they’re for foods that aren’t that good for you. When a craving strikes, it’s usually because of one of the three things: taste, texture or temperature. These three snack cheats satiate all three of these triggers, and are super tasty, too!
