Ingredients:
4 fresh peaches, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
4 teaspoons finely minced fresh basil
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese (such as Sargento® Off the Block)
1/2 cup butter, room temperature
7 tablespoons brown sugar
2 eggs, room temperature
1/4 cup shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese (such as Sargento® Off the Block)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Mix peaches, basil, and 1 tablespoon brown sugar in a bowl; let sit until sugar dissolves, about 15 minutes.
Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Mix 1 cup Cheddar cheese into flour mixture.
Beat butter and 7 tablespoons brown sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, until just combined; gently fold in peaches. Mix flour mixture, a little at time, into peach mixture until batter is just combined.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
Nothing says summer like a ripe, juicy peach and fresh fragrant basil. I love pairing fruits with cheese, and these were inspired by apple cheddar muffins my mom used to make. These savory sidekicks have just a hint of sweetness and make the perfect addition to your summer brunch table!
