Ingredients:
1 cup crushed pork rinds
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried basil
½ cup melted butter
3  skinless, boneless chicken breasts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix pork rinds, Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, sea salt, thyme, and basil together in a large bowl. Place melted butter in a separate bowl.
Cut each chicken breast into 3/4-inch thick strips - about 5 strips per breast. Dip each strip into melted butter and coat with pork rind breading. Place coated chicken strips on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink inside, about 20 minutes.
