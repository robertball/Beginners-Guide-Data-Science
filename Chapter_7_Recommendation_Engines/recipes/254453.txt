Ingredients:
3 cups sliced English cucumber
2 cloves garlic, sliced
1 cup packed basil leaves
2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves
1/2 cup water, plus more as needed
1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar, or more to taste
1/4 cup olive oil
1 pinch cayenne pepper
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
8 ounces burrata cheese

Directions:
Place cucumber slices, garlic, basil, oregano, water, rice vinegar, olive oil, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper  into the bowl of a blender. Pulse 2 or 3 times. Blend on highest speed about 1 or 2 minutes until mixture liquefies. Strain through a fine strainer, pressing everything through with a spoon leaving just a few tablespoons of fiber and rough bits.
Cover and refrigerate until ice cold, 1 or 2 hours.
Ladle some gazpacho verde into chilled bowls. Scoop 1/4 cup burrata onto the soup. Drizzle with a few drops of olive oil.
