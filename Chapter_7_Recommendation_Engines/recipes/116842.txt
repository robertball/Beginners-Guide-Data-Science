Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, softened
2/3 cup sugar
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
14 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup baking cocoa
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup strong brewed coffee, room temperature
3 tablespoons 1% buttermilk
1 cup prepared chocolate frosting
3/4 teaspoon instant coffee granules
1 teaspoon hot water

Directions:
In a small mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Beat in egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, baking powder and cinnamon; add to creamed mixture alternately with coffee and buttermilk.
Coat muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray or use paper liners; fill half full with batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
Place the frosting in a bowl. Dissolve coffee granules in hot water; stir into frosting until smooth. Frost cupcakes.
