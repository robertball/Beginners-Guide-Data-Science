Description: 
High in nutrients and antioxidants, my family has been known to eat this side dish as a main course in itself! It makes a great barbeque dish and crowd pleaser, and nobody will ever know it is healthier than a lot of salads out there. Add shredded cheese cheddar or parmesan for an extra kick.
