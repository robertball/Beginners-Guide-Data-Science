Bake Chicken for 25-30 minutes. Cool and shred chicken.
Heat 1/4 cup of oil to medium high on the stove.  Flash fry corn tortillas for 3-5 seconds. Place on plate. Blot grease.
Use a 9x18 baking pan. Spray with cooking spray. Spoon some chili on the bottom of the pan. Divide chicken into 12 piles.
Take one tortilla, add chicken, cheese, onion, and a T. of chili. Roll up seam side down in pan. Cover with about a cup or two of chili-enough to cover enchiladas. Add  cheddar cheese.
Bake at 350ยบ for 20-25 minutes until cheese is melted.
After baking, Plate enchiladas. Pour more green chili over enchiladas.
For Pork Green Chili-Peel roasted chilies, remove seeds, and dice. Or use canned chiles.
Dice pork in small pieces. Add flour to a paper bag. Dredge pork in flour. Heat oil on medium high for 2 minutes. Fry pork in oil until brown. Stir.
Add 32 oz. of chicken stock. Bring to a boil,  turn down to medium. Boil for 15-20 minutes.
Meanwhile blend tomatoes in a blender.
Then, add the rest of the chicken stock (32 oz.) Add chili and blended tomatoes

If chili needs to be thicker- blend 2 T. corn starch and 1/4 cup of cold water
Bring chili to a boil, add corn starch and whisk with a whisk.
Turn down heat and let thicken for a few minutes.
NOTE: Chili is always better the next day-I like the make this chili the night before so the flavors blend together and the chili thickens.
