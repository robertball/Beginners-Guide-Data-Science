Ingredients:
1 cup chopped onion
4 teaspoons vegetable oil
3 cups biscuit/baking mix
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
6 teaspoons dried parsley flakes, divided
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
In a skillet, saute onion in oil until tender. Place biscuit mix in a bowl. Combine eggs and milk; stir into biscuit mix just until combined. Stir in the onion, 1 cup of cheese and 4 teaspoons of parsley. Spread the batter into two greased 8-in. round baking pans. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and parsley. Drizzle with butter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted and top of bread is lightly browned.

Description: 
Biscuit mix is the handy base for this tender quick bread that never fails to disappear in a snap! The savory bread goes well with any meat or soup, but it's fine alone, too. Cheddar cheese and parsley give the wedges pretty color.
