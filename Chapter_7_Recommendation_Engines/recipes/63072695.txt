Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds flank steak
German stone ground mustard, to taste
Horseradish, to taste
6 large mushrooms, chopped
2 large onions, sliced
2 kosher dill pickles, chopped
2 tablespoons butter
2 1/2 cups water
1 cube beef bouillon

Directions:
Cut the flank steak into thin filets; about 1/4 inch thick and 3 inches wide.
Generously spread one side of each filet with mustard and horseradish to taste.
Place mushrooms, onions and pickles on each filet and form into a roll. Use string or toothpicks to hold the roll together.
Heat a skillet over medium heat and melt butter. Place the rolls in the butter and saute until browned.
Pour in 2 1/2 cups of water and add the bouillon cube; stirring to dissolve the bouillon cube.
Simmer the rolls for about an hour.
