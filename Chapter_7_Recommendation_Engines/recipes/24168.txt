Description: 
This hearty, flavorful wiener sauce is like the kind you'll find in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. It may be frozen until ready for use. Use premium grilled wieners cooked in butter, steamed hot dog buns and the fancy mustard of your choice. Spread with mustard, the sauce, chopped onions and celery salt... in that order.  If you have a delicate digestive system, use with caution.
