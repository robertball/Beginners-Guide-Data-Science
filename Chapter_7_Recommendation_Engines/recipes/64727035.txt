Ingredients:
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)
2 cups heavy cream
2 cups + 1/4 cup water
No-calorie sweetener (such as liquid Splenda)

Directions:
Place cocoa powder and cinnamon (if using) in medium size pot.
Add 1/4 cup hot water and stir with whisk over medium heat until fully combined.  Bring to boil and cook an additional two minutes, stirring continuously.
Add two cups heavy cream and stir to combine.
Add two cups water and stir to combine.
Continue cooking and stirring over medium heat but don't boil!
Optional - remove pot from heat and with hand mixer, beat the mixture in the pot (try doing it in the sink to minimize any mess).  This helps combine and thicken the ingredients just a bit to give a nice froth.
Pour into cup or mug and enjoy!
