Ingredients:
1 pound beef rib eye steak
2 large cucumbers - peeled, halved lengthwise and sliced
2 red onions, halved and thinly sliced
15 Thai chiles, sliced into thin rings
3 limes, juiced
1 pinch white sugar
1 cup fish sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to broiler setting. Broil rib eye to desired doneness. When cool enough to handle, slice into 1/4 inch by 1 inch strips.
In a large bowl, combine the steak, cucumbers, onions, chiles, lime juice, sugar, and fish sauce. Stir gently for 5 minutes, or until flavors are well blended.

Unique taste of Thai.  Blend of flavors is truly unbelievable.  You must try for yourself.  WOW!  We suggest serving over white rice.  Any other way would not be Bob's way.
