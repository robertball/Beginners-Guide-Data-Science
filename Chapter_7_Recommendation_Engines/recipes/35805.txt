Ingredients:
4 (10 ounce) 1 1/2 inch thick rib-eye steaks
1 cup single malt Scotch whiskey

Directions:
Place steaks in a nonmetallic dish, and pour the whiskey over the meat; turn to coat.  Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours.
Preheat grill for high heat.
Brush grate with oil, and arrange steaks over hot grate.  Cook for 6 to 10 minutes. Turn, and cook until done to your liking, another 6 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
Succulent, moist, and depending on the whisky you use, smoky, peaty, or grainy.  The whisky adds a certain depth to the meat, even if you don't like whisky (and I don't!!!).  Try this recipe; you can't taste the alcohol, just the smoky character of the whisky. Serve with game chips or tatties-an-neeps.
