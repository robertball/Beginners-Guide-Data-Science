Description: 
Even my picky husband gobbled this up and went for more! It would be delicious with some hotter peppers diced and added to the chicken, but my kids have pretty tender taste buds so I use the mild chiles. If you can't get the Mexican style cooked shredded chicken at your grocery, just add a little cumin, garlic, salt and pepper to regular chicken.Modified from: Easy Chicken Enchiladas
