Description: 
MAKING these cookies, I feel I'm keeping my mother's Christmas spirit alive. They were her special treat each year at holiday time.    These cookies are great for keeping children busy - they can cut up the gumdrops and eat all the black ones (they turn the dough gray). -Letah Chilston, Riverton, Wyoming
