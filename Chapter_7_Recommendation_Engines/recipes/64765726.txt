Ingredients:
15 oz can diced tomatoes
1/2 tsp basil
1/2 tsp oregano
1 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 tbsp red cooking wine (optional)

Directions:
If you like chunky sauce, put the diced tomatoes in a saucepan. If you like a smoother sauce, run it through a blender before putting it into the pan.
Add all the seasonings and red wine (optional). Let simmer until heated through.
Add Italian sausage for a meaty meal, or use as is over pasta on its own. Delish!
