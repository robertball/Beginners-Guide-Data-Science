Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
2 cups diced rhubarb
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
6 plain rolls or buns
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart casserole dish.
Stir together 1 cup of sugar, rhubarb, and cinnamon in a saucepan over medium-low heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook the rhubarb, stirring frequently, until it breaks apart, about 10 minutes. Pour the rhubarb mixture into the prepared casserole dish.
Cut the rolls up into cubes and spread over the rhubarb. Sprinkle 1/2 cup sugar over the bread cubes; pour melted butter over the sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until the bread is lightly golden brown and the rhubarb is bubbling, about 35 minutes.
