Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
6 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened, divided
1 garlic clove, minced
3/4 teaspoon dried dill weed, divided
8 (1/2-inch-thick) slices French bread
4 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
2 teaspoons lemon juice
4 lettuce leaves
8 slices tomato

Directions:
Pound chicken to flatten evenly; set aside. In a skillet, melt 3 tablespoons of butter; add garlic and 1/2 teaspoon dill. Add chicken; cook until juices run clear. Remove and keep warm. Spread both sides of bread with remaining butter. In a skillet or griddle, grill bread on both sides until golden brown. In a small bowl, combine cream cheese, lemon juice and remaining dill; spread on one side of grilled bread. Place lettuce, chicken and tomato on four slices of bread; top with remaining bread.
