Ingredients:
2 kiwifruits
2 tbsp marshmallow fluff
sliced almonds

Directions:
Slice kiwifruits in half lengthwise, and cut the ends off.
Use a knife or a spoon to remove the skin from the kiwifruits.
Cut each half into slices approximately 1/8" thick.
Spoon a small amount of marshmallow fluff onto half of the kiwi slices, and cover it with a second slice.
Stand the kiwi and fluff "sandwiches " on a plate with the rounded sides up, and place the plate into the freezer for several minutes.
Remove the plate from the freezer, and stick the sliced almonds into the fluff so that they stick up like little stegosaurus spikes.
Serve immediately.
