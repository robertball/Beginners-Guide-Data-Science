Ingredients:
1 egg, beaten
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed, well drained
1 cup ATHENOS Traditional Crumbled Feta Cheese
1 (8 ounce) tub PHILADELPHIA Garden Vegetable 1/3 Less Fat than Cream Cheese
4 green onions, finely chopped
15 sheets frozen phyllo dough (14x9), thawed
1/3 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Mix first 5 ingredients until well blended. Brush 1 phyllo sheet lightly with butter; top with 2 more phyllo sheets, lightly brushing each layer with some of the remaining butter. Place remaining phyllo between sheets of plastic wrap; set aside.
Spread 1/5 of the spinach mixture along one short side of phyllo stack. Fold in long sides of phyllo; roll up from one short side to make log. Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets and spinach mixture. Brush with remaining butter. Make small cuts in tops of logs at 1-inch intervals. Place in large freezer-weight resealable plastic bags or wrap tightly in plastic wrap.
Freeze up to 3 months. When ready to bake, remove desired number of logs from freezer. Refrigerate, tightly wrapped, several hours or overnight until thawed. Unwrap, then place on baking sheet. Bake in 375 degrees F oven for 25 min. or until golden brown. Cool 5 min. Transfer to cutting board. Use serrated knife to cut each log into 6 slices.
