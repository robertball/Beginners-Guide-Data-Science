Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
2/3 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs, beaten
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup finely grated carrot
1 cup crushed pineapple, drained
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3 cups confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Stir white sugar, vegetable oil, and eggs together in a large mixing bowl until thoroughly combined.
Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl.
Stir flour mixture into liquid ingredients until thoroughly moistened. Mix in carrot, pineapple, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.
Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them to the top.
Bake cupcakes in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Set aside to cool completely.
Cream butter with cream cheese with an electric hand mixer in a bowl until smooth.
Beat in confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract, and milk to make a spreadable frosting; frost the cooled cupcakes.

Description: 
These moist and delicious cupcakes are so good that I served them at my wedding reception instead of a traditional wedding cake. They are a hit every time, especially with cream cheese frosting! I have my mom to thank for this awesome recipe.
