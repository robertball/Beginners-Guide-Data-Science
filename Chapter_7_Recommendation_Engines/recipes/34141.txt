Ingredients:
4  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon lemon pepper
1 cup dry vermouth
3 tablespoons olive oil
Â½ cup chopped fresh tarragon
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Generously sprinkle the chicken breast halves with lemon pepper. Place chicken, vermouth, 3 tablespoons olive oil, and tarragon into a large resealable plastic bag. Place in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 6 hours, or overnight.
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chicken breasts on both sides in the hot oil. Pour 1/2 cup of the marinade into the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink.
