Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
2 sticks butter
1 cup porter beer
1 cup raisins
1 cup sultanas (golden raisins)
1/2 cup dried cherries
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons mixed spice
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3 eggs, beaten
1 orange, zested

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).
Combine brown sugar, butter, and stout beer in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir until butter is melted and brown sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Add raisins, sultanas, and cherries. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes.
Sift flour, mixed spice, and baking soda together in a large bowl. Stir in stout-fruit mixture. Add beaten eggs gradually, stirring until incorporated. Fold in orange zest. Spoon batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 1/2 hours. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.
