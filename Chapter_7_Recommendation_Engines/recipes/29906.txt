Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups crushed graham crackers
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (29 ounce) can sweet potatoes, drained and mashed
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup light cream
2 eggs, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons vanilla
1 (10.5 ounce) package miniature marshmallows

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch springform pan.
In a medium bowl, mix graham crackers, cinnamon, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and butter. Press mixture into the prepared springform pan to form a crust. Bake 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned.
In a large bowl, blend cream cheese, sweet potatoes, 1/4 cup brown sugar, light cream, eggs, and vanilla. Pour into the baked crust.
Bake pie 1 hour in the preheated oven, placing marshmallows on top to melt during the last 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is different from your normal sweet potato pies, especially the crust and the cream cheese. My grandmother used to make it, then my mother and her sisters made it for many years. Now that I've moved away from New York and are no longer with them, I make it for my girlfriend's family. Eat it with Thanksgiving dinner, just like we did! Enjoy!
