1-1/2 pounds boneless beef chuck roast, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 medium onion, chopped
1 stalk of celery, chopped
1 tablespoon canola oil
3 garlic cloves, minced
3/4 cup red wine
3 cups beef broth
1 can (14-1/2 ounces) stewed tomatoes, cut up
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme
3 large potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes

Preheat oven to 350
In a large resealable bag, combine 4 tbsp flour, salt if desired, and 1/4 tsp pepper. Add beef, a few pieces at a time, and shake to coat.
In a dutch oven over medium-high heat, brown beef in oil in batches. Remove and set aside. Add onion and celery to the pan and cook until tender. Add garlic; cook 1 min longer. Deglaze the pan with red wine. Stir in remaining flour and pepper until blended. Gradually stir in broth. Add the beef, tomatoes and thyme. Cover and bake at 350 for 1-1/4 hours.
