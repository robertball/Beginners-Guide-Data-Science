Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg

3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
2 eggs
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix flour, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves in small bowl.
In large mixing bowl combine sugar, butter, and extracts until creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Slowly add flour mix, beating dough between additions. Fold in chocolate chips. Drop dough by tablespoonful onto an ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake 9 to 11 minutes, or until cookies are just brown. After cooling cookies on the tray for 2 minutes, remove to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
My friends love it when I bring these to parties. The spice makes them tastier and a bit more interesting than your average chocolate chip cookie.
