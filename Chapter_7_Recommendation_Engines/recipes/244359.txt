Ingredients:
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 small onion, chopped
3/4 cup red bell pepper, chopped
6 fresh chives, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
3 fresh sage leaves, chopped
2 teaspoons thinly sliced fresh ginger
1 small hot chile pepper (optional)
1 (14 ounce) package firm tofu, drained and cut into 3/4-inch cubes
salt to taste
2 tablespoons vegetarian Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon lime juice
6 cups water
3 cubes vegetable bouillon
1 small green papaya, peeled and cut into chunks
1 bunch fresh spinach, trimmed
1 tablespoon fried onions, or to taste

Directions:
Heat coconut oil in a stockpot over medium heat; add onion, red bell pepper, chives, garlic, rosemary, sage, ginger, and chile pepper. Cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tofu to onion mixture; cook, stirring every 2 minutes, until tofu is golden brown, about 6 minutes. Season with salt.
Mix Worcestershire sauce and lime juice into tofu mixture. Stir water and bouillon together in a bowl until dissolved; pour over tofu mixture. Bring liquid to a simmer, add papaya, loosely cover stockpot, and simmer until papaya is tender yet firm to the bite, about 20 minutes.
Remove stockpot from heat, stir on spinach, cover, and allow to sit until spinach is wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle soup into serving bowls and top with fried onions.

Description: 
Tinola, a Philippine papaya soup, inspired me to create this. The few recipes I found didn't have great reviews, so I revised one to make it vegetarian and to use some of my herbs and vegetables in my garden.
