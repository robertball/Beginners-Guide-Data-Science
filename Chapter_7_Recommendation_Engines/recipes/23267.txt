Ingredients:
1 cup LAND O LAKESÂ® Butter, softened*
3/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup real semisweet chocolate chips
2 teaspoons shortening

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees F.  Combine butter, sugar and almond extract in large  bowl.  Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until creamy.  Reduce speed to low; add all remaining cookie ingredients.  Beat until well mixed.
Shape rounded teaspoonfuls of dough into 1-inch balls.  Place 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.  Flatten balls to 1/4 inch thick with bottom of buttered glass dipped in sugar. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until edges are lightly browned.  Cool completely.
Melt chocolate chips and shortening in 1-quart saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally, until smooth (2 to 4 minutes).  Drizzle or pipe top of cooled cookies making tree design, if desired.
