Ingredients:
1 acorn squash, halved and seeded
salt and pepper to taste
4 tablespoons butter, divided
4 tablespoons brown sugar

Directions:
In a microwave safe casserole dish pour enough water to reach 1 1/2 inches in depth.  Place the squash halves cut side down in the water, and pierce the skin with a fork a few times.  Microwave on high for 15 to 20 minutes.  Drain.
Sprinkle each half with salt and pepper to taste.  Place 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons brown sugar in each half.
Broil 5 minutes, or until butter is melted.  Mix the melted butter and sugar into the flesh, and serve.
