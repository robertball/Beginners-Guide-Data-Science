Ingredients:
1/2 lb. ground spicy italian sausage
1/2 lb. ground mild italian sausage
1/2 large green pepper, diced
6 oz can tomato paste
1 refridgerated pizza dough, such as Pillsbury
non-stick cooking spray
1/2 cup green olives, rough chopped
2 cups shredded italian blend cheese
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
oregano

Directions:
Place sausage and green pepper in large saute pan and cook on medium high heat until browned.  Turn the heat to low and add the tomato paste, stiring until fully incorporated.  Continue to cook mixture over low heat for 5 more minutes.  The mixture will be dry and sticky.  Remove pan from heat and allow mixture to cool.
While the sausage mixture cools, line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and spray with Pam.  Unroll the pizza dough and spread evenly to fit pan.  Top the pizza dough edge to edge evenly with cooled sausage mixture.  Top sausage with cheese and olives.
Carefully roll the dough to form a loaf, and place seam side down.  Combine the egg and water with a fork, and brush the loaf with eggwash. Sprinkle oregano on top.  Bake at 350* for 50-60 minutes until golden brown.
