Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) beef flank steak
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
HORSERADISH SAUCE:
1/4 cup fat-free mayonnaise
1/4 cup reduced-fat sour cream
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 green onions, finely chopped
2 teaspoons prepared horseradish

Directions:
Using a sharp knife, score the surface of the steak with shallow diagonal cuts at 1-in. intervals, making diamond shapes. Repeat on other side. In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the next five ingredients. Add steak. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl; cover and refrigerate.
Drain and discard marinade. Grill steak, covered, over medium-hot heat for 7-9 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well done, 170 degrees F). Thinly slice steak across the grain; serve with sauce.
