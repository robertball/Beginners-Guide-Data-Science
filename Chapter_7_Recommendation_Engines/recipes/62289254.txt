Ingredients:
1 c chickpea (garbanzo bean) flour
1 tbsp sweetener (I use 4 g stevia)

1/4 c egg white
1 c nonfat milk
2 tbsp cooking oil
1 tbsp cinnamon

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix dry ingredients together.  In a separate bowl, whisk milk, egg white, and applesauce.  Add wet to dry all at once, whisking only until ingredients are combined.  Pour 1/2 cup portions into a hot griddle or pan, flipping cakes when holes form on cakes.
