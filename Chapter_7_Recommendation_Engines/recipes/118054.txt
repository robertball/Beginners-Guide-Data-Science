Ingredients:
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 cup reduced sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 pound turkey breast tenderloin, cubed
4 teaspoons canola oil, divided
1 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup shredded carrot
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup sliced green onion
1 garlic clove, minced
1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained
1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the first seven ingredients until smooth; set aside. In a nonstick skillet, stir-fry turkey in 2 teaspoons hot oil until no longer pink. Remove and keep warm. In the same skillet, stir-fry the celery, carrot, onion, mushrooms, green onions and garlic in remaining oil until crisp-tender, about 5-6 minutes. Add water chestnuts and turkey; heat through. Stir broth mixture and add to the pan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Sprinkle with almonds. Serve over hot cooked rice if desired.
