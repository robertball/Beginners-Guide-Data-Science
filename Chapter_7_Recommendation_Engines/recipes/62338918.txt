Ingredients:
2 squares unsweetened chocolate
2 squares semi-sweet chocolate
2/3 cup butter, softened
1/3 cup peanut butter
2 cups brown sugar
4 eggs
2 tsp vanilla
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups peanut butter chips
8 regular sized Reese's peanut butter cups

Directions:
Melt the chocolate in the microwave; set aside to cool.
Combine the butter, peanut butter and brown sugar (with an electric mixer). Add eggs, vanilla; beat. Mix in chocolate, then flour, then peanut butter chips (with a wooden spoon).
Line a 13x9 pan with foil (leaving 'handles' on the ends to remove it later) and grease it generously with butter or cooking spray. Pour the prepared batter into the pan.
Cut the peanut butter cups into bite-sized pieces (cutting in half, then cutting each half in thirds works well). Top the brownie batter with the peanut butter cup pieces as evenly as possible, pressing them into the batter lightly.
Bake 30 minutes at 325F. Cool at room temperature until cool enough to put the pan in the refrigerator. Chill at least 2 hours, then remove the brownies (by the foil 'handles' from the pan and cut into squares.

Description: 
A yummy treat for the lovers of chocolate + peanut butter. It seems like a ton of peanut butter products goes into these brownies, but it ends up very balanced and not overpowering in the end. Adapted from www.recipegirl.com
