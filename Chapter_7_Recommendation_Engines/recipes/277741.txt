Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
2 medium onions, chopped
1 medium green bell pepper, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound dry black-eyed peas - sorted, rinsed, and drained
8 cups water, or more as needed
2 (15 ounce) cans no-salt-added diced tomatoes
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained
2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning
1 1/2 cups long-grain brown rice
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in the pot. Cook and stir onions and bell pepper until onions are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and saute until tender, about 1 minute. Turn off Saute function.
Stir in black-eyed peas and pour in water. Close and lock the lid. Select Beans/Lentils function; set timer for 30 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes.
Add diced tomatoes, green chiles, and Cajun seasoning. Stir in rice and more water if needed. Select Rice/Risotto function and adjust time for Brown Rice. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Stir well. Select Slow Cook function; set timer for 4 hours. Cover with a regular pot lid and let simmer.
