Ingredients:
5 strips bacon, or more to taste
1 (46 fluid ounce) bottle tomato-vegetable juice cocktail (such as V8速)
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
3 tablespoons lime juice
3 tablespoons prepared horseradish

1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 (750 milliliter) bottle vodka

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Cut into small pieces.
Pour 1/2 of the tomato-vegetable juice into a large pitcher. Add cooked bacon, Worcestershire sauce, lime juice, horseradish, pickle juice, green olive juice, hot sauce, celery salt, and cayenne pepper. Stir vigorously. Add remaining tomato-vegetable juice and stir again. Add vodka and stout beer; stir. Pour into ice-filled glasses.
