Ingredients:
1-16 ounce bag frozen, cut collards
1/2 yellow onion, diced
1 apple, cored, diced large
1 cup vegetable broth
2-3 dashes liquid smoke
2 tablespoons red cooking wine
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
In a Dutch oven, saute the onion, collards, and apple in broth, uncovered, until the collards start to defrost a bit. Add the remaining ingredients and cover. Cook, over medium to medium-low heat, stirring now and then, until all is tender, about 1/2 an hour or so.
Note: If you use fresh collards, you'll need to cook for about an hour.
