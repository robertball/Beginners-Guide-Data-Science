Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups self-rising flour
1 cup half-and-half
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon Sriracha hot sauce, or more to taste
1 tablespoon melted butter, or to taste (optional)
salt to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Stir flour, half-and-half, vegetable oil, and Sriracha sauce together in a bowl to form a lumpy dough. Roll dough into 2-inch balls and place on a baking sheet.
Bake biscuits in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Brush melted butter and sprinkle salt on top of each biscuit.

Description: 
I bought self-rising flour by accident, so I decided to make the best of the situation. I could make regular biscuits, but regular biscuits are boring. What could make biscuits more interesting? The answer was in the side door of my refrigerator: Sriracha!
