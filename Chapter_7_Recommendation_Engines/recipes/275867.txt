Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package corkscrew-shaped pasta (fusilli)
3/4 cup chopped fresh basil
3/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/3 cup pine nuts
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 clove garlic, diced
1/2 cup finely diced red onion
1/2 cup finely diced radicchio
1 tablespoon mayonnaise, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Combine basil, Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, oil, and garlic in a food processor; blend to make pesto.
Toss pasta with pesto and mix in red onion, radicchio, and mayonnaise. Season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.
