Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups shredded jack cheese
1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
3 ounces of cream cheese softened (I know that this is not authentic but it made them really creamy and good)
1 19 ounce can of red enchilada sauce
2 cups of cooked ground beef
8 to 1o flour tortillas

Directions:
Combine 1 cup of jack cheese, 1 cup of cheddar cheese, cream cheese, 3/4 cup (or so) of enchilada sauce, and beef. Mix until well combined. Pour about 1/4 cup of enchilada sauce into a 9Ã—13 pan and spread it around. Than place about 1/4 cup of filling into each tortilla shell ( I just guessed on the amount here, it may have been 1/3 cup). Roll up and place in pan. Pour remaining sauce on top and sprinkle with the rest of the cheese. Bake at 350 for 25 minutes or until heated through.
