Title:
Spiced Butternut Squash on a Stick Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1/2 tsp. ground cumin
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/4 tsp. salt
1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper
4 cups 1-inch butternut squash cubes (about 20 oz. or half a large squash)
1 large onion
2 1/2 cups firm cherry tomatoes (about a 1-pint container's worth or 25 tomatoes)

Directions:
If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for about 20 minutes to prevent burning. (You'll need 10 skewers.)
Combine seasonings in a small bowl or sealable bag and mix well. Set aside.
Place squash in a large microwave-safe bowl with 2 tbsp. water. Cover and microwave for 1 1/2 minutes, or until squash is slightly tender. Once cool enough to handle, uncover, drain any excess water, and set aside.
Cut onion into pieces roughly the size of the squash cubes. Evenly distribute veggies among the 10 skewers in this order: squash, onion, squash, tomato. (Don't worry if it isn't perfect!)
Lightly spray the loaded skewers with nonstick spray, and evenly sprinkle with half of the seasonings. Flip skewers and repeat on other side.
Bring a grill (or grill pan) sprayed with nonstick spray to medium heat. Add skewers, cover, and cook until squash is tender and veggies are slightly blackened, 8 - 10 minutes per side. If using a grill pan, work in batches, removing pan from heat between batches to re-spray. (And don't worry if the lid used for covering isn't a perfect fit!) Serve and enjoy!

Original recipe from hungry-girl.com; Sure, butternut is a winter squash, but that doesn't mean you can't slap it on the grill when it's warm out... True dat!
