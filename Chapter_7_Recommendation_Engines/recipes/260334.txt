Ingredients:
2 1/3 cups water
1 1/3 cups quinoa
6 ounces vegan sour cream (such as TofuttiÂ®)
1/4 cup curry powder
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
2 teaspoons finely grated peeled fresh ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (1 pound) firm-ripe mango, cut into 1/2-inch chunks
1 cup salted roasted peanuts, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
2/3 cup chopped fresh mint
1 jalapeno chile, seeded and minced

Directions:
Combine water and quinoa in a saucepan over high heat. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Cook until water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Whisk sour cream, curry powder, lime juice, ginger, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Add oil; whisk thoroughly. Toss with the quinoa, mango, peanuts, red bell pepper, mint, and jalapeno.

Description: 
The original recipe was a non-vegan version I found at another food website. I've made some major overhauls to the original recipe, I feel that I can call it my own. I took the dish to a recent vegan potluck dinner and it was a huge hit!  Lots of flavor. Serve warm or at room temperature.
