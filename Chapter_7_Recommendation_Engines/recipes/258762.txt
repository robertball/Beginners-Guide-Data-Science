Directions:
Crush garlic using a mortar and pestle. Add pine nuts; crush with the garlic. Add basil leaves gradually, making circular movements with the pestle, until a smooth paste forms.

Description: 
An authentic Genoese pesto. It's straight from Italy and you won't find a better recipe! This calls for a spoonful of pecorino cheese, but you could also use all Parmesan in a pinch. To store in fridge for up to 1 month: place pesto in a jar, cover with olive oil, and top with a lid.
