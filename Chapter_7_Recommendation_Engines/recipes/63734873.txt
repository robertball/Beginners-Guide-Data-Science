Ingredients:
Stuffed Eggplant
Silani - Light Ricotta Cheese, 1 small container
Kraft - 100% Parmesan Grated Cheese (Costco Canada), 12 Tbsp (6g)
Kirkland Signature - Marinara Sauce Canada, 1 container (3 2/5 cups ea.) ( any jar sauce )
-1/2 Spanish Onion, Sauteed
Vegetable - Green Bell Pepper (Raw), 1 Cup, chopped
Kirkland Signature - Extra Lean Ground Turkey, 1 container- 1 lb
- Eggplant, Whole, Raw, 3 whole eggplant
- Garlic Cloves, 3 cloves
- Roma Tomato, 3 medium

Directions:
Halve the eggplants and hollow them out leaving a bit to hold them up. A spoon works best for this. Chop of the eggplant and saute it. I used Pam but you could use olive oil. Add onions and peppers after about 10 min to the pan, saute again for 5 min then add the ground turkey and garlic. I also added basil, garlic powder, salt. As soon as the turkey is browned you can add the diced tomatoes, ricotta cheese and Parmesan cheese. Take your jar of sauce and put a bit on the eggplants then add the mixture in the pan. Top again with the rest of the sauce. Bake in 350 degree oven for 50 minutes. You can top with cheese however I wait until I am serving it.
