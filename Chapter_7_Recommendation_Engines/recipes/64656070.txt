Ingredients:
1/4 cup (60ml) warm water
3 Tsp. dry yeast
3 Tbsp. sugar
3/4 cup (170g) butter, melted and cooled
1/2 cup (120ml) warm eggnog/eierlikör
1 Tsp. salt
3 eggs
about 4 cups (520g) all-purpose flour
For the filling:
1/2 cup (100g) brown sugar
2 Tbsp. ground cinnamon
pinch of salt
seeds of 1 vanilla bean pod
1/3 cup (80g) butter, softened
For the frosting:
2 oz. (60g) cream cheese
1 cup (130g) confectioner’s sugar
1 Tsp. vanilla extract
1-2 Tbsp. milk

Directions:
1. Melt the butter and let cool down again. In a large bowl mix warm water, yeast and sugar until well combined – let sit there for about 5 minutes to get foamy. Add the warm (not hot) eggnog/eierlikör, melted butter, salt and eggs to the bowl and mix until well combined. Add the flour in small portions and knead until you get a nice smooth dough – use about 3 1/2 cups (450g) and add more if needed. Take out of the bowl and knead with your hands on a floured surface for 2 more minutes – the dough should be quite soft, but not sticky. Shape the dough into a ball and place in a large greased bowl. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise for about 1-2 hours in a warm place – the volume should almost double.
2. While the dough is rising, prepare the filling by mixing the brown sugar, cinnamon, salt and vanilla seeds. Warm the butter so it is very soft, but not melting. Line a loaf pan (mine was about 5x11inch/13x28cm) with baking parchment and set aside.
3. Once the dough has risen enough, punch it once or twice to get air out, then roll out on a floured surface to a rectangle of about 9×24 inches (23x60cm). Spread the soft butter on top of the dough (works best with your fingers) and sprinkle with the sugar-cinnamon mixture – the dough should be evenly covered. Press the mixture into the butter and roll up from the long side of the rectangle – roll up tight. Cut the roll into 1.2 inches (3cm) thick slices. Place the slices in the loaf pan – either side by side or mixed up – doesn’t matter. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge over night.
4. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Take the loaf pan out of the fridge and brush the dough with some melted butter and bake for 35-45 minutes or until lightly browned – do not overbake or it will be very dry. Take out of the oven and transfer to a wire rack.
5. In a small bowl mix the cream cheese, confectioner’s sugar and vanilla extract – add one (or more) tablespoon milk until you get the consistency you like. Drizzle on top of the still warm bread and serve.
