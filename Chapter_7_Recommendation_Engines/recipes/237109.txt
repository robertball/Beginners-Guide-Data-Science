Description: 
Spinach, crab, mushrooms, and lasagna are my hubby's favorite foods. Combine in the slow cooker and wow. I about shocked myself at how good this turned out! You can substitute real crab or shrimp for mock crab.  If you turn off the slow cooker and allow lasagna to cool after the 30 minutes after adding mozzarella cheese, it will stick together better!
