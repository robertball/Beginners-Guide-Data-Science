Ingredients:
1/3 cup olive oil or cooking oil
1/3 cup lemon juice
2 tablespoons snipped fresh basil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
8 ounces fresh green beans, trimmed
12 ounces baby carrots with tops, peeled and trimmed
2 medium red and/or yellow sweet peppers, cut into 1-inch pieces
8 ounces fresh mushrooms, stems removed
1 cup cherry tomatoes

Directions:
For vinaigrette, in a screw-top jar combine oil, lemon juice, basil, garlic, mustard, salt, and pepper. Cover and shake well. Set aside.
In a large saucepan cook green beans, covered, in a small amount of boiling water for 4 minutes. Add carrots and cook, covered, for 8 minutes more or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Drain and rinse with cold water. Combine beans, carrots, sweet peppers, mushrooms, and tomatoes in a bag set in a large bowl. Pour vinaigrette over vegetables.
Seal bag and refrigerate for 4 to 24 hours, turning bag occasionally. To serve, bring to room temperature. Drain vegetables; arrange on a platter.
