Ingredients:
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/3 ounce cream cheese
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup powdered sugar
pinch salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
extra sugar for dredging
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 cup flour
1 cup apple pie filling homemade or canned with apple cut into smallish pieces

Directions:
First cream softened butter and cream cheese with both sugars. Then add salt and vanilla.... then add flour 1/4 cup at a time untill combined but don't overmix.
Chill dough for two hours or overnight.
Heat oven to 350' Mix 1/4 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Roll out dough to 1/4 inch thick and dust each side of dough with the cinnamon and sugar mixture.... cut into squares about 2 inches around. Put a dollop of apple pie filling in the center of each square and fold over from point to point.... egg wash dotted in the middle will help to hold flaps.... make sure they are well sealed or they will pop open in the oven.... also.... make sure you don't over fill pockets "or blankets" as they will overflow and burn in oven. Place cookies on lightly greased cookie sheet or sheet lined with parchment paper. Cook for 10 minutes or untill light golden brown on edges and cooked looking on the bottom.  Remove to cool. Serve luekewarm or cooled.
