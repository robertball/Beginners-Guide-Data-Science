Ingredients:
2 cups crushed saltine crackers
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
Â½ cup margarine, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.
Mix cracker crumbs, seasoned salt, and garlic powder in a shallow bowl. Dip chicken breasts into melted margarine and press into cracker mixture until coated. Arrange chicken in prepared baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
