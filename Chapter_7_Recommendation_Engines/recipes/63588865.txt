Description: 
Not sure I would have ever considered using Johnsonville Italian Sausage as a replacement for Hamburger... but itâ€™s on my radar now!  Great flavor, Juicy and creative too. A sweet, tangy sauce gives these meatballs a wicked delicious taste that guarantees an empty dish at potlucks and several requests for the recipe.Modified from: Baked BBQ Meatballs
