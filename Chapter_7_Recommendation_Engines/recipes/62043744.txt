Ingredients:
5 pounds thawed chicken wings (not dinner wings but the seperated kind)
10 oz. Franks RedHot hot sauce
1 teaspoon tomato paste (TRUST ME!!)
...to tast... salt, pepper, garlic and herb seasoning, and cajun seasoning.

Directions:
Set oven temperature at 425 degrees Farenheit.
To prepare sauce, mix hot sauce, tomato paste and seasonings in medium bowl. Mix well. The sauce should have a little bit of TANG to it!
Lay chicken wings evenly in a large baking pan with sides. DO NOT USE A BAKING SHEET. Try not to overlap, but if you have to, thats fine. Pour hot sauce mixture evenly over wings. Sprinkle with a little more of the garlic and herb seasoning and cajun seasonings. DO NOT ADD TOO MUCH! Just a tad over all the wings. Put them in the oven for 1 hour. Every 15-20 minutes, turn the wings over and sprinkle more garlic and herb and cajun seasoning over them. After you have had them in the oven for 1 hour (flipping every 15-20 mins.), season them once more and broil them on hi for 5 minutes. Flip and repeat.
NOTE: You may not have to use all of the hot sauce. If you find you have too much, you may set some aside to garnish.
