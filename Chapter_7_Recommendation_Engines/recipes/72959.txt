Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup milk
6 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 egg yolk
1 egg white
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Preheat your waffle iron.
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, cornstarch, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Combine the milk, buttermilk and oil in a measuring cup. Whisk in the egg yolk with a fork, and set aside. In a small bowl, beat egg white with an electric mixer until almost soft peaks. Gradually sprinkle in the sugar, while continuing to whip until thick and glossy. Stir in vanilla.
Pour the milk mixture into the dry ingredients, and whisk just until blended. Fold in the egg white using a spatula.
Pour batter onto the hot waffle iron in the recommended amount for your iron. My waffle iron takes a generous 1/2 cup. Close the iron, and cook until golden brown. A good indication that it is getting close is that the steam will stop coming out of the iron. Keep finished waffles in the warm oven directly on the rack. Do not stack, or they will become soggy.
