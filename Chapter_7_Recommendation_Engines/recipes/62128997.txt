Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup molasses
1 1/2 cups sour milk
2 1/2 tbsp oil (I use coconut oil, but anything will do)
1 1/2 cups flour
1 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
2 1/2 cups bran
1/2 cup fruits of your choice (raisins, dates, nuts, blueberries, cranberries, raspberries, etc)

Directions:
Beat eggs, add sugar, molasses, sour milk and oil.  Add flour, sprinkle salt and baking soda over top (so it isn't in a big clump in one place); Add bran and mix with a fork only enough to moisten all the flour.  Just before you are finished mixing, add your fruit.
Fill greased muffin tins and bake in a hot oven (400f) for approximately 25 minutes.  Check at 20 to make sure they do not over cook.  Remove when an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
Note:  This recipe will make 18 regular size muffins in a regular size tin OR 12 large muffins in a regular size tin if filled to the top OR 24 mini muffins filled to the very top.

Description: 
This recipe is dated June, 1950 on the recipe card my grandmother gave to me. These are the real bran muffins that you would expect to get when you think of bran.  Not a lot of white sugar or fat.  Quick, easy, and you can alter quite easily with different fruits and nuts.  Freezes for about 1 week - if they make it to the freezer.  Anything longer gives them a freezer taste.  If adding fresh fruit, stick it in the freezer for a few minutes so it doesn't mush down during the mixing process.
