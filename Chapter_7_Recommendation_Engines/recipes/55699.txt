Ingredients:
1 pound fresh poblano (often labeled pasilla) chilies, rinsed
1 1/2 pounds fat-trimmed beef skirt steak
2 onions, peeled and chopped
2 teaspoons minced or pressed garlic
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 cups fat-skimmed beef broth
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 (10 ounce) package frozen corn kernels
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 1/4 cups yellow cornmeal
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions (including tops)
1 large egg
1 1/4 cups low-fat (1%) buttermilk

Directions:
Place chilies in a 10- by 15-inch pan. Broil 4 to 6 inches from heat, turning as needed, until blackened on all sides, about 15 minutes. When cool enough to handle, in about 10 minutes, pull off and discard chili peels, stems, seeds, and veins. Cut chilies into 1/2-inch pieces.
Meanwhile, rinse meat and pat dry. Cut into 1/2- by 1-inch pieces.
In a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, stir meat, onions, garlic, tomato paste, and 1/2 cup broth until liquid evaporates and meat and onions are browned, about 25 minutes. Add chilies, remaining broth, 2 cups water, and oregano. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer until meat is very tender when pierced, about 1 hour. Stir in corn.
In a bowl, blend cornstarch and 1/2 cup water until smooth. Add to pan and stir over high heat until mixture boils. Pour stew into a 3-quart casserole (about 9 by 13 in.).
In a bowl, combine cornmeal, flour, baking powder, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and green onions. In another bowl, beat egg to blend; mix in buttermilk. Add egg mixture to cornmeal mixture and stir just until evenly moistened. Drop by 1/4-cup portions evenly over stew.
Bake in a 400 degree oven until dumplings are firm and lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
Spoon portions into bowls; add salt to taste.
