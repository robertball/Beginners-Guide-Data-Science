Ingredients:
1 whole round or cube steak tenderized & cut into serving size pieces
1 cup flour
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 15oz cans whole stewed tomatoes
3 beef boullion cubes
1 8oz can tomato sauce
1 cup water
1/2 a large onion, chopped in 1/2" wide wedges
1/2 cup diced celery leaves OR
1/8 tsp celery seed
Salt & Pepper

Directions:
In a large skillet begin heating the oil on medium to medium high heat.  Meanwhile in a gallon size ziploc or equivalent mix in the flour and several shakes of salt & pepper.  Lightly salt & pepper each piece of meat and one at a time shake around in bag of flour to coat.
Make sure oil is hot and start browning both sides of the meat.  You want the pieces slightly darker than golden brown.  Turn down the heat a bit if oil gets too hot.
Remove the meat for a moment and drain the excess oil from the pan, keeping the charred bits in the bottom for flavor.  Add the meat back to the pan and put everything else in over it.  When adding stewed tomatoes crush them and pour in juice too.  Add the boullion cubes, tomato sauce, water, onions, celery leaves or seed and bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes.
Taste for salt, pepper, and beef flavor at this point and add more boullion or salt if you like.  Continue simmering covered for another hour.
Serve with mashed potatoes, the juices makes the perfect "gravy"!
