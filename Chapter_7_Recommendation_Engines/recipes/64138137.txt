Ingredients:
1 large roast
2 cups baby carrots, whole
1 white or yellow onion, chopped
8 celery ribs, chopped
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1/2 tbsp chili powder
1/2 tbsp cayenne pepper
1/2 tbsp paprika
1 tsp garlic powder
water

Directions:
First, prep your slow cooker. Clean and dry and ready to go.
Next step is to chop your vegetables. Chop onion and celery and divide them, half in the slow cooker and half in a large bowl. Also divide the carrots between the slow cooker and the bowl.
Pour the chicken broth into the slow cooker over the veggies.
Mix all the spices together in a bowl. Make sure they are mixed thoroughly.
Put the roast on a flat surface (cutting board or large plate) and pour half of the spice mixture onto it. Rub into meat with your fingers. Flip the roast over and repeat on the other side.
Place meat over the top of the veggies in the slow cooker, then top with the rest of the veggies.
Fill slow cooker with enough water to barely cover contents.
Cook with crock pot set to low heat until meat is cooked through and very tender (6-8 hours, normally, depending on the size of the roast and your slow cooker)
