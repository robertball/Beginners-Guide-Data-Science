Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 heads cauliflower, stemmed and chopped
1/4 cup Greek yogurt
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth, or as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 pounds ground turkey
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 (1.25 ounce) packages beefy onion soup mix
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup water, or as needed
2 (8 ounce) bags frozen corn
1 cup shredded fat-free Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup french-fried onions, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add cauliflower and saute, stirring often to prevent it from getting too brown, until soft enough to mash with a fork, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl, add Greek yogurt, and mash with a fork. Pour in chicken broth a little at a time, continuing to mash until fluffy and smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
Cook ground turkey and garlic in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir in soup mix and flour until combined, then slowly add water and stir until creamy but not runny. Simmer until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.
Spread turkey mixture in the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Layer with frozen corn, cauliflower mixture, and Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Sprinkle with french-fried onions and bake until browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove from the oven and allow to sit for a few minutes before serving.

Description: 
Old fashioned, stick to your ribs comfort food decadence minus the guilt. The star here is the cauliflower mashed potatoes that will have your family amazed at their authentic taste. It's a versatile dish that I've made with frozen and/or fresh cauliflower and subsidized with a potato or two. The key here is just to not boil the cauliflower.
