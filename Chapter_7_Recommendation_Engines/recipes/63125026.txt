Ingredients:
1/4 canola oil
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 shallots, finely chopped
dried whole or crushed red chilies, ground to make 3 tbs powder or use cayenne pepper
1/2 to 1 tsp shrimp paste
2 tbs fish sauce
2-3 tbs brown sugar
1/2 to 1 tsp tamarind paste
1 1/2 tbs lime juice
2 tbs water

Directions:
Heat oil in a small frying pan over medium high heat.  Add the shallots and garlic frying until they turn a very light golden brown and slightly crispy (2-3 minutes).  Remove garlic and shallots with a slotted spoon from the oil and set in a bowl to cool.  Leave remaining oil in pan.  Using a food processor, combine the prepared chili with shrimp paste, fish sauce, sugar, tamarind, lime and water.  Also add the fried garlic and shallots.  Process together to form a thick paste.  Return the paste to your frying pan and stir it into the oil over low heat, gently simmering until you get a fairly even consistency.  Adjust the consistency by adding a little more water if you find it is too thick or more oil if you prefer a shinier sauce.  Adjust the taste, adding more fish sauce if you'd like it saltier or more sugar if you like it sweeter.
The sauce will keep for several months in a covered jar in the refrigerator.
