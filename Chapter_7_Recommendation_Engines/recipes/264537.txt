Ingredients:
4 pounds beef oxtails, cut into pieces
2 onions, cut into large chunks
3 green onions, cut into large pieces
1 bunch fresh thyme
4 teaspoons browning sauce (such as Gravy Master®)
3 teaspoons red pepper flakes
2 teaspoons seasoning blend (such as Badia® Complete Seasoning®)
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons hot sauce
1 clove garlic
2 bay leaves
water to cover
6 cups beef broth
2 (15 ounce) cans lima beans, drained

Directions:
Combine oxtails, onions, green onions, thyme, browning sauce, red pepper flakes, seasoning blend, salt, hot sauce, garlic, and bay leaves in a large pot. Let marinate in the refrigerator, stirring as often as you can, 8 hours to overnight.
Place pot over medium heat. Pour in enough water to cover the oxtails. Simmer for 2 hours. Add beef broth and cook until oxtails are tender, about 2 hours 45 minutes. Add lima beans and cook until heated through, about 15 minutes. Discard thyme and bay leaves.
