Description: 
I love this recipe. I make it all the time. It took me a while to get my kids to eat it but I finally figured out the formula. I use frozen peas and carrots and cut the potatoes into hearts with a cookie cutter. Now, my kids love this recipe and it is so easy.Modified from: Marie's Easy Slow Cooker Pot Roast
