Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 large egg
1 tsp vanilla
1 tsp almond extract
2 cups flour
1/8 tsp salt
1/2 cup dried cranberries
3/4 cup white chocolate or vanilla chips
Filling:
8 ounce pkg cream cheese, softened
14 ounce can sweetened condensed milk
1 tsp dried lemon peel
2 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla
12 ounce jar cherry preserves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 13x9 in pan. Cream butter and brown sugar. Add 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, and almond extract. Mix until combined. Add flour and blend well. Stir in cranberries and white chocolate. Press batter into prepared pan.
In a medium bowl, beat cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk until combined. Add 2 egges, lemon peel, and vanilla, beating until combined. Mixture will be thin but will thicken during baking. Spread cream cheese mixture over batter in pan.
Place cherry preserves in a small bowl and whisk until runny. Drop spoonfuls onto cheesecake mixture. Lightly draw knife through cheesecake mixture to swirl preserves into cheesecake.
Bake at 350 degrees for 35 - 40 minutes or until cheesecake browns a bit on the top and pulls away from the sides of the pan. Cool and refrigerate before serving.
