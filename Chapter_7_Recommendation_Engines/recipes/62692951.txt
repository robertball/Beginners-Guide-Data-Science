Ingredients:
3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 lemon, quartered
2 teaspoons garlic powder, divided
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 (8 ounce) package rotelle pasta
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest

Directions:
Place chicken in a lightly greased pan.  Squeeze lemon over both sides of the chicken breasts and season both sides using 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder and 3/4 teaspoon pepper.  Fry until done and dice.
Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, season the chicken broth with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  Bring to a boil and add lemon juice and pasta.  Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until all liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Stir cream into chicken pan, scraping up the bits. Add lemon zest and pasta. Let stand 5 minutes.  Stir thoroughly before serving.
