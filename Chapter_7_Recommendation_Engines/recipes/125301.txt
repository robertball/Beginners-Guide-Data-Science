Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees), divided
1 teaspoon sugar
3 eggs, beaten
1 cup applesauce
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons salt
8 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups peeled, diced apples
1 1/2 cups raisins
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons cornmeal
GLAZE:
1 egg, beaten
sugar

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine yeast, 1/2 cup water and sugar; set aside. In a large bowl, combine eggs, applesauce, honey, oil, salt and remaining water; mix well. Stir in yeast mixture. Gradually add enough flour to form a soft dough. Knead on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down and turn over in bowl. Cover and let rise 30 minutes. In a small bowl, combine apples, raisins and lemon juice. Divide dough into three parts; knead one-third of the apple mixture into each part. Shape each into round flat balls. Place each in a greased 8-in. round baking pan that has been sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Brush each loaf with egg and sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 to 35 minutes or until brown sounds hollow when tapped.

Description: 
I've been making this bread for many years. It smells so good in the oven and tastes even better. I make bread almost every Saturday, and it doesn't stay around long with our sons home from college in the summer.
