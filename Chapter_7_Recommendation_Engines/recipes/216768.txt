Ingredients:
1 large baking potato
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/4 cup chopped onions
1/2 cup chopped mushrooms
salt to taste
2 tablespoons nonfat plain yogurt

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Pierce potato a few times with a fork. Place on a microwave safe plate, and cook 10 minutes in the microwave on high, until tender but not mushy. Transfer potato to a baking dish, and bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Mix in onion. Cook and stir until tender. Mix in mushrooms. Season with salt. Reduce heat to low, cover, and let sit 5 minutes, or until mushrooms are tender. Serve potato topped with the mushrooms and yogurt.

Description: 
A big baked potato topped with sauteed mushrooms and a dollop of yogurt is a filling, easy meal after a long day at the office or before a game. Speed up the cook time by starting in the microwave! I like to serve it with a salad or green beans.
