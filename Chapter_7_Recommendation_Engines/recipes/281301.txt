Description: 
When summer temperatures climb to 100 degrees, or higher, avoid heating yourself or your kitchen, and use the slow cooker instead! Create a rack out of hand-formed rolls of aluminum foil for the bottom of the cooker, so the burgers won't sit in their own juices. Add a little smoke flavor and some browning sauce, and you'll have a good-looking, tasty burger that is full of smoky flavor. Optional toppings for the hamburgers include cheese, mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles, sliced tomato, sliced onion, and lettuce.
