1 tablespoon butter
1 sweet onion, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 (14.75 ounce) cans creamed corn

1 (12 ounce) package Cotija cheese, grated
1 cup cilantro, chopped
1/2 cup bacon bits
2 teaspoons chili powder

Directions:
Melt butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add creamed corn and whole kernel corn with liquid. Cook, stirring occasionally, until bubbling, about 5 minutes. Add Cotija cheese; stir constantly until melted. Add cilantro, bacon, and chili powder. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until flavors are blended, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
I was recently given a block of Cotija cheese, but I had no idea what do with it. After doing some recipe research, I was inspired to create my own recipe. Enjoy!
