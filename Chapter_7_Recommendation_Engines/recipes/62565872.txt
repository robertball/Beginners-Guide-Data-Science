Ingredients:
olive oil
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 teaspoon chopped garlic
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup cooked chicken, preferably roasted
1 ripe tomato, chopped
4 ounces packaged gnocchi, cut in half
1/2 cup Fat Free Evaporated Milk
3/4 cup fresh baby spinach leaves
4 tablespoons parmesan cheese
Fresh basil

Directions:
Cook the onions and garlic in olive oil for about 5 minutes, or until onion becomes soft and transparent and garlic becomes golden. Be careful not to burn the garlic or it will taste bitter.
Add chicken broth. Turn up heat and let it come to a boil. After the broth starts boiling, add the precooked chicken, gnocchi, and chopped tomato. Turn down to a simmer. Simmer for about 5 minutes.
Next, add the Evaporated Milk. Add spinach last. Stir spinach until it wilts. Remove from heat.
After putting the Chicken Toscana soup into individual bowls, sprinkle with generous amounts of Parmesan cheese and a little basil.
