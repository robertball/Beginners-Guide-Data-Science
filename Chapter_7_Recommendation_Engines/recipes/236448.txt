Ingredients:
Vegetables:
2 heads broccoli, cut into 1-inch florets
2 red bell peppers, cut into 1/2-inch chunks
1 yellow onion, thinly sliced into rings, rings separated
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 limes, juiced
1/2 teaspoon salt
Pasta:
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 pounds penne pasta
Sauce:
4 avocados - peeled, pitted, and chopped
2 limes, juiced
3 cloves garlic, peeled
1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
Garnish:
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved (optional)
4 fresh cilantro stems, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch sea salt to taste (optional)
freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Combine broccoli, red bell peppers, and yellow onion in a large bowl. Add olive oil, juice of 2 limes, and 1/2 teaspoon salt; toss to coat. Spread vegetables onto a baking sheet.
Roast vegetables, stirring 1 or 2 times, in the preheated oven until edges begin to blacken, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven and cool slightly.
Fill a large pot with water and 1/2 teaspoon salt; bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
Blend avocados, juice of 2 limes, garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor or blender until sauce is smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Add 1/2 cup chopped cilantro and pulse until just incorporated.
Gently toss pasta, roasted vegetables, and sauce together in a large bowl. Garnish with cherry tomatoes, cilantro stems, sea salt, and black pepper.

Description: 
This recipe is bright, creamy, salty, and slightly burned and crunchy. It's a delightful sensory experience, and also kind-of healthy, if you believe in that sort of thing! Also, this recipe would make a great paleo dinner with some spiraled veggie pasta.
