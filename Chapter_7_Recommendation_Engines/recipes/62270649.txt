Ingredients:
3 or 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 cans of crescent rolls
1 can cream of mushroom soup
1 can cream of chicken soup
1 cup shredded cheddar (the more, the better!)
1 cup milk

Directions:
Cook chicken in a skillet with salt and pepper, then tear them into bite-sized pieces.
Mix together the soups, cheese, and milk in a separate bowl.
Gather the torn up chicken (in small pieces) and spread out the crescent rolls.
Roll the chicken in the crescent rolls (you can also roll some cheese up inside), and place in a greased 9 x 13 casserole dish.
Pour the soup mixture over the rolls.
Bake at 350 for 40 minutes, or until the mixture starts to bubble and the rolls are golden brown.
