Ingredients:
4 cups egg noodles
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup brown sugar, or more to taste
1 (16 ounce) package cottage cheese
1 egg
2 egg whites
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 firm, tart apples - cored, quartered, and thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch square pan.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Beat cream cheese and brown sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; beat in cottage cheese, egg, egg whites, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg until well combined. Fold noodles and apples into cheese mixture by hand; spread into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until kugel is lightly browned and firm, 45 to 50 minutes.

Description: 
Sweet apple and noodle dish of east European origin. Kugels can be made in many flavors, both sweet and savory. Serve either warm or cold, as a side dish or a dessert. Like lasagna, kugel tastes better the day after it is made. Jonagold and Rome Beauty are two apple varieites ideal for this dish.
