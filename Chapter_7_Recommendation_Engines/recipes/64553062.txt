Ingredients:
Chicken Breast, skinless & boneless - 1 large
Coconut Flour - 1/4 cup
Egg - 1
Coconut Milk - 1 Tbsp
Dried Shredded Coconut - 1/3 cup
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 400 F.
Place the chicken breast between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound to roughly 3/4 inch - 1 inch flat. Keep it as even as possible
In one bowl wisk the coconut milk & egg together. In another bowl, place the coconut flour, and in a third place the shredded coconut.
Slice the chicken strips into roughly 8 equally-sized strips. Dip each strip first in the flour, then the egg/milk mixture, and lastly in the shredded coconut before placing on a large baking sheet.
Bake chicken strips for 10-15 minutes or until chicken has cooked through and coconut has browned but not burnt. Salt & pepper to taste.
Dip, bite, enjoy.

Description: 
For those of you without any love for coconut, put your prejudice aside and give these a try - the roasting essentially eliminates the coconutty flavor and lends these tenders a spendidly breaded texture & flavor. Don't use coconut flakes or chop them to powder, but a shredded coconut with grain sizes similar to dry rice are about perfect here. Give them a try with your favorite low sugar sauce (they're particularly good with Blackberry Barbecue Sauce) and see if you can't stop making these.
