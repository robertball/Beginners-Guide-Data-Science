Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon orange zest
1/4 cup honey
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground mace
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg white

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets.
In a medium bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Gradually blend in the egg yolk, orange zest, and honey. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and mace; stir into the creamed mixture.
Drop cookie dough by teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart  onto the prepared cookie sheet. Flatten cookies with a fork dipped in flour. Brush lightly with egg white. Bake for 10 to 14 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool on wire racks after removing from oven.

Description: 
Mace and honey team up for an unusual, terrific flavor twosome in this recipe.  These cookies taste best if you give them about a week in the cookie jar to mellow.
