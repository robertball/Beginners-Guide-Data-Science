Ingredients:
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/3 cup chopped strawberries
2 tablespoons low-calorie natural sweetener (such as SwerveÂ®)
1 tablespoon vodka (optional)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Combine heavy cream, strawberries, sweetener, vodka, vanilla extract, xanthan gum, and salt in a wide-mouth pint-size jar.
Using an immersion blender and an up and down motion, blend cream mixture for 60 to 75 seconds, or until thickened and soft peaks have formed.
Cover jar and freeze, stirring every 30 to 40 minutes, until ice cream reaches your ideal consistency, 3 to 4 hours.

Description: 
No ice cream machine? No problem! A mason jar and immersion blender are all you need to produce a creamy, decadent keto strawberry ice cream. This ice cream won't freeze rock hard like most no-churn ice creams can. The vodka is optional, however it really helps keep the ice cream scoopable, and you don't taste it!
