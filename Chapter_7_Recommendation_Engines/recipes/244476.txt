Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1  egg
1 slice Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon mayonnaise, or to taste
1 teaspoon mustard, or to taste
1 teaspoon ketchup, or to taste
1 pinch Cajun seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's), or to taste
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
2 slices white bread, toasted
1  lettuce leaf
1 slice tomato

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Crack egg into the skillet and cook until egg is white on the bottom layer and is firm enough to flip, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip egg, trying not to crack the yolk. Place Cheddar cheese on top of egg and cook until cheese is melted and egg is cooked to desired doneness, 2 to 5 minutes.
Spread mayonnaise, mustard, and ketchup into both bread slices and season with Cajun seasoning and hot pepper sauce. Add lettuce and tomato to 1 bread slice; top with egg-cheese. Sprinkle more Cajun seasoning on egg. Pour any remaining butter from skillet over egg and top with second piece of bread, creating a sandwich.
