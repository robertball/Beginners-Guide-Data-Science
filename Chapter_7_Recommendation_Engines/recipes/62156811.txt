Ingredients:
1 large jar sweet green peppers in vinegar
1 6 oz can tonno genova in olive oil
2 large cans pitted black olives
1 large jar pitted green olives
1/2 lb genoa salami, thinly sliced
1/2 lb provolone cheese, thinly sliced
1/2 c extra virgin olive oil
1 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp Italian seasoning

Directions:
Drain, rinse and cut the peppers into thin strips.  Place in a large bowl. Drain the olives and add them to the peppers.  In a separate bowl whisk the olive oil with the salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.  Pour over the peppers and olives, cover and chill overnight.
Approximately three hours before serving, drain the tuna and place in a small dish.  Season with 1/8 tsp of Italian seasoning, and salt and pepper to taste.  Chill for 1 hr.
While the tuna is chilling, cut salami and provolone into quarters and fold the wedges in half. Line the outside of an oval serving platter with the salami and provolone, alternating the two.
Mound the chilled tuna in the center of the platter.  Drain the marinated olives and peppers, reserving the marinade.  Arrange the olives and peppers around the tuna and salami and cheese. Drizzle the reserved marinade over the tuna, salami and cheese. Cover tightly with plastic wrap until serving.
