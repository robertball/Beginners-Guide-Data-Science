Ingredients:
3 pounds ground beef
1/2 onion, chopped
2 tablespoons garlic, minced
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 cups raisins
2 (8 ounce) jars green olives, drained and chopped
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
1/2 cup water
1/2 bunch cilantro

Directions:
Brown the ground beef in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat until crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Pour off any excess grease, then stir in the onion and garlic; cook for 2 minutes before adding the red pepper, green pepper, raisins, olives, tomato paste, water, and cilantro. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 10 minutes, or until the peppers have cooked to your liking.

I received this wonderful recipe of beef, olives, and sweet peppers from my son's Cuban grandmother. We serve it over black beans and rice with fried plantain on the side, it's amazing!
