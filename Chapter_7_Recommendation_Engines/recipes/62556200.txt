2  teaspoons  baking powder
1/2  teaspoon  baking soda
1-1/2  cups  shortening

1/3  cup  milk

Directions:
Makes Brown Sugar Cookie Mix: Stir together all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a very large mixing bowl.
Cut in shortening until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Store tightly covered at room temperature up to 3 weeks. To measure, lightly spoon the mix into a measuring cup and level with a spatula. Makes about 8-1/2 cups.

Bake in 350 degree F oven for 10 minutes. Sprinkle 1/2 cup miniature candy-coated semisweet or milk chocolate pieces evenly over top of partially baked bars. Bake 10 to 15 minutes more or until golden brown and firm around edges. Cool in pan on a wire rack. Cut into bars.
