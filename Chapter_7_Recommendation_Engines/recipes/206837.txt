Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 (14.5 ounce) cans tomatoes, chopped
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
2 teaspoons white sugar
3/4 cup basil leaves, torn into pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir the tomatoes, red pepper flakes, vinegar, and sugar into the onion and garlic mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the flavors blend to your liking, 45 to 60 minutes. Stir the basil into the sauce; season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
A delicious and fresh tasting pasta sauce. The fresh basil added at the end is essential. This sauce can be left chunky (which I prefer) or blended in a food processor to a smooth sauce. Serve spooned over cooked pasta with plenty of parmesan cheese.
