Description: 
WHEN my husband retired, we sold our home and traveled the country for 10 years in our house trailer.    It was wonderful meeting people from all over. We tried foods we never ate before and exchanged recipes. This hearty, tasty main dish from a traveling friend has become one of our favorites. It's easy to prepare for any number of people. -Marie Ritchie, Apple Valley, California
