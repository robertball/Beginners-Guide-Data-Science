Ingredients:
* 1 1/2 pound sole filets
* salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste
* 2 cups flour
* 4 eggs, beaten
* 4 tbsp butter
* 1 tbsp capers
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
* 1 tbsp cold butter
* 4 lemon wedges

Directions:
Pat sole filets dry with paper towels, and season both sides with salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste. Place the flour in a baking dish, and the beaten eggs in another. Dredge the fish filets, one at a time, in the flour to coat both sides, and then transfer into the dish of eggs. Turn the sole filets in the egg to coat both sides, and leave in the egg.
Once all the sole filets are floured and transferred into the dish of eggs, place in the refrigerator until needed. In a large non-stick skillet, melt the butter over med-low heat, until it begins to sizzle slightly. Lift the sole filets out of the egg mixture, allowing the excess to drip off, and saut√© for 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown. Cook in batches if necessary, and keep warm in a very low oven.
When all the sole is cooked, turn off the pan, and add the capers, lemon juice, parsley, and cold butter to the pan. Whisk until the butter melts. Taste for salt and pepper, and adjust. Place the sole on four warm plates, and spoon over the sauce. Serve with lemon wedges.
