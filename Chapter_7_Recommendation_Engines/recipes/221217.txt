Ingredients:
1 cup lime juice
4 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
5 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Whisk together the lime juice, olive oil, garlic, ground cumin, chili powder, salt, and red pepper flakes in a bowl; pour into a large resealable plastic bag.
Put the chicken breasts into the bag, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag.
Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Remove the chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade. Arrange chicken breasts in a baking dish.
Bake chicken breasts in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Shred chicken breasts with two forks to desired texture.

Description: 
I requested this recipe after I had these fajitas at a graduation party. This marinade makes some of the most delicious chicken I've ever tasted, so it's still awesome if you forgo making fajitas and just use it to marinate your chicken breasts.
