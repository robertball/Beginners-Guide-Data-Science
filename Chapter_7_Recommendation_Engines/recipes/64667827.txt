Ingredients:
1 (12-ounce) package frozen chopped Spinach, thawed and thoroughly drained
16 ounces of shredded sharp Cheddar Cheese
1/2 cup chopped Pecans, toasted
1/2 cup Mayonnaise
2 (8-ounce) packages Cream Cheese, softened and divided
1/4 teaspoon Salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground Pepper
1/3 cup Mango Chutney
1/2 teaspoon ground Nutmeg

Directions:
Line four 3" x 6" aluminum mini loaf pans with plastic wrap.
Remove as much moisture from spinach as possible either by squeezing firmly in your hands (a little at a time) or by placing between layers of paper towels.  Set aside.
In a medium bowl, stir together Cheddar Cheese, Pecans, and Mayonnaise.  Spread 1/2 of this mixture evenly into prepared pans.
Stir together Spinach, 1 package of Cream Cheese, Salt, and Pepper and spread evenly over the Cheddar Cheese layer.
Stir together remaining package of Cream Cheese, Chutney, and Nutmeg and spread evenly over the Spinach layer.
Top with remaining Cheddar Cheese mixture.
Cover each pan with layer of plastic wrap, then top with a piece of aluminum foil.
Garnish, if desired, with whole Pecans on top (if serving immediately).  Serve with Crackers.
Loaves can be kept in the refrigerator for up to a week.  Loaves can also be frozen for up to 2 months.  Frozen loaves can be thawed by placing in the refrigerator overnight.
