Ingredients:
1 (32 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater TotsÂ®)
2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, cubed
1 1/2 teaspoons celery seed
1 tablespoon olive oil
2/3 cup buffalo wing sauce
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 cup ranch dressing

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Spread potato nuggets in a single layer on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, place chicken in a large bowl. Add celery seed and olive oil. Stir to coat.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 15 minutes. Turn heat off and add wing sauce. Stir to coat.
Remove potatoes from oven. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to low.
Spoon chicken mixture evenly over potatoes and top with Monterey Jack cheese.
Broil on low until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven and drizzle ranch dressing over the top. Serve immediately.
