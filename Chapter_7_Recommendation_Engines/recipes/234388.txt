Ingredients:
2 cups blackberries
1/2 cup reduced-sugar ketchup
1/4 cup tomato sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar replacement (such as SplendaÂ® Brown Sugar Blend)
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Pour blackberries into a saucepan and cook over medium heat until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes.
Stir ketchup, tomato sauce, brown sugar replacement, garlic, ginger, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper into the blackberries; cook at a simmer until blackberries are completely tender, about 20 minutes.
Pour sauce into a blender no more than half full. Put lid on blender and hold in place with a towel. Pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
