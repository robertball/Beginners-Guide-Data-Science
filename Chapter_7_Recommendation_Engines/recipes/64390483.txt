Ingredients:
2 sticks cold and cubed unsalted butter
1¼ cup granulated sugar
2 eggs
½ cup good quality dark cocoa powder
2¼ to ½ cups all-purpose flour- Spoon and Sweep method
¼ tsp Kosher salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1½ cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
1½ cups peanut butter chips*

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In bowl of electric mixer fitted with paddle, cream together butter and sugar until well blended and fluffy. Add eggs and beat until well-incorporated, then beat in cocoa powder.
Mix in flour, salt and baking powder until just combined. Gently fold in remaining ingredients.
Transfer dough to clean work surface and gently mix dough by hand to ensure even distribution of ingredients. Divide into 12 equal portions, about 4 oz each*, and place each on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Bake in the preheated oven 16-20 minutes depending on how gooey and raw you like the middles (I bake mine at 350 for 18 minutes since I prefer a less raw interior), taking care not to over bake. . Let cool on a rack and store what you don't immediately eat in an airtight container. To freshen them after a few days (if they last that long), give them a quick nuke in the microwave for 5-10 seconds.
