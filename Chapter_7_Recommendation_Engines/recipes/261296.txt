Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups shelled pistachios
2 tablespoons white sugar
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 1/4 cups sweetened dried cranberries
1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
2 1/2 cups flour

Directions:
Pulse pistachios in a food processor or blender until reduced to powder (some small chunks are OK) but not to paste. Scrape into a bowl with 2 tablespoons white sugar. Drizzle with 3 tablespoons melted butter; stir with a fork until mixture starts to clump. Pulse cranberries in food processor or blender (no need to clean it first) until finely chopped. Stir into pistachio mixture.
Put 1 cup butter, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, baking powder, salt, and 1/2 cup white sugar in a bowl. Cream together with a mixer until butter clings to sides of bowl and is uniform in color, 1 or 2 minutes. Mix in egg until incorporated. Add flour; mix on low speed until incorporated, about 2 minutes.
Scrape dough onto a large, generously floured sheet of parchment paper. Dust top of dough with more flour, then press into a rough square. Roll into a 12x15-inch rectangle with a long edge facing you. Sprinkle pistachio-cranberry mixture evenly over dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border of uncovered dough. Brush top border with water. Tightly roll dough from bottom to top, using parchment to help lift dough, ending with the wet edge and pressing lightly to seal. Slide dough and parchment onto a baking sheet; cover with plastic wrap. Freeze 1 hour, or chill 4 to 8 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.
Slice chilled roll into 1/2-inch-thick cookies; set on prepared sheet. Bake until edges start to turn golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes. Cool on sheet 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
These colorful cookies are a new holiday classic! Just make sure to generously flour the surface that you roll the dough out on. That keeps the dough from sticking and breaking as you roll it up.
