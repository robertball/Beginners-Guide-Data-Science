Description: 
These are amazing lemon sugar cookies, apparently an old German recipe. The recipe has a funny history. Years ago, my son's step-mother made them for him to bring home with him after his summer visit. He loved them, so I asked her if I could have the recipe. She very nastily replied no, she wanted to be the only one who made them for him. That was years ago and she never again made them for him. This summer he visited and stumbled across the recipe in a cabinet. He snapped a picture of the recipe and texted it to me! My young Spy! Thus, the name Espionage Cookies.
