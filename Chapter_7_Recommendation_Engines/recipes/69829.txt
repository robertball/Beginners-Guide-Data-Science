Ingredients:
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
½ cup butter, melted
1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
36  pimento-stuffed green olives

Directions:
Mix Cheddar cheese and flour together in a bowl. Stir in butter, cover, and refrigerate 1 hour, or more.
Heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Form chilled dough into small balls, pressing a deep hole in the center using your thumb. Stuff each ball with an olive, and seal completely.
Bake in the preheated oven 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown, watching carefully and turning as needed to prevent bottoms from burning.

Submitter: 
none
Description: 
These are snazzy little appetizers that taste great hot or at room temperature, and they freeze well, too! If baking when frozen, reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
