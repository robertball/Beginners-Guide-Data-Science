Ingredients:
This MUST be followed to the letter!
5 Lbs. of low grade ground beef (must be fatty)
5 Rounded teaspoons Morton Tender Quick Salt
2 1/2 Teaspoons Mustard Seed
2 1/2 Tablespoons Course grain Black Pepper
1 Tablespoon Hickory Smoked Salt
2 1/2 Tablespoons Garlic Salt
OR
1 1/2 teaspoons Garlic Powder

Directions:
1st Day-Mix-Cover-Refridgerate
2nd Day-Mix-Cover-Refridgerate
3rd Day-Mix-Form into 5 Logs
Place on the rack of a broiler pan.
Put into a 140 degree oven on the bottom shelf.
Bake for 8 hours, making a 1/4 turn every 2 hours.
Let cool before wrapping. It will not fall apart when slicing, if you used the lowest grade of ground beef.  You need the grease to make its own casing.
ENJOY!
