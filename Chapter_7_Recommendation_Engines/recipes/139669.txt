Ingredients:
1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes
1/4 cup black olives
1 tablespoon dried basil
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
20 scallops
10 slices prosciutto

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the tomatoes, olives, basil, olive oil, salt and pepper into the bowl of a food processor and pulse until all of the ingredients are well blended and the consistency is almost smooth. Scrape the tomato and olive marinade into a large bowl; toss the scallops in the mixture until well coated.
Cut prosciutto slices in half lengthwise and wrap each piece around one scallop. Arrange wrapped scallops on a baking sheet and bake in preheated oven for twenty minutes.
