1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste

1 (4 pound) package boneless country-style pork ribs

1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup teriyaki sauce
1/4 cup orange juice

Mix the steak seasoning, garlic salt, black pepper, and chili powder in a small bowl. Rub the ribs all over with the seasoning mix, and place into the bottom of a slow cooker.
