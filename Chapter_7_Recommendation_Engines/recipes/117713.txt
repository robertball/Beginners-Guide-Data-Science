Ingredients:
3/4 cup sherry or chicken broth
1/3 cup soy sauce
1 small onion, sliced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 pound boneless beef top round steak, cut into 2-inch strips
3/4 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1/2 inch cubes
4 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided
3 medium carrots, julienned
1 cup fresh broccoli florets
1 medium green pepper, julienned
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup minced fresh cilantro
12 cups torn mixed salad greens
3 medium navel oranges, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch pieces

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Pour 2/3 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add beef. Pour 1/3 cup marinade into another plastic bag; add chicken. Seal bags and turn to coat; refrigerate for up to 2 hours. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade.
Drain and discard marinade from beef and chicken. In a large skillet or wok, heat 1-1/2 teaspoons oil; stir-fry beef until no longer pink. Remove and keep warm. In the same pan, stir-fry chicken in 1-1/2 teaspoons oil until juices run clear. Remove and keep warm. Stir-fry carrots and broccoli in remaining oil for 5 minutes. Add the green pepper, onion and mushrooms; stir-fry for 5-6 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in cilantro and reserved marinade.
Toss salad greens and oranges; place on a large serving plate. Top with the stir-fried beef, chicken and vegetables.

Description: 
'I tossed together this tasty salad for some business friends a few years ago,' explains Michelle Smith from Running Springs, California. 'The meat has to marinate first, but it's well worth the wait. In fact, after serving this dish I received two proposals for marriage plus one offer to be a live-in cook!'
