Ingredients:
1/3 cup sugar
Pinch salt
4 1/2 tbsp cornstarch
1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
1 1/2 cups whole milk
4 egg yolks
1 tsp vanilla
16-20 vanilla wafers
2 large bananas
2/3 cup dark brown sugar
4-5 tsp hot water
1 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, mix sugar, salt and cornstarch. Add evaporated milk and whole milk. Cook carefully, over low to medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture coats the back of a spoon.
In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks. Add about 1/2 cup of the custard into the egg yolks, stirring. Then return the yolks and custard mixture to the saucepan, and cook three minutes longer, stirring constantly. Add vanilla. Cool mixture to room temperature, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, layer the vanilla wafers and sliced bananas in an 8 inch square dish. Melt the brown sugar with the hot water, secreting a paste. Fold the brown sugar paste into the cooled pudding mixture, leaving streaks. Pour mixture over vanilla wafers and bananas. Chill. When well chilled, whip the cream and spread over the dish.
