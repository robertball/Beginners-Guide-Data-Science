Ingredients:
1-2 cloves garlic
1/2 lb ground turkey
10 oz can tomato sauce
2 Tbsp tomato paste
1/2 Tsp basil
1/2 Tsp oregano
olive oil
salt and pepper

Directions:
Heat oil in a pan and chop or press garlic cloves.  Saute in pan for a few minutes then add tomato paste and ground turkey.  Mix together in the pan and make sure the turkey is broken down into small pieces.
Cook over medium heat for a few minutes until the tomato paste is completely incorporated throughout the meat.  Add seasonings and tomato sauce.  Simmer on low for 8-10 minutes, sauce will be very thick.
This sauce is quick, delicious, and very easy to make.  The texture reminds me of a sloppy joe, but this is delicious!  Serve over polenta or pasta.
