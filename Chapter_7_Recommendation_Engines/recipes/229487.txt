Description: 
I'm just beginning to cook so my recipes are pretty quick and simple. This recipe is a really simple, quick, and tasty 'Sloppy Joe.' This is what we are having tonight before we go to the football game. You can also let this simmer in a slow cooker after browning the ground beef if you prefer.
