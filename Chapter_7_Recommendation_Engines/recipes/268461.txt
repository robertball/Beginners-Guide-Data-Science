Ingredients:
7 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/2 cup butter
4 stalks celery, diced
2 large onions, diced
1 tablespoon poultry seasoning (such as Bell'sÂ®)
1 (14 ounce) package seasoned dry stuffing mix
1 cup hot water

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, return to the pot, add butter, and mash. Add celery, onions, and poultry seasoning; stir and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Pour stuffing mix into a large bowl and add hot water; mix until moistened. Fold stuffing mixture into potato mixture in the pot until well blended. Transfer stuffing to a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is browned, about 1 hour.
