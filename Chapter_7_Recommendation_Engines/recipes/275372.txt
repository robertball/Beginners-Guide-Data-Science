Ingredients:
Herb Butter:
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh chives
1 teaspoon finely minced fresh garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter
2 3/4 pounds skin-on, bone-in split turkey breast

Directions:
Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place rosemary, chives, garlic, salt, and pepper onto a cutting board. Cut butter into thin slices on top of herbs and seasonings and mash until well blended.
Pat turkey breast dry and rub with herbed butter on both sides and under the skin.
Place turkey into the basket of the air fryer, skin-side down, and fry for 20 minutes.
Turn turkey to skin-side up carefully and continue frying until an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 18 minutes more. Transfer to a platter and tent with aluminum foil; allow to rest for 10 minutes. Slice and serve warm.
