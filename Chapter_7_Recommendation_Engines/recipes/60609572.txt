Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix
1 (16 ounce) container prepared chocolate frosting
2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Prepare the cake mix according to package directions using any of the recommended pan sizes. When cake is done, crumble while warm into a large bowl, and stir in the frosting until well blended.
Melt chocolate coating in a glass bowl in the microwave, or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth.
Use a melon baller or small scoop to form balls of the chocolate cake mixture. Dip the balls in chocolate using a toothpick or fork to hold them. Place on waxed paper to set.

Description: 
These little treats can be decorated for any festive occasion all you need is your imagination.  I like to use semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of almond bark that can tend to make these dessert balls a little too sweet.Modified from: Cake Balls
