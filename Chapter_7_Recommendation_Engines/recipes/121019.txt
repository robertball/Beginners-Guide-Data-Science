Ingredients:
1 pound bulk pork sausage
1 1/2 cups cornmeal
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon sugar
1 egg
1 cup milk

Directions:
In a 9-in. ovenproof skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink. Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons drippings. In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder and sugar. In another bowl, beat egg and milk. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in sausage and reserved drippings. Return to skillet. Bake at 425 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
