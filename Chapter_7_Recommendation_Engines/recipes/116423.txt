Ingredients:
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2/3 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
In a heavy saucepan, melt chocolate chips with cream over low heat. Remove from the heat. Refrigerate, stirring occasionally.
For a pourable ganache, cool until mixture reaches 85 degrees F-90 degrees F and is slightly thickened, about 40 minutes. Pour over cake, allowing some to flow down the edges to completely coat. Spread ganache with a spatula if necessary to evenly coat, working quickly before it thickens. Chill until set.
For spreadable ganache, chill until mixture reaches a spreadable consistency. Spread over cake. Chill until set.
