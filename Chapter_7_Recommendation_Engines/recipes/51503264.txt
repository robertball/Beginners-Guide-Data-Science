Ingredients:
For the rosemary salt
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
2 tablespoons coarse salt
1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
For the steak
1 pound lean steak, preferably flank, about 1 1/4 inches thick
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
8 cups shredded romaine lettuce
1 1/2 cups halved cherry tomatoes
1/4 cup chopped fresh mint

Directions:
For the rosemary salt, combine chopped rosemary and salt on a cutting board and chop together. Stir in the pepper; transfer to a small bowl, and set aside.
. Heat a grill or grill pan. Sprinkle the steak on both sides generously with the rosemary salt, pressing it into the meat. (Reserve the remainder for another use.) Grill the steak 4 minutes on one side. Turn, and grill to rare, 3 to 4 more minutes. Remove to a plate and let stand 5 minutes. Thinly slice the beef against the grain. Add the vinegar to the pan and stir to incorporate any pan juices.
