Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1-1/4 pound ground turkey Italian sausage
1-1/4 pound potatoes
1 medium onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch kale washed, stems removed and chopped into pieces
6 cups low-sodium chicken broth
2 teaspoons dried basil
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons crushed fennel seed
1/2 cup low-fat buttermilk
fresh ground pepper to taste
1/4 to 1/2 cup shredded pecorino

Directions:
In a large sauce pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add sausage, crumble and brown.
Add onion and garlic and saute until onions are just tender, about three minutes.
Meanwhile, create a bouquet garni in cheese cloth with the basil, oregano and fennel. Add it and all remaining ingredients except the kale and buttermilk, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer until potatoes are cooked, 10-15 minutes.
Add kale and simmer until it is just tender, less than 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in buttermilk. Add pepper to taste, you shouldn't need salt. Top with about a tablespoon of cheese.
Serve with a warm, crusty bread.

Description: 
I love how the earthiness of the potato, slight bitterness of the kale and sweet spiciness of the turkey Italian sausage blend together in a lightly creamy sauce infused with basil, oregano and fennel. A nearly 2-cup serving works out to only 272 calories with 10 grams of fat and 4 of fiber.
