Ingredients:
3 cups white sugar
1 cup water
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
3 egg whites
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine sugar, water, and cream of tartar in a saucepan.  Cook until candy thermometer reaches 238 degrees F (115 degrees C), or until syrup spins a long thread when dripped from a spoon.
Beat egg whites until stiff.  Pour a thin, slow stream of the syrup into egg whites, beating constantly until frosting stands in peaks.  Stir in salt and vanilla to taste.
