Ingredients:
2 zucchini, quartered and sliced
1 onion, sliced into rings
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Place zucchini and onions in a medium bowl and mix together.
In a small bowl mix flour, cornmeal, salt, pepper and garlic powder.
Pour dry mixture over zucchini/onion mixture, cover bowl and shake well.  Let mixture sit for about 30 minutes; a batter will form on the vegetables.
In a medium skillet heat oil over medium heat.  When oil is hot add breaded vegetables and fry, turning to brown evenly.
