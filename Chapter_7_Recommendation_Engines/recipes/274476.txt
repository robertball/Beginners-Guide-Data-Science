Ingredients:
3 small pie pumpkins
3 carrots, peeled, or more to taste
1 small onion, peeled
1 rib celery
1 pound bulk regular pork sausage (such as Jimmy DeanÂ®)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups milk
1/2 (16 ounce) container sour cream

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Poke holes in each pumpkin with a sturdy tool. Boil one at a time until tender, about 45 minutes each. Boil carrots, onion, and celery with the third pumpkin. Drain and let cool until easily handled, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat another pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
Cut pumpkins open and scrape out seeds and pulp. Scoop pumpkin flesh into a large bowl. Add boiled carrots, onion, and celery.
Add pumpkin mixture to a food processor or blender in batches, blending until smooth.
Pour puree into the pot with the sausage. Pour in milk and sour cream; mix until creamy. Cook over low heat until heated through, about 10 minutes.
