Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup uncooked jasmine rice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, cut into wedges
2 tablespoons fish sauce
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 pound chicken tenders, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 tablespoon green curry paste, or more to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 eggplant, cut into 1-inch cubes
2/3 (32 ounce) carton chicken broth, or more to taste
1 (15 ounce) can light coconut milk
1 (8 ounce) can bamboo shoots
2 teaspoons lime juice
1 small bunch fresh basil leaves, or to taste

Directions:
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Mix in onion, fish sauce, brown sugar, ginger, and garlic; cook and stir about 5 minutes. Add chicken, curry paste, and basil. Cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes more. Add eggplant, cover, and reduce heat to low to avoid burning spices. Cook about 5 minutes more.
Pour broth, coconut milk, and bamboo shoots into the saucepan. Continue cooking until eggplant is tender and curry is heated through, 5 to 10 minutes more. Stir in lime juice before serving over cooked rice with basil leaves.
