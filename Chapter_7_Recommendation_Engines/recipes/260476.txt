Ingredients:
Syrup:
1 cup blackberries
1/2 cup orange juice
1/4 cup honey
Corn Cake:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 ear fresh corn, husked
1 1/4 cups buttermilk
2 eggs
3 tablespoons honey
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped
1/2 cup blackberries, sliced into small chunks
1 orange, zested
1 teaspoon fresh thyme
2 tablespoons orange juice
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon butter
Honey Butter:
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Combine 1 cup blackberries, 1/2 cup orange juice, and 1/4 cup honey in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until blackberries break down into a sauce, about 10 minutes.
Combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
Hold corn ear upright on a cutting board; slice kernels off the cob carefully with a knife. Transfer corn kernels to a bowl. Run the flat side of the knife along the cob to extract corn milk; pour into the bowl. Mix in buttermilk, eggs, 3 tablespoons honey, 3 tablespoons melted butter, and jalapeno peppers.
Mix corn-buttermilk mixture into flour mixture. Fold in 1/2 cup sliced blackberries, orange zest, and thyme.
Pour blackberry sauce into a bowl through a fine-mesh strainer. Pour sauce back into the saucepan. Discard solids.
Mix 2 tablespoons orange juice and cornstarch together in a small bowl. Stir a few drops of the blackberry sauce into the cornstarch mixture. Pour cornstarch mixture into the saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring until thick and syrupy, about 5 minutes.
Whip 3 tablespoons unsalted butter and 1 tablespoon honey together to make honey butter.
Melt 1 teaspoon butter on a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop 1/4 cup corn cake batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Top warm corn cakes with a some honey butter and a drizzle blackberry syrup.
