Ingredients:
1/2 cup margarine
5 cups apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup salt
4 bone-in chicken breast halves, with skin

Directions:
Bring the margarine, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and salt to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir until salt has dissolved, and add the chicken breast halves. Return to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the chicken is tender and no longer pink inside, about 30 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Grill the chicken breasts on the preheated grill until the skin is browned, lightly charred in spots, and shows good grill marks, about 5 minutes per side.

Description: 
This is definitely NOT the healthiest way to grill chicken, but it's my grandfather's recipe and he's 92! My kids are the ones who have named this chicken -- they LOVE it!
