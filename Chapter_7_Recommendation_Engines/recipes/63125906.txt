Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 1/4 cups chopped onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 can cooked black beans, rinsed and drained
1 can garbanzo beans rinsed and drained.
2 1/4 cups cooked brown rice
3 cups dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and garlic; cook and stir for a few minutes. Mix in the yellow bell pepper and continue cooking until tender. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl. Pour in the beans, rice and bread crumbs. Season with ginger, salt. Process carefully through the large die of a meat grinder or very carefully in a meat processor being careful to not liquify the mix. Mix thoroughly using your hands. Fill a 1/2 cup measuring cup with the ingredients then dump the contents into your hand and press into patties. Do not overwork the patties.
Heat about 1/4 inch of canola oil in a 10" skillet over medium-high heat (you can use the same one). Fry four patties until golden on each side, about 5 minutes per side. Place cooked patties on a cooling rack to drain for a few minutes. Serve on buns with your favorite burger toppings. We like to spread butter on the cut side of the buns and grill cut side down until golden brown.

Description: 
I had been preparing this recipe for a couple of years. Recently, I decided to try making it more burger like. I haven't accomplished that pinnacle, but I like this result very much. Hannah has a very good recipe and my changes reflect my preferences more than a criticism of her recipe.Modified from: Jamaican Burgers
