Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup white sugar
1/3 cup butter, melted
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 (15 ounce) can solid pack pumpkin
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
2 eggs
2 cups sour cream
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan.
Combine graham cracker crumbs and 1/4 cup white sugar in a bowl; stir in butter. Press crust onto the bottom and 1 1/2-inches up the side of prepared springform pan.
Bake in preheated oven until set and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, beat cream cheese and brown sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Stir pumpkin, cornstarch, 1 1/4 teaspoons cinnamon, and nutmeg into cream cheese mixture. Gradually beat in evaporated milk and eggs until just blended; pour into crust. Place pan on a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until center is almost set, 55 to 60 minutes.
Combine sour cream, 1/3 cup white sugar, and vanilla extract in a small bowl. Spread sour cream topping over cheesecake and bake 5 minutes longer. Cool on wire rack for 10 minutes, then carefully run a knife around edge of pan to loosen; cool 1 hour then refrigerate overnight.
Remove sides of pan; let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before slicing. Sprinkle with cinnamon.
