Ingredients:
3 egg yolks
1 1/2 cups evaporated milk
1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
1/2 vanilla bean
1 cup Kahlua

Directions:
Whisk egg yolks in a small saucepan or top of a double boiler. Add evaporated milk and condensed milk. Stir until well blended. Strain to remove any unblended egg yolk. Return mixture to saucepan.
Scrape the seeds of vanilla pod into the egg and milk mixture.
In a larger saucepan or bottom of double boiler, bring 2 cups water to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Place the small saucepan or top of double boiler over the simmering water. Cook for about 20 minutes, stirring often to prevent sticking.
Remove from the heat, and pour into another bowl. Whisk briskly to cool to room temperature. Mix in Kahlua.
Pour into a clean glass bottle and chill before serving. This eggnog keeps for about a week in the fridge.
