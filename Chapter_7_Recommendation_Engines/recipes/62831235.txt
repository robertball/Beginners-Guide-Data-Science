Ingredients:
1 Angel Food Cake
2 (3 ounce or 85g) packages Raspberry Jell-o
1 1/4 cups boiling water
1 (15 ounce or 425g) package frozen raspberries in syrup, thawed (do not drain)
1 pint (500 ml) whipping cream, whipped, sweetened if desired

Directions:
Break the angel food cake into chunks. Set aside.
Dissolve Jell-o powder in boiling water. Cool slightly (do not allow to set). Add thawed raspberries and syrup to Jell-o and stir until mixed. Fold the whipped cream into the raspberry mixture.
Butter a 9" tube pan or angel cake pan.
Pour a small amount of the raspberry mixture into the prepared pan. Place 1/3 of the cake cubes in the pan, then pour 1/3 of the raspberry mixture over it. Repeat alternating layers until all ingredients are used, ending with the raspberry mixture. Chill until set.
To remove from pan, invert pan onto a serving plate. If necessary, use a tea towel dampened with warm water to help the cake slip out of the pan. Slice into wedges.

Light-tasting and delicious! My mother's famous dessert recipe has completed many holiday meals and makes a stunning summery cake. This works beautifully with strawberries as well.
