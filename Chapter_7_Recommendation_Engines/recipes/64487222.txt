Title:
Ida’s Classic Butter Cream Icing (aka. Wedding Cake Icing) Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
3 cups powdered sugar
1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened at room temp for 20 minutes (you can also substitute the same amount of Crisco)
1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
1 to 2 tablespoons milk (add very slowly)
(Optional) food coloring

Directions:
Using a stand or hand mixer, cream the butter & powdered sugar together first for at least 5-10 minutes. The butter should lighten in color and the texture will change and become fluffier. Then add vanilla extract & I add in the milk in slowly about ½ a teaspoon at a time until I get the desired consistency. Go easy when adding the milk, it will vary with the air humidity and time of year. I like a classic white color but you can add a few drops of food safe colorant.
This will frost a 13x9-inch cake generously, or fill and frost an 8- or 9-inch two-layer cake. Enjoy!

Description: 
This was my great grandmother’s go to classic icing. She used it on just about all of the cakes that came out of her kitchen, Wedding, Birthdays & other special events. She liked to call it her Wedding Cake Icing because it made it sound special. This was originally in an old church cook book that my family has been using for 75-100 years.
