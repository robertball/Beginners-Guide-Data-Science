Potatoes

Directions:
Custom Version:
This recipe was simple and it made "fall off the bone" chicken. I used 5 chicken legs (skin removed) and cooked it on low for 9 hours. Instead of using the alluminum foil, I used potatoes (peeled and quartered) and carrots and onions under the chicken in the crock-pot. I added 1/2 c. chicken broth and lots of seasoned salt and pepper, too. The veggies were nice and soft and the flavor of this slow cooking was wonderful and EASY !!! Thanks 'Cotton' !!!
Original Recipe:
Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold running water. Pat dry with paper towels. Season the chicken with the salt, pepper and paprika, and place in the slow cooker on top of the crumbled aluminum foil.
Set the slow cooker to High for 1 hour, then turn down to Low for about 8 to 10 hours, or until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear.
