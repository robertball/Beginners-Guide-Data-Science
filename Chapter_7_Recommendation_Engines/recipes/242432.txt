Ingredients:

1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese (such as Philadelphia®), softened
1/4 cup orange blossom honey

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place walnuts on a baking sheet. Bake until toasted and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Transfer walnuts to a plate to cool. When walnuts are cool, transfer to a resealable plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin.
Combine cream cheese, honey, and walnuts in a food processor and pulse until creamy.

Description: 
We came up with this recipe after trying Trader Joe's® honey walnut cream cheese; this was much better since we used the orange blossom honey my mom buys from local farmers' market. She suggest toasting the walnuts. To make a sweeter version, add a tablespoon of granulated sugar while pulsing in the processor. Spread a layer on a slice of your favorite bread and enjoy! Yum!
