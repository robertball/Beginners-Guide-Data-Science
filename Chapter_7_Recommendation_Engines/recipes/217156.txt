Ingredients:
1 cup pearl barley
2 cups water
1/2 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1 (8.75 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 small red onion, chopped
1 large carrot, chopped
3/4 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, finely chopped, or to taste
1 tablespoon canola oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons light corn syrup, or to taste
1 tablespoon canola oil, or to taste
1 tablespoon lime juice, or to taste
1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar, or to taste
onion powder, or to taste

Directions:
Bring the barley and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the barley is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat, and chill in refrigerator.
In a large salad bowl, combine the cooked barley, black beans, green and red bell pepper, corn, celery, red onion, carrot, chipotle pepper, 1 tablespoon of canola oil, salt, black pepper, and cumin until thoroughly mixed.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the water, corn syrup, 1 tablespoon of canola oil, lime juice, lemon juice, cilantro, white vinegar, and onion powder; pour dressing over barley mixture, and toss to combine. Refrigerate salad until cold.

Description: 
Got this at ShopRiteÂ® and loved it so much I had to make it. This is what I came up with. I had this alongside my smoked chicken and bacon with avocado spread sandwich. Perfect complement! All the ingredients for the vinaigrette are by eye and to taste.
