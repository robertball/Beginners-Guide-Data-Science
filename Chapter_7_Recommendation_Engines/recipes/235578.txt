Ingredients:
1 tablespoon minced shallot
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 cup cider vinegar
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup apple juice
1/4 cup orange juice
2 cups fresh cranberries
1 cup chopped tart apple
1/4 cup raisins
1 whole fresh Thai chile pepper
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste

Directions:
Slowly heat shallot and garlic in a heavy pot with a lid over very low heat until they release some moisture but not yet browned, about 3 minutes.
Stir cider vinegar, brown sugar, apple juice, and orange juice together in the pot with the shallot and garlic; bring to a simmer while stirring to dissolve sugar. Add cranberries, apple, raisins, chile pepper, ginger, cloves, cinnamon, and salt to the simmering liquid; stir.
Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the mixture thickens and the cranberries are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove and discard the chile pepper. Add salt to preference.
