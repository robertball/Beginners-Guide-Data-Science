Ingredients:
1 pound pizza dough
½ cup pizza sauce (plus more for dipping)
1 cup shredded mozzarella
16 slices pepperoni

Directions:
Roll out pizza dough to ½ inch thick. Using a 2-inch circle cutter, cut 16 circles out of dough.
Press each circle out until each is approximately 3 inches across. Spoon 1 teaspoon pizza sauce in center of 8 rounds, then top with 2 teaspoons shredded cheese and one pepperoni slice. Top with remaining dough rounds, pressing around edges to adhere.
Place rounds onto preheated waffle iron (as many as your waffle iron can comfortably fit at a time). Cook until lightly browned. Do not remove from waffle iron yet.
Top each “round” (they won’t be round anymore at this point) with another pepperoni slice and a little more cheese. Close waffle iron and cook for another minute or so.
Serve immediately with extra pizza sauce for dipping.

Description: 
Pizza made in the waffle iron! It's so fun to make and perfect for a busy weeknight or quick snack. I use pre-made pizza dough but your favorite homemade recipe will work just fine. Add more cheese and pepperoni if you like, it's a very versatile recipe (plus the crispy, cheesy bits are my favorite). I hope you enjoy it!
