Ingredients:
2 apples (not too sweet)
1 cup raw pumpkin
2-3 tbs raisins
lemon juice
salt and pepper

Directions:
Put the raisins in hot water and let them soften (I usually do this in the morning so that it goes faster when I prepare the salad for dinner, but 30 min. to one hour should be enough)
Grate the apple and the pumpkin in a food processor and add lemon juice straight away so that it doesn't become brown
Add the raisins and salt and pepper.

A very refreshing salad, easy and fast to make! The taste of the raw pumpkin is a nice change from the usual pumkin soup or pie. Healthy, low-calorie and full of vitamins
