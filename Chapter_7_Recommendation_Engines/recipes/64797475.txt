Ingredients:
8 ounces firm tofu, drained and pressed
1/3 fine bread crumbs
1 tbsp taco seasoning
2 eggs
Vegetable oil spray

Directions:
Cut the tofu lengthwise into two slabs. Cut each slab into two triangles.
Mix together the bread crumbs and taco seasoning in a shallow pan or plate.
In a separate shallow pan or plate, lightly beat the two eggs.
Heat an air fryer to 190Â°C.
Coat each tofu triangle with the egg. Dredge them in the bread crumb mixture. Gently press down to coat each side. Arrange in a single layer on a plate. Spray lightly with vegetable oil. Cook in the air fryer on one side for 15 minutes. Flip each triangle, spray lightly with vegetable oil. Cook for another 10 minutes or until browned. You may need to cook in batches, depending on the size of your air fryer basket.
Remove and serve.
