Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 yellow onions, chopped
1 green bell pepper, seeded and minced
1 red bell pepper, seeded and minced
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/3 pounds ground turkey
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons dried oregano
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons seasoned salt
1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, liquid drained and reserved
1 (15 ounce) can red chili beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
3/4 cup light beer (such as Miller Lite®)
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon hickory-flavored liquid smoke
1/2 cup low-sodium tomato juice
2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onions, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and garlic in hot oil until the onion is translucent, 7 to 10 minutes.
Crumble ground turkey into small pieces and add to the pot. Place a cover on the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until turkey is cooked through and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
Season turkey with chili powder, oregano, paprika, cumin, seasoned salt, red pepper flakes, ground black pepper, and cocoa powder. Add diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, red chili beans, black beans, tomato paste, light beer, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, and tomato juice to the pot. Loosely cover the pot and cook mixture at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened but still moist, for about 1 hour. Stir reserved liquid from diced tomatoes with green chilies into chili as it simmers to keep it from becoming too dry.
Stir hot pepper sauce through the chili. Reduce heat to low and cook another 10 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving.

Description: 
I love a spicy and thick chili during fall and winter months; this recipe (made with ground turkey) kicks butt! The cocoa powder is the secret ingredient! Works best to have all your ingredients chopped drained and ready before you start, as it thickens up pretty fast over the heat.
