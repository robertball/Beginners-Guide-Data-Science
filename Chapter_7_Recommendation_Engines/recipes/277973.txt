1/2 cup plain skyr (Icelandic yogurt)
1/4 cup grated fresh coconut, divided

Directions:
Combine the banana, apple, and pear in an electric blender. Add ice cubes, skyr, all but one big spoonful of coconut, and spirulina.
Remove 3 or 4 balls of dragon fruit using a fruit baller, then add the remaining dragon fruit to the blender. Blend until smooth. Pour into a bowl. Top with reserved dragon fruit balls and remaining coconut.

Description: 
This smoothie bowl is inspired by my favorite Christmas cartoon, “The Year Without Santa Claus”. One of my favorite parts was Snow Miser. Here I made pears, banana, apple, and skyr mixed with blue spirulina, then topped it with dragon fruit and grated fresh coconut. I wanted to make a smoothie bowl that looked like Snow Miser's blue face and speckled white hair. He's too much!
