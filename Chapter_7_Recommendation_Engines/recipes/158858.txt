Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups cake flour
3 3/4 cups bread flour
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/4 cups cold butter, cut into tablespoon-sized pieces
1 1/4 cups cold water
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the cake flour, bread flour, salt and white sugar.  Stir in the chunks of butter so that each one is completely coated in flour. Combine the cold water and lemon juice; stir into the bowl while lightly tossing the ingredients to moisten them evenly. Gather the dough into a ball.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Keep the edges as square as possible. The dough will look terrible, but don't worry, it will shape up. Fold the dough into thirds like a business letter, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Place the dough on the floured work surface and turn at a 90 degree angle from the last time you rolled it out. Roll again into a rectangle again and fold into thirds. If the dough is still cold and manageable, rotate and roll again, then fold into thirds, or refrigerate and continue in 30 minutes. Finish by rolling the dough out to the size of a baking sheet. Place on a lightly floured baking sheet and wrap in plastic. refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.
To use, roll out dough to 1/4 inch thickness and cut into shapes with a sharp knife. Use as directed in recipes calling for puff pastry, or alternatively, enclose desired fillings and bake in a preheated 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) oven until puffed and golden brown.

Description: 
Classical puff pastry has close to a thousand separate layers of butter and dough. Blitz puff pastry doesn't puff as high, but it sure is easier to make at home!
