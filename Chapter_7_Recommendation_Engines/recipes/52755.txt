Ingredients:
1 teaspoon curry powder, or to taste
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 cup chicken broth
½ cup water
½ cup white wine
1 cup long-grain white rice
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 cup diced mango

Directions:
Combine curry powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper.  Rub mixture into chicken breasts. Set aside.
In a large, non-stick skillet, combine chicken broth, water, and wine with rice. Stir in brown sugar, dried parsley, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Stir in mango. Arrange chicken pieces on top of rice, and bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat.
Let stand, covered, until all liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Mango and curry go very well together - the sweetness of the mango is a nice counterpoint to the spice of the curry.
