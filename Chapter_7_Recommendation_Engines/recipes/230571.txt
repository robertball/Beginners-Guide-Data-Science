Ingredients:
6 large pears, peeled and sliced
1 lemon, juiced
2/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1 (9 inch) unbaked single pie crust
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Sprinkle pears with lemon juice in a bowl. Mix white sugar and nutmeg in a separate small bowl; sprinkle over pears and mix thoroughly.
Fit pie crust into the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish. Cut butter, brown sugar, and flour together in a bowl using a pastry cutter until mixture resembles crumbs. Spoon pear mixture into pie shell and sprinkle top with brown sugar mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until filling is bubbling and crumble topping is lightly browned, about 35 more minutes.

Description: 
This is one of my family's greatest recipes. It is about 30 times better than apple pie, especially if you use fresh nutmeg. You can certainly substitute the pears for peaches too, if they're in season. Let cool or serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
