Back-Burner Ratatouille Recipe

Ingredients:
1 28oz can diced tomatoes UNDRAINED (seasoned or not- your preference)
2-3 zucchini, scrubbed and cut in a 1/2" dice
2-3 yellow squash, same treatment
1 medium eggplant, same treatment
1 medium or small onion, diced finely, OR dehydrated minced onion
Dried Italian seasoning or dried basil
Salt, black pepper, and garlic powder
1 tsp tomato paste (optional)
Good, fruity, extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
In a 3- or 4-quart saucepan or Dutch oven on a medium-low flame, empty the entire can of tomatoes, with the liquid.
Add all the diced vegetables and sprinkle salt over everything. Stir once.
Once you see the vegetables starting to cook down, stir again and add the dried seasonings to taste.
If you don't have room for all the vegetables initially, you can add them in batches as they cook down.
There are several ways to proceed, depending on the time you have:
You can cook uncovered on medium-high, stirring often to prevent burning, until all vegetables are soft. This will take under an hour.
OR, you can slow-cook, covered, on a low flame, for a much longer time, and stirring less often.
Once the vegetables are soft, stir in the tomato paste and readjust the seasoning.
Cook on high for a few minutes to incorporate the tomato paste and to reduce the liquid. Reduce the liquid as much as desired, taking care not to burn the bottom of the pot.
Turn off heat and finish with a few tablespoons of the olive oil.
