Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter
1/3 cup unpasteurized manuka honey
1 tsp real vanilla extract
1 cup mashed bananas
1 3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 tsp fleur de sel
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 cup hot water
1/4 cup dark chocolate chunks
1/8 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
1. Beat butter (at room temperature) with honey until well combined. Add bananas and vanilla.
2. In a separate bowl, combine flour with the fleur de sel, baking soda, and baking powder. Add to banana honey mixture.
3. Whisk in hot water, then fold in chocolate and walnuts. Pour into one greased loaf pan.
4. Bake at 325F for approximately 45 minutes, until a knife inserted in the middle of the loaf comes out relatively clean. Be sure to watch for browning, as the honey will caramelize quickly.
