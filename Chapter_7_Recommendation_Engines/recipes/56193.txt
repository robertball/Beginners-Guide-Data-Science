Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground sage
1 teaspoon Creole seasoning
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
4 (1/2 inch thick) boneless pork chops
2 teaspoons olive oil

Directions:
Place flour, paprika, sage, Creole seasoning, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and garlic powder in a large, resealable plastic bag. Place pork chops in the bag, seal, and shake to coat chops.
In a large skillet, heat oil over high heat for about 1 minute.  Arrange chops in pan, and reduce heat to medium.  Cook until pork chops are dark brown, about 6 to 8 minutes per side.

Description: 
My family loves these spicy, fried pork chops.  Quick and easy to make!  I've used bone-in pork steaks instead, and just increased cooking time per side a couple of minutes
