Beef and Bean Chimichangas Recipe

Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
3/4 cup chopped onion
3/4 cup diced green bell pepper
1 1/2 cups whole kernel corn
1 packet of taco seasoning
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
8 (12 inch) flour tortillas
1 (16 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese
2 tablespoons butter, melted
shredded lettuce
1 tomato, diced
sour cream

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Brown the ground beef in a skillet over medium-high heat. Drain excess grease, and add the onion, bell pepper, and corn. Cook for about 5 more minutes, or until vegetables are tender. Stir in the taco seasoning until blended. Cook until heated through, then remove from heat, and set aside.
Open the can of beans, and spread a thin layer of beans onto each of the tortillas. Spoon the beef mixture down the center, and then top with as much shredded cheese as you like. Roll up the tortillas, and place them seam-side down onto a baking sheet. Brush the tortillas with 1/2 the melted butter.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. 15 minutes into baking flip the chimichangas and baste with the rest of the melted butter. Serve with lettuce, tomato and sour cream.
