Ingredients:
2 cups crushed graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup white sugar
6 Tablespoons melted butter
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 and 1/4 pounds (4 1/2 pkgs) softened cream cheese
1 2/3 cups white sugar
5 eggs at room temperature
1 cup Bailey's Irish Cream
1 Tablespoon vanilla
1 cup chilled whipping cream
2 Tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon instant coffee granules

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Combine graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar and melted butter in a 9 inch spring form pan. Press on the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of the pan. Bake in oven for 7 minutes.
Remove crust from oven and let cool while making the filling. In bowl beat cream cheese until smooth. Add 1 2/3 cups sugar, eggs, Bailey's and vanilla each ingredient at a time to cream cheese. Beat until combined, but don't over beat.
Sprinkle 1/2 cup chocolate chips over the cooled graham cracker crust, spoon the cream cheese filling over the chocolate chips and then sprinkle with other 1/2 cups of chips. Bake 1 hour and 20 minutes until puffed and springy in the center and golden brown. Remove from oven. Cool completely and remove sides from the pan.
Beat 1 cup of chilled whipping cream until soft peaks form, add 2 tablespoons of sugar and instant coffee granules. Continue beating until cream is firm enough to hold its shape. Spread on top of cooled cheesecake.
