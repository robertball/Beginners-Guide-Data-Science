Ingredients:
Marinade:
1/3 cup strawberry preserves
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound skin-on salmon fillets
Strawberry-Pineapple Salsa:
1 cup chopped fresh strawberries
1 cup chopped fresh pineapple
1/3 cup chopped sweet onion (such as Vidalia)
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, or to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Mix strawberry preserves, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, sesame oil, garlic powder, onion powder, ginger, and pepper together in a bowl to make marinade. Pour 1/3 cup into a glass measuring cup; reserve. Place salmon fillets in the bowl.
Marinate salmon in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Mix strawberries, pineapple, onion, and parsley in a bowl to make salsa. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Oil a stainless steel grill basket. Place salmon fillets skin-side up in the basket; cook for 6 minutes. Flip and continue cooking skin-side down, about 6 minutes more.
Divide salmon fillets among serving plates; drizzle reserved 1/3 cup marinade on top. Spoon salsa on top.

Description: 
My inspiration for this splendid recipe came from a dish on the menu at LonghornÂ® Steakhouse. I've guessed how it's made and decided to add strawberries to the salsa, but I am sure it will be fine with just pineapples. Strawberry preserves serve as the marinade base, mixed with soy, vinegar, and sesame oil.
