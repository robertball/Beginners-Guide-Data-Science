Ingredients:
1/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Sift and whisk sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt together in a saucepan.
Heat saucepan over medium heat. Pour milk in slowly, whisking constantly until incorporated. Cook, stirring often with a metal spoon, until pudding is noticeably thicker and clings to the spoon, about 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Divide between 4 small bowls and serve immediately, or chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.

Description: 
A rich, silky homemade chocolate pudding made the same way in our family since the 50's. Cooled pudding will form a dark skin on top, which is our favorite part! Top with whipped cream, if desired.
