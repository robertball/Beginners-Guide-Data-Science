Description: 
I create this recipe for my birthday after receiving a bottle of Tito's® Vodka. It's like drinking liquid crystal. The sugar doesn't quite dissolve so at the bottom of your glass you get a little slurry of sugar and martini. It's the frosting on the cake! Slurp to your hearts content!
