Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 1/2 pounds boneless beef round steak (about 1-inch thick), cut into serving-size pieces
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup, undiluted
1 large onion, sliced
1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1 bay leaf

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper. Add beef, a few pieces at a time, and shake to coat. Remove steak from bag; flatten to 3/4-in. thickness.
In a large skillet, brown steak on both sides in oil over medium-high heat. In a bowl, combine tomatoes, tomato soup, onion, marjoram, thyme, paprika, cloves if desired, bay leaf and remaining salt; pour over beef.
Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 hours or until meat is tender. Discard bay leaf.

Description: 
'This is one of my very favorite recipes,' writes Vicky Reinhold from her ranch in Sturgis, South Dakota. 'I've made it countless times over the 45 years I've been married. Our children always asked for it on their birthdays, and it has a wonderful rich flavor...guess that's why we call it 'super'!'
