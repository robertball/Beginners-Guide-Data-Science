1 cup creamy peanut butter

Line 2 large cookie sheets with waxed paper or foil.
In 5-quart heavy Dutch oven, heat corn syrup to boiling over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Stir in peanut butter until melted. Stir in cookie mix until well blended. Cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. (Candy thermometer should read 160 degrees F.)
Immediately remove from heat. With wooden spoon or rubber spatula, gently fold in cereal and peanuts until well coated.
