Ingredients:
2 (1 pound) packages gnocchi (refrigerated, frozen, or vacuum-packed)
1 (19.76 ounce) package JohnsonvilleÂ® Sweet or Mild Italian Sausage links, decased
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 pound snap peas
1 medium red bell pepper, cut in 1/2-inch dice
6 ounces pesto (store-bought or fresh-made)
1/2 cup light cream (or half and half)
1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a large pot, cook the gnocchi according to the package directions. Drain, rinse and return them to the pot.
In a 12" skillet, heat oil over medium heat and saute the snap peas and red peppers until tender, about 4 minutes. Toss into the pot with the reserved cooked gnocchi. In the same skillet, cook and crumble Italian sausage until cooked through about 8-10 minutes. Transfer sausage to the pot with the vegetables and pasta.
Over med-low heat, stir to combine the pasta, vegetables and sausage mixture. Add the pesto and light cream; toss gently to coat all the ingredients. Heat through and serve with freshly grated parmesan cheese.
