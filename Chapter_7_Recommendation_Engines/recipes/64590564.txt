Description: 
I always go to DiFiore's Pasta Shop when I am hungry.  Everything looks amazing and I always go for the cutlets.  Please warm one up for me now and I will take a container full to go!  On this particular Saturday day I was looking at the chicken cutlets and eggplant cutlets and it came to me!  Parmigina Lasagna! I always have homemade sauce in my freezer and a box of no-boil lasagna from DeCecco not to mention my beautiful baking dish from Emile Henry to prepare, bake and serve this delicious dish.

If you don't have sauce handy go ahead and pick some up at DiFiore's!  Or go ahead and make y
