Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 small onion, grated
2 cloves crushed garlic
2 carrots, shredded
1 small summer squash, shredded
1 small zucchini, shredded
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour ( Divided ) 3/4 cups each
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper or Montreal Steak Seasoning
1 tsp paprika

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over low heat, and cook the onion and garlic for about 5 minutes, until tender. Mix in the carrots, squash, and zucchini. Continue to cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat, and mix in oats, 3/4 cup flour, cheese, and egg and spices. Stir in soy sauce, transfer the mixture to a bowl, and refrigerate 1 hour.
Preheat the grill for high heat.
Place the flour on a large plate. Form the vegetable mixture into eight 3 inch round patties. Drop each patty into the flour, lightly coating both sides.
Oil the grill grate, and grill patties 5 minutes on each side, or until heated through and nicely browned.  You can also cook in a heavy skillet until brown on both sides. ( Use the same one you cook the veggies in. )

Description: 
Burgers that taste like hamburgers, but without meat! You can replace the Cheddar cheese with Monterey Jack or any other cheese you like. If you prefer, you may use a 1.4 ounce packet of brown broth in place of the soy sauce.Modified from: Veggie Burgers
