Ingredients:
4 cups cooked white rice (2 cups dry rice if not cooked)
1/2 cup jarred spaghetti sauce, marinara, or other tomato based sauce
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1 small to medium sized tomato, cut into small cubes
1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, cut into strips or 3 tablespoons dried basil leaves
3 tablespoons fresh or dried thyme
3 tablespoons fresh or dried oregano
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 large eggs
Salt, to taste

Directions:
Preheat a large saucepan until water droplets sizzle on the surface of the pan. Crack the 2 eggs into a small bowl and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine cooked white rice and olive oil. Mix with hands until rice is evenly coated. Add to hot saucepan and cook for about 7-10 minutes, until rice is somewhat crispy (but not brown). Stir occasionally.
Add half of your tomato based sauce and cubed tomato to the rice and stir. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. When the tomatoes looked cooked, add cheese, herbs, and the rest of the tomato sauce. Add salt to taste. Stir and remove from heat.
While rice is still hot, add the 2 eggs and stir, mixing it so the eggs are cooked into the rice. Serve while hot.

Description: 
In my family, this is a dinner favorite. It's not true risotto, since it's made with white rice and not cooked in the traditional way, but it tastes just as good! The great thing about this risotto it is that it is super fast to make and can be made with basic ingredients.
