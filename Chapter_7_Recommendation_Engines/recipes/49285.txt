Ingredients:
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger
1 serrano pepper, finely chopped
1 teaspoon caraway seed
1 teaspoon cumin seed
1 teaspoon crushed fennel seed
1 teaspoon black mustard seed
1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
1 teaspoon ground dried turmeric
1/4 teaspoon asafoetida powder
5 cardamom pods
1/2 medium head cabbage, sliced into strips
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup water, or as needed
juice from one lime
1 (12 ounce) can kidney beans, garbanzo beans, or black eyed peas, drained

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.  Sautee the ginger and serrano pepper for about one minute until soft.  Season with caraway, cumin, fennel, mustard, fenugreek, turmeric, and asafoetida; cook until fragrant, about 20 to 30 seconds.  Stir in the cardamom pods and cabbage.  Season with salt and mix well.
Pour in the water and lime juice, bring to a simmer, and cook, covered for 5 minutes.  Pour the beans over the cabbage, cover, and cook an additional 2 minutes to reheat.  Remove the lid and simmer until the liquid is absorbed, about 1 to 2 minutes.
