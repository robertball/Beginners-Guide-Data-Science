Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless salmon fillets
1/4 cup Dijon mustard (such as Grey Poupon®)
2 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Place salmon fillets in a baking pan.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Combine Dijon mustard and honey in bowl. Spread over the salmon fillets.
Broil in the preheated oven until the mustard begins to blacken, about 6 minutes.
Turn fillets over; coat with the honey-mustard mixture from the bottom of the pan.
Return to the oven. Broil until mustard begins to blacken and fish flakes easily, about 6 minutes more.

Description: 
A super-simple yet tasty recipe from a very novice chef. I am a divorced father who is slowly learning to cook for myself. I have 2 teenagers who hate fish, but will often request this! It's so simple that my 14-year-old daughter has been making it herself for almost 5 years! This recipe works best with salmon pieces that are 1/2 to 3/4 pound each. Serve with some wild rice and maybe a salad, and you have a quick and tasty meal. Any brown mustard will work, but I prefer the Grey Poupon® due to the white wine flavor. Just retain the 2:1 mustard-to-honey ratio if making more sauce. The sauce also works well as a marinade if prepared in advance, and also serves well as a salad dressing.
