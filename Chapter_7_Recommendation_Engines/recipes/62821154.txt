Ingredients:
3 cups pureed black beans (I filled up the blender to the 4 cup line and added a little water)
2 cups sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 cup milk
1 1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup cocoa
1 Tbsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
1 cup shredded coconut (unsweetened) (and optional)
2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Grease a 9×13 baking pan with cooking spray.
Puree black beans with a little water.  I went for a “smoothie” like consistency.
Add the sugar to the mixer or mixing bowl and then pour in the pureed black beans.  Mix until smooth, adding the vanilla and milk as it mixes.
Dump in all the dry ingredients, flour, cocoa, powder, soda and salt. (Can you see the reflection of the chocolate chips bag!?)
Mix, mix, mix until nice and smooth.
Toss in the coconut.
And the chocolate chips.
And if a few don’t make it into the bowl and get stuck on the mixing tool, feel free to snack on those.
On the lowest speed, mix in the coconut and chocolate chips for 10-20 seconds.
Pour the brownie batter into the greased pan and bake in the preheated oven for 35-45 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean in the center.  Let cool on a cooling rack before cutting.
Slice and serve to the hungry people, big and little!
