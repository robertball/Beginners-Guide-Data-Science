Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 dash nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 large bananas, very ripe
1/4 cup brown sugar, lightly packed
Scant 1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
1/3 cup melted butter
Optional: 1/4 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin tin.
In a small bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt; set aside.
In a large bowl, combine mashed bananas, sugar, egg, vanilla, and melted butter.
Fold flour mixture into wet ingredients until just combined. Scoop into muffin pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 mins. Muffins will spring back when lightly tapped or when an inserted skewer comes out clean.

Description: 
My staple go-to recipe for overripe bananas! The key to super moist muffins is to mix the batter until only just combined, and not to over bake.
