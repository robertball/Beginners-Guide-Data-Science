Roulades with Sauerkraut (Vogelsberger Rolle) Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
1 large dill pickle
1 ½ pounds pork loin
6 strips thick sliced bacon
¼ cup German stone ground mustard
1 (16 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained
salt and black pepper to taste
3  eggs, beaten
2 cups dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Slice the pickle lengthwise into six wedges. Slice pork loin into six thin, wide pieces and lay onto a baking sheet.
Lay a slice of bacon and a slice of dill pickle on one side of each pork loin slice. Divide the mustard and sauerkraut among the pork loin slices.  Season with salt and pepper; roll up each slice tightly and secure with toothpicks.  Dip each roulade in the beaten egg and then roll in bread crumbs.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat; drizzle in the olive oil. Cook each roulade until they are golden brown, and a thermometer inserted into the center registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 5 to 7 minutes per side. Remove toothpicks before serving.
