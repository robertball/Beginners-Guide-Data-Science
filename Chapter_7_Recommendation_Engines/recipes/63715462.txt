Ingredients:
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 cup whole milk
2 large eggs
3/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup milk chocolate, coarsely chopped
8 crispy oatmeal cookies, cut in eighths (about 1/2 cup)

Directions:
Mix the cream and milk together in a large pot and heat over medium-low heat.
Beat the eggs in a separate bowl, until they turn lighter in color. Slowly add the sugar while continuing to beat.  Mix in cinnamon.
When an instant read thermometer reads 140 when inserted into the cream mixture, remove it from heat. While whisking the egg mixture, slowly add small amounts of the cream/milk mix until about a third of the cream and milk have been added. Pour in the rest of the cream and milk and mix thoroughly.
Return to heat and heat to 175 degrees. Hold for 30 seconds.
Strain and chill until it reaches 40 degrees.
Transfer to an ice cream maker and chill according to manufacturer's directions.
Pre chill a pyrex or corning ware bowl.  Transfer ice cream to the chilled bowl and fold in cookies and chocolate.  Transfer to a pre-chilled container and freeze solid.
