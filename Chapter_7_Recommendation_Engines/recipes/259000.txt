Ingredients:
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup coconut oil
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup almond flour
1/4 cup coconut flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Beat brown sugar, white sugar, butter, and coconut oil together in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and creamy. Add eggs and vanilla extract; beat until just combined.
Combine all-purpose flour, almond flour, coconut flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Whisk to mix evenly. Pour into the butter mixture; stir until well combined. Fold in chocolate chips and nuts. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and edges are set, 10 to 12 minutes.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe when I had a sweet tooth that needed tending to, and I wanted to make it a little healthier than your average cookie. So I replaced some of the flour with coconut and almond flour and used 1/2 cup of coconut oil instead of a whole cup of butter. I use all organic ingredients, but that's up to you. This is our family go-to cookie recipe. We've made it so many different ways and loved them all, but our favorites are semisweet chocolate chips with walnuts, or white chocolate chips with macadamia nuts. It's a win-win with these amazing cookies.
