Ingredients:
5 cups beef or vegetable broth
1 tablespoon butter
1 onion, chopped
1 cup pearl barley
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1 bay leaf
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound mushrooms, sliced
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoons parsley

Directions:
Bring broth to a boil in a saucepan. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, and sauté for 5 minutes. Add the barley, thyme, bay leaf and 2 cups of the hot broth. Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low, and simmer until most of the broth is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Pour in remaining broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring and allowing it to become absorbed before adding more.  This process takes about 50 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil on medium high heat in a large skillet. Sauté mushrooms in the hot oil until tender. Add garlic, and cook for about 2 more minutes. Add the mushrooms and parsley to the barley mixture. Remove bay leaf, and serve.

Description: 
This barley risotto is delicious and charming. It makes a nice side dish for steak or roasted meats. Especially when you want to serve something a little different.  It's also filling enough to be a vegetarian main dish.Modified from: Barley Mushroom Risotto
