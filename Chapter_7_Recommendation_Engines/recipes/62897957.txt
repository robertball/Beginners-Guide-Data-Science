In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Slowly beat in eggs one at a time. Add in greek yogurt, vanilla extract and mix well.
In separate bowl, combine flour, salt, cinnamon and baking soda. Coarsely sift with a wisk.
Fold in mashed bananas, cubed apples and walnuts (optional) . Do not over stir the bananas into the mix, you still want small chunks of banana visible.
Evenly divide batter and pour into the prepared loaf pans.
Crumble topping:
In small bowl, combine brown sugar, white sugar, flour, cinnamon, and butter. Stir until small brown clumps form throughout the bowl.
Sprinkle over batter in the loaf pans.
Garnish with sliced apples and banana pieces.
Baking Instructions:
Place loaf pans in oven for 50 minutes.
Pull out loaf pans and cover with aluminum foal. Slide pans back into oven for another 15-20 minutes.
Check bread regularly with a toothpick. Once the toothpick comes out cleanly the bread is done.
Pull out the bread and let cool.
ENJOY! :)
