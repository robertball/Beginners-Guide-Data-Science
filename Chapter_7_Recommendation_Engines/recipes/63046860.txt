Ingredients:
Ingredients:
1 pound bacon, cooked, drained, crumbled, and divided
2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
2 cups shredded Fontina cheese
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
salt & pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups chopped seeded tomatoes
1 cup shredded Iceberg lettuce
Toasted bread rounds, crackers, or pita chips (I’m crazy about Stacy’s Pita Chips, Parmesan Garlic & Herb)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°. Spray a 11/2-quart baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
Set aside 1/2 cup crumbled bacon.
In a large bowl, combine remaining bacon, cream cheese, shredded cheeses, sour cream, mayonnaise, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Dijon mustard. Spoon mixture into prepared baking dish. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until hot and bubbly. Sprinkle chopped tomatoes, remaining 1/2 cup crumbled bacon, and Iceberg lettuce over hot dip. Serve immediately with toasted bread rounds, crackers, or pita chips.
Slightly adapted from The Dean Brothers.
