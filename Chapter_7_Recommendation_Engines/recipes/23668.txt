Ingredients:
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup LAND O LAKESÂ® Butter
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 (1 ounce) square unsweetened baking chocolate, melted and cooled
2 drops green food color

Directions:
Combine sugar, butter, egg, vanilla and peppermint extract in large mixer bowl.  Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until creamy (2 to 3 minutes).  Reduce speed to low; add flour, baking powder and salt.  Beat until well mixed (1 to 2 minutes).
Remove half of dough.  Add cooled melted chocolate to remaining dough in bowl.  Beat until well mixed (1 minute).  Add green food color to white dough; mix well.  Shape each half into 4x5-inch rectangle; wrap in plastic food wrap.  Refrigerate 1 hour.
Roll out chocolate dough between two sheets of lightly floured waxed paper to 12x7-inch rectangle.  Repeat with green dough.  Place green dough on top of chocolate dough.  Gently press doughs together.  Roll up, jelly-roll fashion, starting with 12-inch side; wrap in plastic food wrap.  Refrigerate until firm (at least 2 hours).
Heat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cut rolls with sharp knife into 1/4-inch slices.  Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets.  Bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until set.  Remove from cookie sheets; cool completely.
