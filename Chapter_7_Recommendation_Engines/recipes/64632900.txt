Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons thousand island dressing
8 strips bacon
2 tablespoons butter
1 pound ground chuck
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 large eggs
4 hamburger buns
4 leaves iceberg lettuce
4 slices cheddar cheese

Directions:
Make spread: In a small bowl, stir together mayonnaise and Thousand Island Dressing.
In a large skillet, fry bacon over medium-high heat until crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate.
Form beef into three equal-sized patties. Using a small glass, cut out the center of each patty to create a donut-shaped burger (combine excess meat to form fourth patty).
Season generously with salt and pepper.
Heat a cast-iron skillet to medium-high heat and melt butter. Add burgers and cook 2 minutes, then flip. Crack an egg into the center of each burger and cook, covered, until whites are set.
Toast buns and place spread on bottom buns.
Build burgers by topping with lettuce, burger, bacon, and Cheddar.
Delish tip: For a cool presentation, slice burgers in half to expose the egg
