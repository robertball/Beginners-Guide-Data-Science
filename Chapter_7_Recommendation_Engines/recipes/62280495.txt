Ingredients:
2 1/4 oz. pkgs. active dry yeast
1/3 cup warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)
5 1/2 to 6 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup warm skim milk (110 degrees to 115 degrees)
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup sugar
6 Tbsp. margarine, softened
1 1/4 tsp. salt
FILLING:
1 1/3 cups golden raisins
1 1/3 cups dark raisins
1 cup water
1/3 cup apple juice or cider
1 Tbsp. ground cinnamon
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add 2 cups flour, milk, eggs, sugar, margarine and salt. Beat on medium for 2 minutes. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a bowl coated with nonstick cooking spray, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. In a saucepan, bring first five filling ingredients to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; cook and stir for 15 minutes or until almost all the liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat; set aside. Punch dough down and knead 1 minute. Divide in half. Roll each half into a 12 x 8 inch rectangle; brush with egg. Spread half of filling over each rectangle to within 1/2 inch of edges. Roll up jelly roll style; pinch to seal. Place each loaf, seam side down, in a greased 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Cover loosely and bake at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes. Yield: 2 loaves (20 slices each).
