1 cup sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add egg and vanilla; mix well. Combine flour and baking powder; gradually add to creamed mixture. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 14-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Spread jam to within 1/2 in. of edges. Sprinkle nuts over jam. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight.
Unwrap and cut into 1/4-in. slices. Place 1 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.
