Ingredients:
1 tablespoon Market Pantry™ vegetable oil
1 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon Archer Farms™ minced garlic
3 tablespoons Archer Farms™ chili powder
2 teaspoons Archer Farms™ ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons Market Pantry™ Sugar
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 Archer Farms™ rotisserie chicken, shredded
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1/4 cup jalapenos, drained and chopped
2 cups Mexican-style shredded four-cheese blend
10 corn tortillas
Optional toppings: sour cream, diced avocado, shredded lettuce, lime wedges

Directions:
To make enchilada sauce, in a 2-quart saucepan, heat oil over  medium-high heat. Cook onion for 5 minutes or until softened.  Add garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt and sugar, stirring constantly  for 30 seconds. Stir in tomato sauce, reduce heat and simmer for  8 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, make filling in a large mixing bowl. Combine chicken,  cilantro, jalapenos and 11/2 cups cheese. Stir in 1/2 cup enchilada  sauce. Spread 3/4 cup sauce in bottom of microwave-safe 13x9"  baking dish. (If pan won't fit in your microwave use 8" or 9"  square pans.)
Arrange tortillas in single layer on work surface. Scoop about 1/3  cup filling onto center of each tortilla, roll and place seam side  down in sauce-covered pan. Repeat with remaining tortillas and  filling. Pour remaining sauce over enchiladas. Sprinkle remaining  1/2 cup cheese down center of pan of enchiladas. Cover tightly  with plastic wrap.
Microwave enchiladas on high for 2 to 4 minutes until filling is hot  and cheese is melted. Serve with toppings on the side, if desired.
