Ingredients:
2 cups NESTLE® TOLL HOUSE® Semi-Sweet Chocolate Morsels, divided
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups packed light brown sugar
1 cup butter, softened
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
4 large eggs, room temperature
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
PREHEAT oven to 350 degrees F. MICROWAVE 1 1/2 cups morsels in a medium, microwave-safe bowl on HIGH power for 1 minute; stir. Microwave at additional 10 to 20-second intervals, stirring until smooth; cool to room temperature. Combine flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl.
BEAT sugar, butter and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl until creamy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in melted chocolate. Gradually beat in flour mixture alternately with milk. Spoon into well-greased 10-inch Bundt pan.
BAKE for 55 to 65 minutes until wooden pick inserted in cake comes out clean. Cool in pan for 30 minutes. Invert cake onto wire rack to cool completely.
MICROWAVE remaining morsels in a heavy-duty plastic bag on HIGH power for 45 seconds; knead bag to mix. Microwave at additional 10 to 20-second intervals, kneading until smooth. Cut a small hold in corner of bag; squeeze to drizzle over cake.
