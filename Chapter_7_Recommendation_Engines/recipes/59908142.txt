Description: 
Everyone seems to like a little something different in their potato salad. This a basic recipe that simply has bacon, eggs, and potatoes in it.  The original recipe called for a mere 1/4 cup of mayonnaise leaving it dry and starchy so I upped the amount of mayonnaise and added a little vinegar for a bite.  If you like onions in your salad, caramelize them for a little something different.Modified from: Old Fashioned Potato Salad
