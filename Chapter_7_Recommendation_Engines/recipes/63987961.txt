Ingredients:
12 ounces extra-wide egg noodles
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
5 portabella mushrooms, stems removed and sliced into 1/4 in. strips
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 bunch green onions, chopped and divided
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
14 ounces beef broth
8 ounces sour cream
4 ounces fresh goat cheese
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Add the noodles to 4 quarts of unsalted cold water in a 6-quart pot, cover and place over high heat. Cook to al dente, 18 to 22 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Melt the butter in pan over medium-high heat. Increase the heat to high, add the mushrooms and sprinkle with salt. Saute until they darken, 5 to 6 minutes. Add half of the green onions and saute 2 to 3 minutes.
Sprinkle in the flour and stir to combine. Cook about 1 minute. Add the beef broth and bring to a simmer. Decrease the heat to medium-low and cook for 10 to 12 minutes. Add the sour cream, goat cheese and black pepper, stirring to combine. Partially cover and bring to a simmer for 2 to 4 minutes.
Drain the noodles, add to the pan and stir to combine, making sure to get noodles covered in sauce. Garnish with the remaining green onions and additional black pepper. Serve immediately.
