Ingredients:
5 medium zucchini
4 ounces blue cheese, crumbled
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 pint cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced

Directions:
Cut zucchini into 3/4-in. slices. Using a melon baller or small spoon, scoop out the insides and discard, leaving the bottom intact.  Place zucchini on an ungreased baking sheet; spoon 1/2 teaspoon crumbled blue cheese into each. Combine Parmesan cheese, basil and pepper; sprinkle half over blue cheese. Top each with a tomato slice; sprinkle with remaining Parmesan mixture. Bake at 400 degrees F for 5-7 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve warm.
