Vietnamese Pho Ga (Chicken) Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package 1/4-inch thick dried rice noodles
1 whole chicken
1 (2 inch) piece peeled ginger
2  whole star anise
Â½ teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG) (optional)
2 teaspoons salt
water to cover

Directions:
Cover noodles with cold water; set aside to soak, about 30 minutes.
Place chicken, ginger, star anise, and monosodium glutamate in a large pot. Sprinkle with salt and cover with water. Cook over medium heat until juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Remove chicken from pot and cool until easily handled, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove skin and shred chicken meat.
Drain noodles. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and divide among serving bowls.
Top noodles with shredded chicken and ladle in broth.

Description: 
Coming from a Vietnamese family, we have to find ways to cook traditional food on the fly and this is a recipe that my mom came up with years ago. Serve with your choice of garnishes - bean sprouts, Thai basil, chiles, etc. You can also make this kho - which is dry in Vietnamese - essentially putting the broth on the side and serving the noodles with the sauce recipe.
