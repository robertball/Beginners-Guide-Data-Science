Ingredients:
6 large eggs
4 slices thick-cut bacon, rough chopped
3 T. sour cream
1/2 tsp. yellow mustard
1/2 c. finely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 tsp. onion powder

Directions:
Place eggs in bottom of sauce pan and cover with cold water, keeping an inch of water above the eggs.  Bring to a rolling boil and cover the pan.  Remove from heat, keep covered and let eggs rest in the hot water for 12 minutes.  In a nonstick pan, saute the bacon over medium high heat until crispy.  Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and mince until crumb-like.  Drain the eggs and place them in a bowl under cold running water for 3 minutes.  Peel and slice in half lengthwise.  Separate the yolks from the whites.  Place yolks in a medium-size mixing bowl, smash them with a fork and stir in the sour cream and mustard.  Mix until smooth.  Add the bacon, cheese and onion powder to the yolk mixture, stirring to fully incorporate.  Fill each egg white half with mixture.  Refrigerate until ready to serve
