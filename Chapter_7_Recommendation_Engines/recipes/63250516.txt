Ingredients:
3/4 pound sweet Italian loose sausage
16 ounces  Chicken Broth (regular or Certified Organic)
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 medium carrots, chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 onion, chopped
4 ounces dried pinto beans
4 ounces dried navy beans
4 ounces dry kidney bean
6 sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained and thinly sliced
Grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook the sausage in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until it's well browned, stirring frequently to separate meat. Pour off fat. Saute vegetables - onion until, add carrots and celery. Empty the sausage into the pot, be sure to leave the "bits" in as you go as this adds to the flavor. Add to a large slow cooker or large soup pot. This will not fit in a Dutch Oven or similar sized pot - they're too small. Cover and cook on HIGH for 5 to 6 hours. Cook on low for another 4 to 6 hours, drain, chop and stir in the tomatoes during the last hour or until the beans are tender. Sprinkle with the cheese.
