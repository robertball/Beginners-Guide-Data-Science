Ingredients:
MIX:
4 1/2 cups warm water
1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar
4 1/2 tablespoons yeast, I use SAF
WHEN YEAST IS "FOAMY" STIR IN:
1 cup honey
1 cup light olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons salt
3 1/3 cups quick oats, Optional
KNEAD IN FLOUR:
12   cups freshly ground white wheat flour, Can use 3 cups bread flour for white bread

Directions:
Knead 10 minutes to develop the gluten.  The dough should be elastic, but is is a soft and somewhat sticky dough.  Grease five bread pans with PAM spray (or cookie sheets for rolls or longk skinny loaves.  Shape loaves (or rolls) with a little flour and place in pans.  Let rise until almost doubled in size -- about 20-40 minutes.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 24 minutes for wheat loaves, 27 minutes for white loaves, 11-14 minutes for small rolls.  Cook whole wheat bread until just BEFORE it looks done;  cook white bread a couple of minutes beyond looking done.  Cool on racks and stroe in bread bags.  Freeze what you won't use within 24 hours.
