Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground turkey
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1/3 cup chopped water chestnuts
2 tablespoons chopped green bell pepper (optional)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon cold water
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix ground turkey, onion, water chestnuts, bell pepper, garlic, parsley, soy sauce, water, ginger, salt, and pepper in a bowl; shape into 4 patties.
Cook the turkey burgers on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
This recipe has wonderful flavor and the water chestnuts give it great texture. My husband loves meat but he'd prefer this over regular hamburgers anyway! Make batches ahead of time and freeze the patties using waxed paper to separate.
