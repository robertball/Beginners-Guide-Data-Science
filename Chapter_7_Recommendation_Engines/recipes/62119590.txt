Ingredients:
-Cake-
1 box of your favorite chocolate cake mix
1 21 oz can cherry pie filling
2 tsp almond extract (can substitute vanilla if desired)
2 eggs
-Icing-
1 cup sugar
4 T (1/4 cup) butter
1/3 cup milk
1 bag semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Pour cake mix in a mixing bowl and smash any lumps.
Add cherry filling, almond extract, and eggs and mix until combined with a wooden spoon.
Pour batter into a greased 9x13 pan and bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes.
After cake is done, melt butter in a saucepan, then add milk and sugar and bring to a boil.
Add chocolate chips until spreading consistency. (I recommend using a whole bag, because it comes out smoother that way)
Spread over cake while still warm.
Try to keep from eating the whole thing yourself!
