Ingredients:
1 lb chicken pieces (or skinless/boneless breasts)
1/2 cup fresh basil
1 1/2 cups cubed sweet potato
2 cups chopped carrots (Or mini sticks)
1 1/2 cups chopped celery
4-5 cloves garlic
1 medium yellow onion
1 teaspoon rosemary
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1 container or 15 oz can chicken broth
*Optional* 2 cups penne pasta or other pasta
6 cups water
salt and pepper as needed

Directions:
Begin by lightly sauteeing the chicken pieces in a large stock pot with olive oil, only to gently brown the outside.
Add 4 cups of water, or just enough to cover the chicken pieces and allow to boil until chicken is tender.
Cool chicken and shred meat off of bones, if boneless cut into smaller pieces.
Add chicken back into broth, add the chicken broth and the rest of the water plus all vegetables and seasonings. Cook for 5-10 minutes.
Add optional pasta to stock pot and cover, simmer for 15-20 minutes until pasta is al dente, make sure to keep an eye on the water levels as the pasta will soak up the stock.
Salt/pepper as needed, and serve with a warm bread or whole wheat crackers.
