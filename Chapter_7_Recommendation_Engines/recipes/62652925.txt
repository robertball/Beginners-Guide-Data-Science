Description: 
This Strawberries Romanoff (Romanov) recipe combines the national fruit of France, the strawberry, with a sauce that is at once light and superb. I eat this every time I stop at my favorite French cafe here in the Dallas area - they charge the earth for it. Save your wallet from tears and make this delicious, light treat at home instead.
