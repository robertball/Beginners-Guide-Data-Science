Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup coconut oil
3 egg yolks
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet lightly.
Beat sugar, butter, and coconut oil together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in egg yolks and vanilla extract. Add flour, baking powder, and baking soda gradually; mix until dough just comes together. Mix dough with hands to fully incorporate ingredients. Roll dough into walnut-size balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookie tops are cracked, 10 to 12 minutes.

Description: 
This is a variation on the sugar cookie using coconut oil. It tastes similar to a shortbread cookie, but they are very moist and delicious. Roll tops of cookies in sugar and/or colored sugar before baking for a festive treat. Cinnamon and sugar works well, too.
