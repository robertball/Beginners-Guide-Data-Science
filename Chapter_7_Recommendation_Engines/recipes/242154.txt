1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish sauce

Description: 
A great take on a north Alabama favorite: Big Bob Gibson's white sauce. This may not be exactly like it, but it is about as close as I have been able to get it. You can substitute apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar, if desired.
