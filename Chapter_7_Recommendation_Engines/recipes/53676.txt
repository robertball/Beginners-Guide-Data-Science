Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 cup barbeque sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
4 slices Monterey Jack cheese
8 slices sourdough bread, toasted
4 lettuce leaves
4 slices tomato

Directions:
Preheat a grill for medium heat. When hot, lightly oil the grate.
In a medium bowl, lightly mix together the ground beef, barbeque sauce and garlic powder. Separate into 4 portions and flatten into patties.
Grill the burgers for about 8 minutes per side, or until well done. Place a slice of cheese on top of each burger and allow it to melt for a minute. Press chopped cilantro into the melted cheese on each burger. Serve burgers on toasted sourdough bread topped with lettuce and tomato. Feel free to use other condiments to your liking.
