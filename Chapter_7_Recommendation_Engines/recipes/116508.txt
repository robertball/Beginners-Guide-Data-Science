Ingredients:
6 cups water
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
3 cups uncooked long grain rice
2 tablespoons dried parsley flakes
1 tablespoon dill weed, divided
2 teaspoons celery salt, divided
1 cup diced carrots
1 cup diced fresh tomato
1 cup diced green pepper
1 cup diced onion
1 cup diced celery
1/4 cup diced hot banana peppers or hot peppers of your choice
2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted
1/2 cup milk
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In a large saucepan, bring water and butter to a boil; add rice. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. Stir in the parsley, 2 teaspoons dill and 1 teaspoon celery salt; set aside.
In a skillet, saute carrots, tomato, green pepper, onion, celery and hot peppers in oil until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in soup, milk, basil, thyme, pepper and remaining dill and celery salt. Divide half of the rice mixture between two greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dishes. Top with vegetable mixture and remaining rice mixture. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes or until heated through.
