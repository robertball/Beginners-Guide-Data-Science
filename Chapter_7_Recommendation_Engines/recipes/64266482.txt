Ingredients:
4 eggs, separated, at room temperature
1 Tbsp water
1/2 cup + 2 Tablespoons (5.3 oz, 150 g) sugar
1 stick (125 g) butter, melted
3/4 cup (4 oz, 115 g) flour
2 cups (500 ml) milk, lukewarm
2 tsp vanilla extract
Powdered Sugar

Directions:
Mix egg whites until stiff.
In another bowl, beat the egg yolks with the sugar, water and vanilla until light. Add melted butter and continue beating for another minute. Then add the flour and mix it in.
Add the milk (it has to be lukewarm, otherwise the butter will harden) and beat until well incorporated.
Gently fold in beaten egg whites using a spatula.
Pour batter into a greased 8 inch x 8 inch (20 x 20 cm) baking dish and bake in preheated 325 F oven for about 60 minutes or until the top is golden.
Cool in the pan for at least 3 hours. Serve sprinkled with powdered sugar.

Description: 
The magic of this cake is in the fact that you make only one batter and, after baking, you get a cake with 3 distinct layers: dense one on the bottom, custard-like layer in the middle, and a fluffy sponge cake layer on top. It has wonderful vanilla flavor and simply melts in your mouth.
