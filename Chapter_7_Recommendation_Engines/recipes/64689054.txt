Description: 
Sometimes you just need something quick and easy yet hearty and delicious. This “old school” pot roast fits the bill perfectly.  The basic recipe came from my husbands aunt who didn’t really love to cook. She used only the beef plus 2 ingredients.  I added a few more to make this a really tasty yet still simple recipe anyone can make.  Delicious served with mashed potatoes and your favorite veggies.
