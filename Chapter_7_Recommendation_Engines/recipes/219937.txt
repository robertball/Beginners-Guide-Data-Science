Ingredients:
2 quarts water
1/2 cup distilled white vinegar
10 large eggs
1/4 cup mayonnaise
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard, smooth style
2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish juice
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1 1/2 tablespoons real bacon bits
1 pinch paprika, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring water to a boil over high heat and stir in the vinegar. Carefully lower the eggs into the boiling water.
Return eggs to a boil over medium heat and boil for 15 minutes.
Transfer the eggs to a colander set in the sink, and run cold water over the eggs for about 5 minutes to chill.
Peel the eggs under a light stream of cold water and set aside in cold water to finish chilling, about 10 minutes.
Slice the eggs lengthwise; scoop the egg yolks into a bowl.
Mash the egg yolks with a fork, then stir in the mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon at a time, until smooth; stir in the Dijon mustard.
Mix in sweet pickle relish juice, onion powder, and bacon bits; stir with the fork until the yolk mixture is thoroughly combined.
Fill each egg white half with the yolk mixture using a spoon.
Dust the deviled eggs with paprika and transfer to a platter.
Cover the platter with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold and the flavors have blended, at least 1 hour.
