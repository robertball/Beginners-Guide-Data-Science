Ingredients:
1 pound whole wheat fettuccine
8 ounces zucchini, cut into thin strips with a vegetable peeler
2 tablespoons butter
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Lightly cook zucchini by tossing into pasta water just before draining.
Heat butter and garlic in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in cream and simmer for 5 minutes, then add cheese and whisk quickly, heating through. Stir in parsley.
Toss sauce with cooked whole wheat fettuccine and zucchini strips.
