Ingredients:
11 Tbsp unsalted butter, cut up
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
6 Tbsp sugar
6 Tbsp packed light brown sugar
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 cup mini chocolate chips
1/2 cup turbinado sugar, such as Sugar in the Raw*
1 tsp coarse sea salt
1 egg white, lightly beaten

Directions:
Heat butter in large skillet over medium heat 6-9 minutes or until milk solids on bottom are dark chocolate brown.  Pour into large, wide bowl; freeze for 15-20 mins or until the consistency of softened butter.
Whisk flour, baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt in medium bowl.
Beat chilled butter in large bowl at medium speed 30 seconds or until smooth.  Beat in sugar and brown sugar 1 min or until combined.  At low speed, beat in eggs and vanilla until smooth.  Beat in flour mixture just until blended.  Stir in chocolate chips.
Divide dough in half; shape each half into a 8x2" log.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Combine turniado sugar and sea salt in small bowl; spread on baking sheet (or sheet of waxed paper).  Lightly brush each dough log with egg white; roll in turbinado sugar mixture to completly coat outside.  Cut each log into 24 slices (approx 1/4" slices); place 2 inches apart on parchment paper-lined baking sheets.
Bake 10-12 minutes or until pale golden brown around edges, but still soft in the center.  Cool on baking sheets on wire rack 3 minutes.  Remove cookies; cool completely.
