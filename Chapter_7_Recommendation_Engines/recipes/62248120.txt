Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups half and half
1 1/2 cups coconut milk
2 eggs
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup flaked coconut
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (9 inch) pie shell baked
MERINGUE
3 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
6 tablespoons sugar
1/2 cup flaked coconut

Directions:
In medium saucepan combine half and half, coconut milk, eggs, sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Bring to a boil over low heat, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in 3/4 cup coconut and the vanilla. Pour hot custard into pie shell.
For meringue, in a small mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, on high until stiff glossy peaks form and sugar is dissolved. Spread evenly over pie filling, sealing edges to crust. Sprinkle with flaked coconut.
Bake at 350F for 12 to 15 min. or until the meringue is golden. Cool on wire rack for 1 hour. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving.

Description: 
This is a pie that was created for our daughters birthday. She loved her grandmothers coconut cream pie. We did not have the exact recipe so we came up with this.
