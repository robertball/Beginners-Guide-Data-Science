Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup shortening
1 egg
2/3 cup milk

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cream of tartar. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles fine crumbs. In a small bowl, beat egg and milk; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; roll to 1/2-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.

Description: 
When I got married, I made sure to copy this recipe of my mom's. I'm glad I did...it's become one of my husband's favorites. We especially like to eat them smothered with homemade country sausage gravy.
