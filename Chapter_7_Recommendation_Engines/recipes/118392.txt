Description: 
'A co-worker gave me this recipe, but I didn't try it until recently. What a mistake it was to wait! It's easier than dipping, coating and frying...and the flavor is outstanding,' notes Heidi Kirsch of Waterloo, Iowa. 'Once you've tried this tender fish, you'll never go back to fried.'
