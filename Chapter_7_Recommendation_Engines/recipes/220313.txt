Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (14 ounce) can spinach, drained
1  egg
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons milk
1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Grease a baking sheet.
Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a uniform thickness of 1 inch.
Heat spinach in a saucepan over medium-high heat.
Whisk eggs, Parmesan cheese, and milk together in a bowl.
Stir egg mixture into the spinach; cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Spread about 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of the spinach mixture onto each pounded chicken breast.
Roll each breast into a cylinder shape, secure ends with toothpicks, and arrange on the prepared baking sheet.
Sprinkle bread crumbs atop rolled chicken.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 45 minutes. Allow chicken to rest for several minutes before removing toothpicks and serving.
