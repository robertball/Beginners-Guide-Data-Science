Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
8 large flour tortillas
1/4 cup cinnamon sugar, or as needed
1/2 cup sliced green grapes, or to taste
1/2 cup minced fresh strawberries, or to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat cream cheese, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and ground cinnamon together in a bowl until smooth.
Cut 3-inch circles out of each tortilla using a round cookie cutter. Fold tortilla rounds into a taco-shell shape.
Hold folded tortilla with tongs and cook in the preheated oil until the taco shape holds and tortilla is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer cooked tortilla to a paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining tortilla rounds.
Sprinkle cinnamon sugar over cooked tortilla rounds. Spread cream cheese mixture into each shell; top with grapes and strawberries.

Description: 
I made these on a whim while trying to clean out my refrigerator. Ended up with this gem! Would be great at a shower or any other get-together where you are serving finger-foods. Also, would be a great dessert on your family taco night.
