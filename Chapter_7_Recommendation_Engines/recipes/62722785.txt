Ingredients:
4 med-sm, red-ripe round tomatoes (about 1 1/2 #)
1 med onion, cut in half
3-4 jalapenos, stemmed
4 garlic cloves
Salt

Directions:
Charring the ingred: Should be done on charcoal fire. Lay tomatoes, onion halves, jalapenos and garlic on a heated perforated grill pan. Grill the ingred., turning occ. until well charred-about 10 min. for the garlic, 15 min for the chiles and 20 min for the tomatoes and onions. As they are done remove the ingredients to a rimmed baking sheet. Let cool. Peel garlic. If you wish, you can pull the charred skins off the tomatoes.
Finishing the salsa: In food processor, combine garlic and chiles. Pulse until coarsely pureed. Add tomatoes and any juices that have collected on the baking sheet, and pulse until roughly chopped. Chop the charred onion and place in bowl. Stir tomato mixture, along with a little water (usually about 2 T), to give salsa an easily spoonable consistency. Taste and season with salt, usually about 1 t.
