Ingredients:
4 large baking potatoes
8 slices bacon, fried and crumbled (or Real Bacon pieces)
1 cup sour cream (or plain Greek yogurt)
1/2 cup milk
4 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
8 green onions, sliced, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake potatoes in preheated oven for 1 hour.
When potatoes are done, allow them to cool for 10 minutes.  Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a large bowl; save skins. Use potato masher to mash flesh or, for creamier texture, mix with hand mixer. Stir in sour cream/yogurt, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese and 1/2 the green onions until well blended. Spoon the mixture into the potato skins.  Top each with remaining cheese, green onions and bacon.
Bake for another 15 minutes.
