Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
2/3 cup ricotta cheese
2 teaspoon garlic powder
4 teaspoons dried dill weed
4 tablespoons melted butter
1/8 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons onions, minced
2/3 cup crushed fine seasoned croutons
1/3 cup parmessean cheese
1/4 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
TO MAKE FILLING:  In a large bowl beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the ricotta cheese, dill weed, garlic powder, pepper and onion. Beat until smooth and creamy.
Cut open chicken breasts with one small opening, but cut the entire breast inside in half.
Put a dollop of 1/8 of the filling in each breast.   Push with the back of a spoon to force it it.   Then "staple" the opening shut using two toothpicks.
Combine crushed croutons and parmessean cheese.
Roll each breast in melted butter and then roll in crouton/parmessean mixture.
Place in baking pan and dob remaining cheese mixture around the breaded breasts.
Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 30 minutes or until the juices run clear and chicken reaches 180 degrees.
After you remove the breasts from the pan, add milk and whisk with remaining cheese mixture until it becomes smooth.   Serve this mixture over fettucini pasta.
