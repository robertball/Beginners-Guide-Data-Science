Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
salt
2 eggs
1 egg shell half of water

Directions:
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt.  Pour out on counter and make a well in the center.  Add egg and water and mix from the center keeping in the shape of a well until all flour is incorporated.
Turn dough onto floured surface and knead several times.  Roll out about 1/4 inch thick.  Roll loosely and cut "tube" into sections to make noodles.  Toss with flour and separate noodles.  Lay out on counter and cover with a towel several hours or overnight.
Boil noodles in broth and chicken (best using meat and broth left from a whole boiled chicken, not canned).  Cook for about 10 minutes.

I will never be able to make egg noodles like my grandma's, but I'll always keep trying.  They were the best I've ever eaten.
