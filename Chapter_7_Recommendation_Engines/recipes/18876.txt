Ingredients:
6 cups uncooked white rice
1 pound kielbasa sausage
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
2 pounds lean ground beef
1/4 onion, minced
2 (15 ounce) cans kidney beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can pork and beans

Directions:
Prepare the rice in a large pot according to package directions.
Cut the kielbasa into 1-inch chunks and quarter the chunks. Place in a large skillet over medium-high heat for about 5 to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Season with cayenne pepper to taste. Transfer this to the pot with the rice, reserving the grease in the skillet.
In the same skillet over medium-high heat, saute the ground beef for 5 minutes. Stir in the rice, and onion; reduce heat to medium and saute for 5 more minutes. Drain well and add to the pot. Stir the kidney beans, pinto beans, and pork and beans into the pot. Add a little water, if necessary, and simmer over low heat until ready to serve.

Description: 
My current version of a classic recipe here is still a work in progress, but it's a pretty good one. This is a meal in itself, and tastes even better the next day when reheated.
