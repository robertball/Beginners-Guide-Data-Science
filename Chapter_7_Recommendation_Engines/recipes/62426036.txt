Description: 
This recipe is not at all complicated but outstanding! I like using this marinade when I am serving my flank steak with a flavorful sauce, so then it can stand out! I paired this with my Tomatillo Mango Sauce. This picture is the sandwiches we had the next day with the leftover flank steak thinly sliced.
