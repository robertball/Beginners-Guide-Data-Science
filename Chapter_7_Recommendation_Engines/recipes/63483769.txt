Description: 
I love Tomato Soup but could not understand why so many were loaded with calories! It's just Tomatoes! Right? So I came up with the low-cal, low sodium CLEAN version and 1 cup is just under 60 calories! I make a large batch so that I can freeze and store 1 cup portions for a quick meal anytime.
