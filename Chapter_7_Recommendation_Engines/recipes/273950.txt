Ingredients:
4 strips bacon
1 head iceberg lettuce
olive oil, or as needed
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
½  red onion, sliced
½ cup blue cheese dressing

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels and let cool. Chop bacon into bits.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cut the lettuce into 4 wedges. Brush the wedges with olive oil.
Cook lettuce on the preheated grill, cut-side down, about 2 minutes. Turn lettuce and cook until warmed through and slightly charred, 2 minutes more. Discard any wilted leaves.
Place each lettuce wedge on a plate. Top with tomatoes, onion, and bacon. Drizzle on blue cheese dressing and serve.
