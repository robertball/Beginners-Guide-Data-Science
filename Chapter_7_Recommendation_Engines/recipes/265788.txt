Ingredients:
water
2 cups uncooked brown rice
2 green onions, diced, white parts only
1 clove garlic, diced
3 mushrooms, diced
1 large carrot, shredded
1/2 pound cooked Dungeness crab
1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1 tablespoon sesame oil

Directions:
Bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes.
While rice is cooking, heat a skillet over medium heat. Add green onions and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add mushrooms and cook until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add carrots and cook until softened, about 2 minutes more. Add crab and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes more.
Mix soy sauce, maple syrup, and sesame oil to the vegetable mixture in the skillet. Add cooked rice and stir to combine.
