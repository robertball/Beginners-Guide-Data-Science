Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups warm water (110-115 degrees F)
1 T sugar
2 t salt
2 1/4 t instant yeast
4 1/2 cups all purpose flour
2 oz butter, melted
10 cups water
2/3 cup baking soda
2 T melted butter
pretzel salt

Directions:
In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the warm water, sugar, yeast, and salt on low speed for 10 seconds. Switch to the dough hook and add the flour and butter. Mix on low speed until combined. Change to medium and mix until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl (4-5 minutes). Remove from the mixer and put dough into a lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set in a warm place for approximately 1 hour.
Turn the dough out on a lightly oiled work surface and divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll out each piece of dough into a 24 inch rope. Put a damp towel on the pieces you aren't working with to prevent them from drying out. Form the pretzel into a traditional twisted pretzel shape.
Preheat oven to 425. Place pretzels on baking sheets lined with parchment.
Bring the 10 cups of water to a boil and add 2 pretzels at a time- and boil them for 30 secondsm until each pretzel has been boiled. Once back on the baking sheets, brush each pretzel with the melted butter and sprinkle with the pretzel salt. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until desired brownness is reached. Lightly brush each one with a little more melted butter and serve warm.
