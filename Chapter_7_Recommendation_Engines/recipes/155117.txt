Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
6 boneless pork chops
3/4 cup white wine
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Liberally sprinkle the onion soup mix over both sides of the pork chops. Fry the pork chops in the hot oil until the pork is no longer pink in the center, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Remove the chops from the skillet, and set aside.
Pour the white wine into the pan; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Reduce heat to low. Stir the heavy cream, and season with garlic powder and salt and pepper. Gently lay the pork chops in the pan, turning to coat in the sauce. Simmer until thoroughly reheated, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe when I was craving something to remind me of growing up in Georgia. Remember to taste before adding additional salt as the soup mix is pretty salty. Serve over white rice, mashed potatoes, or buttered noodles.
