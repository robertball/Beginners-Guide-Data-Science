Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds dry kidney beans, soaked overnight
1 pound bacon, diced
1 cup brown sugar
1 small onion, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
2 cups water, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place beans in a Dutch oven or large casserole dish. Mix in bacon, brown sugar, and onion; season with salt and pepper. Add just enough water to barely cover the beans.
Cover, and bake for 6 to 8 hours in the preheated oven. Add more water if necessary.

Description: 
This recipe was given to me by my Aunt Joan, who got it from her neighbor.  It is deceptively simple, but so good.  I just took it to a potluck and got rave reviews: 'These beans are awesome!'
