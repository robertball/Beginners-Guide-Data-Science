Ingredients:
4 Thinly sliced boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 Tbsp chopped, fresh rosemary
20 whole cloves garlic, peeled
2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
Olive oil for drizzling
1 Tbsp unsalted butter
1/2 cup chicken stock
1/4 cup white wine for cooking
2 cups fresh baby spinach leaves
Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Place garlic cloves in a small baking dish and drizzle to coat with olive oil. Roast in the oven until slightly golden and soft, about 20-30 minutes. Let cool.
Heat the olive oil in a heavy skillet. Season the chicken with salt & pepper and add it into the skillet.
Add the rosemary and cook over med-high heat about 4-5 minutes per side. Chicken should be lightly browned.
Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside to keep warm.
Stir the wine and stock into the skillet. Cook and stir gently until the liquid is reduced and thickened to a sauce, about 6-8 minutes.
Add in the garlic cloves and continue to cook and stir for 2 minutes.
Return chicken to pan and cook for one minute more.
In a separate pan, melt the butter and then add the spinach leaves. Cook and stir until the spinach just begins to wilt.
Place wilted spinach on 4 individual dinner plates, top with chicken and divide garlic cloves equally.
Spoon the sauce over the chicken and garlic and serve immediately.

Description: 
This dish is inspired by a recent meal I had at a resort restaurant. It is so good and fairly simple to prepare. This goes well served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and a cold green salad.
