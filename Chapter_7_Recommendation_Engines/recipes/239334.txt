Coat the meat completely in flour and saute in the stock pot. Get it good and brown over medium heat. Don't be afraid to get the meat nice and dark.
Once browned, add the vegetables and tomato paste. Mixture should be good and thick. Slowly add the beef stock while stirring the meat till meat is covered with liquid and continue to stir. Add bay leaf.
