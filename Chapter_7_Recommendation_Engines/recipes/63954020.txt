Ingredients:
2 cups raw baby spinach leaves (or 1 cup frozen chopped spinach or collard greens)
2 cups broccoli florets, fresh or frozen
1 cup sweet green peas, frozen
1 tsp. fresh lemon juice
3-4 tbsp. water

Directions:
If using raw spinach, wash it thoroughly.  Place broccoli and spinach in a microwave-safe bowl, cover with water and microwave on high for 8-10 minutes until very tender.  Add the frozen peas for the last minute of cooking.
Once cooked, drain the vegetables and place them in the bowl of your food processor along with 2 tablespoons of water and the lemon juice.  Puree on high until as smooth as possible.  Stop occasionally to push the contents from the top to the bottom.  If necessary, add the rest of the water to make a smooth puree.
Refrigerate for 3 days or freeze in 1/4 cup portions.
