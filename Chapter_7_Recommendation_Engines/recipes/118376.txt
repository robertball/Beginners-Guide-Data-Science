Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
3/4 cup sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup orange juice
2 tablespoons water
1 1/2 teaspoons orange peel
1/8 teaspoon almond extract
1 1/4 cups cake flour
1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
FROSTING:
1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon butter or margarine, softened
1 tablespoon orange juice

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the orange juice, water, orange peel and almond extract; mix well. In another bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt; add to creamed mixture. Beat for 2 minutes. Pour into a greased 8-in. square baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
For the frosting, combine the confectioners' sugar, butter and enough orange juice to achieve spreading consistency. Frost cake.
