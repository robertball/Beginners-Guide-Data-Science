Description: 
My kids love quail eggs.  Even though they taste exactly like hen eggs, they want quail eggs because they are so little and fun.  They challenged me to make an egg salad on a stick and this is what I came up with.  Use whatever ingredients your family likes.  They are healthier than hen eggs.  Typically 5 quail eggs equals one serving.
