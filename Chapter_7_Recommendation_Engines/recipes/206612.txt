Ingredients:
2 tablespoons ground coffee beans
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
2 whole cloves
1/2 (3 inch) cinnamon stick
2 cups water
1/2 cup coconut milk
2 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Combine the ground coffee, red pepper, cloves, and cinnamon stick in a coffee filter set into a drip coffee brewer. Pour the water into the brewer's water reservoir. Set the coffee brewer on to brew.
While the coffee brews, gently warm the coconut milk in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in the honey until the honey is dissolved. Pour the brewed coffee into the mixture; stir. Divide the liquid into two mugs to serve.

Description: 
Don't let the ingredients scare you off. This coffee has a bit of a kick, but it's just right for warming up on those cold winter days. It's easily made in a french press or a regular drip coffee maker. The cinnamon stick can be used more than once. Top with whipped cream and sprinkle with ground cinnamon if desired.
