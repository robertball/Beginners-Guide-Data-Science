Ingredients:
1 c. mayonaise (do NOT substitute Miracle Whip)
1 c. parmesan cheese
14 oz. can quartered artichoke hearts, chopped
Fresh baby spinach (optional)

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients.  Put in a baking dish (I use a glass pie plate) spritzed with non-stick spray.  Bake at 425 degrees until bubbly and just getting toasty brown on the edges (approx 15-20 mins).
Serve with whatever suits your fancy - tortilla chips, crackers, pita triagles, sour dough bread, vegies etc. - it's all good!
