Description: 
A great warm-weather filler-upper.  Chicken is marinated in an Italian dressing, salsa combination with a hint of lime then tossed on the grill.  Cilantro and some tobasco really give it a kick!  I usually marinate the night before so I can just throw them on the grill real quick for parties or gatherings.
