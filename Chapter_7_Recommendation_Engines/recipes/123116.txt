Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 (16 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce
1 (15 ounce) can solid pack pumpkin
3/4 cup chopped pecans
2/3 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
GLAZE:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup orange juice concentrate
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, pie spice, baking soda, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, combine the cranberry sauce, pumpkin, pecans, oil and eggs; stir into dry ingredients and mix well. Pour into two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 65 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to a wire rack to cool completely. Combine glaze ingredients; drizzle over loaves.
