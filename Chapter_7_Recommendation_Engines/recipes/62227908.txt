Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix (use half the amount of oil called for on pkg directions).
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (14 ounce) jar caramel sauce
4 - 5 bars chocolate covered toffee, chopped
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
Chocolate syrup (for decoration)

Directions:
Bake cake according to package directions for a 9x13 inch pan; cool on wire rack for 5 minutes. Make holes in the cake with bottom of wooden spoon.
In a saucepan over low heat, combine sweetened condensed milk and caramel topping, stirring until smooth and blended.  Slowly pour the warm topping mixture over the top of the warm cake, letting it sink into the holes, reserving a small amount for decroation on top; then sprinkle the crushed chocolate toffee bars liberally across the entire cake while still warm.
Let cake cool completely, then top with whipped topping. Decorate the top of the cake with remaining chocolate toffee bar chunks, swirls of caramel topping and stripes of chocolate syrup. Refrigerate and serve right from the pan!
