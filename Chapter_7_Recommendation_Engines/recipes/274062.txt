Ingredients:
Marinade:
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper
1 tablespoon water, or as needed
1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
Sauce:
2 cups water
1 cup shredded coconut
1/4 cup oil
2 curry leaves, or to taste (optional)
4 green chile peppers, chopped
2 medium onion, minced
1 teaspoon ginger paste
1/2 teaspoon garlic paste
2 teaspoons ground coriander
1 1/2 teaspoons sambar powder
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste

Directions:
Combine salt, black pepper, and red pepper in a large bowl. Add water to make a fine paste. Add shrimp and toss, making sure shrimp are well coated. Refrigerate while making the sauce.
Combine water and coconut in a microwave-safe bowl and cook in the microwave oven for 1 hour. Strain and reserve water; discard coconut. Set coconut water aside.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add curry leaf and chile peppers. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add onion and cook until browned, adding water as needed to prevent sticking, 10 to 15 minutes.
Add ginger paste and garlic paste and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Add coriander, sambar powder, and turmeric and stir for 1 minute. Add reserved coconut water and marinated shrimp. Cook until shrimp are curled and opaque, adding more water as needed, about 5 minutes more. Season with black pepper and salt.
