Ingredients:
3 ½ cups broccoli florets, frozen
1 cup frozen assorted bell peppers
¼ yellow onion, sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 Tbsp canola oil
salt and pepper to taste
2 oranges, squeezed, or ½ cup orange juice
1/3 cup water
1 Tbsp butter, unsalted
1 1/2 Tbsp Dijon-style mustard
2 tsp corn starch
4 cups low-sodium broth
2 cups quinoa

Directions:
Heat canola oil on medium heat in a sauce pan, and add garlic and broccoli. Cook 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. In a separate bowl, combine orange juice, water, butter (melted), Dijon-style mustard, and corn starch. Mix well. Add mixture to pan. Add frozen bell pepper. Continue to stir on low heat 4-6 minutes to allow sauce to heat through.
Cook quinoa separately, according to package instructions. Quinoa can also be cooked in a rice cooker. Place broccoli and pepper mixture on cooked quinoa and enjoy!
