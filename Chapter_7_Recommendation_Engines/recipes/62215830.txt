Description: 
This is as close as I can come to Mom's Potato Candy. This has been a Christmas favorite while growing up, and the following generations aren't happy unless it's part of the fare. When adding the confectioners' sugar and peanut butter, be aware that the amounts are approximate. You may add more or less, depending on your tastes. Note - several said to just have a baked potato, mash it, add pwdrd sugar until very stiff, then spread PB on it...Modified from: Potato Candy
