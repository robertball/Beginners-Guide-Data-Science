Description: 
During the many years I've made this creamy potato dish, I haven't run into anyone who didn't like it! The sauce is very flavorful and just the right consistency--not too thick or too thin. For a family dinner or potluck dish, this casserole is always a winner.                    --Lavonne Hartel                                                          Williston, North Dakota
