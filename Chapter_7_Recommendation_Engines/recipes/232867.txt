Ingredients:
2 (20 ounce) bags California-blend frozen vegetables
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cup sour cream
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup melted butter
1 sleeve buttery round crackers (such as Ritz®), crushed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add frozen vegetables, cover, and steam until tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a baking dish.
Mix mayonnaise, sour cream, onion, and Cheddar cheese in a bowl; pour over vegetables. Stir crackers and melted butter in another bowl and sprinkle over vegetables.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
