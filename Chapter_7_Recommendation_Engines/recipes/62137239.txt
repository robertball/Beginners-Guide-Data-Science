Combine cake mix, pudding, eggs, milk and oil together until smooth. Pour batter evenly into 3 lightly greased, 9" inch round cake pans.
Bake in the center of preheated oven at 325 degrees for 30 minutes.
Remove cake from oven and let completely cool.
While cake is cooling, combine cream cheese and both sugars until smooth. Next, add Cool Whip and pecans. Mix well.
