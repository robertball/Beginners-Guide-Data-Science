Ingredients:
3 cups bread flour
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped black olives
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 tablespoon cornmeal

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together flour, yeast, sugar, salt, black olives, olive oil, and water.
Turn out dough onto a floured board.  Knead until smooth and elastic, 5 to 10 minutes.  Set aside, and let rise about 45 minutes, until it doubles in size.  Punch down.  Knead well again, for about 5 to 10 minutes. Let rise for about 30 minutes, until it doubles in size.
Round the dough on kneading board.  Place upside down in a bowl lined with a lint-free, well floured towel.  Let rise until double in size.
While the bread is rising for the third time, put a pan of water in the bottom of the oven.  Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
Gently turn loaf out onto a sheet pan that has been lightly oiled and dusted with cornmeal.
Bake loaf at 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) for 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Bake for 30 more minutes, or until done.
