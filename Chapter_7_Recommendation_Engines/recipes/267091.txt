Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
1 butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into small slices
2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon honey, or to taste
1 (8 ounce) tub crumbled goat cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with olive oil or line with parchment paper.
Combine butternut squash and sweet potatoes in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Spread onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes. Turn vegetables and drizzle with honey. Sprinkle evenly with goat cheese. Bake until cooked through and lightly browned, about 10 minutes more. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
