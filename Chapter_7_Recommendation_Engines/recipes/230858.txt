Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 onion, sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
5 eggs
2 tablespoons garlic and herb cheese spread (such as Boursin®)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms, onion, and garlic until onion is browned, about 15 minutes. Season with Italian seasoning.
Beat eggs with garlic and herb cheese spread in a bowl. Mixture will be slightly chunky. Season with salt and black pepper.
Pour eggs in skillet over mushroom mixture; cook and stir until eggs are nearly set, about 1 minute. Fold mozzarella cheese into eggs until just melted, about 30 seconds.

Description: 
A recipe inspired from a local brunch restaurant. The Boursin® cheese gives the omelet an incredible creaminess. A great brunch/breakfast dish. I prefer a blend of exotic mushrooms and I like to serve this with toast.
