Ingredients:
2 1/2 gallons vodka
6 (12 ounce) packages frozen raspberries
4 1/2 cups white sugar

Directions:
Combine vodka, raspberries, sugar, and water in a large, non-metallic container. Press and muddle raspberries until incorporated into the mixture. Allow mixture to sit, stirring for 10 to 15 minutes each day, for 5 to 6 days.
Strain mixture multiple times through a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth until berries and seeds are removed and liquid is lighter in color.
