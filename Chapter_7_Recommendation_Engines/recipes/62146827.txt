Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
1 lb ground pork
3/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp clove
1/4 tsp sage
1 potato, boiled and mashed plain
1/2 cup breadcrumbs
water
pie crust (for top and bottom)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
Place all the ingredients, up until, and including, the sage, in a saucepan.
Add enough water to cover the meat, and simmer until the meat is cooked through.
Drain, leaving a little water to keep the meat moisturized.
Add the potato and breadcrumbs, mashing to mix together well. Let the mixture cool slightly.
Place into the crust, and cover with the top crust, cutting slits to vent.
Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the crust is brown.

Description: 
This is my memere's recipe for French Meat Pie. We live in a community that has a large french-candian heritage, and almost every family has their own version. Of course, I think ours is the best! :)
