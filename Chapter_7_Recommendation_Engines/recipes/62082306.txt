Ingredients:
3 medium sized green or roma tomatoes-coarsely chopped (preference to green)
4 tomatillos (Mexican green tomatoes with husks) - cleaned and chopped
3 medium sized avocados (optional)
1 jalapeño coarsely chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/4 bunch cilantro
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups sour cream (room temp)

Directions:
You can opt to roast the jalapeño before combining with the other ingredients to give it a extra flavor.  To roast the pepper:  Put it in the toaster oven at 375 degrees for about 5 minutes or until the pepper "sweats".  Keep a close watch you don't want it to burn!
Sauté the onion, peppers and the garlic in a large saucepan.
Add the tomatoes tomatillos. (If you choose to add avocados - this is where you would add them.) Add water as needed.  You do not want extra water in the mixture.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes or until tomatoes are soft.  Boil off remaining water.
Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
Place tomato mixture, avocados, cilantro and salt in a food processor or blender (you may need to do this in batches).
Process the mixture until smooth.
Pour mixture into a large bowl.
Serve with or over tortilla chips.  Sprinkle with your choice of shredded cheese for nachos!
