Ingredients:
4 cups water
2 cups uncooked brown rice
1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
2 bell peppers, diced
1 onion, diced
2 cups fresh spinach
1 cup green beans
1/2 cup diced mushrooms
2 teaspoons chili powder, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon paprika, or to taste
2 (15 ounce) cans fat-free refried beans
10 (8 inch) flour tortillas
2 (10 ounce) cans enchilada sauce
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend

Directions:
Bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add bell peppers, onion, spinach, green beans, and mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 8 minutes. Season with chili powder and paprika.
Spoon refried beans into a microwave-safe container. Cover and microwave until hot, about 3 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking pan.
Divide brown rice, bell pepper mixture, and refried beans evenly among tortillas. Roll up tortillas to enclose filling; arrange seam-side down in the baking pan.
Pour enchilada sauce over rolled tortillas. Sprinkle Mexican cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 30 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
