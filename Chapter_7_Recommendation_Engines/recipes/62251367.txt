Ingredients:
2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
4 carrots, peeled and cubed
1 stick (1/2 cup) butter, divided
1/2 small onion, finely diced (about 1/4 cup)
2 cloves garlic, crushed
3 Tablespoons flour
3 cups milk
2 (5 oz.) cans tuna, drained
1/2 cup frozen peas
1 tube buttery crackers, crushed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cover potatoes and carrots with cold water and boil, covered, about 15 minutes until tender. Drain and keep warm by covering. Melt half the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook for about three minutes until soft. Sprinkle flour in and whisk to mix and remove lumps. Continue to whisk over medium low heat for 1 minute. Do not allow this to brown. Add milk and continue to whisk gently as the mixture thickens until it reaches a boil. Flake tuna into the white sauce. Add potatoes and carrots and stir in the peas. Taste this mixture and add salt and pepper to taste. Place this mixture into a casserole prepared with spray release. Melt remaining butter and add crushed crackers. Top the casserole with crumb topping. Bake in a preheated oven for half an hour until hot and bubbly.

Description: 
This tuna casserole is an updated version of a recipe handed down from my grandmother, Elizabeth Kelleher Daly so of course it uses potatoes as its starch. She actually called it California Chicken. I guess to a native Yankee, the joke was that in California, tuna is chicken.
