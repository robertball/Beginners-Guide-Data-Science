"Skinny" Chicken Tacos Recipe

Ingredients:
1 package thinly sliced chicken breasts, cut into thin strips
2 red bell peppers, cut into thin strips
1 medium red onion, cut thinly
2 jalapenos, seeds and stems removed and cut into thin strips
3 limes
2 tsp. cumin
2 tsp. garlic powder
2 tsp. chipotle chili powder
1 bunch cilantro, chopped
1 package multi-grain tortillas (fajita size)

Directions:
1.  In a bowl, combine the chicken strips, 1 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. chipotle chili powder and the juice of 1 lime, mix to combine and let marinade for about 10 minutes.
2.  In a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, add the onions, red bell pepper and jalapenos along with the remaining spices and juice of 1 lime.  Saute until veggies are crisp tender.
3.  After the veggies have been started, in another non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, add the chicken and cook until done.
4.  When the chicken and veggies are just about ready, warm up the tortillas.  I usually do mine in the microwave between a couple of damp paper towels.
5.  To assemble, place the veggies, chicken and cilantro and squeeze just a little bit more lime over the cilantro, roll and enjoy.
6.  Other options for toppings would be low fat sour cream, 2% reduced fat mexican cheese and salsa.
