Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1 cup slivered or sliced almonds
1 lbs thin French green beans, trimmed
3-4 cloves garlic, minced
olive oil (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (convection bake)
Melt butter in frying pan over low heat.  Add almonds to butter and coat well.  Increase heat to low-medium, stirring regularly.
When almonds start to brown slightly, remove from heat.  Add garlic and green beans and mix well so green beans are coated with butter.
Lay parchment paper on two baking trays.  Lay out green beans and almonds on parchment, separating the green beans so they aren't baking on top of one another.
Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove from oven, stir, and replace back in oven on the opposite shelves (so pan on top shelf is now on bottom shelf).  Bake for another 10 minutes, or until they are browned to desired amount.
