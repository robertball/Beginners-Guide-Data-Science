Ingredients:
1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
1 teaspoon baking powder
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
3 large eggs
1/2 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoons heavy cream, for tart dough
8 ounces goat cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

Directions:
In a large bowl, sift flour, baking powder, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Using two knives or a pastry blender, cut butter into flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Mix in 1 egg and 3 tablespoons heavy cream. (If too dry, add more cream.) Shape dough into a disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until chilled, 30 minutes or up to overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, mix together cheese, remaining eggs and heavy cream, parsley, and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper.
On a floured surface, roll out dough. Fit into an 11-1/2- by 8-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, rolling pin over top to cut off excess dough. Pour filling into crust. Bake until golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 15 minutes, before removing tart from pan.
