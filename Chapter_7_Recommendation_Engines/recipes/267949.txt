Ingredients:
4 cups pound cake chunks
4 large eggs
1 cup white sugar, divided
1 cup whole milk
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped Halloween candy

Directions:
Butter an 8-inch square baking dish. Place pound cake chunks in the prepared baking dish and set aside.
Beat eggs and 3/4 cup sugar together in a bowl until frothy. Add milk, heavy cream, vanilla bean paste, and salt. Continue beating 1 to 2 minutes more. Stir in chopped candy, breaking up any clumps that may form. Pour egg mixture over pound cake in the baking pan; press cake into the mixture to cover. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and set, about 1 hour. Let bread pudding cool on a wire rack for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.
