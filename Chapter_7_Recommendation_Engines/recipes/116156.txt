Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup cold butter
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups halved fresh strawberries
1 (11 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained
1 cup fresh blueberries
GLAZE:
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup unsweetened pineapple juice
1 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flour and confectioners' sugar. Cut in butter until crumbly. Press onto an ungreased 12-in. pizza pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until very lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack.
In a small mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Spread over crust. Arrange the strawberries, oranges and blueberries on top.
For glaze, in a small saucepan, combine sugar and cornstarch. Stir in pineapple juice and lemon juice until smooth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Cool slightly. Drizzle over fruit. Refrigerate until chilled.
