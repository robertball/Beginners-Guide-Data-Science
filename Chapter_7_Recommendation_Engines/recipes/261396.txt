Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 pounds roasted lamb, cubed
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 1/2 cups thinly sliced leeks
1 1/2 quarts beef stock
1 (19 ounce) can stewed tomatoes, drained
2 cups leftover lamb gravy
1 (15 ounce) can Irish stout beer (such as GuinnessÂ®)
2 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
parsnips, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
1 turnip, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
4 cloves garlic, halved, or more to taste
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon ground rosemary
1 teaspoon coarse salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup boiling water
3 tablespoons beef gravy granules (such as BISTO)
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons cold water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in large pot over medium-high heat. Coat lamb with flour and cook in the hot oil until the sides start turning golden, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in the same pot. Add leeks and cook until transparent and some slices are golden, about 5 minutes. Stir lamb back into the pot. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in beef stock, tomatoes, gravy, and beer. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer stew until vegetables are done roasting, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
Place potatoes, carrots, parsnips, turnip, and garlic in a large glass baking dish. Coat with 1/4 cup olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Season evenly with rosemary, salt, and pepper.
Roast vegetables in the preheated oven, stirring every 20 to 30 minutes, until soft and starting to brown, 1 to 1/2 hours.
Stir hot vegetables carefully into the lamb stew. Bring to a boil. Mix 1 cup liquid from the pot with 1/2 cup boiling water and gravy granules in a small bowl until smooth. Stir into the stew. Dissolve cornstarch in 2 tablespoons water and add into the stew. Stir until stew thickens, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Great way to use up roast lamb leftovers. The meat becomes so tender after being simmered for so long. My Irish husband ate 3 huge bowls of this the first time I made it. He said it was better than his grandma's back at home in Ireland.
