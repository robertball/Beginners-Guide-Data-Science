Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed
2 1/2 pounds whole pork tenderloins
salt and black pepper to taste
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
1 onion, chopped
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 cup white wine
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1/4 cup sour cream

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season pork tenderloins with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Cook pork in the oil, turning until browned on all sides, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from pan, and set aside. In the same skillet, cook onion and mushrooms until they brown lightly and begin to soften; 3-5 minutes.
Pour wine into slow cooker; stir in the onion and mushrooms. Place browned pork on top of the vegetables.
Combine mushroom soup, Dijon mustard, and sour cream in a bowl. Spread mixture over pork. Cover slow cooker; cook on Low until pork is tender and liquids have formed a sauce; 7 to 8 hours.
