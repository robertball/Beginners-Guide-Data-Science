Ingredients:
Dough:
1 cup warm milk (120-130 degrees)
1 tsp sugar
2 1/2 tsps rapid rise yeast
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 tsp salt
2 eggs, room temperature
1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
Filling:
2 1/2 cups finely chopped fresh or frozen cranberries
1 tbsp orange zest
3 tbsps orange juice
3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1/4 tsp salt
1 tbsp cornstarch
Vanilla Glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
3-4 tbsps heavy cream
pinch of salt

Directions:
1. Prepare dough. In a small bowl, mix warm milk, 1 tsp sugar, and rapid rise yeast until dissolved. Set aside, and allow yeast to proof until foamy.  In another bowl, whisk together eggs and cooled melted butter, set aside.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together 2 cups all purpose flour, whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1 tsp salt. Pour in yeast mixture and gently stir to combine. Mix in butter and eggs and continue to stir until a sticky dough is formed. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead in the last 1/2 cup of all purpose flour a little at a time, until dough is no longer sticky. Continue kneading until dough is smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes, using additional flour if necessary. Place dough into a greased bowl, and turn to coat. Cover, and place in a warm draft-free area. Allow dough to rise until doubled in size, about 1-2 hours.
3. Prepare filling. Combine cranberries, orange zest, orange juice, brown sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, salt and cornstarch in a saucepan. Place over medium heat, and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture begins to bubble and thicken slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow to cool to room temperature.
4. Line a 9 x13" pan and a 6" cake pan with parchment paper, and then lightly grease both pans.
5. Assemble rolls. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll out into a rectangle about 21" x  14". Place cranberry filling in on the dough, leaving a 1/2" border on all sides. Starting with the longer (21") side, roll up the dough. Pinch to seal the dough together, and lay seam-side down. Using a serrated or very sharp knife, cut into 15 rolls about 1 1/4" wide. Place cut side up in prepared pans (12 rolls into the 9" x 13", and 3 rolls into the 6" cake pan). Loosely cover, and allow rolls to rise until doubled in size, about 30-45 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake rolls for 22-27 minutes, or until they begin to turn golden brown on top. Allow to cool in pan for several minutes before removing.
7. Prepare Vanilla Glaze. Whisk together powdered sugar, heavy cream, vanilla extract, and pinch of salt until smooth. Adding more heavy cream if necessary to thin, or more powdered sugar to thicken as needed. Pour glaze over slightly warm rolls before serving.

A different take on cinnamon rolls! I like to frost these with a simple vanilla glaze, but feel free to use any kind of icing you like!
