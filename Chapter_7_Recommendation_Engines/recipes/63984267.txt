Description: 
A super-delicious soup that is simple to make.  The aroma while it's cooking is amazing and the taste is to die for!  Be sure to add the chopped bell peppers at the end, so they won't end up too mushy. I love stuffed green peppers, and when the flavors are  condensed into an easy-to-prepare soup, it makes a family favorite. It's great topped with shredded medium cheddar cheese and a side of garlic bread!
