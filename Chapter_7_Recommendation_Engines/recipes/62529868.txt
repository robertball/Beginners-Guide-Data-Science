Lightly spray a 3 1/2- or 4-quart slow cooker with cooking sray.
In a large bowl (and I mean HUGE bowl), stir together the oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Stir in the pumpkin.  Gradually stir in the water and half-and-half.  Stir in the raisins and vanilla.
Ladle the mixture into the slow cooker.  Cook, covered, on low for 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 hours.  Serve topped with brown sugar and chopped walnuts, if desired.
