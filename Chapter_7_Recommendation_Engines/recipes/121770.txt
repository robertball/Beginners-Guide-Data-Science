Ingredients:
1 cup evaporated milk
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 envelope onion soup mix
2 pounds ground beef
Sauce:
1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 1/2 cups ketchup
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup chopped green pepper
1/2 cup chopped sweet red pepper
2 tablespoons chopped onion
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first three ingredients. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into 1-in. balls. Place on a greased broiler pan. Broil 4-6 in. from the heat for 5-8 minutes or until browned. In a Dutch oven, combine the sauce ingredients.  Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; add meatballs. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour or until the meat is no longer pink.

Description: 
I've found these colorful meatballs keep well in a slow cooker for a no-fuss meal. We enjoy them served over rice or noodles.
