Ingredients:
4 cups thinly sliced Brussels sprouts*
1 medium apple, coarsely chopped
4 slices bacon, crisp-cooked and crumbled
1/2 cup sliced almonds, toasted**
Honey Yogurt Dressing:
1 (5.3 ounce) container VOSKOSÂ® Nonfat Honey Greek Yogurt
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine Brussels sprouts and 2 tablespoons water in a medium microwave-safe bowl; cover. Microwave on 100% power (high) for 4 minutes, stirring halfway through. Immediately chill the Brussels sprouts by plunging into a bowl of ice water; drain well. Remove any excess moisture from the Brussels sprouts by using a salad spinner or place Brussels sprouts in a colander and use paper towels to absorb the excess moisture.
Combine Brussels sprouts and apple in a large bowl. Pour Honey Yogurt Dressing (see below) over Brussels sprouts mixture; toss gently to coat. Add bacon; toss gently to combine. Cover and chill for 2 to 24 hours. Just before serving, gently stir in almonds.
Honey Yogurt Dressing: Stir together VOSKOS(R) Nonfat Honey Greek Yogurt, cider vinegar, and salt in a bowl. Chill up to 24 hours.

Description: 
A quick cook in the microwave and these mini heads of cabbage slice neatly for a slaw that melds its personality with sweet chopped apple, crumbled bacon, and a creamy Greek yogurt dressing. Like other cruciferous vegetables, Brussels sprouts bring Vitamins A and C to the meal, along with some iron.
