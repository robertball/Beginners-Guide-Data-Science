Description: 
Great recipe for any time of the day. I got the idea from another Allrecipes.com recipe, but made several modifications that turned it into an almost-different dish.

 The addition of orange juice, apples, and vanilla makes this a tasty breakfast treat. These are best when a little crispy.
