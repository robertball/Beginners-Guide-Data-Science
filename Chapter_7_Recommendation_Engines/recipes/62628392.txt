Ingredients:
1 cup milk warm in microwave to 110 degrees
1/2 cup water hot tap water
1 egg
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 cup butter cubed smaller pieces
2 tsp. yeast
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
place ingredients in bread pan in order listed above! salt being last on top of flour.  select dough cycle on bread machine when cycle is done knead dough a few times then :
Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Shape into smooth balls, and place on a greased baking sheet. Flatten slightly. Cover, and let rise for 30 to 40 minutes.
Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown.
For Hot Dog Buns:  Shape each piece into a 6x4 inch rectangle. Starting with the longer side, roll up tightly, and pinch edges and ends to seal. Let rise about 20 to 25 minutes. Bake as above. These buns are pretty big. I usually make 14 instead of 12.
