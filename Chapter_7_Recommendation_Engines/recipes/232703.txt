Ingredients:
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir cream of mushroom soup, sour cream, and Worcestershire sauce in bowl until well blended. Pour half the soup mixture in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange chicken breast halves in baking dish and cover with remaining soup mixture.
Bake chicken in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Cut chicken into bite-size pieces and serve over egg noodles with mushroom sauce.
