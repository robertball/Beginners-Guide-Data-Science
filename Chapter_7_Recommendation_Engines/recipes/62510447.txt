Ingredients:
5 cups flour
1 1/2 tsp. salt
2 1/2 Tbsp. baking powder
3/4 cup butter
About 1 cup warm water
2 lb. hamburger
1/2 onion
4 cups canola oil

Directions:
Saute onions and hamburger in frying pan. Set aside.
Mix dough ingredients. Slowly add warm water to make dough easier to knead. Knead dough for 5-8 minutes.
Form dough into over-sized golf balls and roll out with a rolling pin.
Spoon hamburger meat onto rolled out dough and form pockets around hamburger meat (so they look like Pizza Pops).
Fry in oil until dough is cooked (golden brown).
Cut open pockets and fill with grated cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, salsa and sour cream.
