Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar
2 egg whites
1/4 cup water, or as needed

Directions:
Beat sugar and egg whites in a large bowl using an electric mixer on low speed until evenly combined and shiny, about 3 minutes. Add the water gradually, beating on medium-high until icing is smooth and the desired consistency, about 5 minutes.
