Ingredients:
3 cups water
1 cup cracked freekeh
1 pinch salt (optional)
2 tablespoons cooking oil
1 onion, diced
2 eggplants, peeled and cubed
2 (16 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
2 russet potatoes, peeled and chopped
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
1 sweet potato, peeled and chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring water, freekeh, and salt to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside.
While the freekeh is cooking, heat oil in a pot over medium heat. Stir in onion; cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add eggplant and cook, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes, russet potatoes, carrots, sweet potato, cumin, coriander, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low heat and simmer, covered, about 30 minutes. Add cooked freekeh and simmer for 10 minutes more.
