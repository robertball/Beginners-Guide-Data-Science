Ingredients:
1 can of Garbanzo Beans (10 oz)
Reserved liquid from canned garbanzos
1 1/2 tablespoons Peanut Butter
1 - 2 tablespoons sesame oil
5 tablespoons lemon juice
4 cloves of minced garlic
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
First drain the garbanzo beans (aka chickpeas) and put the liquid to the side.
In a food processor or blender, emulsify the beans until they are smooth.
Add 2 - 3 tablespoons reserved liquid and blend again until it's a smooth paste.
Next mix the lemon juice, minced garlic, cumin, and peanut butter in a small bowl.
Add this to the paste, and start blender/processor.
Through the liquid feeder, or the top of the blender trickle the olive oil and sesame oil until the tablespoons are gone.
One final blend, and it's finished! Serve with toasted pita chips, or vegetables.
