Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, melted
2/3 cup crushed saltine crackers
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 pound yellow perch fillets

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour butter into a shallow dish. Combine cracker crumbs, Parmesan cheese, basil, oregano, salt, and garlic powder in a separate shallow bowl.
Dip perch fillets into melted butter and press into the seasoned cracker crumbs to coat. Arrange coated fillets on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the coating is browned and fish flakes easily with a fork, 25 to 30 minutes.
