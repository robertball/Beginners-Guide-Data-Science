Ingredients:
2  pats Garlic & Herb Sauté Butter, divided
3  Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts
3  32 oz. Chicken Broth (Low Sodium), divided
4  cloves garlic, minced
4  celery stalks, diced
4  carrots, diced
½  yellow onion, chopped
1 ½ tsp. chicken bouillon
Parsley, to desired taste
Oregano, to desired taste
Fresh cracked pepper, desired taste
1 bag egg noodles, desired size

Directions:
In a Dutch oven, melt one pat of sauté butter over medium-high heat.  Clean/trim chicken and add to the Dutch oven once butter is melted.  Sauté until just done on the inside and just browned on the outside, turning occasionally.  Do not overcook. Remove chicken.
Still on medium –high heat, add enough chicken broth to just cover the bottom of the pot (be careful, the broth may splash – so pour slowly), with a whisk loosen the crispy coating on the bottom, to deglaze the pan.  (The broth will be very dark – don’t worry it will lighten through the cooking process)  Allow broth to reduce down, with only a little left.  Add remaining pat of sauté butter, and melt.  Add garlic and veggies to reduced broth and cook until veggies are tender to your desired consistency.  You may need to add additional broth through this process (in small increments) to ensure the veggies don’t burn or stick.
While veggies are tenderizing, dice chicken breasts into small chunks.
Once veggies are tender,  add remaining chicken broth of one container and one additional container.  Add chicken chunks.  Add bouillon and seasonings.  Stir to mix everything together.  Cook until the broth begins to boil – stirring occasionally.  Add desired amount of noodles.  Cook until noodles begin to boil and soften.  Through this process you may need to add additional chicken broth (of third container), as the noodles will absorb the broth quickly.  Continue cooking until noodles are at desired consistency.

Description: 
Nothing warms the soul and body like a bowl of Chicken Noodle Soup.  This soup will brings robust flavor because of the sauted chicken and vegetable - children who don't normally eat veggies, will eat these veggies...and will love them!! I like hearty soups  so I use an entire bag of medium noodles.  But if you like a brothy soup  you will want to use less.  All depends on one which “bear” of the “three bears” you are.
