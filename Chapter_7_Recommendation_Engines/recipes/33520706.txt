Ingredients:
2 cups Wondra flour (you can substitute cake flour)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup sugar
1 cup milk
1 egg
1/2 cup of squeezable margarine (ie Parkay)
1 pint strawberries or blueberries
"Drobenka" (crumb topping)
1/3 cup Wondra flour (or cake flour)
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Grease an 11x7x1.5 pan.
Combine all of the ingredients into a semi-solid dough. Spread the dough into the prepared pan, and cover with berries.
Make the "Drobenka": mix the flour, butter, and sugar together with a fork until crumbs form.
Sprinkle the "Drobenka" over the berries.
Bake the cake for 30 minutes until the crumbs are lightly browned.

Description: 
This isn't a pizza at all, but a cake-like Czech pastry my Babi would make for me when I was little. The end result, when made with strawberries, reminded me of a pepperoni pizza, thus the name.
