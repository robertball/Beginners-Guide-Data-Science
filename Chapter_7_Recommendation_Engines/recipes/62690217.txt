Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) pork butt roast (or loin)
1 bottle BBQ sauce
1 (32 ounce) container low sodium beef broth (less broth can be used by choice)
Salt (optional) and pepper to taste
1 cup celery (optional)
1 cup carrot (optional)
2 cloves chopped garlic (optional)
1/2 onion chopped (optional)

Directions:
Cut vegetables into strips or medium chunks and place veggies, garlic, pepper at bottom of unheated slow cooker. Rub roast with salt and pepper, and place on top of ingredients in the slow cooker. Pour broth over the meat.
Turn the slow cooker to HIGH and let sit for 5 hours, or until a fork can easily remove meat from the bone.
Once done, remove roast from slow cooker, and turn to LOW. Use a strainer and separate the juice that is in the slow cooker. Set broth aside.
Place approximately one cup of broth back in slow cooker and de-bone roast using two forks, placing shredded pork back into slow cooker.
