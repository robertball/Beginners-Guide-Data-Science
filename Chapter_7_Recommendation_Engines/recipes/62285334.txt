Ingredients:
*   2 tablespoons butter
* 1/4 lb stewing beef
* 1/4 lb lamb steak (or mutton if available)
* 4 cups good beef stock
* 1 medium onion, peeled and sliced
* 1 carrot, peeled and sliced
* 1 parsnip, peeled and sliced
* 2 tablespoons flour
* 1 bouquet garni
* salt and pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon chili powder
* 1/2 cup cooked rice (optional)
* 1/4 cup madeira wine (optional)

Directions:
Cut the lamb and beef into 1-inch cubes and roll in the flour.
Place the butter in a large saucepan over a low to medium heat. (It is important not to turn the heat up too high since the butter burns easily. We want it to go brown, but not black!) Fry the meat off for 3 minutes and then add the rest of the flour and fry for a minute longer until the butter/flour is a golden brown.
Now add the sliced vegetables and stir in the stock, Throw in the bouquet garni, partially cover the saucepan, and simmer for 2 hours.
Puree the soup before adding the cooked rice if using; serve the soup piping hot with assorted breads and rolls. Traditionally a tablespoon of Madeira would be stirred into the soup at the table.

Description: 
The very soup reputed to have built the British Empire and one that was oh-so-fashionable in Victorian and Edwardian times! This soup was served daily, until recently, in the dining cars of British Rail. This classic hearty soup was also very popular at the castle (Windsor) in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Queen Victoria was particularly fond of it, and it regularly appeared on state banquet menus.
