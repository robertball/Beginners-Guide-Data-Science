Ingredients:
You will need a glass container that will hold 2 1/2 half to 3 cups of liquid, the mouth of which is wide enough to accept ice cubes. The ingredients are:
5 parts vodka
4 parts gin
3 ice cubes
2. parts pale dry sherry (Dry Vermouth, is an acceptable substitute)
1 part water.

Directions:
Place all 5 ingredients in the glass container and place it in the freezer of your refrigerator for at least   three hours. The one part water should freeze and crystallize in the drink. Also place your cocktail glasses in the freezer, with or without rocks, as is your custom.
Serve the martini, as is your custom, with olives or a twist. Or serve with pickled onions, changing it from a Martini to a, "Gibson". Serve with an olive and an onion, and you have a, "Gibtini".

Description: 
The US Marine Corps was founded in Philadelphia, on Nov. 10, 1775 in a tavern during the American Revolutionary War. The name of the tavern was, Tun Tavern. There is an exact replica of Tun Tavern at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia. It was at Quantico in this Tun Tavern that the US Marine Corps Martini was born over 50 years ago. It has been made and served all over the world. Is it a killer martini? More on that later. It is some times referred to as the 5,4,3,2,1, Martini.
