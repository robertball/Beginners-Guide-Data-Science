Meatball soup
Hey there, longtime no see! I'm posting my fist soup recipe, which is one of my favoites, Meatball soup! Since I have no cooking robot but I love the texture of the taiwanese style meat ball, I've made original chinese meatball but I've put taiwanese ingredients and more starch to have a more ''dought-like'' texture. You'll see, the spices add an intensive flavour to the meatballs and make them addictive!

Around 2 or 3 serving, considering it as a main dish.
