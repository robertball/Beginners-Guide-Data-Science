Ingredients:
1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
2 TBS olive oil
2 large cloves of garlic
Salt

Directions:
Smash garlic cloves with the hard part of your palm, remove skins.
In a 12 inch skillet heat oil over medium.
When oil is hot, add the garlic cloves and cook for 2 minutes.
Gently place green beans in pan, and lightly toss.
Sauté for about 8 minutes.
Toss  the green beans around and sauté under done about 6 -8 minutes longer.
If you prefer a very well done green bean, you may need to turn the heat to medium low so you don’t lose the bright green color and continue cooking.
Once beans are done remove to a serving plate and sprinkle with salt to taste.

Description: 
These green beans are so easy but super tasty. The garlic gives them a great flavor and sautéing in the oil on the stove makes them so simple.  The secret is to use a pan a little bigger than what you think you will need.  It makes for easy mixing.  You can buy the fresh green beans in the “steam bag” - those are trimmed and ready to go.
