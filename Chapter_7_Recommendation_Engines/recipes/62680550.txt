Description: 
A favorite at my church. It's not healthy by any means but it's oh-so-tasty. It's quick and easy to make and can be made ahead, frozen, and reheated without losing any of its creamy goodness. Makes a good side dish and is easily amended to make a main dish by adding chopped ham or whole kernel corn.
