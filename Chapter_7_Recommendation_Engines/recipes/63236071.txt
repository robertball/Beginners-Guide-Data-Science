Tzatziki Potato Salad Recipe

Ingredients:
4 pounds potatoes (pref. yukon gold, so no peeling needed)
1 1/3 cups Greek yogurt (I used full-fat but I think other fat levels would work)
1/4 cup sour cream
1 small onion, chopped
6 hardboiled eggs
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (from half a big lemon)
1 tablespoon vinegar
1 tablespoon minced fresh dill
1 medium garlic clove, minced
2 teaspoons kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 hothouse or English cucumber (1 pound), unpeeled and grated

Directions:
In a medium pot, cover potatoes with cold water and bring them to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-high and let potatoes simmer until tender enough that they can be pierced easily with a skewer or slim knife. Drain potatoes and let them cool completely. (This is a great step to do ahead, as it seems to take potatoes forever to cool. If youâ€™re really in a rush, spread them on a tray and pop them in the freezer for 10 minutes.)
Meanwhile, in the bottom of a large bowl, stir together yogurt, sour cream, lemon juice, vinegar, dill, garlic, salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper.
Grate the cucumber on a box grater and try to remove some of the excess by squeezing out handfuls, pressing it in a mesh sieve with a spoon or wringing it in a square of cheesecloth or a lint-free dishtowel. Add to yogurt mixture.
Once potatoes are cool, add to cucumbers and yogurt and stir to coat. Add chopped hardboiled eggs and finely chopped onion. Adjust seasonings to taste. Either eat immediately or keep in the fridge for up to three days.
