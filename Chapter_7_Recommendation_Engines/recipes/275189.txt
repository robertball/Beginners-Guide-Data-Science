Ingredients:
1 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
2 cloves fresh garlic, chopped
2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins

Directions:
Whisk balsamic vinegar, olive oil, rosemary, and garlic together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add pork tenderloins, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove pork from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
Place pork on the preheated grill and cook, turning occasionally, until pork is slightly pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
