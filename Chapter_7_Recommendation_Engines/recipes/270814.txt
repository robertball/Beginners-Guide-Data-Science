Ingredients:
2 slices bacon, chopped
2 medium fresh mushrooms, chopped
1 tablespoon minced green onions (including green tops)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup cottage cheese

Directions:
Cook bacon in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined bowl, reserving bacon grease in a small bowl.
Return skillet to medium-high heat and add 1 teaspoon reserved bacon grease. Cook mushrooms and green onions until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a small bowl and keep warm.
Return skillet to medium-high heat and add 1 teaspoon reserved bacon grease. Add eggs and scramble until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and keep warm.
Place cottage cheese into a microwave-safe bowl. Heat on 50% power for 60 to 90 seconds, or until warm, stirring halfway through. Drain any liquid that has been released and transfer cottage cheese into one side of a single-serving bowl. Place scrambled eggs into the other side of the bowl. Top with mushroom mixture and bacon. Serve immediately.
