Ingredients:
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
3 large potatoes, cubed
6 (4 ounce) links Italian sausage, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 green bell pepper, cut into 2-inch squares
1 large sweet onion, peeled and cut into wedges
wooden skewers, soaked in water

Directions:
Place rosemary, thyme, oregano, and parsley in a large resealable plastic bag. Add potatoes. Seal and shake until potatoes are covered.
Alternate threading potatoes, sausage, peppers, and onions onto skewers, leaving a small space in between each item.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place kebabs on the grate; cover any large gaps on the skewers with aluminum foil. Grill until vegetables are tender and sausage is cooked to your liking, 4 to 6 minutes per side.
