Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
4 large green bell peppers, stemmed and seeded
1 cup water, or more as needed
2 cubes chicken bouillon
1 clove garlic, peeled
1 tablespoon butter, or more to taste
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Combine bell peppers, water, chicken bouillon, and garlic in a medium pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook until peppers are soft, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter.
Fill blender halfway with the pepper-broth mixture. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Pour into a bowl. Repeat with any remaining mixture. Stir in sour cream.
Line the bottom of the baking dish with a layer of the spaghetti. Spread a portion of the pepper puree on top and add a layer of mozzarella cheese. Repeat layering spaghetti, pepper puree, and cheese until all ingredients are used up.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.
