Ingredients:
*  1 1/2 lb Prosciutto(thinly sliced )
* 1 lb Provolone cheese(thinly sliced)
* 25 Pablano peppers
* 1 gallon white vinegar
* 2 quarts extra virgin olive oil
* 2 quarts canola oil
* 1 small onion, thinly sliced
* rosemary
* bay leaves
* dill weed
* basil
* chopped garlic

Directions:
1. Wash peppers and place whole, stems intact, in gallon jars.
2. Fill jars with white vinegar.
3. Let stand at least one week.
4. I've let them soak as long as 3 weeks. You may need to add more vinegar to keep the jar full as the peppers soak it in.
5. The peppers will float, make sure to keep them covered.
6. After soaking for at least a week, pour out vinegar and rinse peppers in cool water.
7. Remove stems and seeds.(wear gloves)
8. Expect to lose 3 or 4 peppers during soaking.
9. Layer Provolone and Proscuitto slices twice then roll and stuff into pepper.
10. Add some Olive Oil to the jar.
11. Add Onion, Rosemary, 2 or 3 Bay Leaves, Dill Weed, Basil and chopped Garlic to oil.
12. Place the peppers in the jar and fill the jar with 50% Olive Oil and 50% Canola Oil.
13. Let soak a minimum of one week.
I let them soak and store them at room temperature. You may want to refrigerate for longer shelf life. (I've had shelf life in excess of one month) ENJOY!
