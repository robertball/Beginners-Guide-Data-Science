Ingredients:
1 cup raw cashews
2 cup chickpeas [canned, drained, and rinsed]
2 garlic cloves
1 tbsp. buckwheat flour
1/2 of a medium sweet white onion
1/2 cup fresh basil
1/2 cup fresh Italian parsley
3 tbsp. cold pressed olive oil
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. cumin
1/2 tsp. sea salt
Salsa
1 1/2 cup grape tomatoes [diced]
1 jalapeño [chopped]
1 garlic clove
2 tbsp. cold pressed olive oil
1 tbsp. oregano
pinch of sea salt
pinch of fresh black pepper
Horseradish Sauce
1/2 cup vegannaise
5 tbsp. freshly grated horseradish root
1/2 tsp. sea salt
1/2 tsp. fresh black pepper
1/2 tsp. white wine vinegar

Directions:
Grate 5 tablespoons of fresh horseradish and add it to a medium bowl. Add veganaise and vinegar and stir to combine. Refrigerate to allow the flavors to intensify.
Preheat the oven to 375 F and line a baking sheet with parchment.
Pulse the herbs in the food processor then add the remaining falafel ingredients and process until a smooth mixture forms.
Form the mixture into falafel-sized balls [about the size of a golf ball]. A cookie dough or ice cream scoop works great as a reference. Just scoop and roll the mixture into a round-ish shape, then place on the pan. When you’re all out of falafel mixture, pop them into the oven.
Bake for 8 minutes on one side then gently flip them and bake for 8 more.
While the falafels are baking, get started on the salsa. Slice grape tomatoes into small slivers and dump them into to a medium bowl. Add finely chopped jalapeno, olive oil, and vinegar and mix it all together.
Once the falafels finish baking, allow them to cool before putting them into the wrap. Place 3-6 balls on the leaf, depending on the size of the leaf. Top with horseradish cream, then salsa, then carefully fold up the ends of the leaf and roll it into a rough burrito-esque shape.
We wrapped ours in chard leaves but if you require a more authentic falafel experience, go for a gluten-free pita instead. They’re also pretty delicious all by themselves.
