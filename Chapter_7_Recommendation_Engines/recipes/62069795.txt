Description: 
I was my neice's show-and-tell one day in her kindergarten and they had this playdough at one of their centers.  It's easy to make and SMELLS fabulous.  I like to make it with my kids for their friend's birthdays.  We include a few packages of kool-aid and a copy of the recipe.  If you are making it for one child you will want to 1/2 the recipe.
