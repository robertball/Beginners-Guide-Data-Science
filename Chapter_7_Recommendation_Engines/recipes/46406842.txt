Ingredients:
1 pound(s) fresh or frozen gnocchi
2 tablespoon(s) butter
2 medium shallots, chopped
1 pound(s) zucchini (about 3 small), very thinly sliced lengthwise
1 pound(s) cherry tomatoes, halved
1/2 teaspoon(s) salt
1/4 teaspoon(s) grated nutmeg
Freshly ground pepper, to taste
1/2 cup(s) grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup(s) chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Cook gnocchi according to package instructions until they float, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain.
2. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until the butter is beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Add shallots and zucchini and cook, stirring often, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add cherry tomatoes, salt, nutmeg and pepper and continue cooking, stirring often, until the tomatoes are just starting to break down, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in Parmesan and parsley. Add gnocchi and toss to coat. Serve immediately.
