Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 (10 ounce) package regular marshmallows
6 cups KELLOGG'S® RICE KRISPIES® cereal
1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate morsels or milk chocolate morsels
5 teaspoons shortening
Multi-colored sprinkles

Directions:
In large saucepan melt butter over low heat. Add marshmallows and stir until completely melted. Remove from heat.
Add KELLOGG'S(R) RICE KRISPIES(R) cereal. Stir until well coated.
Using 1/4-cup measuring cup coated with cooking spray divide warm cereal mixture into portions. Using buttered hands shape each portion into 2 1/2- x 1 1/2-inch egg shapes. (Or, coat insides of plastic snap-apart Easter eggs with cooking spray. Press cereal mixture into eggs. Remove cereal mixture from plastic eggs.) Cool.
In small saucepan combine chocolate morsels and shortening. Cook over low heat until melted, stirring constantly. Dip bottoms of cereal eggs into chocolate. Decorate with sprinkles. Place on wax-paper-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate until chocolate is firm. Individually wrap in plastic wrap. Best if served the same day.
