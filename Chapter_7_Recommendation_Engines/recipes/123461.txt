Ingredients:
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped broccoli, thawed
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
2/3 cup chopped onion
3 eggs
1 1/3 cups milk
3/4 cup biscuit baking mix
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine broccoli, 2 cups cheese and onion. In another bowl, combine eggs, milk, biscuit mix, salt and pepper; mix well. Pour over broccoli mixture; toss gently. Pour into two greased 9-in. pie plates. Bake at 400 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Sprinkle with remaining cheese; return to the oven for 1-2 minutes or until melted. Let stand 5-10 minutes before cutting.

Description: 
Biscuit mix is the secret to the no-fuss crust in the tasty broccoli dish shared by Judy Siegrist of Albuquerque, New Mexico. 'There's no need to roll out a crust--it makes its own as it bakes,' she says. 'I keep one pie in the freezer to thaw and warm up in a jiffy.'
