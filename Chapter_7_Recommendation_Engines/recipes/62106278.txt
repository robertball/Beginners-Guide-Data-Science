Ingredients:
1 package cream cheese
1/4 cup unsalted butter
100 ml heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup superfine flour
1/4 cup cornflour
6 egg yolks
1 tbsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp salt
6 egg whites
3/4 cup fine granulated sugar(divide into 2, one half for the egg yolk mixture and the other for the egg whites)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line the bottom of a 9 inch round cake pan cake pan with parchment paper. Lightly grease the bottom and sides with butter.
Melt cream cheese, butter and heavy whipping cream in a double boiler. Mix really well until the texture is really creamy.
Cool the cream mixture over iced cold bath.
Mix in the flours, egg yolks, sugar,lemon juice.
In a separate bowl, whisk egg white on the highest speed until they can hold a soft peak. Gradually add sugar while continue whipping to stiff peaks.
Mix only 1/3 of the whisked egg white into the cream cheese mixture. Mix it really well.
Fold in the rest of the egg white mixture. Add the whites by thirds, not at once. Fold in gently and do not overmix.
Pour the miixture into the greased round pan.
Place the round pan into a baking pan filled with boiling water (waterbath). Water level should be halfway of the bake pan. Wrap the bottom of round pan with alumunium foil to keep the water from seeping into the pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 Hour or until the top is golden brown.
Turn the oven off, and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for another hour to prevent cracking.
