Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups butter
3/4 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cream butter or margarine; gradually add sugar, beating well.
Add flour, and mix well.  Stir in peppermint extract.
Divide dough in half and place in separate bowls.  Tint half of dough with red food coloring and the other half with the green food coloring.
Roll dough into balls using 1/2 teaspoon dough per ball.  For each wreath shaped cookie, place six balls in a circle, alternating colors, on ungreased cookie sheets.  Press together securely.   Bake for 8 minutes.  Let cool 10 minutes; then remove to racks.  Cool completely.
