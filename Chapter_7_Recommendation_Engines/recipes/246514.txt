Ingredients:
3 cups raw cashews
Crust:
1 cup almonds
1 cup pecans
4 Medjool dates, pitted
2 teaspoons coconut oil, melted
2 teaspoons cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
Filling:
4 cups banana, coarsely chopped
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup coconut oil, melted
Topping:
1/2 cup chopped vegan dark chocolate
1/4 cup coconut milk

Directions:
Soak cashews in a bowl with water to cover, 3 hours to overnight; drain.
Mix almonds, pecans, dates, 2 teaspoons coconut oil, cocoa powder, and salt together in the bowl of a food processor until finely ground and beginning to form a paste, 1 to 3 minutes. Press mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Refrigerate crust until ready to use.
Process cashews in the bowl of a food processor until finely ground. Add banana, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract; blend until combined. Add 3/4 cup coconut oil in a thin stream through the feed tube while processor is running until smooth, thin filling forms. Pour filling into crust and place in the refrigerator until set, at least 4 hours.
Place chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Heat coconut milk in a saucepan until near boiling; pour over chocolate. Whisk until smooth glaze forms. Pour over cake and refrigerate until set, at least 30 minutes more.

Description: 
A vegan cheesecake-type cake, nearly raw (could easily be made raw), soy-free, gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free... and yet still delicious, smooth, and sweet.
