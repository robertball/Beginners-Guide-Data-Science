Ingredients:
1- single pie crust (my family prefers Pilsberry pre-made pie-crusts)
1 c frozen brocolli, thawed and drained
1 1/2 c cubed cooked ham
1 1/2 c or 6 oz swiss cheese, shredded
4 eggs
1 c milk
1/2 t salt
1/2 t dry mustard
1/2 t pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Thaw and drain brocolli.  Dry on a paper towel to remove as much water as possible.  Line 9" pie plate with pie crust.  Layer ham, cheese, and brocolli in pie crust in that order.  In a medium bowl, combine remaining ingredients and beat well.  Pour egg mixture over brocolli.  Cover crust until last 10-15 minutes of baking.  Bake in over for 35-45 minutes or until knife inserted comes out clean.  Eggs should be fully cooked.  Let stand for 5 minute before cutting after removed from oven.
