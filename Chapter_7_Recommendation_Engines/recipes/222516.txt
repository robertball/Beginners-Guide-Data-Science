1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup yellow cornmeal
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 cup chopped fresh chives
1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
1 1/2 cups plain yogurt

3 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups.
Whisk flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Stir in chives and dill.
Whisk yogurt, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl; add to the dry ingredients and stir until just blended into a batter.
Pour 1/3 cup batter into each prepared muffin cup.
Bake in preheated oven until golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing. Serve warm.
