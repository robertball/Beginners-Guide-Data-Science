Ingredients:
2.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs
2 onions, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced (I used the food processor fitted with a slicing disk)
1.5 Tbs olive oil
0.5 oz (weight) ground sumac*
1 tsp cinnamon (I used 1/2 tsp Vietnamese cinnamon)
1/4 tsp ground allspice
1/4 tsp ground cloves
Big pinch saffron (optional, but nice)
Handful of pine nuts
Fresh mint for garnish (optional)
Salt and pepper

Directions:
In a large microwave safe bowl (I used a big glass mixing bowl), combine the onions, olive oil, sumac, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, and saffron. Microwave for 2.5 minutes, stir, then microwave for another 2.5 minutes. If you don't mind dirtying a pan, you can of course saute the onion and add the spices, I just like this shortcut when I'm using the slow cooker.
Dump the chicken into the slow cooker (frozen is fine, just tack another hour onto the cook time if unthawed). Season liberally with salt and pepper. Add the onion mixture and stir, nestling the chicken in the onions.
Cook on low for 6 hours or until done. When ready to serve, saute the pine nuts in a bit of olive oil over medium-high until browned. Finely chop the mint. Taste and add more salt and pepper to the chicken if desired. Serve topped with mint and pine nuts.
