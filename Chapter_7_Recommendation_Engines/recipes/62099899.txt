Description: 
A friends Dad told me about this recipe. I searched allrecipes.com to refresh my memory and was shocked to find nothing like it; so here is my version. 
Quick and delish, I will never shake-n-bake again. Take liberty and add your favorite herbs to the crumb mixture to suit your taste. This would make great chicken fingers as well! The possibilities are endless!
