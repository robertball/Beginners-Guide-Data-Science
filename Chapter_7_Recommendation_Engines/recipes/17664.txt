2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, salt and brown sugar. Stir in the eggs, buttermilk and melted butter all at once. Mix just enough to moisten. Pour batter into prepared pans.
