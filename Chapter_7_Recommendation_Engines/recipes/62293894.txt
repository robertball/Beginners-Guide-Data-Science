Ingredients:
20 wonton wrappers
2 8oz pkg cream cheese
1 pkg dry ranch mix
6 green onions, chopped
Oil for deep frying
small bowl of water

Directions:
Mix cream cheese, ranch mix, and onions until well mixed.
Place a tablespoon of mixture in the middle of the wrapper. Flour side up!
Dip finger in water and run it around the outside of the wrapper and fold. Make sure there are no openings in the seams.
Repeat this process until all mixture is gone.
Place in freezer for 45 mins.
Deep Fry until golden brown. If cheese starts to come out, either its been cooking too long or a seam wasnt secured.
Serve with soy sauce, duck sauce, sweet & sour sauce or even bbq sauce!

Just playing around with wonton wrappers one day and I made this. My husband says he likes them better than our favorite chinese food restaurants! :)
