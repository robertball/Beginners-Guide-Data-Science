DIANNA’S MEATLOAF Recipe

Ingredients:
3 lbs ground beef or chuck
1 lbs pork sausage
1 medium bell peppers, red or green, finely chopped
1 small sweet onion, finely chopped
2 eggs, lightly whisked
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2/3 c milk
3 slices of stale bread
TOPPING:
½ cup tomato sauce
½ cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375°F.
Mix topping ingredients and set aside. Whisk eggs. Add milk to bread and let stand until bread absorbs liquid, then drain milk from bread, but don’t press milk out. In a large bowl, combine the *ground beef or chuck and pork, then once well mixed add remaining ingredients. If meat is low in fat, add up to 1 tablespoon olive oil. Mix well.
Shape meat into a loaf, forming a dome shape. Pour topping mixture over loaf.
**Bake covered 1 ½ - 2 hours, or until meat reaches 160 degrees, uncover for about 10 minutes to allow meat to brown. Allow meat to rest for about 8-10 minutes, this will help when slicing.
Note: *To combine the ground beef or chuck and pork (as pork is normally fibrous and will lump), I let the meat sit out for about 30-minutes and then I mash them together with a potato masher. **I like to cook my meatloaf on a cookie cooling rack in the bottom of a casserole dish, so that the majority of the fat cooks off and the meat doesn’t sit in that fat.
I am not too sure on the serving sizes, but this recipe feeds my family of five with leftovers.
