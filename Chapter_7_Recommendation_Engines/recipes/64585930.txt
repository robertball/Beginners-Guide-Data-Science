Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 medium ripe banana, peeled
1 large egg
1/2 cup or 4.5 oz. creamy peanut butter (for diabetic friendlier, use peanut butter without sweeteners)
3  tablespoons honey (optional)
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
pinch of salt
1/2 cup miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Prepare miniature muffin cups with liners or spray with cooking spray.
In a large blender, add banana, egg, peanut butter, honey, vanilla, baking soda and salt.  Combine on high for about 1 minute until smooth.
Stir in chocolate chips with a spoon.
Fill each muffin cup 3/4 full with batter.
Bake for 8-9 minutes until the centers are firm and a toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.
Makes about 12 mini muffins
