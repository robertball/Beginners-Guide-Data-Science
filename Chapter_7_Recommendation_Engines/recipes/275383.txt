Ingredients:
1 CAULIPOWER® Three Cheese Pizza
4 ounces Brussels sprouts, thinly sliced
3 teaspoons olive oil, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced
2 slices crisp-cooked bacon, crumbled
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place pizza on a sheet pan or pizza pan. Do not allow to thaw before placing in the oven; it should be frozen.
Toss Brussels sprouts with 2 teaspoons olive oil in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. Scatter the Brussels sprouts on the pizza.
Toss the red onion slices with the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil, and arrange on top of the Brussels sprouts.
Sprinkle the bacon over the onions, and top with grated Parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper flakes.
Bake in the preheated oven for 13 to 15 minutes.
