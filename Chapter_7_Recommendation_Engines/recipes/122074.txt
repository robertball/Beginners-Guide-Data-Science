Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
1 1/3 cups sugar, divided
1 egg
1 tablespoon half-and-half cream
1 teaspoon lemon extract
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 egg yolks
1 teaspoon water
1/4 cup finely chopped pistachio nuts
1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon peel

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and 1 cup of sugar. Beat in egg, cream and extract. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until easy to handle.
In a small bowl, beat egg yolks and water. In another bowl, combine pistachios, lemon peel and remaining sugar.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-in. leaf-shaped cookie cutter dipped in flour. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Brush with egg yolk mixture; sprinkle with pistachio mixture.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 6-8 minutes or until edges are set (do not brown). Remove to wire racks to cool.
