Ingredients:
3 Swai fillets;½ cup Miracle Whip; ¾ cup shredded Asagio cheese; ½ cup bread crumbs; salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°.  Lay fillet "skin side" down in bread crumbs. Salt and pepper to taste. Apply Miracle Whip to exposed side of fillet as you would to any sandwich. Place fillet in baking dish (I use disposable pans). Top with Asagio cheese.  Bake 45 to 60 minutes depending on thickness of Swai. Fish is done when flaky. Side with steamed broccoli or any fresh vegetable that is steamed.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe one day standing in front of the freezer for inspiration.  The Swai is a meaty fish that when coupled with Asagio and miracle whip tastes like crab cakes without the hassle.
