Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons sugar
1 teaspoon salt
6 eggs
1 quart buttermilk
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in water; let stand for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients.  Beat eggs, buttermilk and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.  Stir in yeast mixture.  Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.
To make pancakes, pour batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto a greased hot griddle; turn when bubbles form on top of pancakes.  Cook until second side is golden brown.
