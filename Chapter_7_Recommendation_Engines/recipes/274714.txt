Ingredients:
1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 slices fresh ginger
2 pounds pork loin rib tips
boiling water as needed
2 tablespoons rock sugar, or to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce

Directions:
Heat a cast iron pan over medium-high heat. Add oil, ginger and pork rib tips, in that order, to the hot pan. Stir-fry ribs until the surface of the ribs turns golden on all sides, about 5 minutes.
Pour enough boiling water on top of the ribs so the ribs are just covered with water. Cover with a lid and cook for 10 minutes. Remove lid and keep cooking until the water is almost absorbed, 5 to 20 minutes more. Be careful not to burn the ribs. Add rock sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce. Stir until well combined and cook until sauce thickens, 1 to 2 minutes.
