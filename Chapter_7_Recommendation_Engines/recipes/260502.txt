Description: 
Just a recipe I threw together while entertaining my 6-month-old on a soccer night for my older kiddos when we had limited time. This is an alternative to fast food on busy hectic nights. I prechopped my veggies during nap time, so all  I had to do was add them to the Instant Pot®! Garnish with green onions, Cheddar cheese, and bacon.
