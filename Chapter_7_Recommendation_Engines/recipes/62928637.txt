8 strips of bacon, cooked til crisp then crumbled
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped mushrooms
1 (5oz.) package shredded Swiss cheese

1 frozen 9 inch deep-dish pie crust

Directions:
Cook bacon until crisp, then set aside to cool. Reserve bacon grease.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Saute onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms in reserved bacon grease.
Crumble cooled bacon.
In a large bowl mix cheeses, crumbled bacon, onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms. Scoop vegetables out of the bacon grease with a slotted spoon to avoid getting excess grease in the mixture.
Lightly press the mixture into the frozen pie crust.
Mix eggs, half & half, and pepper in a bowl. Pour egg mixture over cheese mixture.
Bake at 400°F for 15 minutes, then reduce oven to 350°F and bake for another 35 minutes.

Description: 
I've followed quiche recipes before, but I always want to put everything in it. So it inspired me to write up my own version based off variations I've tried before. It turns out delicious!
