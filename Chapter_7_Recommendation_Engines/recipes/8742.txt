Ingredients:
3 pounds chicken wings
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup white sugar
¼ cup fish sauce
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 teaspoons paprika
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
⅓ cup minced garlic
3 tablespoons minced jalapeno peppers
¼ cup sliced red bell peppers

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a large bowl combine the broth, sugar, fish sauce, vinegar, cornstarch and paprika. Set aside.
In a hot wok or skillet add the oil, garlic and chiles. Stir fry over high heat until the garlic turns slightly golden, about 4 minutes. Add the broth mixture and stir until it boils and is reduced to about 1 1/4 cups, about 10 to 15 minutes. Keep warm.
Place the chicken wings in a 10x15 inch baking dish and bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven for 60 to 70 minutes (until browned and crisp). Turn occasionally. Drain off the fat. With a slotted spoon, transfer the wings to a platter and pour the garlic sauce mixture over them, mixing well. Garnish with red bell pepper strips if desired.
