Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1 cup shortening
1 tsp salt
2 T vinegar
2/3 cup cold milk
1/2-1 T powdered sugar (optional)

Directions:
mix salt and flour (and sugar if you like).
Carefully cut in shortening until your shortening is in small pieces (do not cream together).
Stir vinegar into milk. Add about 1/2 of the milk mixture to the flour and mix carefully. continue adding milk a little at a time until you have a very soft dough. Do NOT knead! Only mix as much as you need to to get the dough to stick together.
Divide dough in half and roll out on a floured surface. Fill with your pie filling and bake as directed for your pie.
If you need a pre-baked pie shell bake in a preheated 400* oven for 10-12 minutes.
