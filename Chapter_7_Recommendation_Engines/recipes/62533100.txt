Ingredients:
1 lb breakfast sausage
1 lb spicey breakfast sausage
1 cup chopped onion
3 cups diced celery
2 tablespoons of poultry seasonings or sage
2 loaf of bread, ripped in pieces
salt and pepper to taste
2 cups of Milk to moisten as needed
3 eggs

Directions:
Cook sausage, celery and onion. Drain
Add the spices and bread.
Mix the egg with the milk and add to the stuffing.
Stuff the bird.
If there is extra you can bake in a buttered baking dish for about half and hour at 350.
I usually make it the day before. But DO NOT stuff the bird until you bake it :)
