Ingredients:
1/2 cup sugar
2 TBS unsweetened cocoa powder
2 TBS cornstarch
1/8 tsp salt
1 1/3 cups milk
2/3 cup coconut milk (small can is 2/3 cup. I'm pretty sure if you swapped out ALL the milk for coconut milk, it would be awesome, but I just had a small can.)
2 egg yolks (slightly beaten)
2 oz dark chocolate, finely chopped
1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Mix sugar, cocoa, cornstarch, and salt in a saucepan. Slowly mix in milk and coconut milk. Cook over medium heat (continue stirring), until mixture comes to boil. Boil for one minute (still stirring) Slowly stir half the mixture into the egg yolks, and then back into the saucepan on the stove. Boil for one minute. Remove from heat and add in chopped chocolate and vanilla extract. Pour into bowls and  cover (unless you are one of those people who like the "skin", cough, mom) and put pudding in the refrigerator for at least one hour.
Top with toasted coconut and enjoy!
