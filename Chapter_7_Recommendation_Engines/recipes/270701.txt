Mix red pepper flakes, ginger, soy sauce, sugar, mushroom powder, and salt together in a medium bowl.
Strain shallot mixture through a fine mesh sieve over the ginger-pepper flake mixture. Let garlic and shallot pieces cool in sieve before stirring back into the infused oil. Pour into a glass container with a top and chill until ready to use.
