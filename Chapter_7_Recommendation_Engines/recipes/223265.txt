2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet with a rim.
Mix onion, vegetable oil, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; add potato pieces and toss to coat. Spread potatoes into prepared pan in a single layer.

Description: 
These are so good. You can make them with just about anything as a side dish. And even my 5-year-old likes the flavor...so that could say something.
