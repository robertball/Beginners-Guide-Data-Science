Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 cup chopped rhubarb
1/2 cup raisins (optional)
1/2 cup chopped nuts (optional)
3 tablespoons flax seeds (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in a bowl. Set aside.
Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the egg into the butter until completely blended, then stir in the rhubarb.  Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the raisins, nuts, and flax seeds; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.  Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
