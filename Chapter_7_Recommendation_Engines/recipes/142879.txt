Ingredients:
10 frozen strawberries
2 kiwi, peeled and chopped
1/2 medium mango - peeled and diced
1 1/2 bananas, peeled and diced
3 (12 inch) flour tortillas
canola cooking spray
1 cup cinnamon sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine the kiwi, mango, and banana in a bowl. Process the strawberries in a blender until they are liquefied and pour over fruit mixture.  Stir to coat and refrigerate.
Coat both sides of each tortilla with the cooking spray.  Cut them into triangle-shaped wedges and place on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle cinnamon sugar evenly over the chips.  Bake in preheated oven until golden-brown, about 10 minutes.  Allow to cool and serve with the fruit mixture.
