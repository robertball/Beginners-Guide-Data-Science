Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds venison (deer meat)
2 onions, chopped
4 cups fresh mushrooms, sliced
3 tablespoons butter
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
1 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon salt
1 pinch mustard powder
1/8 teaspoon dried parsley

Directions:
Heat butter or margarine in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and saute until translucent; then add meat and saute until browned.
When meat is lightly browned, add mushrooms, garlic, tomato paste, flour, sour cream, salt, mustard powder and parsley. Stir together, reduce heat to low and let simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. The longer it simmers, the more tender the meat will be. Enjoy!

Description: 
This is my all time favorite... I serve it with mash potatoes and green beans.  the sauce makes an excellent 'gravy' for the potatoes. When I don't have deer meat, I use London broil.
