Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) whole milkfish (bangus), or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup white vinegar
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Remove scales from the bangus. Cut a slit into the fish lengthwise along the back to remove gills, intestines, and innards. Spread open the fish to expose the flesh; pat dry all over.
Lay fish flat on a ridged plate and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread garlic over the flesh and pour vinegar on top. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 1 hour to overnight.
Discard marinade and pat fish dry with paper towels.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the fish until golden brown and crispy, 7 to 10 minutes.
