Ingredients:
1 pound (2 cups) dry beans (I use a mix of black, pinto and navy)
8 cups water
4 ounces diced salt pork
1 large onion, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, chopped
1/2 cup molasses
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
The day before, combine the beans and water in slow cooker and cook on high for 4 hours then low for 8 hours.  Put slow cooker with beans and their liquid in refrigerator  overnight.
In the morning, skim off some of the liquid, depending on how dry the beans were, so the beans aren't too soupy.  Stir in the salt pork, onion, jalapeno, molasses, brown sugar, mustard, salt and pepper. Cover, and cook on Low for 12 to 14 hours. Stir before serving.
