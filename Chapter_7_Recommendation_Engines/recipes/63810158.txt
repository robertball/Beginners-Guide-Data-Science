Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup cake flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 1/2cups low-fat buttermilk
1 tablespoon melted butter, optional

Directions:
Heat the oven to 400 degrees and adjust a rack to the center position.
Place the flours, soda, cream of tartar, salt and sugar in a large mixing bowl.
Add the butter and rub it into the flour using your fingers until it is completely incorporated and the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center and add the buttermilk.
Work the liquid into the flour mixture using a fork until the dough comes together in large clumps. Turn the dough onto a work surface and knead briefly until the loose flour is just moistened. The dough will still be scrappy and uneven.
Form the dough into a round about 6 to 7 inches in diameter and place in a cast iron skillet.
Score a deep cross on top of the loaf and place in the heated oven.
Bake until nicely browned and a tested comes out clean when inserted into the center of the loaf, about 40 to 45 minutes.
Remove from oven and brush with a tablespoon of melted butter if desired. Cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature
