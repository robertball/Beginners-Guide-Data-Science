Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups kimchi, or to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 cups diced fully cooked corned beef
3 cups cold cooked rice
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
1/2 cup sliced green onion
2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds
2 teaspoons sesame oil, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon soy sauce

Directions:
Drain kimchi over a pot, reserving the juice.
Meanwhile, coat a pan with olive oil and add corned beef.
Chop kimchi into small chunks; add to the pan. Place pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until mixture is browned to your liking, 4 to 7 minutes. Add rice, kimchi juice, water, and gochujang.
Mix rice mixture together and spread evenly over the pan; cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Mix and pat rice down again. Continue cooking, mixing and pressing rice every 3 to 4 minutes, until evenly browned and crusty, 12 to 15 minutes total.
Mix green onion, sesame seeds, and sesame oil into the fried rice. Taste and season with soy sauce. Stir again. Transfer fried rice to serving bowls.

Description: 
There's nothing quite as deeply and profoundly flavorful as caramelizing fermented foods, which is why you've got to try this kimchi fried rice and top it with 2 poached or fried eggs; the runny yolk will mix into and moisten the rice, taking this to a whole other level. The poached egg also paired quite nicely with my 'landweed' garnish, some fresh nasturtium from my garden, as it does with the much more traditional shredded seaweed.
