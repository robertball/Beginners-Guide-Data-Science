Ingredients:
1 6oz bag baby spinach
2 cups pre-rinsed quinoa
3 cups water
1 cup orange juice
1/4 tsp salt
3/4 cup dried cranberries (craisins)
1/3 cup toasted pumpkin seeds
1 package edamame steam-in-bag cooked and drained
lemon juice from 1/2 lemon
lime juice from 1/2 lime
1 tsp lime zest
1/2 T sugar
1 T olive oil
2 T orange juice (freshly squeezed if possible)
1 tsp orange zest

Directions:
Bring water, orange juice, salt and quinoa to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes until quinoa is done.  Turn off heat.  Add spinach to quinoa and cover with lid so spinach wilts (about 5 minutes).  Meanwhile, combine sugar, lemon juice, lime juice, lime zest, orange zest, olive oil and freshly squeezed orange juice.  Whisk mixture until well combined.
Add edamame, cranberries, pumpkin seeds and juice mixture to quinoa and spinach mixture.  Stir to combine well.  Refrigerate for an hour or more before serving.
