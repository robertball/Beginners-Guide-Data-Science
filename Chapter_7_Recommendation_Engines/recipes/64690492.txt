Ingredients:
5 pork chops, bone in or thick boneless. Surface fat removed.
1/4 tsp pepper
1-2 tbs Avocado oil, or as needed
1 lg clove garlic, finely chopped or micro planed
1/4 cup dry white wine
1 can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 1/4 cup water
2 tbs flour
1/4 cup water
1 tsp low sodium soy sauce, I use Bragg®

Directions:
Heat the oil in the pot using the saute function
Season the chops with pepper
Add two-three chops and brown well, don't rush this step as it adds a lot of flavour to the dish. Move the seared chops to a plate and sear the other two or three.
Add the garlic and cook until just fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Deglaze the pot with the wine, scrapping up any brown bits, simmer until decreased by half
Add the soup and stir in the 1 1/4 cup water.
Simmer until the sauce is smooth.
Add the seared chops and turn to coat.
Put the lid on the pot, closed vent .
Press the pressure function and adjust time for 18 minutes.
Let the pressure come down naturally for 10 minutes and open the vent.
Combine the 1/4 cup water and 2 tbs flour.
Remove the chops from the pot and add the slurry.
Thicken the gravy by using the saute function.
Add the 1 tsp soy sauce and stir well.
Return the chops to the pot and turn to coat.
Note. The gravy will not be thick, use more slurry if that's the constancy that your looking for.
