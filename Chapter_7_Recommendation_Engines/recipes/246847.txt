Ingredients:
Salmon:
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 dash Cajun seasoning
4 (3 ounce) fillets salmon fillets, thawed if frozen
Salsa:
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 tomato, diced
1/4 cup diced red onion
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
8 corn tortillas
1/2 cup shredded mild Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Microwave butter in a small microwave-safe bowl until melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Whisk in lemon juice. Add Cajun seasoning.
Place salmon fillets in a shallow baking dish. Drizzle butter mixture over salmon.
Bake salmon in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Flake into smaller pieces with a fork.
Mix corn, black beans, tomato, red onion, and cilantro in a bowl to make salsa.
Arrange corn tortillas on a baking sheet.
Warm tortillas in the preheated oven for about 5 minutes.
Divide salmon, salsa, and Cheddar cheese among warm tortillas. Wrap up and serve with sour cream and guacamole.

I am a newlywed and made these tacos after I had something similar at a restaurant in town. My husband loved them and thinks I am a brilliant chef and a perfect wife!
