Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups self-rising cornmeal
1/4 cup self-rising flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup cottage cheese
1 onion, chopped
1 1/2 cups grated unpeeled zucchini

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a cast iron skillet.
Mix together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Set aside.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and oil. Stir in the cottage cheese, onion, and zucchini.
Make a well in the dry ingredients and slowly pour in the wet ingredients. Mix until just combined. Pour into the skillet.
Bake until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.
