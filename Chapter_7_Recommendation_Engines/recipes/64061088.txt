Ingredients:
1 can original or buttermilk biscuits
1 block (8 oz) cheese, cut into 16 pieces
1/3 cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons bread crumbs
1 tsp seasoning

Directions:
Heat oven to 350Â°F. Spray 2 9-inch round pans with cooking spray.
Seperate biscuits into into 16 slices. Gently stretch and flatten each dough slice; wrap dough around 1 piece of cheese, making sure to seal cheese completely inside dough. Repeat with each piece of cheese and slice of dough.
Quickly dip each dough-wrapped cheese into melted butter; very lightly coat with bread crumbs. (Do not use too many bread crumbs, just enough for a little texture and flavor.) Place wrapped cheese in pan.
Bake 30 minutes or until tops are golden brown and center rolls are no longer doughy.

Description: 
The great thing about this recipe is that it can be changed to fit your needs.  I use mozzarela and Italian seasoning when I serve Italian, cheddar cheese and garlic powder with tomato soup or colby-jack cheese and adobo seasoning to serve with mexican.
