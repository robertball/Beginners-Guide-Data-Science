Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) bag fresh cranberries
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup water
1 fresh pineapple - peeled, cored, and cut into small chunks
1 mango - peeled, seeded, and diced
1 bunch cilantro, chopped
3 Satsuma mandarin oranges, peeled and segmented
1 sweet onion, diced
1 jalapeno pepper, diced
1/4 cup orange juice

Directions:
Cook and gently stir cranberries, sugar, and water in a large skillet over medium heat until the mixture begins to bubble. Reduce heat to low and cook until cranberries begin to soften and break down, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.
Combine pineapple, mango, cilantro, mandarin oranges, onion, and jalapeno together in a bowl; drizzle with orange juice. Stir cooled cranberries and pineapple mixture together. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.
