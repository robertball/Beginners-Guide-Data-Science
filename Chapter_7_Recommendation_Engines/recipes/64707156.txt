9.21.18 ... Oh, fine.  My "expert" review isn't showing except the first part ... I subbed one whole egg for the two egg whites - what am I going to do with two egg yolks?!  'Pretty sure I overbeat because it was  a tad dry.  I'll go with only two whole eggs next time - more brownie-ish - who doesn't love that?!? - & a 7oz-er of marshmallow cream.  'Didn't add the nuts - allergy - but if I do, I think almonds between marshmallow layer & chocolate icing would be nice.  With being so rich, you can get a lot of servings from a 9x13.  Nice!   I see why Mr Emma likes this so much!  :D. The more I have, the better I like this!
