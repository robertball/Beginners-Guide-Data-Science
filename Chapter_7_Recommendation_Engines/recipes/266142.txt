Ingredients:
4 Gala apples, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
1 cup peeled and chopped fresh apricots (optional)
1/2 cup pitted and sliced cherries (optional)
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon cooking sherry
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground grains of paradise

Directions:
Combine apples, apricots, cherries, honey, lemon juice, butter, sherry, cinnamon, and grains of paradise in a large microwave-safe bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, making sure there is at least 1 inch clearance above the mixture and leaving 1 corner open to vent.
Microwave on high power for 10 minutes. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn halfway through if your microwave does not have a turn table. Uncover and microwave for 3 to 5 minutes if too much liquid was released by the fruit.
Mash fruit with a potato masher until desired chunkiness is reached. Serve immediately or cool and store in the refrigerator.

Description: 
I needed a quick way to use up the last fruit in our fruit bowl (apples, apricots, and cherries), and this microwave applesauce recipe was born. The basic recipe has a great bold flavor and is very customizable; add different kinds of fruit or none at all. It also works well doubled. Fast, easy, and delicious way to get your 5-a-day!
