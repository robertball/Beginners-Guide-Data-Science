3/4 cup butter
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons water
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
2 c andes mint chips
2 eggs
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda

In a large pan over low heat, cook butter, sugar and water until butter is melted.  Add chocolate chips and stir until partially melted. Remove from heat and continue to stir until chocolate is completely melted. Pour into a large bowl and let stand 10 minutes to cool off slightly.
At high speed, beat in eggs, one at a time into chocolate mixture.  Reduce speed to low and add dry ingredients, beating until blended.  Chill dough about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll dough into balls and place on ungreased cookie sheet about 2 inches apart.  Bake 8-10 minutes.
optional - skip adding the mint chips, and instead use the whole andes mints - cut in half and place on top of each cookie immediately after removing from oven
