Ingredients:
1 pound Korean rice cakes
5 tablespoons soy sauce, divided
2 tablespoons sesame oil, divided
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or to taste
1 (8 ounce) container tofu, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon rice wine
2 cloves garlic, minced
ground black pepper to taste
1/2 yellow onion, sliced
1 small carrot
2 green onions
1 teaspoon honey, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, or to taste

Directions:
Defrost frozen rice cakes for 10 minutes in cold water.
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add rice cakes and boil until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain; do not rinse. Mix in 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 1 tablespoon sesame oil. Set aside.
Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Fry tofu in the hot oil until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
Combine remaining 4 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoon honey, rice wine, garlic, and black pepper in a container. Marinate tofu in the mixture.
Cut carrot lengthwise; slice diagonally into thin strips. Cut green onions into 2-inch lengths. Quarter each piece.
Heat the same pan over medium-high heat. Add onion, carrot, and tofu without marinade. Saute until onion and carrot start to soften, 3 to 5 minutes. Add rice cakes and stir-fry for 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in as much marinade as desired. Add green onions. Swirl 1 teaspoon honey and 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil on top.
