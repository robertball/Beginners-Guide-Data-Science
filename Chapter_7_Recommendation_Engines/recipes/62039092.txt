1 (3 ounce) package gelatin, any flavor
1/2 cup water
1 1/2 cup miniature marshmallows (or 12 large marshmallows)

Lightly spray 8 or 9-inch square pan with no-stick cooking spray.
Bring water to a boil in a medium size bowl in a microwave oven. Add gelatin and stir to dissolve completely.
Add marshmallows to gelatin. Microwave 1 minute or until marshmallows are almost melted. Stir until completely melted and mixture is smooth. (Creamy layer will float to top.)
Pour into prepared pan. Refrigerate 45 minutes or until set. Loosen edges using knife dipped in warm water. Starting at one end, roll up tightly. With seam side down, cut into 10 to 12 (1/2-inch) slices. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve.
