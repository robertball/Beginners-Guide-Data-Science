Ingredients:
3 pounds pork spare ribs or pork loin back ribs
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon instant minced onion
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Cut spare ribs into serving-size pieces. Place ribs, bone side down, on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Cover and roast at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. Drain. Combine all the remaining ingredients in a bowl; brush some of glaze on ribs. Roast, uncovered, 30-45 minutes longer or until meat is tender, brushing occasionally with remaining glaze.

Description: 
'BASTING with the honey-and-oil glaze seals in the goodness of these delicious ribs as they bake to a golden brown. They can be prepared in the oven, or on the grill in a foil packet to keep the meat juicy.'
