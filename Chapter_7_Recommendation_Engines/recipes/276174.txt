Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
salt to taste
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup chopped pecans
4 medium skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into strips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a wire rack onto a baking sheet and lightly coat with cooking spray.
Mix maple syrup, mayonnaise, and salt together in a bowl.
Mix panko and pecans together in a separate bowl. Dip chicken into the syrup mixture, followed by the panko mixture. Place onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 15 to 20 minutes.
