Description: 
These meatballs are a favorite for any occasion. I made 14 pounds of meatballs for my sister's graduation party and I only had 1 medium container left over. My mother made sloppy joes and needless to say they had a lot left over because everyone loved these meatballs. Guaranteed favorite!
