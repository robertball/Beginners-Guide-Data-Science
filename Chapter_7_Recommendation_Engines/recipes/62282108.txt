1 plain hamburger bun
1/3 lb ground beef
1 dash salt
1 tablespoon Kraft thousand island dressing
1 slice tomato (or 2 small slices)
1 lettuce leaf

Directions:
Preheat a frying pan over medium heat. Lightly toast the both halves of the hamburger bun, face down in the pan. Set aside.
Separate the beef into two even portions, and form each half into a thin patty slightly larger than the bun. Lightly salt each patty and cook for 2-3 minutes on the first side. Flip the patties over and immediately place two slices of cheese on each one. Cook for 2-3 minutes.
Assemble the burger in the following stacking order from the bottom up: bottom bun, dressing, tomato, lettuce, beef patty with cheese,beef, onion, beef patty with cheese, top bun.
Optional: Omit the bun and wrap in lettuce for Caveman Style
