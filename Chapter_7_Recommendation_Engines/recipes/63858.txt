Ingredients:
1 pound sweet potatoes
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons minced ginger
3 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 jalapeno, minced
2 stalks celery, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 small onion, diced
1 pound pork loin, trimmed and cut in 1/2-inch pieces
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 (16 ounce) cans BUSH'S® Dark Red Kidney Beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth

Directions:
Prick sweet potatoes with fork and microwave on high for 6-8 minutes until tender. Set aside. When cool, peel and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Heat olive oil in large stockpot. Add ginger, garlic and jalapeno and saute until soft, about 2 minutes. Add celery, green pepper and onion, and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
Season pork with cumin, salt and pepper. Push vegetables to one side of stockpot and add pork, browning on all sides. Add BUSH'S BEST Dark Red Kidney Beans, tomatoes, broth and sweet potatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 25-30 minutes, or until pork is tender.  Taste and adjust seasonings. Garnish with a spoonful of relish made from 1 cup chopped pineapple, 2 sliced scallions, and 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro. Serve with hot sauce, if desired.
