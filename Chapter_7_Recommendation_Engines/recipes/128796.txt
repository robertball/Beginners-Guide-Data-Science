Description: 
This is an authentic German cheesecake recipe from my friend Isolde, a dear friend and coworker, gave to me many years ago. Quark is found in Germany and parts of Europe. If you cannot find quark you may substitute fromage frais, yogurt cheese, mascarpone, 2 parts ricotta plus 1 part sour cream, or strained cottage cheese.
