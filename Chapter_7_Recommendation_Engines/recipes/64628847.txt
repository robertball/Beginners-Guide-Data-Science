Ingredients:
600 grams chicken breast
1 Tbsp soy sauce
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1 Tbsp sake
1 Tbsp olive oil

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, salt, pepper, sake and olive oil in a small bowl then mix well.
Wash then dry the chicken with a kitchen paper. Press the chicken several times using the tip of a knife or fork to so that the chicken can absorb the marinade more.
Divide the chicken into 2 equally then put inside a freezer bag. Pour half of the marinade in each freezer bag then massage the chicken gently from the outside of the freezer bag.
Put in the fridge for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to a month. You can steam, or fry or watch my two videos to learn how to use the marinated chicken.
