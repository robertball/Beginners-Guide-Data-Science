Ingredients:
6 plum tomatoes, cut into 1/4 inch slices
1 tablespoon olive or vegetable oil
4 cloves garlic, peeled
1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons minced fresh basil
water
4 (1 inch thick) halibut steaks
TOPPING:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 cup soft bread crumbs
2 tablespoons minced fresh basil
2 tablespoons chopped ripe olives

Directions:
Place tomatoes on a baking sheet; drizzle with oil. Wrap garlic in aluminum foil and place on the baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees F for 20 minutes or until edges of tomatoes are lightly browned and garlic pierces easily with a fork. Place tomatoes and garlic in a food processor or blender; cover and process until smooth. Add vinegar, basil and water to achieve desired thickness; set aside.
Place halibut in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Combine mayonnaise and mustard; spread over fish. Combine bread crumbs, basil and olives; sprinkle over mayonnaise mixture and press down gently. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes or until topping is golden brown and fish flakes easily with a fork. Spoon tomato sauce onto four dinner plates; top with fish.
