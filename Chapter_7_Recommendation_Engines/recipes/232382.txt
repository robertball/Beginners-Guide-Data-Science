Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1 cup solid vegetable oil-butter spread (such as Smart BalanceÂ® sticks), softened
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups shredded unsweetened coconut
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup dark chocolate chips
1 cup chopped unsalted almonds
1 tablespoon plain Greek yogurt (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat brown sugar, vegetable oil butter spread, and egg with an electric mixer in a bowl until smooth. Stir in vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt. Add coconut, flour, and oats; stir until just moistened. Fold in chocolate chips, almonds, and yogurt.
Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 9 to 11 minutes.

Description: 
These cookies are soft and chewy and didn't last a day after making them! Once I thought I HATED coconut, but these made me realize I just didn't like overly sweet coconut. These are fabulous! Made with whole wheat flour and oatmeal, it's a better alternative to the traditional cookie.
