Ingredients:
1 cup diced fully cooked ham
1/2 cup diced sweet red pepper or green pepper
1/2 cup chopped onion
6 eggs, lightly beaten
3/4 cup cottage cheese
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 plum tomatoes, sliced
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a large ovenproof skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, saute the ham, red pepper and onion until ham is lightly browned and vegetables are tender.
In a bowl, combine the eggs, cottage cheese and pepper; pour over ham mixture. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. When the eggs are almost set, broil 4-6 in. from the heat for 1 minute or until top is set. Top with tomatoes and cheddar cheese. Broil 1 minute longer or until cheese is melted.

Description: 
This frittata is a nice change of pace from traditional scrambled eggs. Plus, it looks so pretty on a buffet table.                                         --Ivy Abbadessa, Laxahatchee, Florida
