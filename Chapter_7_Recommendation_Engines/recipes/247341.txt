Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 pounds eggplant, unpeeled, cut into chunks
1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into chunks
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Mix tomato sauce, red wine vinegar, cumin, salt, sugar, and cayenne together in a small bowl.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until golden, about 2 minutes. Add eggplant and red bell pepper; pour in tomato sauce mixture. Simmer, covered, until eggplant and red bell pepper soften, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool, about 10 minutes.
Transfer eggplant mixture to a food processor; pulse until it reaches the desired consistency. Sprinkle cilantro over dip.
