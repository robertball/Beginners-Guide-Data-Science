Ingredients:
2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
3 cups flour
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons margarine, softened
1 cup water
1 cup margarine
1 cup brown sugar, packed
1 cup pecans, chopped

Directions:
Remove baking pan from machine. Place yeast, flour, cinnamon, salt, sugar, 2 tablespoons butter and water in the order that is recommended for the bread maker.
Make sure that no liquid comes in contact with the yeast.
Select dough cycle and press start.
When dough is complete, place dough on floured surface and knead 10 to 12 times.
In a medium saucepan on low heat, melt one cup of butter, stir in brown sugar and pecans. Stir until smooth.  Remove from heat.
Cut dough in one inch chunks.
Drop one chunk at a time into the butter sugar mixture. Thoroughly coat dough pieces, then layer them loosely in a greased Bundt pan, staggering layers so you're plopping each dough chunk over a space between two below.
Let rise in a warm, draft-free spot until dough is just over the top of the pan, 15 to 20 minutes.
Bake at 375ยบ for 20 to 25 minutes or till golden brown.
Remove from oven, place a plate face down in top of the pan and, using oven mitts to hold plate on pan, turn over both until bread slides out onto plate.   Serve warm...and enjoy.

Description: 
Here is a recipe for a bread machine, though it can easily be done in the conventional, muscle building way. You use the dough only setting and do the rest by hand.  For machines that do 1 1/2 - 2 pound capacity.Modified from: Monkey Bread II
