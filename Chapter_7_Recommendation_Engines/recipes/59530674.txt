Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) sweet potato
1/3 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup milk
2 eggs
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)
Roast sweet potatoes for 40-50 minutes (depending on size) until soft.  Let cool 15 minutes, remove skins.
Break apart sweet potato in a bowl.  Add butter, and mix well with mixer. Stir in sugars, milk, eggs, and pumpkin pie spice. Beat on medium speed until mixture is smooth.  Pour filling into an unbaked pie crust.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 55 to 60 minutes, or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.  Pie will puff up like a souffle, and then will sink down as it cools.

Description: 
By roasting the sweet potatoes in the oven they develop a deep caramel flavor, allowing you to cut back on the sugar and butter in this recipe, believe me they won't be missed.  Use pumpkin pie spice to brighten the flavor of the sweet potato.Modified from: Sweet Potato Pie I
