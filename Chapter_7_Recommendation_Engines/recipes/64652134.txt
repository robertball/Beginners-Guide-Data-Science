In a bowl, combine the ground beef or turkey, onion, eggs, breadcrumbs, cheese, salt, pepper and garlic powder; Mix well.
Shape into 1 inch meatballs and place on waxed paper lined cookie sheet.
Refrigerate at least 1 hour to firm up. (I usually do this the night before).
After 4 hours on low, remove lid and carefully place meatballs into the soup.
Cover and cook on HIGH for an additional 4 hours, until all is tender and cooked through,
Serve with additional Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This soup freezes beautifully! My dad grows swiss chard in the summertime and we cook it and freeze it for later use. If your greens are precooked, add them to the soup when you add the meatballs. This would be great with any greens you like. Cook some small shaped pasta or pastina to pour the soup over if you wish... Enjoy!
