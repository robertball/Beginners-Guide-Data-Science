Ingredients:
1 - 5 to 6 pound pork butt
4-5 cloves of garlic (or to taste)
1 can fire roasted tomatoes with chilies
1 cup white cooking wine
Soft flour tacos (your favorite kind)
Whatever else you like to put in your tacos (Hot sauce a must :)

Directions:
Slice the garlic cloves into thin wedges.
Put the Pork Butt into the crock pot fat side up.
Pierce the top of the Butt with a paring knife about 1-1/2 to 2 inches deep all over the surface and insert garlic wedges into the slots.
Pour in the can of tomatoes and chillies
Add the Wine
Cover and cook 8-10 hours on low
When Butt is cooked, remove to platter.  The bone will just fall out if cooked enough.
Using 2 forks, pull the pork apart, shredding it and removing all the fat.
Return the shredded port to the crock pot.
Serve on warmed taco shells (Nuking works great) with your favorite accompaniments.

Description: 
I concocted this recipe by going through the cupboard and the freezer and the wine cabinet :) The pork butt and the crock pot make a perfect match.  It is so easy to make and yummy.
