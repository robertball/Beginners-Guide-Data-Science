Description: 
I made this recipe one night when pressed for time.  I had a taste for Asian flavors and not many ingredients in the pantry.   Mildly spicy and super fast to prepare, this recipe is an easy after work meal.  The type of protein or vegetable used could easily be adapted to whatever you have on hand!
