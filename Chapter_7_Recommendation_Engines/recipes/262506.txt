Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) salmon fillets
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Place salmon fillets into the baking pan and sprinkle evenly with lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper.
Combine panko, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder in a bowl. Sprinkle mixture evenly over the salmon.
Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly browned and salmon flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
Of all the recipes I make, this one is my husband's favorite for salmon. It's made with panko, or Japanese bread crumbs, which are very light and crunchy, mixed with Parmesan cheese. It's baked in the oven until the panko is nice and toasted.
