Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups panko bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon ground thyme
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/3 cup spicy brown mustard
1/3 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed
6 tilapia fillets

Directions:
Stir together the panko crumbs, salt, paprika, thyme, black pepper, and dried parsley in a bowl until thoroughly combined. In another bowl, mix the brown mustard and mayonnaise until smooth.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat until the oil shimmers. Dip each tilapia fillet into the mustard mixture, then coat on all sides with the seasoned panko crumbs. Lay the coated fillets gently into the hot oil, and cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.
