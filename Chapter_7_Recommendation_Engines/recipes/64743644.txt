3 large bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts, about 4 lbs
Brine:
4 cups water
1/4 cup kosher salt
2 tbsps brown sugar
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar

1 tsp ground black pepper

1/2 tsp onion powder

1. Brine Chicken: In a large dish, combine water, kosher salt, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar. Stir until salt and brown sugar are dissolved. Place chicken breasts in brine, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
2. Preheat electric smoker according to manufacturer's directions to 225 degrees using maple wood chips.
3. Remove chicken breasts from brine and rinse under cold water. Pat dry.
4. Combine dry rub ingredients, and sprinkle over all sides of chicken breasts. Place chicken breasts skin side up on a grill rack in the preheated smoker. Place a drip pan underneath. Smoke chicken breasts at 225 degrees for about 4 hours, adding maple wood chips as necessary to keep the smoke continuous, or until chicken breasts reach an internal temp of 160 degrees.

Description: 
This is a delicious and different way to enjoy chicken breasts, with plenty of smoky flavor! Brining the chicken before smoking allows it to stay moist and flavorful. They are a great addition to a salad, on a sandwich, or just by themselves!
