Ingredients:
1 (19.8 ounce) package fudge brownie mix
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup baking cocoa

Directions:
Prepare and bake brownie mix according to package directions for fudge-like brownies. Cool completely on a wire rack. In a small mixing bowl, cream the butter, confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Place in a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag; cut a small hole in a corner of bag; set aside.
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Dust with cocoa; set aside. Cut brownies into 15 rectangles. Using a 1-1/2-in. heart-shaped cookie cutter, cut out a heart from the center of each brownie. Reserve cutout centers for another use. Place brownies on prepared baking sheet. Pipe frosting into centers of brownies.

Description: 
In Austin, Texas, Susan Ohlendorf found a fun way to show her loved ones how much she cares. She prepares brownies from a mix, cuts a heart shape out of each one and fills the center with homemade frosting. 'Our grandson loves to eat the little heart-shaped brownies that are left over,' she notes.
