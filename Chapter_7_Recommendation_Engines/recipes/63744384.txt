Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoon(s) cooking oil
1 small onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoon(s) ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon(s) ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon(s) fresh-ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon(s) cayenne
1 quart(s) canned low-sodium chicken broth or homemade stock
2 cup(s) canned unsweetened coconut milk
5 teaspoon(s) Asian fish sauce (nam pla or nuoc mam) or soy sauce
1 3/4 teaspoon(s) salt
2 strip(s) (3-inch-long) lime zest
1/2 pound(s) egg fettuccine
1 pound(s) boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 3), cut into 14-inch slices
2 tablespoon(s) lime juice
3 tablespoon(s) chopped cilantro (optional)

Directions:
In a large pot, heat the cooking oil over moderately low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is translucent, about 5 minutes.
Add the garlic, coriander, ginger, black pepper and cayenne; cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.
Add the broth, coconut milk, fish sauce, salt and lime zest.
Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the fettuccine until just done, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Add the chicken to the soup and simmer until just done, about 1 1/2 minutes.
Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the fettuccine, lime juice and cilantro, if using.
Serve the soup in bowls with a fork and spoon.

Wine Recommendation: The spices and the coconut milk will be best accompanied by a wine with a hint of sweetness. Try a chenin blanc from California or a demi-sec version of Vouvray (also made from the chenin blanc grape).
