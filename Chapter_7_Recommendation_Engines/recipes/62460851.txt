Description: 
I adapted a traditional whole wheat muffin recipe to more suit my clean-eating lifestyle. That means avoiding processed and/or refined food ingredients and using foods as close to their natural state as possible. Ingredients like coconut oil, Sucanat (non-refined evaporated cane juice) and a vast array of whole grain flours are easily found these days, as more and more people discover the vast health benefits of eating clean.
