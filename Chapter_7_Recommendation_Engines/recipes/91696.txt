Description: 
Give your Thanksgiving dinner a twist this year.  You will be pleasantly surprised at the indescribable flavor of this turkey.  Well, WOW comes to mind. I got the general recipe from a German friend of mine with an added twist of my own.  I have had so many raves about my turkey that everyone now comes to my house on Thanksgiving.  Definitely a crowd pleaser, there has never been left over turkey at my house. Thanks Evelyn :)
