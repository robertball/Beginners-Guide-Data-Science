Description: 
My green savory drink.

 I couldn't find a recipe that I liked online, so I made my own. I use a VitamixÂ® 7500 and crank it up to 7 or 8 for 35 to 45 seconds and it's smooth and drinkable. I blend rather than juice because I can't rationalize throwing out fruit/vegetable pulp. Throw one of these back every day and feel the power! 

Let me know what you think.
