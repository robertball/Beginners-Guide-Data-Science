1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until just blended. Mix in the quick oats and chocolate chips. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
These cookies are sweet and chewy.  Use store brand or sale priced baking items and substituting half the butter for margarine help to keep this recipe cost effective.  This recipe is great without the walnuts, or you can substitute any extra nuts or dried fruits hiding in your cupboard that need to be used up!Modified from: Chewy Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies
