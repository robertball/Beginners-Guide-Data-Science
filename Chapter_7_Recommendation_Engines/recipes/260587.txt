Ingredients:
7 eggs, divided
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup fine bread crumbs
canola oil for frying
1 tablespoon lemon zest (optional)
1 teaspoon black truffle salt

Directions:
Immerse 6 eggs in a large pot or container of water with a sous vide insert. Set temperature to 148.1 degrees F (64.5 degrees C); cook for 1 hour. Let eggs cool in a bowl of tepid water for 10 minutes.
Turn on your faucet to very low. Crack each cooked egg into your hand carefully and let the white drip away under the water. Place yolks in a bowl.
Combine flour, sea salt, and baking powder in a small bowl. Whisk the remaining egg in a second bowl. Spread breadcrumbs on a plate.
Heat about 1 1/2 inches oil in a large saucepan to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C).
Roll each yolk gently in the flour mixture. Dip into the egg wash and roll in the breadcrumbs. Place coated yolks in the hot oil; fry until lightly golden brown, about 30 seconds. Drain on a paper towel. Sprinkle lemon zest and truffle salt on top.

Description: 
If sous vide eggs had been invented 2,000 years ago, there would have been entire books of the Bible dedicated to their praise. But at the last meeting of the Jet City Gastrophysics, we took a giant leap forward. You see, the beauty of a sous vide egg lies in its exquisite texture. After about an hour in the water bath, the yolks become buttery with nearly the texture of pudding. The only way to improve on this amazing transformation is to add a crunchy shell. These fried eggs make excellent tapas, particularly if your guests aren't expecting what's inside. Perhaps in another thousand or so years, we'll discover something even more delicious.
