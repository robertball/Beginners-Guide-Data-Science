Ingredients:
vegetable cooking spray (such as I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!Â®)
1 egg, beaten
1 1/4 cups panko bread crumbs
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 skinless, boneless chicken tenders, cut into 1/2-inch strips lengthwise

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or wax paper and spray with cooking spray.
Place egg in a shallow dish. Place bread crumbs, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper into a large zip-top freezer bag and mix well. Dip 2 chicken strips into egg and then place into bread crumb mixture and shake to coat. Place coated chicken pieces onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chicken.
Spray each chicken tender with cooking spray 2 times.
Bake tenders in the preheated oven for 7 minutes; flip, continue to bake on opposite side until no longer pink in the centers, about 7 minutes more. Remove from the oven.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Broil tenders in the preheated oven for extra crunch, about 2 minutes more.
