Description: 
A dish my mother made for special occasions.  According to some sources, Shrimp de Jonghe was invented at the turn of the 20th century by the De Jonge brothers, Belgian immigrants and owners of De Jongheâ€™s Hotel and Restaurant in Chicago. This garlicky, herbed casserole is one of the earliest Windy City specialties. This dish can be served as an appetizer or main course.
