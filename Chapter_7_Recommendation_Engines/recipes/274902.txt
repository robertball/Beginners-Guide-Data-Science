Ingredients:
1 cup pumpkin seeds
1 cup sliced almonds
1 cup sunflower seeds
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup shredded coconut
1/2 cup raisins
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup coconut oil
1/4 cup raw honey
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine pumpkin seeds, almonds, sunflower seeds, walnuts, coconut, raisins, pumpkin pie spice, and salt in a large bowl.
Combine coconut oil, honey, maple syrup, and vanilla extract in a saucepan over low heat. Stir until melted, about 5 minutes. Pour over pumpkin seed mixture and mix very well. Spread granola across parchment paper and flatten out evenly.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, watching to prevent burning, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool before indulging!
