Ingredients:
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1/2 cup minced fresh rosemary
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest
8 cloves garlic, minced
1 (7 pound) bone-in leg of lamb, trimmed of excess fat and tied
salt
1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 teaspoon water

Directions:
Adjust oven to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C).
Mix honey, mustard, rosemary, pepper, lemon zest and garlic in a small bowl.  Spread 3/4 of this mixture over lamb, season with salt and place on a shallow roasting pan.  Use the remaining honey mixture to baste the roast during cooking.
Roast the lamb in preheated oven for about 1 hour and 30 minutes for medium-rare to 1 hour 45 minutes for medium, or until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest section of the roast registers 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium-rare to 155 degrees F (68 degrees C)  for medium-well.
Remove lamb from oven, transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes prior to cutting and while making the gravy.
Set roasting pan over 2 burners at low heat and pour in 1 cup of water.  While it is heating up, scrape the pan until all of the browned bits are loose. Strain pan juices into a small saucepan; return to heat, add vinegar and bring to a boil. Whisk in cornstarch; continue to simmer until gravy thickens. Carve lamb into slices and serve with warmed juices alongside.
