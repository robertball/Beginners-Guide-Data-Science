Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Press cookie dough into the bottom of a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until light-golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely.

Description: 
I have been making these for about 10 years and have had many requests for the recipe. They are easy to make and disappear so quickly, if you don't grab one you might miss your chance! Serve immediately or refrigerate. Bars cut more easily if refrigerated first.
