Ingredients:
2 Cups Brown Sugar
2 Cups All purpose flour
1 stick of softened butter
1 tsp vanilla
dash of salt
1 tsp baking soda
1 slightly beaten egg
1 Cup of buttemilk or sour milk
4 oz crushed candy bars

Directions:
Crush candies by originally freezing them, then crushing them in the wrappers with a hammer or chopping them up in the cuisinart.
Preheat oven to 350
grease 9x13 pan, line with foil and spray foil with cooking spray.
Combine brown sugar and flour, mix together and then add the butter, cutting in until it begins to resemble pie crust.
Remove 1 cup of the flour/sugar/butter mixture and set aside.
Combine flour mixture with vanilla, salt, baking soda, egg, and milk.  Mix until moistened, not too well mixed.  Pour into pan.  Sprinkle dry cup of flour mixture over top, and top with crushed candies.
Bake for 30-35 minutes.
Once cake is cool you can remove from the pan with foil and fold back the foil to cut.  The recipe called for the foil, and at first I thought it was odd but it prevents the cake from sticking to the pan :)

Description: 
This recipe was made by a good friend's aunt for all her new neighbors and activities at church in Harbor Beach, MI.  She recently passed away and this recipe has been given to all of her friends and family to pass on the tradition.  It's much sweeter than most coffee cakes, definately a treat warm or room temp :)
