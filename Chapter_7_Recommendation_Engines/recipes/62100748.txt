Description: 
This is an old, treasured recipe of my moms.  I have 6 brothers who range 15 years in age, and we all adore this recipe.  Mom would have to hide the pan to keep them from disappearing.  The recipe is easy and the result is a moist, dense, cake-like brownie with a fudge-like frosting.  The recipe may be doubled to make a 9x13 pan, but remember to adjust the baking time.
