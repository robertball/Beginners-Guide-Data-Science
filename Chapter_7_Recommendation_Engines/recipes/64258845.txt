Ingredients:
10 small soft flour tortillas (or corn if you prefer)
3 tablespoons flour
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup sour cream
2 1/2 cups shredded and cooked chicken (we like to use rotisserie chicken)
3 cups Monterey Jack cheese  shredded
3 tablespoons butter
4oz can diced green chillies (I like medium  they are not spicy at all)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Combine shredded chicken and 1 cup of cheese
Fill tortillas with the mixture above and roll each one then place in a greased 9×13 pan
Melt butter in a pan over medium heat
Stir flour into butter and whisk for 1 minute over heat.
Add broth and whisk together. Cook over heat until it’s thick and bubbles up
Take off heat and add in sour cream and chilies. (be careful it’s not too hot or the sour cream will curdle)
Pour mixture over enchiladas and add remaining cheese to top.
Bake in oven for 20-23 minutes then you will want to broil for 3 minutes to brown the cheese.
