Ingredients:
2 spaghetti squash
1 1/2 tablespoons salt
1 1/2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 zucchini - quartered lengthwise, seeds removed, and sliced
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced, or to taste
1 1/2 cups trimmed and chopped fresh green beans
1 tomato, diced
1/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Poke 10 holes in each spaghetti squash and place in an ovenproof baking pan.
Bake squash in the preheated oven until softened, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine salt, Italian seasoning, pepper, garlic powder, oregano, onion powder, and basil in a bowl.
Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add zucchini; cook and stir for 3 minutes. Add red bell pepper, garlic, and 1/2 of the spice mixture. Cook and stir for 3 minutes more. Add green beans, tomato, and remaining spice mixture. Cook and stir filling together for about 6 minutes.
Cut each cooled spaghetti squash in half lengthwise. Remove and discard seeds. Fill each squash half with filling and return to the baking pan. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove and uncover; top squash evenly with mozzarella cheese. Return to the hot oven and bake until melted, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle chives on top before serving.
