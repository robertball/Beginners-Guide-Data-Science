Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups chopped pecans
4 large eggs
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup light corn syrup
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter, melted and cooled
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons bourbon
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
1 (9 inch) unbaked deep dish pie crust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Spread pecans over a cookie sheet.
Bake pecans in preheated oven until toasted, about 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. Check pecans after 30 minutes. Allow pecans to cool completely.
Increase oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk eggs, brown sugar, light corn syrup, flour, butter, white sugar, bourbon, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth. Fold pecan pieces and chocolate chips into the egg mixture until combined; pour into prepared pie crust.
Bake in preheated oven until pie is set, 50 to 60 minutes. Serve warm or chilled.
