Ingredients:
4 cups chicken broth
2 cups long grain white rice
1/2 cup butter
salt to taste

Directions:
Place the chicken broth and rice in a large pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 15 minutes.
During the last 5 minutes of the rice, melt the butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat until it browns and the foam starts to clear. It will be a dark brown, similar to chocolate.
After the rice has simmered for the 15 minutes, remove it from the heat. Pour the burnt butter over it, being careful not to spatter. Do not stir into the rice. Replace the lid, and let stand for 15 minutes. Stir and season with salt to taste before serving.

Description: 
Awesome rice cooked in chicken broth, then topped with burnt butter! A family favorite that my Greek grandpa used to make! My dad loves it with plain yogurt on top, and my mother, with buttery tomato sauce. Great with everything!
