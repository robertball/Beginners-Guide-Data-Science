Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) package raspberry flavored Jell-OÂ® mix
2 cups boiling water
1 (16 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, undrained
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped pecans
1 teaspoon orange zest
1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup whipped topping

Directions:
Place the gelatin into a bowl, pour in the boiling water, and stir until the gelatin dissolves. Mix in the cranberry sauce, pineapple, celery, pecans, and orange zest until evenly blended. Pour the gelatin mixture into a mold or serving dish.
Chill in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 8 hours.
To make the topping, beat the cream cheese with half of the whipped topping. Fold in the remaining whipped topping until well blended. Unmold the gelatin, and spread with the topping mixture.

Description: 
My grandmother made this salad every Thanksgiving. It is delicious even without its creamy topping. This side dish is so yummy, I sometimes make it even when it's not Thanksgiving! Depending on your salad's shape, you can spread the topping in a layer over the Jell-O; or if you use a ring mold, put the topping in the center. Alternately, you could serve the topping in a bowl on the side, so it's optional.
