Description: 
A Chinese take on the holiday roast turkey. The sauce is a sweet and spicy flavorful glaze
on the crispy skin of the turkey with a hint of orange and cranberry. The whole red peppers
with green onions on the side add a festive touch. The dressing is a savory rice dressing with cranberries and nuts. Sure to become a year round favorite.
