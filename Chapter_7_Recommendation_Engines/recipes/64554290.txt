Ingredients:
2 Large Grade A Cage Free Eggs
1 Tbsp Milk
1 Tsp Butter
Salt & Pepper
Fillings

Directions:
Place butter into pan
Heat a small skillet or omelet pan over medium-low heat just until butter is melted
Coat pan with butter using spatula or by lifting and tilting pan
Scramble eggs and milk in a bowl with a fork until well combined
Pour eggs into pan and spread into a 7-8" circle
Allow eggs to cook for 15-30 seconds then place toppings on one half of eggs
Continue cooking over medium-low heat until eggs are about 75% cooked through.  Do not stir eggs or move them around.
Using a spatula or two, gently lift the side of the eggs without toppings and fold over the top of the eggs with toppings.
Add salt & pepper to taste
Cook for another 30-45 seconds and then plate (Eggs will not be 100% cooked inside the fold, leave them this way)
