Ingredients:
2 pounds pork ribs, cut into 2-inch sections
1 pound boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes
1/2 cup water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 onion, quartered
6 tomatillos, husked and quartered
2 serrano chile peppers
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
water to cover
4 cloves garlic, peeled
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 bunches purslane

Directions:
Combine pork ribs, pork shoulder, water, and salt in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. Uncover and increase heat to medium-high. Continue cooking and stirring constantly until all liquid has evaporated and pork has browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
Combine onion, tomatillos, serrano peppers, and cilantro in a medium saucepan. Add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until tomatillos are tender and have changed color, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer vegetable mixture to a blender; add garlic and and blend carefully until sauce is smooth.
Pour sauce into the Dutch oven, season stew with salt and pepper, and simmer for 1 hour. Add purslane and simmer until pork is tender and purslane is soft, about 20 minutes more.

Description: 
Purslane, known as verdolagas, tastes like a cross between spinach and cucumbers. Verdolagas are very common in Mexican kitchens, especially in pork stews. Comfort food at its best!
