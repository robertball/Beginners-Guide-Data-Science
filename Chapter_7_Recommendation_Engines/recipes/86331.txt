Description: 
This salad has become a staple of my kitchen. I like that it is a chopped salad, a technique that virtually ensures each bite will include every ingredient. There is something magical about the pine nut and Parmesan combination, a fact that will not be lost on pesto lovers. This is one of those rare recipes that justifies the expense of imported Parmigiano-Reggiano.
