Ingredients:
1 lb Lump Crab Meat
20 Saltine Crackers
1 tablespoon minced chives or parsley
1/2 tablespoon Rosemary
1 tablespoon Old Bay Seasoning
1/4 cup lite mayonnaise
1 large egg
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup (60 ml) canola oil, or mild flavored oil
1 tablespoon butter
Lemon wedges, for serving

Directions:
Drain the crabmeat, if necessary, and pick through it for any rogue shells
Toss the cracker crumbs, herbs and spices and crabmeat together, using your fingers to gently break apart some of the lumps.
Whisk the mayonnaise, egg, mustard and Worcestershire sauce together then stir into the crab mixture until mixed. It will look somewhat loose.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 3 hours.
Scoop the crab mixture into six 1/2-cup mounds and lightly pack into 6 patties, about 1 1/2 inches thick.
Position an oven rack 6 to 8 inches from the top of the oven. Turn broiler to high.
In a oven-safe skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. When the oil shimmers, add crab cakes to pan. Cook until the underside of the cakes are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
Cut the butter into six pieces then add one to the top of each crab cake. Slide the pan under the broiler and cook until the tops are well browned, 5 minutes
Remove from Pan and put on napkin to absorb any grease
**Oven Cooking **
Preheat oven to 425
Place crab cakes on lightly buttered baking sheet
Bake for 12 minutes, flip and bake an additional 3-4 minutes or until golden brown
