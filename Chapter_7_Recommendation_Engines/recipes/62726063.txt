We've paired up these south-of-the-border spuds with perfectly poached eggs. Our secret for keeping the eggs intact? Adding a dash of vinegar to the cooking water.
Details Read all reviews (16) Ingredients
4 cup(s) water
1 Tbsp vinegar
4 large egg(s)
2 tsp olive oil
29 oz drained canned whole new potatoes, diced
1/2 cup(s) salsa
1/2 cup(s) low-fat shredded cheddar cheese
Instructions
Preheat broiler.
In a large saucepan over high heat, bring water to a boil. Add vinegar and reduce heat to medium.
Carefully crack eggs into 4 separate small-size bowls (yolks should remain intact). Add eggs to saucepan one at a time, and simmer until egg white is cooked and yolk starts to solidify, about 2 minutes. Remove poached eggs with a slotted spoon; set aside.
Heat oil in a large oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Add potatoes and sauté until golden brown, stirring frequently, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add salsa and cook to heat through, about 1 minute. Top potatoes with poached eggs and sprinkle with cheese.
Place pan under broiler and broil until cheese melts, about 1 minute. Serve hot. Yields about 2/3 cup potato hash and 1 egg per serving.
