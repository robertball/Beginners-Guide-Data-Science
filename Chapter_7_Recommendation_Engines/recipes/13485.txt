Ingredients:
6 small miniature sugar pumpkins
2 tablespoons brown sugar
3 teaspoons butter
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or as needed
1 cup water, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut off the top of each pumpkin, reserving the tops, and scrape out all of the seeds. Place 1/2 teaspoon butter and 1 teaspoon of brown sugar inside each pumpkin. Sprinkle ground cinnamon on the butter and brown sugar mixture. Put the pumpkin "lids" back on and arrange pumpkins in a baking dish with a little water in the bottom.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until tender, about 45 minutes.
