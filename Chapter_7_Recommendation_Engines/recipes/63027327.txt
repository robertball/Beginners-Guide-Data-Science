Description: 
My best friend in high school's mom made this for me when I had my first overnight stay in a hospital.  I loved it so much that I made it whenever I got the chance.  When we lived overseas, my mom had to limit the number of times I could make it because butter was so expensive.  Now it's part of my Christmas baking.
