Ingredients:
2-3 lb Pork Tenderloin Roast
1 Small onion, sliced
1 T. Onion powder
1 T. Garlic powder
1 T. White pepper
1 T. Salt
1/4 c. Dijon Mustard
Water or broth or apple juice if needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place the onion slices in the bottom of a roasting pan. Combine the onion powder, garlic powder, white pepper and salt in a small bowl. Rub the entire roast with the spice combination. Brush the Dijon mustard over the entire roast. Place the roast on top of the sliced onions. Cover the entire pan with foil and seal the edges.
Cook for one hour, then check the pan to make sure there are some juices in the bottom of the pan. If the pan seems dry, add just enough of your favorite liquid to cover the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat to 300, reseal the foil, and cook for an additional 30 minutes. Remove the roast from the oven, leaving the foil in place and allow it to rest for 20 minutes before slicing and serving.
