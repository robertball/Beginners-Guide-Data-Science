Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) box rigatoni pasta
1/2 small red onion
4 cloves garlic, peeled
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
2 medium tomatoes, cored
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup diced fresh mozzarella cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
While the pasta is cooking, puree onion and garlic in the bowl of a food processor.
Heat oil and butter in a medium pan over medium-low heat. Add onion and garlic; simmer until fragrant, about 3 minutes.
Puree tomatoes in the food processor. Add tomatoes to the onion mixture; simmer for 5 minutes. Mix in oregano, parsley, salt, and pepper. Add cooked rigatoni and Parmesan cheese; mix well.
Remove from heat. Toss in mozzarella cheese and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
My family and I love bruschetta. This pasta dish is a twist on the traditional bruschetta appetizer. We like to use rigatoni or shell pasta. Serve with grilled chicken.
