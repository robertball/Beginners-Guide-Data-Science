Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-OÂ®
1/2 cup cold water
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
4 eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (10 ounce) package frozen strawberries, thawed
6 tablespoons butter
2 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9 inch round cake pans.
In a large bowl, dissolve the gelatin in cold water; stir in the cake mix, eggs, vegetable oil, flour and 1/2 of the strawberries.  Beat for 5 minutes on the medium speed of an electric mixer.  Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the layers spring back when lightly pressed in the center.  Cool cakes in the pans on wire racks.
To Make Frosting:  Cream the butter, sugar and the remaining half of the strawberries in a medium bowl until light and fluffy, adding additional confectioners' sugar if needed for a spreadable consistency.  Spread the frosting between layers and over the top and sides of cake.
