Description: 
This dish is simple, tasty, and-best of all-fast. I've made it with both peeled and unpeeled shrimp. Unpeeled was definitely messier to eat, but I think on the whole the unpeeled shrimp were a little juicier. This recipe is tasty without the tequila, too. I love garlic, so I use an insane amount of it in this dish.
