Title:
BBQ Zucchini Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 lbs. zucchini, quartered
2 tbsp. garlic powder
2 tbsp. onion powder
1/4 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. black pepper
2 tsp olive oil

Directions:
Step 1 – Place all ingredients into a plastic bag, and gently shake until the zucchini is coated in the oil and spices.
Step 2 – Place on BBQ and cook. (Much of the oil will be left behind in the bag. That’s okay. I just toss it with the bag.)
NOTE: For crispier/crunchier zucchini, cook on higher heat for a shorter time. For a softer zucchini, cook on lower heat for a longer time.
Step 3 – When the zucchini is cooked to your liking, remove from the grill and allow to cool. These retain A LOT of heat. So cooling time is essential.
Eat and Enjoy!
