Description: 
These are the best I've had, short of the actual grilling method of course!!  This is a very simple recipe that I came up with a few years ago.  It's not rocket science, just ribs cooked in the slow cooker, and finished in the oven.  This is what I do when I want ribs during the week, and have to work all day.  I'm eating them within a half hour of getting home, and they turn out perfect every time!!
