Ingredients:
12 slices bacon
10 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 cans (10 ounces each) Old El Paso® green or red enchilada sauce
10 flour tortillas (8 inches in diameter)
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend (8 ounces)
Sour cream, if desired
Taco sauce, if desired

Directions:
Heat oven to 350°.
Spray rectangular baking dish, 13x9x2 inches, with cooking spray.
Cook bacon in 10-inch skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until very crisp.
Remove bacon from skillet, reserving 1 tablespoon drippings in skillet.
Drain bacon on paper towels; crumble bacon and set aside.
Beat eggs, milk, onion powder and cumin in medium bowl with wire whisk until well blended.
Pour into skillet with bacon drippings.
As mixture begins to set at bottom and side, gently lift cooked portions with metal spatula so that thin, uncooked portion can flow to bottom; avoid constant stirring.
Cook 5 to 7 minutes or until eggs are thickened throughout but still moist; do not overcook.
Pour 1/2 can of the enchilada sauce over bottom of baking dish.
Fill each tortilla with about 1/3 cup eggs, 1 tablespoon bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese; roll up.
Place seam side down on enchilada sauce in dish.
Pour remaining 1 1/2 cans enchilada sauce over filled tortillas.
Top with remaining cheese and bacon.
Bake uncovered about 20 minutes or until thoroughly heated and bubbly.
Serve with sour cream and taco sauce.
