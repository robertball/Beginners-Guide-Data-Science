Ingredients:
3/4  cup cornmeal
1 cup low-fat (1%) buttermilk
1/2 cup warm water
1 3/4 cup white whole wheat flour
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons honey
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg yolk
2 egg whites
2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup diced jalapeno peppers
1/2 cup corn kernels, frozen and thawed
1/2 cup (2 ounces) sharp cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line muffin tin with paper liners.
In a small mixing bowl, soak the cornmeal in 1 cup of buttermilk and ½ cup warm water for 10 to 15 minutes
Meanwhile, mix the remaining four dry ingredients in a medium size mixing bowl.
In stand mixer that has been outfitted with the paddle attachment beat the egg yolk with the extra virgin olive oil and agave (or honey) for two minutes until combined.  Add the cornmeal-buttermilk mixture and mix to combine.
Add the dry ingredients in three stages, scraping the bowl down after each addition.
Fold in the jalapeno peppers, corn kernels, and cheddar cheese.
Whip the reserved egg whites to medium peak. Add a small amount of the whites to the batter and mix in, to lighten the batter. Add the remaining whites and fold carefully to fully incorporate while taking care not to deflate the lightened batter.
Scoop into muffin tins. Fill the tins two-thirds full.
Bake for 20 to 22 minutes.
