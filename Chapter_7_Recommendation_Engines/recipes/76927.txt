Salmon Hash With Potatoes & Dill Recipe

Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil
1 large onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice
1 pound Boneless, skinless salmon fillet, cut into 1/2-inch dice
1 1/2 pounds starchy potatoes (such as Idaho), cut into 1/2-inch dice
2 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
2 tablespoons water
1 pinch Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat 2 Tbs. oil over low heat in a 12-inch non-stick skillet (so potatoes don't stick). While skillet heats, prepare onion and salmon as directed above. A few minutes before cooking, increase heat to medium-high. When oil starts to send up wisps of smoke, add onion and salmon; cook, stirring often, until golden brown. Meanwhile, dice potatoes and toss with remaining oil. Transfer salmon mixture to a bowl and reserve.
Add potatoes to empty skillet; cook, stirring only occasionally so they form a golden-brown crust, about 10 minutes. As potatoes cook, mix ketchup, mustard, fresh dill and 2 Tbs. of water. (Recipe can be prepared to this point up to 2 hours ahead. Spread hot potatoes on a large lipped cookie sheet; cover when cool. Return skillet to medium-high; add potatoes and re-crisp.)
Return reserved salmon mixture to skillet; stir in ketchup mixture, then season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until hash has nicely browned, about 5 minutes longer.

Description: 
One of my favorite things to order when I go out to breakfast is hash - corned beef, roast beef or any other variation - which got me to thinking about trying to make it at home. After all, the ingredients are simple: As long as you've got some kind of protein, potatoes and onions, you're in business. And it makes a fast brunch or even light supper dish, with or without poached eggs.
