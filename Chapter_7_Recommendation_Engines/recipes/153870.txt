Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup vegetable oil
2 dashes hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabascoâ„¢), or to taste
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
salt and pepper to taste
8 ounces frozen thinly sliced beef tenderloin carpaccio.
1 tablespoon capers, for garnish
1 lemon, cut into wedges

Directions:
In the container of a blender, combine the eggs, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, a pinch of salt and a dash of hot sauce. Cover and pulse to mix. Start the blender on medium speed and let run while pouring in the olive oil, and then the vegetable oil, in a thin continuous stream until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon. Pour in the Worcestershire sauce and blend for about 10 seconds more. Taste and adjust salt if needed.
Arrange the frozen beef on a serving plate in a semi-circle. Drizzle the sauce over the meat. Garnish with capers and freshly ground black pepper and squeeze a little lemon juice over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
