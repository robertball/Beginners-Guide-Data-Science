10 mushrooms whole
1 medium onion, diced
1 tsp "Better than Bullion" (or 1 bullion cube)

Thick-slice the mushrooms. Add the butter to skillet over medium heat.  Add the diced onion and mushrooms to the butter. Reduce heat to low. Cover skillet and cook on low for 15 min. Uncover and stir. Then re-cover and cook over low heat for an additional 15 min.
Pour water into mixture. Add bouillon stir until it dissolves in mixture. Using scissors, cut the bacon into small pieces over the mixture. Simmer on low, uncovered for 10 more minutes.
Turn back up to medium heat until mixture bubbles. Stir the cornstarch and sour cream into the skillet stirring constantly for 2 min.
Use mixture to top fried pork steaks.

Description: 
I use this recipe to top my fried pork chops. Together with a side of my homemade spaetzle, this dish reminds me of my favorite German-style town, Leavenworth, WA!
