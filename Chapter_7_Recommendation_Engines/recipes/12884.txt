Ingredients:
4 tablespoons margarine
1 teaspoon paprika
2 small onion, chopped
4 cups water
10 potatoes, diced
2 cups half-and-half cream
1/2 pound cod fillets, cubed
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups shredded Muenster cheese
salt to taste

Directions:
Melt the butter or margarine in a large saucepan, and add the paprika.  Saute the onions in this mixture until they are soft.  Add the water, bring it to the boil, and add the potatoes.  Simmer gently until the potatoes are almost done.  Depending on the size of the potatoes it may be necessary to add more water during cooking.
Add cream or milk and the fish; continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until potatoes begin to fall apart.  If they remain very firm, mash them gently in the pan with a masher or wooden spoon.
Add a little of the potato mixture to the beaten eggs, and then stir eggs into the soup.  Remove from  heat, and stir in the cheese.  Correct the seasoning, and serve at once.

Description: 
The flavors in this soup create a warm and soothing meal. A generous plate of sliced avocados is a typical accompaniment. Use an aged European Muenster for the best results.
