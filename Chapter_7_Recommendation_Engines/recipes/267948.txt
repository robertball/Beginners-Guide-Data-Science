Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup salted butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup dark brown sugar
1/4 cup sugar and sucralose blend for baking (such as NaturÂ® Bakers Blend)
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup white chocolate chips
1/4 cup candy-coated milk chocolate pieces
1/4 cup candy corn
3 tablespoons sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter an 8-inch square baking pan.
Whisk flour and baking powder in a small bowl to remove any lumps.
Beat butter with white sugar, brown sugar, and sugar blend in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in egg and vanilla extract, beating until smooth. Add flour mixture and blend until just combined, taking care not to overbeat the batter.
Gently fold white chocolate chips, milk chocolate pieces, candy corn, and almonds into the batter. Spread batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting into bars.
