Ingredients:
1/2 c cold water
2 cups strong coffee, hot.
1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk (not evaporated milk)
3 packages of Knox unflavored gelatin

Directions:
Place 1/2 c cold water in a bowl.
Sprinkle 3 unflavored gelatin packets over the water. Let sit until the gelatin blooms, about 10 minutes.
Stir in the hot coffee and mix until the gelatin is completely dissolved.
Stir in the can of sweetened condensed milk.
Pour into glass pan. Thickness of finished jello depends on the size of the pan. I used a 7 x 11 pan but a 9 x 13 pan will give you thinner pieces and an 8 x 8 pan will give you thicker pieces.

Description: 
This recipe was given to me by a friend from one of her favorite blogs (foodlibrarian.blogspot.com). It is a different take on Vietnamese Coffee (espresso served with condensed milk and cream). Give it a try! My first batch didn't see the next morning's sun!
