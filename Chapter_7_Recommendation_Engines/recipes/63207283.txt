Ingredients:
1 loaf (1 pound) Italian bread
1/3 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon minced fresh basil or 1 teaspoon dried basil
1 garlic clove, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
3/4 pound sliced deli turkey
6 ounces provolone cheese, thinly sliced
1 jar (7 ounces) roasted sweet red peppers, drained and sliced
1/2 cup sliced pimiento-stuffed olives
1 large tomato, sliced
3 tablespoons shredded Romano cheese
1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano or 1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Cut bread in half lengthwise; carefully hollow out top and bottom, leaving a 1-in. shell (discard removed bread or save for another use).
In a small bowl, combine the oil, vinegar, basil, garlic, salt and pepper flakes; brush over cut sides of bread.
In the bottom bread shell, layer with turkey, provolone cheese, red peppers, olives and tomato. Sprinkle with Romano cheese, oregano and pepper. Replace bread top.
Bake for 5-10 minutes to melt cheese. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate for 30 minutes. Cut into slices. Yield: 6 servings.

Description: 
You have to resist the temptation to eat this impressive, multi-layered sandwich immediately! It needs to rest at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator to allow the flavors to meld. But it's worth the wait.
