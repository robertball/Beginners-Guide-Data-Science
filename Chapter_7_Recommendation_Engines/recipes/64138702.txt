Ingredients:
2 teaspoon srubbed sage
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 Tbs Olive Oil
1 (5 pound) boneless pork loin
1-1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 cup vinegar
1/2 cup water
1/4 C + 2 tablespoons soy sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a bowl, combine sage, salt, pepper, and garlic.  Drizzle Olive oil over pork. Rub thoroughly all over pork. Place pork in an uncovered roasting pan on the middle oven rack.
Bake in the preheated oven approximately (3 hours, )or until the internal temperature reaches at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), depending upon your desired doneness.
Meanwhile, place sugar, cornstarch, vinegar, water, and soy sauce in a small saucepan. Heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture begins to bubble and thicken slightly. Brush roast with glaze 3 or 4 times during the last 1/2 hour of cooking. Pour remaining glaze over roast, and serve.
