Ingredients:
4 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon baking powder
6 tablespoons butter, softened
1 1/4 cups buttermilk
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
3/4 cup finely chopped onion
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 cups grated zucchini

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together bread flour, salt, and baking powder until thoroughly combined. Beat in the butter, buttermilk, and confectioners' sugar to make a dough; gently mix in the onion, zucchini and Cheddar cheese. (Or add to dry ingredients and then add wet ingredients - either way works.) Divide dough in half, and shape each half into a ball. Place the loaves onto the prepared baking sheet, and gently flatten to about 2 inches thick. Dust each loaf with flour.
Bake on a preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes. Cool on racks for a few minutes; serve warm.
