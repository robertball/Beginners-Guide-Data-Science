Description: 
Kheema (minced meat) Pav (rolls) refers to spicy minced meat served in buttery rolls. And even though minced meat in this form is more of street food, the preparation of the meat itself is quite basic and cooked at home on regular basis. Generally served with roti, kheema is a regular entry in a non-vegetarian household. But when tucked in buns, slathered with sweet and spicy sauce, served with a side of chat masala wedges and tall glass of lassi, you have an ultimate movie night food!
