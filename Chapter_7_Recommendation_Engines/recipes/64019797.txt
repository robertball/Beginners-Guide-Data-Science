Ingredients:
4 cups cooked Brown Rice (Minute Rice is my favorite for convenience, cooked in chicken broth)
4 Cloves Garlic, Diced
1 Medium Yellow Onion, Diced
4 Tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1 - 9oz bag Spinach
1/2 Cup Milk
5 Large Eggs
Salt and Pepper to taste
Optional:
1 1/2 cups Breakfast Sausage, cooked and chopped into 1/2" pieces
1/2 Cup Cheese of choice, grated
1 tsp Cayenne Pepper

Directions:
Cook rice according to package, use chicken/vegetable broth to enhance flavor.
In a large enough bowl and using a fork, beat eggs and milk (if adding cheese, add here too), set aside
Heat oil in large, deep skillet on medium heat, add onions and garlic, saute 3-4 minutes or until onions have developed opaque appearance.
Add in spinach slowly, until it is all wilted, and mix well with a large spoon or metal spatula. (if using sausage bits, add after spinach.) Saute about 2 minutes.
Slowly pour in egg mixture, and scramble continuously until eggs are cooked. (Do not let mixture become omelet consistency)
Add cooked rice and mix it all together
Serve immediately, or refrigerate and reheat throughout the week.

Description: 
I used to get something similar to this for breakfast every day from a local co-op. After moving, I realized how easy it was to make, and replicated it.
