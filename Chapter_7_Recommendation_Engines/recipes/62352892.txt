Ingredients:
1 package of tempeh, cubed
1/2 cup or more of peanut butter (creamy)
1/2 a can of coconut milk
2-3 squirts of Braggs
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon or less of chipotle pepper powder or chili powder
2 teaspoon or more of cumin
1 teaspoon turmeric
1-2 cloves of garlic, diced
2 cups cooked rice

Directions:
Start the rice, making sure that it finishes first.
Fry up the tempeh with some high temp.  oil, making it golden brown, adding the garlic towards the end of the fry.
While the fry is going on, mix the peanut butter, coconut milk, and other spices in a separate bowl.
When the tempeh is fried the way you want it, turn off the burner and add the peanut butter sauce and stir so that all of the tempeh is coated.  You can serve it over the rice right away, or wait a few minutes while the sauce heats up more and thickens.  If you let it sit this way, the sauce will stick to the tempeh better.
Serve with a flourish and enjoy!
