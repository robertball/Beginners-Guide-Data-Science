Description: 
My mother says this is the original chocolate chip cookie recipe passed down from my grandmother.  For bars just press the dough into a jelly roll pan and bake.  This recipe makes a very small batch.  I triple the recipe and use 1/2 cup margarine and 1 cup shortening instead of all shortening.  It seems to make a softer cookie.
