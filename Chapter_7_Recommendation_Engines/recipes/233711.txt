Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) can refrigerated biscuit dough (such as Pillsbury Grands Jr.Â®)
2 tablespoons sweet hot mustard
9 ounces fully cooked sausage links
4 teaspoons finely grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Spread each biscuit into a 2x4-inch oval using your hands. Brush hot mustard onto each biscuit. Place a sausage link across the short edge of each biscuit oval and roll up lengthwise. Cut each rolled biscuit into 4 round slices. Lay 'bites' onto a baking sheet. Sprinkle each 'bite' with Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are browned, 18 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is an easy appetizer to serve at any gathering. I like to put a dot of sweet hot mustard on each bite after they are cooked, but it might be better to just offer the extra mustard for those who want it. Place a toothpick in each bite to serve.
