Directions:
**ENCHILADA SAUCE BASE**:  1 Pkg. of lon g, red dried chili peppers.  Remove stems and if you want it less hot, remove seeds. (I leave half)  Put in blender with about 1 cup water letting it stand a few minutes.  Puree until it is a thick paste.  You can freeze any unused portion for next time.
Place pork chops in a deep skillet and cover with water and lid.  Boil  until meat falls off the bone, then remove pork and shred with a knife and fork.  Set aside.
Add to the pork broth, all the other ingredients and then add the pork back into the mixture.  According to  how much broth you have, and acording to your taste, start adding the enchilada base into the stew until you have a rich red/brown color and the heat is to your liking.  Taste, adjust seasoning and simmer for about 35 minutes.
