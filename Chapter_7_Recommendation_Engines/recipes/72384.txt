Description: 
This is a delicious smoothie that reminds me of the chocolate covered blueberries we bought every Christmas.  Light and sweet, perfect for a summer night snack! I use fat free cocoa mix to make it lighter, or my favorite flavored cocoa mix, like chocolate hazelnut, to change it up a bit.
