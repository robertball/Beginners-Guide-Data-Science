Ingredients:
4 boneless pork chops -- 3/4-inch thick
Vegetable oil
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground mace
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons butter
2 medium tart red apples -- cored and sliced into 1/2-inch wedges
3 tablespoons chopped pecans

Directions:
Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Brush chops lightly with
oil and cook for 5-6 minutes, turning occasionally, until evenly browned
on both sides. Remove chops to a serving platter; keep warm.
In a small bowl combine brown sugar, salt, pepper, mace and nutmeg. Add
butter to skillet; stir in brown sugar mixture and apples. Cover and cook
for 3-4 minutes or just until apples are tender. Remove apples with a
slotted spoon and arrange on top of pork chops; keep warm.
Continue cooking mixture in skillet, uncovered, until sauce thickens
slightly. Spoon the sauce over the apples and chops. Sprinkle with pecans.
