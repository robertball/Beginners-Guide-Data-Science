Ingredients:
16 ounces elbow macaroni
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon mustard powder (like Colman’s®)
1 teaspoon hot sauce (optional)
4 cups water
1 (12 oz) can evaporated milk
1/3 cup whole milk
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 cups shredded Cheddar Cheese (about 6 ounces)
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack Cheese (about 3 ounces)
1/2 cup frozen peas, defrosted
1 cup diced cooked ham
Salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine macaroni, salt, mustard powder, optional hot sauce, and water in your Instant Pot®, stirring well.
Place the lid on the Instant Pot®, lock in place, and set the pressure valve to “sealing.”  Pressure cook on high for 4 minutes.
When the cooking cycle is complete, do a Quick Pressure Release, and switch to the low saute function by pressing Saute once and the Adjust button twice. Open the pot, and stir macaroni to be sure they are evenly cooked and to separate any clumps of the pasta.
Stir in the evaporated milk, whole milk, and butter.  Gradually add the cheeses, constantly stirring until the cheese is completely melted.
Stir in the diced ham, peas, salt and pepper, and serve hot.
Footnote:  Adjust the consistency of the mac and cheese sauce to suit your personal preference.  FYI, I used Kraft® 2% Milk Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese to reduce fat with no negative effect on taste.

Description: 
Forget about the blue box (you know what I’m talking about) and make homemade mac and  cheese for a weeknight dinner.  The ham, peas and optional hot sauce add some pizazz to classic mac and cheese.
