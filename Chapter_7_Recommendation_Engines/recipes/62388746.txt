Ingredients:
3 or 4 bell peppers (preferably red)
2 T olive oil
1 T red wine vinegar
1/8 t salt
1/2 t pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 t capers, drained and rinsed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 500 degrees.
Place peppers on large sheet pan and roast for 30 minutes (turning once) or until skins are nicely blackened.
Place peppers in bowl, cover with foil and let sweat for 20 to 30 minutes.
In the interim, in a small to medium sized bowl, whisk together remaining ingredients for the vinaigrette.
Once cooled, skins should easily slip off.  Open peppers, remove stem and seeds, slice into quarters, and place peppers with their juices into vinaigrette.  Toss with fingers, cover, and let rest in fridge for at least a half hour.
