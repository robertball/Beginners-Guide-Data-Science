Ingredients:
1 16 oz. can vegetarian refried beans
1 cup cottage cheese
1 tsp taco seasoning
3/4 cup mexi-cheese, divided
4 green onions, sliced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 TB olive oil
1/4 cup chopped red onion
1 1/2 cups water
5 tsp flour
1 1/2 TB chili powder
1 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp salt
2 tsp cider vinegar
1 1/2 cups chunky salsa
8 flour tortillas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly spray a 13 x 9 baking dish.
In a large bowl, combine the refried beans, cottage cheese, taco seasoning, 1/4 cup mexi-cheese, green onions and chopped fresh cilantro.  Set aside.
In a large sauce pan, sauté red onions in olive oil about 4 minutes over medium heat.  Add water, flour, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and cider vinegar.  Whisk until smooth.  Add salsa and bring to a boil.  Cook, stirring often, 5 minutes until slightly thickened.  Remove from heat.
Spread a ladle full of sauce in the bottom of baking dish.  Dip each tortilla in sauce.  Place about 1/2 cup of the bean mixture on each tortilla.  Fold in sides and roll up. Place in baking dish.  Repeat with remaining tortillas.
Ladle remaining sauce over enchiladas.  Top enchiladas with remaining 1/2 cup of mexi-cheese.  Sprinkle with fresh cilantro, if desired.  Cover with foil and bake 20 minutes.  Uncover and bake an additional 10 – 15 minutes until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling.
