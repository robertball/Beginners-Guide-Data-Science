Description: 
This delicious tomatillo-based sauce can be made with beef, pork or chicken though it is traditionally served with pork.  Unfortunately, I don't have precise measurements of the seasonings, but do some tasting along the way!  Serve it over rice for a delicious Mexican dish!Modified from: Carne Con Chilies
