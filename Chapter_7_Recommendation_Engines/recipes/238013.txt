Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed
1 lemon, zested and juiced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound tilapia, cut into bite-size cubes
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
1 cup diced fresh tomato
1/2 cup sliced black olives
2 tablespoons chopped jarred jalapeno peppers
2 tablespoons capers

Directions:
Mix olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic, dill, salt, and pepper together in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir tilapia in the oil mixture until opaque, about 10 minutes. Transfer tilapia to a bowl and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes. Reserve liquid in skillet.
Combine chilled tilapia, celery, avocado, tomato, olives, jalapeno peppers, and capers in a bowl. Drizzle reserved olive oil-lemon mixture over tilapia mixture; toss to coat. Allow salad to marinate in the refrigerator, at least 30 minutes.
