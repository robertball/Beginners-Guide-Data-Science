Ingredients:
4-6 unsalted matzo boards
1 c unsalted butter or margarine
1 c lite brown sugar, packed firm
3/4 chocolate chips (peanut butter chips, white chocolate chips, or sprinkles)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line cookie sheet with aluminum foil, spray with Pam.
Arrange matzo to fit the pan. Break boards to completely line the pan.
Combine butter & sugar in a saucepan. Over medium heat, stir constantly (it burns easily!) until boiling. Continue stirring & cooking for 3 minutes. Pour over the matzo.
Place the cookie sheet in the oven & immediately reduce heat to 350 degrees.
Bake 10 minutes. If it is smoking too much, reduce heat to 325 degrees.
Remove from the oven & sprinkle the chips over it. Let stand 5 minutes.
Spread the chocolate. Add sliced almonds or the sprinkles at this point. You can also do this with white chocolate or add white & regular chips at the same time & swirl them. Be creative!!
Place in fridge until set. When cool, break into pieces.
