Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork sausage
1 pound processed cheese food
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 (1 pound) loaf cocktail rye bread

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a medium baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place ground beef and ground pork sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside.
Place processed cheese food in a large, microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high 3 to 4 minutes, or until processed cheese food is melted.
Into the bowl with melted processed cheese food, mix Worcestershire sauce and ketchup. When thoroughly blended, mix in beef and pork.
Place approximately 2 tablespoons of the mixture on each slice of cocktail rye bread.
Arrange cocktail rye bread slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned and crisp.
