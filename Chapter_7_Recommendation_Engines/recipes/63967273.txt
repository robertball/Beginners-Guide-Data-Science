Ingredients:
In a saucepan, combine:
2 cups milk
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup shortening
Bring to a boil, then cool.
In a small bowl, combine:
1 cup lukewarm water
2 heaping Tbsp yeast
2 teaspoons sugar
Set aside and let dissolve.
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
3 eggs, beaten
7 cups flour, to 9 cups

Directions:
When the milk mixture has cooled to lukewarm, pour into mixer.  Add a cup of flour, all of the yeast mixture, salt and three beaten eggs.  Beat until smooth.  Add flour a little at a time while mixing until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl but is not stiff.
Place dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap that has been sprayed with cooking spray, and let rise in a warm place until dough has doubled in size.  Punch down, cover, and let rise again until doubled in size.
After dough has risen a second time, divide in half.  Place on a floured board or counter.  Roll out until 1/2 inch thick, and cut into circles.  Place on a greased cookie sheet so rolls are almost touching.  Let rise about 30 minutes.
Bake at 375 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes until golden brown.
