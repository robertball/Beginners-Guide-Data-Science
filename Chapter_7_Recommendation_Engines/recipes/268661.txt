Ingredients:
4 ounces honey-flavored goat cheese
3 ounces prosciutto
2 fresh figs, thinly sliced
2 leaves fresh basil, cut into thin strips
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Place goat cheese on a sheet of plastic wrap. Top with another sheet of plastic wrap and use a rolling pin to flatten into a 4x8-inch rectangle.
Remove the top sheet of plastic wrap and cover goat cheese with slices of prosciutto, slightly overlapping the edges. Cover prosciutto with a new sheet of plastic wrap and flip both sheets over so the goat cheese layer is now facing up.
Remove top sheet of plastic wrap. Cover goat cheese evenly with figs, basil, and black pepper. Starting from the long edge, roll tightly to form a log. Wrap log in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours.
