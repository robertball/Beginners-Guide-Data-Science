Ingredients:
4 to 6 assorted citrus fruits, such as grapefruit, oranges, tangerines, or pomelos
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon honey
1/2 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (5-ounce) pkg. mixed baby greens
3 cups thinly sliced Swiss chard
1/2 cup very thinly sliced red onion
2 avocados, halved, seeded, peeled, and chopped
1/2 cup roasted salted cashews, coarsely chopped

Directions:
Using a sharp knife, remove all of the peel and pith from the fruit. To section each fruit, cut between the membrane and flesh of each fruit and remove the flesh. (You should have 2 cups fruit.) After sectioning, squeeze the leftover membranes over a bowl to reserve the juice.
In a screw top jar combine 3 tablespoons of the reserved fruit juice, the olive oil, white wine vinegar, honey, mustard, salt, and pepper. Cover and shake to combine.
Arrange mixed greens, Swiss chard, reserved fruit sections, red onion, avocado, and cashews on a large serving platter. Drizzle dressing over salad.
