Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta
1/4 cup butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 pounds sea scallops, rinsed and patted dry
3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup heavy cream (optional)
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese to taste (optional)

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the angel hair pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and cook just until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute. Slice any scallops over 3/4-inch thick in half so they'll cook evenly; stir scallops, basil, and parsley into the skillet. Cook and gently stir just until scallops feel slightly firm when pressed with a finger, 2 to 3 minutes. Scallops will become tough and chewy if overcooked. Stir in lemon juice, and season with salt and black pepper. Pour in cream if you like a thicker sauce. Bring the mixture just to a bare simmer.
Serve over hot angel hair pasta; sprinkle to taste with Parmesan cheese.
