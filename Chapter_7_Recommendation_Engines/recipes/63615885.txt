3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 tbsp flour
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp salt

Vanilla ice cream (optional)

Directions:
Make filling: In medium bowl, combine apple, 3/4 cups sugar, 2 tbsp flour, the lemon juice, vanilla, cinnamon, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 cup water.  Turn into 8x8x2-inch baking dish.  Dot with 2 tbsp butter.
Preheat oven to 375F.
Make batter: In medium bowl, combine all batter ingredients.  Beat with wooden spoon until smooth.  Drop in 9 portions over filling, spacing evenly.  Batter will spread during baking.
