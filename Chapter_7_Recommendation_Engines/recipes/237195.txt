Ingredients:
½ cup soy sauce
½ cup lemon juice
¼ cup peanut butter
6 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tablespoons curry powder
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
6 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into chunks
6 (10 inch) skewers

Directions:
Stir soy sauce, lemon juice, peanut butter, garlic, curry powder, brown sugar, and hot pepper sauce together in a large bowl until marinade is well-combined. Place chicken in the marinade and stir to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade and thread chicken onto skewers.
Cook chicken on the preheated grill until juices run clear and chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.
