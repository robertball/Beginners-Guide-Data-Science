Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups raisins
1/2 cup coffee flavored liqueur
1 cup shortening
2 cups packed brown sugar
3 eggs
1/2 cup milk
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups rolled oats
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1 cup white chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Place raisins in a small bowl, and add coffee flavored liqueur. Heat in the microwave for approximately 2 minutes, or until hot. Set aside to cool (overnight is great). Drain, and reserve liquid.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, cream together shortening and brown sugar. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then mix in milk and the reserved liquid from the raisins. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Stir in oats. Mix in the walnuts and white chocolate chips, if desired. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
This is a wonderful, chewy, just a little different oatmeal cookie. I have made them with many variations and all of them good. They taste the best if the raisins soak in the coffee liqueur overnight.
