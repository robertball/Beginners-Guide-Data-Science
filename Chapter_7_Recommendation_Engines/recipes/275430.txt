Ingredients:
4 (5 ounce) cod fillets
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter, melted
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
vegetable oil
2 (6 ounce) packages sugar snap peas
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 medium orange, cut into wedges

Directions:
Brush the air fryer basket with vegetable oil and preheat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Thaw fish if frozen; blot dry with paper towels, and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.
Stir together butter and sesame seeds in a small bowl. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the butter mixture for the fish. Toss peas and garlic with remaining butter mixture and place in the air fryer basket.
Cook peas in the preheated air fryer in batches, if needed, until just tender, tossing once, about 10 minutes. Remove and keep warm while cooking fish.
Brush fish with 1/2 of the remaining butter mixture. Place fillets in air fryer basket. Cook 4 minutes; turn fish. Brush with remaining butter mixture. Cook 5 to 6 minutes more or until fish begins to flake when tested with a fork. Serve with snap peas and orange wedges.
