Ingredients:
¼ cup all-purpose flour
⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
⅛ teaspoon paprika
3 pounds bone-in chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 small red onions, cut into quarters
1 pound new white potatoes, cut into quarters
8 ounces fresh baby carrots, green tops trimmed to 1-inch long
1 ½ cups Swanson(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Chicken Stock
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano leaves
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves

Directions:
Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Stir the flour, black pepper and paprika on a plate. Coat the chicken with the flour mixture.
Heat the oil in a 12-inch oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 10 minutes or until well browned on all sides. Remove the chicken from the skillet. Pour off any fat.
Add the onions and potatoes to the skillet and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the carrots, stock, lemon juice and oregano and heat to a boil. Return the chicken to the skillet. Cover the skillet.
Roast for 25 minutes. Uncover the skillet.
Roast, uncovered, for 20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender. Sprinkle with the thyme, if desired.
