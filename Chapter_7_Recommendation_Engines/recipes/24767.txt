Description: 
This creamy sweet potato recipe is a huge hit with everyone. A friend served a version of these at a luncheon, and I absolutely loved it.  I found some sweet potatoes in my fridge that I hadn't used and decided to try it.  Everyone at work flipped over them!   They're great with pork chops or steak, too!
