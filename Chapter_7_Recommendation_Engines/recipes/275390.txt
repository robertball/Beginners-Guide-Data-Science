Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package sausage patties (such as JohnsonvilleÂ®)
1 serving nonstick cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place sausage patties into the basket in 1 layer, working in batches if necessary.
Cook in the preheated air fryer for 5 minutes. Pull the basket out, turn sausage over, and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a patty reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 3 minutes more.

Submitter: 
Yoly
Description: 
Air fry your sausage patties and you will avoid grease splatter all over your stovetop. Best part is, the patties will be nicely browned.
