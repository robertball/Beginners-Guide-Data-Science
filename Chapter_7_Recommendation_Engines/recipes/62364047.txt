Description: 
Some people think Indian cooking is too exotic. Well if exotic is another word for delicious then yeah it's exotic. Great as a side dish or entree. It features peas, tomatoes, onions and a whole lot of flavor. I'm a committed carnivore but my vegetarian friends and I all love this. Cook it up and serve over rice (Bismati or jasmine). You can easily mix up your own Indian spice, garam masala, using allrecipes.com or store buy it. You can use store bought Mexican queso blanco or use Indian panir cheese if you feel compelled to be 100% authentic. I hope you enjoy it. Namaste y'all!
