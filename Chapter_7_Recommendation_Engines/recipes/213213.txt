Ingredients:
2/3 cup butter
4 1/2 cups white sugar
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
2 (7 ounce) jars marshmallow creme
16 ounces chocolate candy (such as Hershey'sÂ®)
2 1/2 cups milk chocolate chips
2 cups peanut butter (optional)

Directions:
Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Set aside.
Bring butter, sugar, and evaporated milk to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. Boil for 5 to 7 minutes, then remove from heat and quickly stir in the marshmallow cream, chocolate candy, and chocolate chips, until the chocolate has melted and is fully incorporated. Pour chocolate mixture into the prepared baking pan. Dot the top of the fudge with peanut butter. Swirl a knife through the fudge and peanut butter to create a marble effect. Cover and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Cut into squares for serving.

Flying back from Hawaii this Thanksgiving - and sat by the nicest couple that shared their snacks and a recipe for fudge to die for!  He asked me to call it Fat Pete's Fudge if I got it published in honor of him! Thanks to Fat Pete!
