Ingredients:
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons McCormick® Ground Ginger
2 teaspoons McCormick® Garlic Powder
2 teaspoons McCormick® Season-All® Seasoned Salt
1 teaspoon McCormick® Crushed Red Pepper
1/2 teaspoon McCormick® Ground Cinnamon
3 pounds pork baby back ribs
1/4 cup water
1 cup guava jelly

Directions:
Combine brown sugar and spices in a small bowl; reserve 2 tablespoons spice mixture.  Rub remaining spice mixture on ribs; coat well.
Place ribs in a single layer on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet (17x11-inch) or roasting pan.  Pour water into pan; cover with foil.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 1 hour, or until meat starts to pull away from bones.
Meanwhile, combine jelly and reserved spice mixture.  Brush steamed ribs with jelly mixture.  Cover and refrigerate 1 hour or overnight, if desired.
Grill or broil 3-5 minutes per side, or until heated through and nicely browned.
