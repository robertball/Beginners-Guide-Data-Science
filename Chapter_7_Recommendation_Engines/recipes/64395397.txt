Ingredients:
4 cups whole milk (or any variety)
1 cup cultured buttermilk

Directions:
Clean a Mason jar with lid, or other jar, with very hot water.  Let dry.
Add 4 cups of milk and 1 cup Cultured buttermilk together in clean jar and shake well.
Store jar in a warm part of the house that is a constant, approximate 70 degrees (**see notes).  Let sit for 24 hours and mixture has thickened or clabbered and thickly coats the back of a spoon.
You may use right away or refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.
When ready to make more buttermilk, simply save 1 cup from the batch and repeat the process.
You may let the mixture sit for up to 36 hours but if the milk has not thickened then the cultures in the starter buttermilk may not have been active enough to support the process. This process will work approximately 5-8 times.  After that you need to begin with new commercial buttermilk.

Description: 
You can easily make your own cultured buttermilk right at home.  Simply use a little store bought buttermilk as a starter and you can have a continuous supply with far less additives than store bought buttermilk will contain.
