Ingredients:
Chicken:
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
3 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh basil leaves (or 2 tsp dried)
salt & fresh ground pepper to taste
(1 tsp salt & 1/4 tsp pepper)
Sauce:
2 tablespoons butter
1 medium shallots
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1 cup half & half (or heavy cream)
3 oz fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup frozen English peas
salt & fresh ground pepper to taste
Pasta:
1/2 (9 oz.) package fresh fettuccine
2 oz fresh grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Combine vinegar, oil and basil. Pour over chicken and marinate overnight in the refrigerator. Grill the breasts or bake in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes. Set aside. Peel and finely chop shallot. Saute in butter 1 minute. Add garlic and saute until fragrant. Add cream, salt and pepper to taste. Boil to reduce slightly to the consistency of a light sauce, just thick enough to coat a spoon. Add mushrooms, peas, and Parmesan cheese and cook another 2 minutes. Cook pasta, drain and shake out excess water. Thinly slice chicken. Add to pasta and gently toss with sauce, along with cheese. Serve immediately.
