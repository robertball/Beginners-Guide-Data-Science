Ingredients:
1 pkg. (2-layer size) chocolate cake mix
1 pkg. (3.9 oz.) Chocolate Flavor Instant Pudding
1 cup Sour Cream
1 cup water
2/3 cup oil
4 eggs
1 bag chocolate chips(12 oz.)
1 cup thawed  Whipped Topping

Directions:
Mix dry cake and pudding mixes in large bowl with whisk until blended. Add next 4 ingredients; mix well. Stir in chocolate chips. Pour into slow cooker sprayed with cooking spray and  cover the crock pot with paper towels. The towels will absorb the moisture and prevent it from collecting on the top of the cake. Change out the towels once during the cooking process, cover with lid.
Cook on LOW 6 hours (or on HIGH 4 to 4-1/2 hours) or until top surface of cake has no wet spots and cake begins to pull away from side of slow cooker.
Serve warm topped with COOL WHIP.
