Ingredients:
3 cups all purpose flour;  1 cup butter, softened; 1.5 cups sugar; 3/4 teaspoon baking powder; 1/4 teaspoon salt; 1 large egg; 1 tablespoon milk, 1 cup powdered sugar for rolling out dough.

Directions:
1. Add butter and sugar into a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light in color.  2. Add the egg and milk and mix on medium speed for 1 minute.  3. In a separate bowl sift the flour, baking powder,  and salt together. 4. Gradually mix the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture with a spoon or standing electric mixer.  5. When dough has formed split it into two sections and wrap each section in wax paper. Refrigerate for two hours.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
When you are ready to use the dough take only one of the halves out of the refrigerator at a time.  Spread a thin layer of powdered sugar on a flat surface and roll out the dough using a rolling pin to 1/4 inch thickness. Place cookie cut outs on baking sheet 1 inch apart. Bake for 7 to 9 minutes rotating baking sheet halfway through.  Let cool on baking sheet for two minutes before removing and finish cooling on cooling rack.
