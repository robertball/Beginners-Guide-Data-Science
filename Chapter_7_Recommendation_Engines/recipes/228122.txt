3/4 cup chopped onion
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 2 1/2-quart baking dish.
Layer potatoes and onion in prepared baking dish.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour until smooth. Gradually add broth, mayonnaise, garlic, salt, parsley, poultry seasoning, and pepper; cook and stir until thick and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Pour mayonnaise mixture over potatoes and onion.
