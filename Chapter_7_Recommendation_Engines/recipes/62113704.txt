Ingredients:
1 12 inch French roll
6 Thick slices of lean bacon
1 Avocado
2 Leaves Iceberg lettuce
5 Slices beefsteak tomato
1/4 lb. Deli turkey breast
Mayonnaise
1/4 tsp. salt

Directions:
Place bacon between two paper towels on a paper plate or glass baking dish.  Microwave 6 to 8 minutes in 2 minute increments until crisp. (Microwaving will keep bacon flat.)
Slice tomatoes 1/4 in. thick.
Shred lettuce.
Cut avocado in half, take one half and scoop out pulp into a shallow bowl mash with fork, add salt and stir.
Spread avocado on one side of French roll and layer with bacon, turkey, tomato and lettuce.
Spread mayonnaise on remaining half of roll, place on top of sandwich and enjoy!
(Remaining half of the avocado can be used to make dip for chips.  Simply add 2 Tbs. of salsa for a quick guacamole.)
