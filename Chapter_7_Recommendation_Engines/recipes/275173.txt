Ingredients:
1 teaspoon unsalted butter, or as needed
1 1/2 cups white sugar, divided
1 stick unsalted butter, room temperature
2 extra large eggs
1 cup plain yogurt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
5 medium ripe plums, pitted and sliced
3 large ripe peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9-inch square baking pan.
Beat 1 cup sugar and 1 stick butter together using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating after each addition. Add yogurt and vanilla extract; mix until batter is smooth. Add flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to the batter and mix until just combined. Combine remaining 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon in a separate bowl.
Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan and sprinkle with 1/2 of the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Top batter with plums and peaches; sprinkle with remaining cinnamon-sugar mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour, making sure not to overbake. Serve warm or at room temperature.
