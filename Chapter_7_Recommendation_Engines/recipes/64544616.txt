Ingredients:
1 very ripe banana
3/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk
2 flax eggs (to make -> 2 tbsp flax meal & 6 tbsp water)
1/2 cup buckwheat flour
1 tsp baking powder
2 tbsp raw cacao powder
1/2 cup fresh raspberries

Directions:
In a ramekin or small bowl, make flax egg. Set in refrigerator 30 minutes until it becomes an egg-like consistency.
Using a standing or hand mixer, combine banana, flax egg, almond extract & coconut milk until banana is mashed & combined well.
To the mixture, add buckwheat flour, baking powder & cacao powder to banana & combine thoroughly.
Add raspberries to the mixture smashing slightly by hand until broken up into bits throughout the batter.
Heat a frying pan over medium heat & spray with cooking spray.
Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, scoop mixture onto pan & cook 3-4 minutes before until pancakes begin to bubble. Flip carefully (buckwheat flour is light, I found 2 spatulas helped with flipping).
Cook another 1-2 minutes on the other side then remove and cool on a rack briefly to allow pancakes to fully set.
