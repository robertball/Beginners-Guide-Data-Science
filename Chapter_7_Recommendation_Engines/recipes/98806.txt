Description: 
This is a very simple Carolina style vinegar based BBQ sauce.  A friend of the family gave us this recipe several years ago and after a few tweaks and additions, this is the best BBQ sauce that I've ever had.  You combine all of the ingredients and then enjoy.  This is easily scaled up or down.
