My lazy way of cooking ribs....
This is for a friend:
I wrap ribs in foil, along with apple juice. (I usually do this after I put the rub on)
I place in the oven at 200 for 1 hour.
After that, increase to 225 degrees.
Cook for another 2-3 hours depending on size. (Big slab of spare ribs need 3)
Unwrap from foil, put on smoker, or grill with indirect heat.
Let meat surface slightly dry 5-10 minutes...
Apply sauce every 15 minutes or so.
Cook for about an additional hour...depends on temps
Flip once half way through the grilling process.
notes:
I only need an hour when I use a Weber with charcoal -and smoking wood- on one side, ribs on the other
The webber runs -with the vents half open- at about 250 degrees.
The smoker I run hits about about 175...so I need an extra 30 minutes
