Ingredients:
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
3 envelopes unflavored gelatin
1 cup cold water, divided
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (or preferred flavour)
12 ounces semi-sweet chocolate
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Combine powdered sugar & cornstarch in a small bowl. Spray 9"x13" pan with cooking spray, dust bottom & sides with cornstarch mix. Set pan aside, & retain excess cornstarch mix.
Combine gelatin & ½ c water in mixer bowl.
Combine ½ c water, granulated sugar, honey, corn syrup, & salt in a small saucepan over medium high heat. Cook covered 3-5 minutes. Uncover, & continue cooking without stirring until syrup reaches 240 F (use candy thermometer) (12-15 min).
With whisk attachment, & mixer on low, pour hot syrup into gelatin. Once combined, increase speed to high, beat until thick & fluffy (10-15 min). Add extract with a minute or two left.
Use a lightly oiled spatula to scrape fluff into pan, & smooth. Dust the top with starch mix (retain excess). Allow to set uncovered at room temperature for at least 4 hours.
Remove from pan, & place on cutting board. Using a large knife, or pizza cutter, dusted in cornstarch mix, cut marshmallow block into 1.5” squares. Use cornstarch mix to dust sticky sides. To create Dinomite bite: Use scalloped circle cookie/biscuit cutter to remove one corner from each square. Save scraps for hot chocolate.
In a small pan, bring to a simmer a few inches of water. In a heat proof bowl, combine chocolate, cinnamon, & cayenne pepper. Place bowl over pan. Stir until chocolate is melted smooth, & spices are mixed through.
Dip tops of marshmallows in chocolate. Allow chocolate to set.
