Ingredients:
Filling:
12 oz. fresh raspberries
1/4 cup honey
5 egg whites
1 tbsp. lemon zest
1 cup finely chopped almonds
Crust:
1-1/4 cups whole wheat pastry flour
1 pinch salt
1/4 cup safflower oil
1/4 cup water
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1/4 tsp. cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Put crust ingredients in a mixing bowl and mix by hand until you have a firm ball of dough.
Roll dough between two large sheets of parchment paper until it is very thin (about 1/8 inch)
Cut to size and mold into pot pie tins.
Whip your egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, combine all other ingredients. Mix gently.
Combine both bowls by gently folding the egg whites into the raspberry mixture.
Gently scoop mixture into pot pie tins.
Bake for approximately 20-30 minutes. A cake tester or toothpick should come out clean when poked into the middle of the pie.
