Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon active dried yeast
1 cup warm milk
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup warm water
butter or ghee (optional)

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine yeast, sugar, salt, oil, milk in warm water.
In a large bowl, gradually add yeast mixture to flour and work it by hand until the mixture forms sticky dough. Cover the dough with little oil and let it rise for 20 minutes.
Adjust the wirerack of oven to highest position. Preheat the oven to 550 degrees F (285 degrees C) using grill mode.
Divide the dough to 10 to 12 balls. Flour your hands, the surface and the balls to prevent sticking. Punch down the ball and toss in hands to reach the disire size and thickness. Pull down an edge to form an oval shape.
Place the dough on a slightly-floured baking pan. Bake each side for 3 to 5 minutes or until brown spots appear. Rub the top with butter or ghee as desire.

Description: 
I found Chef Sanjay Thumma and his recipes on youtube website. So I tried his Naan bread recipe and it was so good, just like what we buy from indian restaurants. After I discovered this recipe, I just make my own Naan bread to have with bought indian curries. And that saves money in my pocket!

Next time you buy Naan bread, just look how they toss the dough to make it flatten. It's the key to make yours.
