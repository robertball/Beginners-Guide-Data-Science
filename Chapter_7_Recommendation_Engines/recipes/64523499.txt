Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
2 eggs
1 tablespoon molasses
2 teaspoons grated orange peel
3-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup finely ground almonds
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
Milk and finely chopped or sliced almonds

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy; beat in the eggs, molasses and orange peel. Combine the flour, ground almonds, cinnamon, baking powder, nutmeg, cloves, pepper, ginger and cardamom. Gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until easy to handle.
On a parchment paper-lined surface, roll a small amount of dough to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut with floured 2-in. circle-shaped cookie cutters, leaving 1 in. between cookies. Remove excess dough and re-roll scraps if desired. *Traditionally these cookies are cut out with windmill or other Dutch-inspired cultural shapes.
Slide a baking sheet under the parchment paper and dough. Brush cookies with milk and sprinkle with finely chopped or sliced almonds as desired. Repeat with remaining dough.
Bake at 350 degrees for 8-10 minutes or until edges are lightly browned; remove to wire racks to cool. Yield: about 2-1/2 dozen.
