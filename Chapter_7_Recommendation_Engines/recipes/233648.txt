Ingredients:
Dressing:
1/3 cup water
5 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 cup raspberry-flavored liqueur (such as Chambord速)
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
Fruit Salad:
2 cups diced nectarines
1 cup pitted and halved sweet cherries
1 cup sliced strawberries
1 cup fresh raspberries
1 cup fresh blueberries
Whipped Cream Topping:
1/3 cup heavy whipping cream
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon raspberry-flavored liqueur (such as Chambord速)
3 tablespoons toasted slivered almonds

Directions:
Stir water, 5 tablespoons sugar, 1/4 cup raspberry-flavored liqueur, and lemon juice together in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring frequently, until the sugar dissolves completely, about 8 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Mix nectarines, cherries, strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries in a large bowl. Pour the cooled sugar mixture over the fruit and toss gently to coat.
Beat heavy whipping cream and 2 teaspoons sugar in a bowl with an electric hand mixer on high until stiff peaks form. Fold 1 teaspoon raspberry-flavored liqueur into the whipped cream; spoon over the fruit salad and sprinkle evenly with almonds.
