1/2 teaspoon honey
2 teaspoons wheat germ

Description: 
I invented this recipe when I started running out of smoothie components.  I think it tastes like a cross between peaches and cream, and egg nog (there are no eggs in it though).  The oats and/or wheat germ can be omitted for a smoother smoothie. If using frozen peaches, omit the ice cubes.
