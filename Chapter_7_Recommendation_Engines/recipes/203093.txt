Description: 
A good friend introduced me to this simple to make 'adult' drink that really packs a punch! I keep a can of pineapple juice (as well as 1/2 batch of the premixed liquors) in the fridge at all times during the summer, for those impromptu happy hours on the deck. Careful, though, its fruity taste is deceiving and it WILL sneak up on you.
