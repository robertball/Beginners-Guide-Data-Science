Ingredients:
3 cups spelt flour
1 packet or 2 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup very warm water (120-130*)
2 tablespoons butter or coconut oil
2 tablespoons honey

Directions:
In a medium bowl stir together 1 cup of the flour, yeast and salt. Add very warm water, honey and butter. Mix by hand until almost smooth. Gradually stir in remaining 2 cups flour to make a firm dough. Cover, let rest for 15 minutes. Spread dough on greased extra-large pizza pan, or two medium pizza pans. Top as desired. Bake at 400* for 17-20 minutes.

Description: 
Pizza was one of the things I really missed after discovering my allergy to wheat. This dough is easy to make and quite good! I grind my own spelt flour, it's much cheaper than buying it at a healthfood store.
