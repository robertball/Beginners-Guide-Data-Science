Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup pearl (Israeli) couscous
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup chopped yellow onion
1 shallot, chopped
6 cloves garlic, quartered
1/2 cup golden raisins
1/2 cup chopped oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon butter, softened

Directions:
Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan; stir couscous into the boiling water and cook until couscous absorbs all the water and is cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion, shallot, and garlic in the hot oil until onion is lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir raisins, sun-dried tomatoes, and almonds into onion mixture; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Stir couscous into onion-raisin mixture; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season couscous mixture with salt and pepper; add lemon juice. Remove skillet from heat and stir butter into couscous mixture.
