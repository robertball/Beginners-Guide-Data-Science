Ingredients:
1/4 c firmly packed brown sugar
1/4 c sweet paprika
3 T black pepper
3 T coarse salt
1 T hickory-smoked salt or more coarse salt
2 t garlic powder
2 t onion powder
2 t celery seeds
1 t cayenne pepper

Directions:
Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir to mix. (Actually, your hands work better for mixing than a spoon or whisk does. Use your fingers to break up any lumps of brown sugar.) Store the rub in an airtight jar away from heat or light; it will keep for at least six months.
