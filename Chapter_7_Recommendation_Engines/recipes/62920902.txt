Ingredients:
4 cups apple juice (bottled)
1 tablespoon maple syrup (pure)
5 cups sugar
3 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1 3/4 ounces dry pectin

Directions:
Sterilize lids and jars.  Keep warm until needed.
Place apple juice, maple syrup, cinnamon and nutmeg in a heavy saucepan. Add the pectin and bring to a hard boil over high heat until it dissolves into the juice. Slowly stir in the sugar and bring back to a rolling boil over high heat. Boil for one full minute.  Remove from heat and skim off foam with a metal spoon. (At this point - you can choose to run thru cheesecloth to get a more transparent jelly.)
Pour into jars, top with lids.  Process in a hot water bath for 15 minutes.
