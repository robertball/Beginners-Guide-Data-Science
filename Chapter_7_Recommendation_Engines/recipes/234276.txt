Ingredients:
2 2/3 cups white sugar
2/3 cup shortening
2 cups pureed cooked butternut squash
4 eggs
2/3 cup water
3 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
2/3 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
2/3 cup raisins (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
Beat sugar and shortening together in a bowl until fluffy. Stir butternut squash, eggs, and water into sugar mixture.
Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and cloves in another bowl; stir into sugar mixture. Add nuts and raisins; stir until batter is just blended. Pour batter into prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 15 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
