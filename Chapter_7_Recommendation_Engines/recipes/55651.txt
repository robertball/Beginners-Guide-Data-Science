Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
8 ounces shallots, peeled and slivered lengthwise
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups 2% low-fat milk
1/4 cup dry sherry or madeira
Salt and white or black pepper
4 slices firm-textured white bread
1 pound shelled cooked tiny shrimp, thawed if frozen

Directions:
Melt butter in a 4- to 5-quart pan over medium-high heat; add shallots and stir often until limp, about 3 minutes.
Sprinkle flour over shallots and stir until well mixed, about 1 minute. Whisk in milk and stir until mixture boils and thickens, about 5 minutes. Add sherry and salt and pepper to taste; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, to blend flavors, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, toast bread; trim off and discard crusts if desired. Rinse and drain shrimp. Add shrimp to sauce and stir often just until simmering again, about 2 minutes.
Set a slice of toast on each plate. Spoon hot shrimp Newburg equally over toast.

Description: 
This Newburg makes a great brunch entree served over toasted English muffins or, more indulgently, spooned into hot popovers. Garnish servings with sprigs of fresh herbs such as tarragon.
