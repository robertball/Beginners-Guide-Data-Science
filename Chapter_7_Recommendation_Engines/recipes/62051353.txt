Description: 
A quick and easy salad with a wonderful lemon kick!  Can also be a Tex-Mex side dish by changing the lemon to lime, parsley to cilantro and adding a dash of cumin!  Use whatever kinds of beans you have in the pantry, but a dark and light color make the best presentation.  Depending on my whim, I also sometimes add cucumber, black olives or feta cheese!
