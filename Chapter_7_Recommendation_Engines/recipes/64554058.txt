Ingredients:
1lb ground beef (or ground turkey)
1 Tbsp sesame oil
3 garlic cloves, minced
2-4 green onions, sliced small (to taste)
14oz coleslaw mix (or just shredded cabbage if you don't want the other vegetables in coleslaw mix)
3 Tbsp low sodium soy sauce
1 tsp Sriracha (or red pepper flakes)
dash of sugar
1/2 tsp minced ginger
1 Tbsp white vinegar (or rice wine vinegar)
salt and pepper
extra Sriracha

Directions:
Brown meat, season with salt and pepper to taste, remove from pan and set aside.  In a separate pan, heat up sesame oil and saut√© garlic, onions and slaw until cabbage is cooked to desired tenderness (*hint-cabbage will continue to cook until cooled, so best to leave it just slightly under cooked from what you're wanting).  Stir in soy sauce, sugar, Sriracha, ginger and vinegar.  Add back in ground meat and mix well.  Add additional hot sauce or chili flakes if desired.
