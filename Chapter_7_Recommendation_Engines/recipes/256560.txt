Ingredients:
4 avocados - peeled, pitted, and cubed
3 tomatoes, diced
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14 ounce) can corn, rinsed and drained
1 small bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
1/2 red onion, minced
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
8 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/4 cup sour cream, or to taste

Directions:
Combine avocados, tomatoes, black beans, corn, cilantro, red onion, oil, vinegar, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until salsa is well mixed.
Spoon salsa into each tortilla and top with Monterey Jack cheese. Roll tortilla around filling to create a burrito.
Warm burritos on a microwave-safe plate in the microwave until cheese is melted and salsa is warmed, about 45 seconds. Top burritos with sour cream.

Description: 
This fresh, versatile salsa makes a great dip on its own, but it's equally good wrapped in a warm tortilla. For breakfast burritos, add an egg or two cooked to your taste. Salsa may also be enjoyed plain with tortillas chips.
