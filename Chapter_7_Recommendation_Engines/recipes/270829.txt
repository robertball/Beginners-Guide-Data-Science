Ingredients:
1 cup almond flour
2 ounces cream cheese, softened
3 tablespoons low-calorie natural sweetener (such as SwerveÂ®)
1 egg
1 teaspoon baking powder
3 1/2 tablespoons reduced-sugar raspberry preserves

Directions:
Mix flour, cream cheese, sweetener, egg, and baking powder together in a bowl until a wet dough forms.
Place the bowl into the freezer until dough is cool and you can roll it into balls, about 20 minutes.
Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Line the basket with parchment paper.
Roll dough into 10 balls and place into the prepared basket. Make a thumbprint in the middle of each cookie. Place 1 teaspoon of preserves into each indention.
Cook in the preheated air fryer until the edges are golden brown, about 7 minutes.
Cool cookies completely before moving from parchment paper, about 15 minutes, or you will have a crumbly mess.
