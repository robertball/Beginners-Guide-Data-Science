Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter (no substitutions)
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 15 oz. can canned chicken broth
2 1/2 cups sour cream
1 4 oz. can of green chilis, drained (optional)
1/2 tspn. salt, or to taste
1/8 tspn. white pepper

Directions:
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat.
Sprinkle in the flour gradually, stirring constantly until mixture begins to bubble, about a minute.
While still stirring, slowly whisk in the broth and continue cooking and stirring until smooth and thickened, and the rawness of the flour is cooked out.
Remove from heat and add the sour cream and green chilis and stir until well combined.
Return pan to burner over low heat and season with salt and pepper to taste; adjust seasonings and add salt as necessary.
Thin with small amounts of chicken broth if necessary until desired consistency is reached. This sauce will thicken slightly when returned to an oven and baked.
Pour generously over prepared enchiladas or in between layers of a casserole and proceed with baking as instructed in the recipe you're using.
