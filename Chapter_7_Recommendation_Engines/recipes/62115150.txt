https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
5 lbs. Russet potatoes
2 Large white onions (chopped)
12 Large Eggs (hard boiled)
3/4 Cup Sweet Pickle Relish
1 1/2 Cups Real Mayonnaise(more if needed)
3 Tbs. Yellow Mustard
1 tsp. Salt
3/4 tsp Black pepper

Directions:
Boil unpeeled potatoes 20 to 30 minutes until a fork penetrates easily.
Cool potatoes immediately by running cold water on them(to prevent over cooking).
When cool enough to touch, peel by scraping skins with small knife.
Refrigerate peeled potatoes 2 hours.
Dice cold potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes.
Use egg slicer to dice eggs(slice lengthwise then turn egg sideways for perfectly diced eggs).
In very large bowl combine all ingredients and mix carefully.
Refrigerate at least overnight before serving.
Tip: I find a 5 qt. ice cream container is perfect for this quantity of potato salad.
