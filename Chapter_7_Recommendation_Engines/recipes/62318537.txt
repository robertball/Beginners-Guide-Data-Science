Ingredients:
- Juice from 2 limes
- 1 tablespoon Thai fish Sauce (Nam Pla)
- 1 teaspoon cane sugar (can use palm sugar too)
- 2 small red chillies, deseeded and finely chopped
- 1 stalk of lemon grass, shredded (easiest to hammer the stalk before shredding, the hammering tenderises it!)
- 6 kafir lime leaves, shredded (These freeze very well, by the way!)
- Fresh ginger, about a walnut in size, peeled and shredded
- 2 Tablespoons of Groundnut Oil
- 2 pieces of fish, each around 200 gms (7 ounces). Mackerel, cod, haddock or salmon work fine.
- Soy sauce, a few glugs
- Rice wine (Sak√©), a few glugs

Directions:
in a jug, salad dressing shaker, whatever, mix the lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, chillies, lemon grass, lime leaves and ginger.
Warm the oil in a shallow pan, while warming the serving plates.
Add both the fish and the spice mixture as soon as the oil starts to sizzle. Cook for a minute or two until the fish starts to get golden, then turn over and repeat with the other side.
Remove the fish to the warmed plates, then add a good few generous glugs of soy sauce and rice wine to the pan.
Bring to a full bubble and reduce slightly before pouring the juices over the fish.
