Ingredients:
4 pounds St. Louis-style pork ribs, cut into 6-inch sections
2 cups barbeque sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Heat one side of a gas grill to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Fill a small metal can or container with water. Cover with aluminum foil; make several slits in the foil with a knife. Place on the preheated side of the grill.
Place ribs bone-side up on the unheated side of the grill; close grill. Cook for 1 1/2 hours. Flip ribs and continue cooking until rib meat shrinks back from the bones, about 1 1/2 hours more.
Baste ribs with barbeque sauce. Transfer to the heated side of the grill; cook for 2 minutes with the lid closed. Flip and baste second side with barbeque sauce. Cook for 2 minutes with the lid closed. Flip and baste first side with more barbeque sauce. Cook for 2 minutes with the lid closed.
