Ingredients:
3/4 cup flour (recipe book now uses 1/2 cup flour)
3/4 cup milk
2 eggs
1/8 teaspoon salt
Whipped cream
Berry Sauce
6 large frozen or fresh strawberries
3 tablespoons berry jam
optional: sugar if needed, to taste

Directions:
Place mini muffin pan (or cast iron skillet) in oven and heat to 400 degrees.  While oven is heating, place flour, milk, eggs, and salt in a blender and blend until smooth.  Carefully remove the pan from the oven (don’t forget it’s hot!) and quickly spray the wells with non-stick spray, or brush with melted butter(If using cast iron pan, coat entire pan surface with butter).  Fill muffin wells 3/4 full with batter.  Place pan in oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, until puffed and slightly golden on top.  Remove puffs and place on plate or platter. Drizzle with berry sauce and top with cool whip or whipped cream, or serve with sauce and/or maple syrup for dipping.
