Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
8 ounces thickly sliced bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes, slow roasted (see Note) and then coarsely chopped, with some of their juices
1 pound dried bucatini or spaghetti
8 ounces arugula, tough stems removed and coarsely chopped
1/2 cup freshly shredded pecorino romano cheese

Directions:
1 - Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil and salt generously.
2 - While the water is heating, warm the olive oil in a large frying pan placed over medium heat. Add the pancetta and sauté, stirring frequently, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the pancetta begins to render its fat and turn somewhat crispy. Stir in the cherry tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, or until the tomatoes are heated through. Turn off the heat and cover the sauce to keep it warm.
3 - Add the pasta to the boiling water, stir to separate the noodles, and cook according to the manufacturer’s instructions until al dente. Drain the cooked pasta in a colander set in the sink, reserving about 1 cup of the cooking water.
4 - Transfer the pasta to the frying pan and gently toss the pasta and sauce to combine thoroughly, adding a splash or two of the cooking water if necessary to loosen the sauce. Add the arugula by the handful and continue to toss for a minute or so, or until the arugula is just wilted. Transfer the dressed pasta to shallow individual bowls and sprinkle the cheese over the top. Serve immediately.
