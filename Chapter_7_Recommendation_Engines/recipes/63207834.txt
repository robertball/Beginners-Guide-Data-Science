Bacon-Wrapped Cocktail Sausages Recipe

Ingredients:
1 14-oz. package Lit’l Smokies
1 12-oz. package lean bacon
3/4 c. brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 325 and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut the slab of bacon into thirds.
Wrap 1/3 of each slice of bacon around each sausage and secure with a toothpick and place on the baking sheet.
Repeat with remaining sausages and bacon. When I was making these, the stars somehow aligned and this package of Lit’l Smokies and Hormel Black Label bacon matched up completely–no leftover bacon, no leftover sausage. Sprinkle brown sugar over sausages
and bake at 325 for 40-45 minutes or until bacon has cooked and is starting to brown.
If you’re serving these at a party, they taste even better after a little time in the slow cooker on low heat.
