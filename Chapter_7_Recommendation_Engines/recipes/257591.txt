4 Ball Park® Hamburger Buns
Dijon mustard
12 slices dill pickle
1/2 cup sliced red onion
Cuban pulled pork (recipe below)
8 slices Black Forest ham
8 slices Swiss cheese
olive oil
Cuban Pulled Pork:
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
1 bay leaf
1 orange, zested and juiced
1 lime, zested and juiced
1 yellow onion, sliced
5 whole garlic cloves, peeled
3 pounds pork shoulder

Directions:
Combine salt, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, oregano, crushed red pepper, peppercorns, bay leaf, and lime/orange zest and juices in a bowl.
Place sliced onions and garlic cloves in the bottom of slow cooker. Top with pork shoulder and pour juice and spice mixture over the meat. Set slow cooker on low for 6 to 8 hours. When done, remove pork from cooker and let cool slightly. Then shred cooked pork into thick chunks using 2 forks. Pour remaining juices over pork to keep warm.
Preheat a panini press according to manufacturer's instructions.
Spread Dijon mustard on both sides of each hamburger bun. Then layer from bottom to top with pickles, red onions, 1/2 cup pulled pork per sandwich, sliced ham and Swiss cheese.
Brush outsides of buns with olive oil and place in panini press until cheese is melted.

Description: 
They say the key to a good Cuban sandwich is soft bread; we say Ball Park® Buns fit the bill. If you don't have a panini press, make your sandwich in a pan on the stove, using the lid for a press.
