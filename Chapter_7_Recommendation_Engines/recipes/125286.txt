Description: 
This tasty side dish is always a big hit when my son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter come for dinner or when I'm hosting a shower or party. At Easter, it's a great way to use up hard-cooked eggs!               --Carolyn Griffin                                                                   Macon, Georgia
