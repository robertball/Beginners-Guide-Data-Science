Ingredients:
4 bell peppers
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
2 tablespoons sofrito
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/4 teaspoon oregano
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 pound lean ground beef
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 tablespoon capers
1 1/2 cups cooked white rice
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook bell peppers in boiling water until softened, about 10 minutes. Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the cut side on the bottom of the dish.
Bake peppers in preheated oven for about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir sofrito, garlic, salt, cumin, oregano, and black pepper with the onion; let mixture cook together for about 1 minute. Break ground beef into small pieces into the skillet; cook and stir until the beef is crumbly and completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir tomato sauce, capers, and rice through the beef mixture; spoon into the peppers. Sprinkle cheese over the top of the stuffed peppers.
Continue baking in oven until the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Peppers stuffed with rice and ground beef, seasoned Puerto Rican style. It's a combination of a few traditional stuffed pepper and Pastelon recipes. I used homemade sofrito, but you can substitute with the Goya® stuff. It's easy to make and delicious served with plantains. I like a lot of filling in my stuffed peppers, so this recipe only yields 4 peppers.
