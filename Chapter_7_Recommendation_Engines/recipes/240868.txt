Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
3 leeks, halved and thinly sliced
1/2 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 stalks celery, diced
3 carrots, diced
1 small head cabbage, and thinly sliced
3 cups water
1 cup salsa
1/3 cup ketchup
4 cubes chicken bouillon
2 teaspoons Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere'sÂ®), or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 pound smoked sausage, thinly sliced

Directions:
Heat butter in a large Dutch oven or heavy stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir leeks, onion, and garlic until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add celery and carrots; cook and stir 3 to 4 minutes. Add cabbage; cook and stir until slightly tender, about 5 minutes.
Mix water, salsa, ketchup, bouillon cubes, Creole seasoning, salt, and pepper into vegetable mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors blend in soup, 20 minutes. Add sausage to soup and simmer until cooked through, about 20 minutes more.

Description: 
Not too spicy, warm and healthy. Skip the sausage, add canned beans, and use vegetable stock to make it vegetarian. Serve with sourdough bread and more salsa as desired.
