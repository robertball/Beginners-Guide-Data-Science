Ingredients:
3 pounds corned beef brisket with spice packet
10 small red potatoes
5 carrots, peeled and julienned
1 large head cabbage, cut into small wedges
1/3 cup of brown sugar,
2 TBSP of butter
2 TBSP of prepared mustard
1/3 cup of ketchup
3 TBSP of apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Place corned beef in large pot or Dutch oven and cover with water. Add the spice packet that came with the corned beef.  Cover pot and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.  Simmer approximately 50 minutes per pound or until tender.  Take the corned beef out of the pot. Pour the sauce (made from the last five ingredients...mix until smooth) over the brisket and bake 30 mins. at 350
Add whole potatoes and carrots to meat water, and cook until the vegetables are almost tender - 15 mins.  Add cabbage and cook for 15 more minutes.
Place vegetables in a bowl and cover. Add as much broth (cooking liquid reserved in the Dutch oven or large pot) as you want. Slice meat across the grain.
