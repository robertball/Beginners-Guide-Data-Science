Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups fat-free milk
3/4 cup egg substitute
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup strawberry spreadable fruit
3 cups chopped fresh strawberries
2 teaspoons confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine the milk, egg substitute and vanilla. Combine the flour, sugar and salt; add to milk mixture and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Coat a 7- or 8-in. nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Heat skillet over medium heat. Pour about 2 tablespoons batter into the center of skillet. Lift and tilt pan to evenly coat bottom. Cook until top appears dry; turn and cook 15-20 seconds longer. Remove to plate; keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter, coating with additional nonstick cooking spray as needed.
Spread each crepe with about 2 teaspoons spreadable fruit. Top with about 3 tablespoons strawberries. Roll up. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
