Ingredients:
3 cups frozen strawberries, partially thawed
1 cup frozen collard greens or frozen spinach
1 cup plain yoghurt
3 cups pomegranate juice blend or cranberry juice blend
3 teaspoons good quality cod liver oil (optional)

Directions:
Add all ingredients into blender adjusting quantities to taste and blend until very smooth.
Pour into individual glasses/cups with straws and serve immediately.
Note: at first my 3-year-old didn't like the green flecks present in the smoothie (made by the collard greens or spinach) until I called them, "Magic Green Smoothie Sparkles". Now she loves it.

Description: 
The whole family will enjoy these sweet-tasting smoothies, especially the kiddies! Try these smoothies as part of a healthy breakfast to start the day off right. Use a good quality cod liver oil and there will be no fish taste. I put the strawberries and collard greens into a bowl in the fridge the night before so they are slightly thawed by morning. These smoothies are a perfect way to sneak in much-needed vitamins and minerals into your busy lifestyle.
