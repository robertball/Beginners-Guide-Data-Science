Ingredients:
1 cup dried cherries
1/3 cup cherry liqueur
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup chopped white chocolate
1/2 cup chopped semisweet chocolate
1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts

Directions:
Immerse dried cherries in boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and set in a small bowl with the cherry liqueur to soak, the longer, the better. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, cream the butter with the brown sugar and white sugar. Stir in the egg, vanilla, and almond extract. Sift together the flour, and baking soda; stir into the creamed mixture. Gently fold in the cherries, with the liqueur, white chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate and macadamia nuts. Batter should be soft and creamy.
Drop cookie dough by tablespoons onto the prepared cookie sheet. Leave 2 to 3 inches of space between cookies. Bake for 12 to 13 minutes in the preheated oven, cookies should be lightly browned. Remove from baking sheet to cool on wire racks.
