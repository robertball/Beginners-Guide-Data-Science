Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups warm water
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 cup honey
2 cups bread flour, plus extra
2 cups wheat flour
1 tablespoon cocoa powder
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoons instant coffee powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 teaspoons (1 envelope) rapid rise yeast
3 tablespoons cornmeal - for dusting

Directions:
1. Place all of the ingredients except the cornmeal and whipped butter in a bread machine and follow the manufacturer's directions.  The dough will be a little on the wet side and sticky, but if it seems too wet, add more bread flour. When dough is done let it rise for 1 hour.
2. Remove from machine, punch down and divide into 8 portions. Form the portions into tubular-shaped loaves 6 to 8 inches long and 2 inches wide.
3. Sprinkle the entire surface of the loaves with the cornmeal and place the loaves on two cookie sheets. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
5. Bake for 20-25 minutes. The internal temperature of a loaf of yeast bread when baked to perfection is 210 degrees F.  Serve warm
with whipped butter.
