Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (16 ounce) package pork sausage (such as Owens® Original)
1 small onion, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)
1 (12 ounce) package frozen chopped broccoli, thawed
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of celery soup
1 (32 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots®)
1 pinch ground black and red pepper blend (such as McCormick® Hot Shot®), or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes.
Mix tomatoes with green chile peppers, broccoli, Mexican cheese blend, and cream of celery soup into sausage mixture; spread into the prepared baking dish. Arrange potato nuggets over sausage mixture; season with pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and potato nuggets are slightly brown, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is a tastier version of Tater Tot® casserole with hearty ingredients for a full meal. Made with Owens® Original Breakfast Sausage, Ro*Tel® Diced Tomatoes, frozen broccoli cuts and Ore-Ida® Tater Tots®. I like it because it is easier than shepherd's pie. My friends and their pre-teen kids love it too. Spread more cheese over potatoes before baking if desired.
