Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
1 small red onion, thinly sliced
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup water
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed, halved lengthwise, and thinly sliced
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1/2 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon, but leave the drippings; blot the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble when cool.
Stir the onion and salt into the hot fat over medium heat until tender, about 5 minutes. Pour in the water and Dijon mustard. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until the water comes to a boil. Scrape the pan to dissolve the brown bits in the water. Add the Brussels sprouts and vinegar. Cook, stirring often, until the Brussels sprouts are tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Toss with bacon and Gorgonzola cheese crumbles to serve.
