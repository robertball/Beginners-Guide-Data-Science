1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup dried bread crumbs
1/3 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup milk

1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup shortening
12 fluid ounces tomato-based chili sauce
1 1/4 cups grape jelly

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine ground beef, bread crumbs, onion, milk, egg, salt, Worcestershire sauce, and ground black pepper. Mix together, and shape into meatballs.
In a large skillet, heat shortening over medium heat. Add meatballs, and cook until browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from skillet, and drain on paper towels.
Add chili sauce and jelly to skillet; heat, stirring, until jelly is melted. Return meatballs to skillet, and stir until coated. Reduce heat to low.  Simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes.

Description: 
Simple meatballs with an unusual chili sauce/grape jelly coating. Quite a combination of tastes and textures. Note: After cooking, I like to keep the meatballs warm in a slow cooker until ready to serve.
