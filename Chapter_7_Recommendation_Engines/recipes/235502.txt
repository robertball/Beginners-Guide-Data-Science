Ingredients:
12 3/4 ounces ground turkey, broken into small portions
6 3/8 ounces bacon, chopped
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 medium jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1 (16 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes, chopped
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Mix turkey, bacon, onion, bell pepper, and jalapeno pepper in a baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until the turkey is completely browned and the bacon is crisp, about 15 minutes.
Stir kidney beans, black beans, tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, salt, and cayenne pepper together in a large pot; bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low.
Stir turkey mixture into the beans mixture. Cook chili at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
I have made this dish for a group of 40. Made sure I did not tell them it was turkey until they asked for the recipe. Everyone could not believe it was turkey. Everyone wants me to make it again. Top with shredded Cheddar cheese alongside Spanish rice and tortilla chips.
