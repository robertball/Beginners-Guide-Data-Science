Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 leeks (white and pale green parts only), chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 cups half-and-half
1 pound potatoes, peeled and chopped
1 (8 ounce) bottle clam juice
1 pound cooked shrimp
2 (8 ounce) bags frozen corn
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir leeks into the butter and season with salt and black pepper; cook and stir until the leeks are tender, 4 to 5 minutes.
Stir flour into the leek mixture until dissolved completely and the mixture begins to thicken; add half-and-half, potatoes, and clam juice. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer for 10 minutes.
Stir shrimp and corn into the potato mixture; continue cooking until the potatoes are completely tender, about 10 minutes more. Remove pot from heat, add lemon juice and chives, and stir.
