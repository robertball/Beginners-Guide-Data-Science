Ingredients:
36 buttery crackers such as Keebler ClubÂ® Crackers
12 slices bacon, cut into thirds
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line two rimmed cookie sheets with aluminum foil.
Arrange crackers on the prepared cookie sheets in a single layer. Place a piece of bacon on top of each cracker, then put about a teaspoon of brown sugar on top of the bacon.
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is browned and crackers and bacon are glazed, about 45 minutes. Drain on paper towels before serving.
