Ingredients:
For the cake:
---------------------
5 T all purpose flour
4 T sugar
2 heaping teaspoons baking cocoa
1/4 tsp baking soda
dash salt
1/2 tsp white vinegar
1/4 tsp real vanilla extract
2 tsp vegetable oil
4 and 1/2 T water
-----------------------
For the glaze:
-----------------------
1 T real butter, melted
4 heaping T powdered sugar
dash salt
1/4 tsp vanilla extract (real)
1-2 teaspoons milk

Directions:
Grease a small round microwave proof dish, or spray with cooking spray.
In a 1 c glass measuring cup or small bowl, mix dry ingredients for cake well with fork or wisk. Make 3 small depressions (wells) in the dry ingredients, and add vinegar in one well, milk in another, and vanilla in another. Pour water over all, and mix well with a fork.
Microwave on high for approximately 2 minutes, being careful not to overcook. (Can use toothpick test, should come out clean in several areas of cake.) Set aside.
Rinse and dry the glass measuring cup, and melt 1 T butter. Add remaining frosting ingredients and stir well with fork or wisk. May add more powdered sugar or milk to obtain desired consistency. Spread over warm cake, and serve immediately.

Description: 
I think I finally perfected the art of a quick microwave cake, but I don't do it in a mug. This is the best one I've made so far, similar to depression era Wacky Cake recipes. A quick and delicious treat that rivals a baked cake, for those sweet cravings. Serves 2 if you feel like sharing :)
