Ingredients:
6 c flour
1/2 tsp yeast
2 1/2 tsp salt
3 c  water

Directions:
Mix together all ingredients in large bowl.
Cover with plastic film and leave on counter in warm room for 12-18 hours.
The next morning scrape out dough onto floured countertop and fold over over 5-10 times to form soft dough ball.
Place in parchment lined 10 inch fry pan.
Cover with plastic film then moist towel.  Let rise for 2 hours.
At beginning of final hour of rising heat oven to 450 degrees F and place 4 quart dutch oven in oven to heat through for that hour.
Just before moving dough into dutch oven, with a sharp knife, carefully cut large X on top of the raised bread.
Pick up raised dough ball by the parchment paper and set (parchment paper and all) into the dutch oven.
Place lid back on and bake for 30 minutes.
Remove lid and brown bread 5-10 minutes longer until golden brown on top.
Remove from oven.
Pick hot bread out of the dutch oven by the parchment paper and cool on wire rack.
Take parchment off before entirely cooled so it does not stick onto the bread.
