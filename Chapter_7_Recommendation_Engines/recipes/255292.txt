Ingredients:
1 head garlic
2 teaspoons olive oil
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 pinch ground cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Trim off the top of the head of garlic to expose cloves. Drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle salt and black pepper on top. Wrap in aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until garlic feels soft when lightly pressed, about 1 hour. Unwrap and cool, 5 to 10 minutes. Refrigerate until chilled, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Pull out individual garlic cloves with a sharp knife; place in a small bowl. Mash with a fork until creamy. Add mayonnaise, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne; mix well until blended.
Refrigerate until flavors combine, at least 1 hour.

Description: 
Creamy roasted garlic aioli can be made quickly with leftover roasted garlic. We love roasted garlic and tend to bake more than one at a time for convenience and to be energy efficient.
