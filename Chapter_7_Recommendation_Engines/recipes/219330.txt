Description: 
Mini muffins for finicky toddlers with the addition of fruit and veggies.  My son is 2 and has been eating these for a year.  I always keep a supply in the freezer, he loves them frozen especially when new teeth are coming in!  Adults love them too. Great for play groups! Recipe makes 24 mini muffins or 12 regular-size muffins.
