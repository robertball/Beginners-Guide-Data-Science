Ingredients:
4 Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast
4 cans Salsa Verde (as much as desired)
1 can Whole Kernel Corn, drained
1 Small Can sliced Mushrooms, drained
1 Pack Oaxaco Mexican Cheese (any kind of block cheese is fine)
Toothpicks
1 lb. Thorn Apple Bacon

Directions:
1. Clean and dry Chicken Breast. Lay breast flat on cutting board. Along rightside edge and starting in the middle cut chicken, stopping about an inch from left side. Do not cut all the way through, make sure you keep the top half and bottom half of chicken connected. You should be able to open chicken breast like a book.
2. Open chicken breast like a book and lay flat.
3. Cut up chunks of cheese and place on Chicken breast. Roll chicken around cheese and fold edges in.
4. Wrap bacon around chicken and secure with toothpicks so it will not open. You may use 1 or 2 slices of bacon. Repeat for every Chicken Breast.
5. In a large pan heat the Salsa Verde, Corn and mushrooms on medium high.
6. Put Bacon Wrapped chicken in the pan and allow to cook turning the chicken over carefully when you see fit. Cook until done. Chicken goes very well with beans.
