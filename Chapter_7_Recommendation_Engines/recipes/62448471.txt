1/4 tsp. minced garlic
1 - 2 tsps. Diced jalapeno peppers (optional)
12 roasted asparagus spears (optional)
½ - 3/4 cup Lump Crabmeat, heated in a separate skillet with 1 tbsp. butter, just to remove the chill from the crabmeat.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees
In bowl whisk eggs well; then add cream, parsley, and seasoning to taste - set aside.

Turn down heat to medium-low and add eggs to skillet with onions and peppers, stirring well to blend; with a rubber spatula, gradually pull in eggs from around the sides of the skillet as it's cooking; when it starts to set, top with mushrooms, crabmeat, then top with cheeses.
Bake in the oven for 3 - 5 minutes, until eggs are fully set and cheese has melted.  Sprinkle additional seasoning on top, according to your taste.
