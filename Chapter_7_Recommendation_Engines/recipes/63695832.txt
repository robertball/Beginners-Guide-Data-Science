Ingredients:
1/2 tsp canola oil
1 tbs unsalted butter
1 tbs butter cubed into small pieces and frozen
6 large eggs
Pinch salt
Pinch pepper
2 tbs shredded parmesan cheese
4 tsp chives, minced

Directions:
Place 1/4 tsp canola oil in 8" omelete skillet (with lid set aside, but ready to use) over low heat. Let warm for 10 minutes.
Crack 2 eggs into medium bowl. Separate yolk from 3rd egg (use white for something else) and add yolk to medium bowl with 2 whole eggs. Beat eggs moderately for 80 strokes. Stir in half of the frozen butter cubes.
When omelet skillet is fully heated, wipe out oil with a paper towel, leaving a thin film all over the skillet. Add 1/2 tbs butter to the skillet and heat until foaming subsides - about 1-1/2 minutes. Swirl butter to coat skillet. Add egg mizture and increae heat to medium-high.
Use 2 wooden chopstiks to scramble egg mixture, swirling eggs and scraping egg from the sides, until eggs are almost cooked, but still slightly runny - about 1-1/5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Turn heat to low.
Smooth eggs into a nice, even layer with a silicon spatula. Sprinkle omelet with 1 tbs cheese and 2 tsp chives. Cover skillet and let sit for 1-2 minutes.
Put skillet back on low heat for 20 seconds. Use silicon spatula to loosen edges of omelet from sides and slideout of skillet onto serving plate and roll omelet to serve.
Repeat for second omelet.
