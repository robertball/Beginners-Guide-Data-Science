Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Add butter; stir until combined. Press onto the bottom and up the sides of a 9-in. pie plate. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Pour pie filling into crust.
In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, egg and vanilla until smooth. Carefully spread around outside edges of pie, leaving a 3-in. circle of cherries exposed in the center. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until edges begin to brown. Cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate for several hours before serving.
