Ingredients:
20 oz ground turkey
4 tbsp minced onion
1 tsp minced garlic (~2 cloves)
1 packet taco seasoning

1/4 c water
4 oz diced green chilis
1 can black beans, drained, and roughly mashed
2 c grated Mexican blend cheese
3 tubes refrigerator crescent rolls

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Place turkey and onion in a skillet, over medium high heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until turkey is cooked through. Drain, if needed.
Add garlic, taco seasoning, taco sauce, and water. Bring to boil, lower heat, and simmer 15 minutes.
Stir in diced green chilis, drained and mashed black beans, and grated cheese.
Unroll crescent rolls, and cut each triangle in half.*
Place heaping teaspoonful of the meat filling on each triangle, then fold the corners of the triangle to the middle, like a diaper. Place on parchment covered baking sheet.
Bake according to directions on crescent roll package, approximately 10-13 minutes, until golden brown
If making these ahead, cool on racks
Enjoy!

I like to call these 'Little Montezuma's Revenge' (= This is my version of 'Dirty Diapers,' submitted by Melanie K. - with a mexican twist. I made a double batch of these for a (large!) babyshower - 96 diapers! - and there were none left!
