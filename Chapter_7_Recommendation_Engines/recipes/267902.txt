Ingredients:
3/4 cup water
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
1 cinnamon stick
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
1 (12 ounce) bag fresh cranberries

Directions:
Combine water, sugar, orange juice, cinnamon stick, ginger, orange zest, and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sugar is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir cranberries into the sugar mixture in the saucepan and return to a boil over medium heat. Cook until cranberries start to burst and mixture thickens slightly, 8 to 10 minutes; sauce will thicken further upon cooling.
Transfer cranberry sauce to a bowl; remove and discard cinnamon stick. Store in the refrigerator; for best flavor, bring to room temperature before serving.

Description: 
The warmth of the ginger and cloves and the brightness of the orange zest come together to make this a family favorite! You can use frozen cranberries if you can't find fresh - just simmer a few minutes longer. Make this ahead of time, and save yourself some stress on the big day!
