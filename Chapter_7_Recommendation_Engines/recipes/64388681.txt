Ingredients:
1 Cup quinoa
2 Cups water or chicken broth
1 tablespoon canola or olive oil

Directions:
Put the quinoa in a strainer placed over the sink. Use cool, running water to rinse the quinoa for approximately two minutes, rubbing and sifting the seeds to ensure that each are washed thoroughly. Allow the quinoa to drain.
Heat a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add approximately 1 tablespoon of canola or olive oil for every cup of quinoa and heat. Toast the quinoa in the oil, stirring frequently with a spatula or wooden spoon, until the quinoa is a light golden color, about six to eight minutes.
Pour the chicken broth into the saucepan, using 2 cups of broth for every 1 cup of quinoa. Bring the mixture to a boil.
Put the lid in place and decrease the heat to low. Cook for 15 minutes without stirring.
Remove the pan from the heat and let it stand, with the lid still in place, for five minutes.
Fluff the individual quinoa seeds gently with a fork to before serving.
