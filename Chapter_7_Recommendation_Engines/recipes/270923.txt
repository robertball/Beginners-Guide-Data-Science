Ingredients:
1 (32 ounce) package frozen French fries
6 slices bacon
4 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded
4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and sliced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Arrange fries in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until light golden in color, 17 to 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Dice.
Remove fries from the oven. Preheat the oven's broiler. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Add a layer of fries, diced bacon, cheeses, and jalapeno peppers. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used.
Broil until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.

Not the healthiest snack, but one of my favorites for Sunday football! Feel free to tweak ingredients to suit your personal taste. Serve with your favorite condiments; I recommend blue cheese dressing or barbeque sauce.
