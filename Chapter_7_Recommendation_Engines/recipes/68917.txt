Ingredients:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon stone ground mustard
1 teaspoon capers
1 teaspoon ketchup
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1 pound swai fish
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup finely crushed plain Melba toast rounds
salt and pepper to taste
1 clove garlic, minced
1 lemon, sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a bowl, thoroughly blend the mayonnaise, mustard, capers, ketchup, paprika, and hot pepper sauce.
Brush the basa fillets with about 1 tablespoon olive oil, and roll in the crushed Melba toast to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Use a kitchen sprayer to lightly spray the coated fish with remaining olive oil. Arrange the fish in a baking dish and top with garlic and lemon slices.
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork and coating is lightly browned. Serve with the mayonnaise sauce mixture.
