Ingredients:
3/4 pound lean ground beef
1 medium onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (10.75 ounce) can 98% fat-free condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can 98% fat-free condensed cream of chicken soup
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
10 (6 inch) corn tortillas, torn into bite-sized pieces
12 ounces shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Set aside.
Mix mushroom soup, chicken soup, and tomatoes together in an electric blender. Add to ground beef mixture.
Layer pieces from 5 to 6 tortillas, 1/2 of the beef mixture, and 1/2 of the Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese in the casserole dish. Repeat layers, ending with cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
