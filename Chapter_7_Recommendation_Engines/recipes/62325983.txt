Ingredients:
2 cups milk
1/4 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 Tbsp salt
1/2 cup butter flavored shortening
1 package yeast
4 cups flour to start; up to 8 total but probably around 5-6
Brown sugar, cinnamon, raisins, pecans, and butter

Directions:
Heat milk (95 to 110 degrees) and mix with a spoon of the total sugar and the package of yeast. Set aside for 5 minutes while you mix the dry ingredients and cut in the shortening with a pastry blender or fork. Add yeast mix and eggs; mix till thoroughly combined. Knead dough "real well;" cover and let rise in a warm place till at least doubled in bulk. Punch down, knead, and let rise again. Punch down and knead, then roll to 1/4-3/8" thickness on a floured board. Spread with filling; roll into a log and cut in 1" width. Let rise; bake at 350 F till done. Donâ€™t burn. Should have slight brown appearance. Cover with brown sugar and butter, or powdered sugar glaze. Heat frosting slightly.
