Ingredients:
2 pounds top sirloin, 2 inches thick
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
2 oranges, juiced

Directions:
Make crisscross cuts on surface of meat on both sides, and place in a shallow dish.  Reserve 1/2 cup orange juice.  Mix remaining orange juice with garlic and ginger.  Pour over meat, and marinate in refrigerator for at least 6 hours.
Preheat grill for medium heat.
Brush grate with oil, and place steak on grill.  Cook for 10 to 12 minutes per side, or until done. Remove from grill, and rest for several minutes.
Meanwhile, heat reserved orange juice.  Slice meat, and transfer to a serving platter.  Pour heated orange juice over the meat.
