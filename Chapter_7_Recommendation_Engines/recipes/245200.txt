Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix
2 large eggs
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 (12 ounce) jar hot fudge sauce
1 (21 ounce) can LUCKY LEAFÂ® Regular or Premium Cherry Fruit Filling & Topping
2 cups heavy cream
1 1/4 cups powdered sugar
Chocolate bar for shavings

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare 9x13-inch baking dish according to directions on cake box.
Prepare cake according to directions on box. Bake 20-22 minutes. Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick in middle of cake. If toothpick comes out clean, cake is done. Allow to cool for 10 minutes.
While cake is still warm, use the end of a wooden spoon or another round object and poke holes over the top of the cake.
Microwave hot fudge about 30 seconds or until it is thinned out and can be stirred. You may need to microwave an additional 30 seconds. Pour the jar of hot fudge sauce on top of cake and allow it to absorb in the cake. Let set until completely cooled.
Spread cherry fruit filling evenly over top of cake.
Prepare homemade whipped cream*: For best results, freeze bowl and whisk attachment about 5-10 minutes until really cold. Add heavy cream to cold bowl and beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Add powdered sugar and increase speed to medium high. Beat until stiff peaks form.
Spread whipped cream over top of cake. Chop or grate chocolate bar into small pieces to sprinkle over top of cake.
Keep refrigerated.
