Ingredients:
2 (17.3 ounce) packages Pepperidge FarmÂ® Puff Pastry Sheets
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
1/2 pound ground pork or turkey
1 small red pepper, diced
4 medium green onions, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup tomato sauce
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
1 cup sour cream
1 cup guacamole

Directions:
Thaw the pastry sheets at room temperature for 40 minutes or until they're easy to handle. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or spray with vegetable cooking spray. Stir the egg and water with a fork in a small bowl.
Cook the pork in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the pork is well browned, stirring frequently to break up meat. Add the diced red pepper, green onions and garlic. Cook until tender. Stir the tomato sauce, cumin, chili powder and crushed red pepper into the skillet. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 8 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the cheese, 1 cup of the beans and cilantro. Let cool.
Unfold 1 pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Roll to a 16x12-inch rectangle. Cut into 10 (2 1/2-inch) rounds. Top half of each round with 1 teaspoon cheese mixture. Brush edges of pastry with water. Fold over and press the edges with a fork to seal. Place the empanadas on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining pastry and cheese mixture. Brush with the egg mixture.
Bake for 18 minutes or until golden. Serve with sour cream, guacamole and remaining beans.
