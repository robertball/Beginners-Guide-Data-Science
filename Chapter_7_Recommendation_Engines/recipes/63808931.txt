Ingredients:
1.) 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour, divided
2.) 1/4 teaspoon salt, optional
3.) 1/2 teaspoon pepper, divided
4.) 1-1/2 pounds boneless beef chuck roast, cut into 1-inch cubes
5.) 1 medium onion, chopped
6.) 1 tablespoon canola oil or olive oil
7.) 3 garlic cloves, minced
8.) 3 cups beef broth
9.) 1 can (14-1/2 ounces) stewed tomatoes, cut up
10.) 3/4 teaspoon dried thyme
11.) 3 large potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
12.) 3 medium carrots, cut into 1/4-inch slices
13.) 1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine 4 tablespoons flour, salt if desired and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Add beef, a few pieces at a time, and shake to coat.
In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, brown beef in oil in batches. Remove and set aside. Add onion to the pan and cook until tender. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Stir in remaining flour and pepper until blended. Gradually stir in broth. Add the beef, tomatoes and thyme. Cover and bake at 350° for 1-1/4 hours.
Add the potatoes and carrots. Cover and bake 1 hour longer or until meat and vegetables are tender. Stir in peas; cover and let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
