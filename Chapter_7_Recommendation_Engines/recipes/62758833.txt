Ingredients:
1 pkg center cut pork chops (4 - 6)
1 to 2 tbsp olive oil
1 can onion soup
1 tomato (cut into wedges) (optional)
1 green pepper (sliced)
1 large onion (sliced)
1 tsp dijon mustard
1 tbsp worstershire sauce
2 good shakes garlic powder
Dash or two of hot sauce (optional)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in skillet and quickly saute the onions and green pepper until just limp (do not add tomato wedges at this time). Remove and set aside.  In same skillet brown chops on both sides, then remove onto holding plate. Into pan drippings on medium heat, add the worstershire sauce, garlic powder, hot sauce, mustard and onion soup, stirring quickly to blend.  When this begins to bubble, add back in the chops, cover and lower heat to very low. Let this simmer for some time (40 mins or so) and add a little water if juices get low. Last 5 minutes add the onion mixture and the fresh tomato wedges (get these down into the juice).  Simmer uncovered a few minutes and let the juices cook down some. Then serve. Is great with rice or mashed potatoes.
