Ingredients:
1/2 cups coarsely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
(4 to 5 ounces; do not use a food processor)
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
* Equipment: a nonstick baking pad such as Silpat

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F with rack in middle. Line a large baking sheet with nonstick pad.
Stir together cheese and flour. Make 4 mounds (about 1 1/2 tablespoons each) about 5 inches apart on baking sheet and spread each mound to form a 4- to 5-inch round.
Bake until pale golden, about 10 minutes. Cool 2 minutes on baking sheet on a rack, then carefully transfer each wafer (they are very delicate) with a wide metal spatula to rack to cool completely.
Stir cheese in bowl (to redistribute flour) and make 4 more wafers in same manner.
Cooks' note: Wafers can be made 2 days ahead and kept, layered between sheets of parchment or wax paper, in an airtight container at room temperature.
