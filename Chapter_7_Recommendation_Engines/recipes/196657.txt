Ingredients:
1 pound ground antelope meat
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
2 red potatoes, cubed
1 stalk celery, thinly sliced
1 tomato, chopped
3 (14 ounce) cans beef broth
1 cup water
1 cup elbow macaroni
salt and black pepper to taste
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste

Directions:
Stir the antelope, bell pepper, onion, and chives together in a large pot over medium heat until the vegetables are very tender and the antelope has browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in the corn, red potatoes, celery, tomato, beef broth, water, and macaroni. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes more. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before serving.

Description: 
I had recently been given some antelope burger (ground) and i didn't know exactly what to do with it, so i just put together what i had and it turned out great. My whole family enjoyed it! You can use ground beef as well; antelope taste similar.
