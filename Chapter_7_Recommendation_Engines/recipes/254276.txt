8 slices salami, or more to form 2 rows
¼ cup tomato sauce, or other crushed tomato product
½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or more to cover
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
2 teaspoons olive oil, or as needed

Directions:

Chef John
Description: 
What started out as a frustrating attempt to test some pizza dough, turned into what we're calling salami bread. It would make a great Italian submarine sandwich, or just load it up with lots of Italian cheeses and fresh and pickled vegetables.
