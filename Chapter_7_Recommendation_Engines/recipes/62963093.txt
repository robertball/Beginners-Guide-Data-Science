Ingredients:
1/2 Cup Solid Vegetable Shortening
5 Cups Powdered Sugar
1/2 Cup Butter or Margarine
3 Tbsp. Milk
1 1/2 Tsp. Vanilla Extract

Directions:
In a large bowl with an electric mixer, cream butter and shortening; then add vanilla. Add sugar, a cup at a time, beating on medium speed. When all the sugar has been mixed in, icing will appear dry. Add milk and beat at high speed until light and fluffy. Keep icing covered with a damp cloth until you're ready to decorate. For best results, keep icing refrigerated when not using.
