Ingredients:
4 eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
3 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese
1 teaspoon milk
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
In a small bowl, beat eggs and pepper together. In another small bowl, combine crumbled cheese with milk.
Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in eggs, and tilt pan until bottom is evenly covered. When edges appear cooked, place feta mixture in a line in the center of eggs. Using a spatula, fold eggs over top and bottom of cheese, then fold sides over.

Description: 
This omelet is juicy with this cheese - everyone that tried it, loved it, and they never expected it to turn out this good. Make sure pan is well greased, or else sides will stick and you won't be able to roll it.
