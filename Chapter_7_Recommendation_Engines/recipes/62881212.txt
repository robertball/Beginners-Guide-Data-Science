Ingredients:
11 gr of instant yeast
10 egg yolks
1 egg white (optional, makes the cakes more firm)
150 gr  sugar
150 gr tapioca flour
300 ml  coconut milk
10 kaffir lime leaves
1/2 tsp. vanilla essence
1 tsp of salt
Some vegetable oil for greasing
Small cups to make small cakes.
A bunch of sand

Directions:
1.Cook the coconut milk with the kaffir lime leaves, vanilla essence and the salt for about 10 minutes on low heat, this allows the flavour of the lime leaves to develop. Set aside to cool.
2.Mix the egg yolks with the optional egg white and sugar in till it is a smooth and creamy mixture. Put in the tapioca flour and mix well. Then finally add the cooled coconut milk and the instant yeast. Cover with a wet towel and set aside on a warm spot to rise for 3 hours, you are not even allowed to look at it!
3.After 3 hours, take a large flat pan, put in a 1,5 cm thick layer of sand (any kind will do) and put it on a medium fire. Grease the cups (I use aluminium mould) and put the batter in a cup until the cup is 2/3 full, continue until all the cups are filled. Place the cups on the sand and let cakes cook until the cakes are dry on top (takes about 30 minutes).
4.Take cakes from the stove and grill them in the oven, only with the top grill, until they are nice golden brown.
