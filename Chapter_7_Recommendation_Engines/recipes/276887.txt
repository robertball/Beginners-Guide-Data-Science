Ingredients:
Marinade:
1 cup buttermilk
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 dash hot sauce, or to taste
1 tablespoon dry ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley Ranch速)
4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
Breading:
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper (optional)
1 tablespoon dry ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley Ranch速)
Wash:
1 large egg, beaten
1/2 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup milk
The Rest:
canola oil for frying
4 soft hamburger buns, toasted and buttered
6 tablespoons mayonnaise, or to taste
12 dill pickle slices, or to taste

Directions:
Whisk buttermilk, salt, hot sauce, and ranch dressing mix together in a large bowl. Cut diagonal slits into the thick ends of chicken breasts and toss into marinade until well coated. Transfer to the refrigerator to marinate for 2 to 4 hours.
Meanwhile, make the breading: Mix flour, cornstarch, salt, pepper, cayenne, and ranch dressing mix together in a shallow dish.
Make the wash: Whisk egg, buttermilk, and milk together in another bowl until combined.
Use a fork to pull chicken from marinade, letting any excess drip off. Dip into the breading to coat both sides; shake off any excess. Dip into egg wash mixture to saturate surface; return to breading to coat, shake off excess, and repeat once more. Let sit on a wire rack to dry, at least 15 minutes.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer to between 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Fry chicken breasts in the hot oil until golden, crispy, and no longer pink in the centers, 4 to 5 minutes, flipping halfway through. Transfer to a plate topped with crinkled up aluminum foil to prevent bottoms from getting soggy.
Spread mayonnaise over hamburger bun halves. Stuff with pickles and chicken.

Description: 
I tried to make a copycat Popeyes速 fried chicken sandwich and ended up with a hybrid between that and the one from Chick-fil-A速. So you get the best of both worlds and what's more, this DIY version never runs out, not even on Sundays.
