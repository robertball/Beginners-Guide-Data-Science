Ingredients:
4 large baking potatoes
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons milk
1 (1 ounce) package ranch salad dressing mix
1 1/2 cups mashed potatoes
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Scrub and pierce potatoes; place on a microwave-safe plate.  Microwave, uncovered, on high for 18-20 minutes or until tender, turning several times.  Let stand for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, combine cream cheese and milk; beat in salad dressing mix.  Add mashed potatoes; mix well.  Cut a thin slice from the top of each potato; scoop out pulp, leaving a thin shell.   Add pulp to the cream cheese mixture and mash.  Spoon into potato shells.   Top with cheese.
Place two potatoes on a microwave-safe plate.  Microwave, uncovered, on high for 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 minutes or until heated through.  Place remaining potatoes on a baking sheet.  Freeze overnight or until thoroughly frozen; transfer to a freezer bag.  May be frozen for up to 3 months.
To use frozen potatoes:  Place potatoes on a microwave-safe plate.  Microwave, uncovered, at 50% powder for 8-9 minutes or until heated through.
