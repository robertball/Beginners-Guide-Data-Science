Ingredients:
1 cup self-rising flour
1 cup beer
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups sliced cauliflower
4 cups vegetable oil

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
Whisk flour, beer, black pepper, and salt together in a bowl to make batter. Submerge cauliflower pieces in batter to coat. Working in batches of 10, drag 1 piece at a time gently against the rim of the bowl to remove excess batter and transfer to the hot oil. Fry cauliflower, stirring gently to keep pieces separate, until golden, 2 to 4 minutes.
Use a slotted spoon to transfer fried cauliflower to a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Keep warm in the oven.
Return oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) between batches and continue frying cauliflower.

Description: 
This is a great and easy recipe for fried cauliflower. I recommend only using self-rising flour because it helps it get more crispy and the right texture. You can serve this with ranch, blue cheese dressing, or marinara sauce.
