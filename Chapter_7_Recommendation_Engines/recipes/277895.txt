Ingredients:
1/2 cup almond milk
1/2 cup coconut oil, melted
3 small bananas, mashed
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/3 cup agave nectar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups spelt flour
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners or grease with coconut oil.
Mix almond milk, coconut oil, bananas, eggs, agave nectar, and vanilla extract together in a medium mixing bowl until well blended.
Combine flour, chocolate chips, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and gelatin in a large mixing bowl. Form a well in the center and add banana mixture all at once. Stir until just combined but still a bit lumpy. Fill the prepared muffin cups with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 16 to 18 minutes. Cool in the tin for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I created this recipe after a month of Paleo/primal eating as an alternative to traditional baked goods. Chock-full of healthy fats and fiber, these delicious little muffins leave you feeling full for longer and are easier for many people to digest. I generally use sprouted flours and organic ingredients, but they are still tasty without it.
