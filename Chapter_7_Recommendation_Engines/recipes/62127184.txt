Ingredients:
3 Tbs. olive oil
2 1/2 lbs. Bratwurst sausages, slice into 1" thick pieces
1/2 medium onion, chopped
3 14.5 oz. cans low-sodium chicken broth
1 lb. Angel Hair pasta, or thin spaghetti, broken in half
2 10-oz. bags  baby spinach, rinsed
1 1/2 cups dairy half and half
3/4 cup grated Romano cheese

Directions:
In large pot or dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium high heat.  Add sliced brats and brown them, stirring gently and frequently to keep them from sticking to the pot.  Add onions and continue cooking until onions are opaque, stirring frequently.
Turn burner to high, add chicken broth and bring to a boil.  Add pasta and cook until al dente, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes.
Turn burner to low and add the spinach and cover the pot to wilt, about 2 minutes (do this in batches if the pot is too small).
Stir in half and half and Romano cheese and continue to stir until heated through, about 3 minutes.  Serve.

Description: 
This one-pot meal is easy to prepare and so delicious!  You can substitute almost any meat or seafood for the Brats.  It's also yummy with shrimp/scallops, Italian sausages, or chicken.  Leftovers are fabulous and there's an extra bonus:  Only one pot to clean up!
