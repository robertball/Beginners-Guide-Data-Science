Ingredients:
4 pounds chicken thighs which have more flavor
7 cups water
1 large onion, halved
3 stalks celery
3 carrots, cut into 2 inch pieces
2 bay leaf
leftover parsley stems (optional)
fresh garlic to taste (optional)
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger or to taste
favorite spices (optional)
salt to taste

Directions:
Place the chicken in a large pot over high heat. Add water to cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 45 min.
Remove chicken from pot. Leave water in pot. Cool chicken. Remove skin and bones from meat. Return bones and skin to pot. Add onions, carrots, celery, bay leaf, ginger, and salt. Continue simmering for one hour stain and mash. Return bones to pot with extra spices and cook 2 to 4 hours.
Strain and cool the stock, uncovered. Refrigerate over night and remove hardened white chicken fat from top.
Use the meat for soups, salads, sandwiches, or other dishes where cooked chicken is needed. After stock has been defatted, use or freeze immediately. I freeze the stock in one-cup amounts and use instead of water for cooking rice or vegetables or making gravy.
