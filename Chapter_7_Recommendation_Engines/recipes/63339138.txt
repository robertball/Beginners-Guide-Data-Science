Seperate dinner rolls, cut each in half and place on a large cookie sheet that had been lined with foil.
Spread garlic butter mixture evenly over the cut sides of all the rolls.
Place under broiler 1-2 minutes, until toasty; set aside and turn oven down to 350 degrees.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat.
Place sliced sausages in a single layer and brown on both sides (about 2-3 minutes per side).
Evenly arrange sausages over bottom halves of rolls.
Top each w/ a spoon of sauce, mozzarella cheese and 2 pepper rings; replace tops of rolls.
