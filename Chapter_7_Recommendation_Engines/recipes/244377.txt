Description: 
This tastes just like real Italian gelato, but low-fat. And using condensed milk, no one will ever know! You can use any of your favorite berries for this recipe. My favorite is raspberry. Also tastes great with a ripe banana mixed in. Or try something exotic and tropical such as kiwi and mango with coconut extract.
