Ingredients:
8 1/2 cups medium tomatoes, quartered
1 large red onion, chopped
1 tbsp garlic, minced
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp Italian seasoning
1/2 tsp salt, plus more to taste
2 tbsp olive oil
6 oz (3/4 cup) nonfat Greek yogurt
Cilantro for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F.
In a large roasting pan, combine tomatoes, onions, garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp salt, and olive oil. Toss to mix completely.
Roast in the oven for about 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.
Once the tomatoes are roasted, remove from oven and let cool for 15-20 minutes, or until lukewarm.
In a blender, blend the roasted tomato mixture with the yogurt. If your blender cannot hold all of the ingredients, do this in separate batches. It is better to do smaller batches to achieve a more even consistency than to overfill your blender.
Combine in a pot or saucepan. At this point, depending on the type and ripeness of your tomatoes, your soup may be sweeter or more sour, so add in enough salt to adjust the taste to your liking. Heat until just boiling, then serve with cilantro as garnish.
