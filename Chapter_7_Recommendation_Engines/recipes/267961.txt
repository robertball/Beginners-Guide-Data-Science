2 cups shredded cooked turkey
1/2 cup salsa verde

1/3 cup jellied cranberry sauce
1 tablespoon lime juice
1/3 cup sour cream
1 small bunch cilantro, coarsely chopped, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil; arrange chips on it.
Stir turkey and salsa together in a bowl. Fill chips with turkey mixture, then top with cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and chips are golden, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, stir cranberry sauce and lime juice together in a bowl. Top each chip with some of the cranberry-lime mixture and some of the sour cream. Sprinkle with cilantro.
