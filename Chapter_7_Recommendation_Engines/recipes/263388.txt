Ingredients:
1 bunch fresh sweet basil, stemmed
5 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, divided
4 tablespoons pine nuts
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic
1/2 tablespoon salt
1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 pound raw shrimp
1 (12 ounce) package potato gnocchi

Directions:
Combine basil, 4 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, olive oil, whole garlic cloves, salt, and pepper in a blender; puree until pesto is smooth.
Melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add minced garlic; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add shrimp; cook and stir until opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and keep warm.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain. Mix pesto into gnocchi and serve with shrimp. Garnish with remaining Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This buttery, garlicky shrimp and pesto over gnocchi or pasta is a comfort food I like to cook once in a while. 
Serve it with garlic toast and, if you like, a plain salad.
