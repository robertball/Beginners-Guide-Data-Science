Ingredients:
1 pound round steak, chopped
1 cup margarine
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 gallon water
1/4 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 large carrot, diced
1 onion, chopped
1 stalk celery, diced
1/3 cup diced red bell pepper
1 cup baby Bella mushrooms, sliced
1 cup frozen corn kernels
16 ounces stewed or diced tomatoes
12 cubes beef bouillon
2 tablespoons margarine

Directions:
Make a roux by melting the butter or margarine, then stirring in the flour. Brown gently.
Gradually add 2 cups of the water to the roux and stir until smooth. Add the remaining water, the carrot, onion, celery, frozen vegetables, canned tomatoes, and beef base granules.
In a skillet saute the steak in 2 tablespoons butter or margarine until browned. Drain off all the grease. Add the browned steak to the soup and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/2 hours or until the vegetables are tender.  Season to taste with freshly ground black pepper. Once cooked this soup may be frozen for later use.
