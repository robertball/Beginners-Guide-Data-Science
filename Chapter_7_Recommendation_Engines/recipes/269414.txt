Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup butter
1 cup dried cranberries
1 cup chopped pecans
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
1 cup eggnog
1 tablespoon coarse sparkling sugar, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a large mixing bowl. Cut in butter until mixture looks crumbly. Mix in cranberries, pecans, and orange zest until evenly distributed. Stir in eggnog.
Turn dough out on a well floured surface and cut into 2 pieces. Keep sprinkling on flour if needed. Form each piece into a disk and gently pat each disk into a round about 6 inches in diameter. Sprinkle each disk with coarse sparkling sugar. Cut each round into 8 wedges using a bench scraper or sharp knife. Cut straight down through the dough so you shear the edges; this helps the scones rise. Don't separate the wedges.
Transfer dough circles to the prepared baking sheet. Separate the wedges slightly; there should be about 1 inch between the wider edges.
Bake in the preheated oven until scones are just beginning to brown, about 20 minutes. Serve warm.

Description: 
I like making these eggnog scones for my coworkers the week before we all take off for the year and shut down the office. I also bring in a carton of eggnog to be used as creamer in our coffee. They love the little extra treat!
