Ingredients:
1 egg
1 1/2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as SrirachaÂ®)
1 (16 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 jalapeno pepper, minced
1 cup canned whole kernel corn, drained
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Whisk egg, cumin, chili powder, and chile-garlic sauce together in a bowl.
Mash black beans in a separate bowl until they reach a paste-like consistency.
Stir jalapeno pepper, corn, and garlic through the black bean paste.
Mix the egg mixture into the black bean mixture.
Scatter the bread crumbs over the black bean mixture; mix with your hands to evenly incorporate.
Form the resulting mixture into 4 patties.
Pour flour into the bottom of a shallow dish; coat the patties in the flour to help them hold shape.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the patties in hot oil until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.
