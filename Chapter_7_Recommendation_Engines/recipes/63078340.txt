Ingredients:
1 refrigerated pie crust (Pillsbury)
1/2 cup onion, chopped
3/4 cup Real Bacon pieces, heated
1 tbsp butter
1 1/2 cups evaporated milk (or heavy cream)
6 eggs
1/2 to 3/4 cup canned spinach, drained
3 oz. cheddar, shredded
3 oz. Colby-Jack cheese, shredded
2 tbsp Gorgonzola cheese
1 small can sliced mushrooms
1 tsp thyme
1 tsp garlic salt
Pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place pie crust into a quiche pan or 9-inch pie dish (may need to roll out slightly so that crust overlaps edge; crimp over plate edge). Cover crust with a sheet of aluminum foil and fill crust with pie weights or dried beans. Bake the crust in the preheated oven just until the edges begin to turn golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, and take out the pie weights and aluminum foil.
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and saute onion until translucent; set aside. Sprinkle bacon into the partially-baked crust. Whisk the milk, eggs and spices together in a bowl; fold in spinach, onion, cheese and mushrooms until well blended. Pour mixture into crust, covering bacon.
Return to oven, and bake until the filling is set in the middle and the quiche is puffy and golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool 15 min., serve warm.
