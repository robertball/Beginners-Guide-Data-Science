Ingredients:
SAUCE:
1/3 cup good-tasting chicken stock
3 Tbsp. rice vinegar OR white vinegar
1 Tbsp. lime juice
3-4 Tbsp. brown sugar
2 Tbsp. fish sauce
1 Tbsp. soy sauce
1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
1/8 tsp. white pepper
PAD THAI:
250 g dried medium rice noodles
2 tbl julienned dry tofu
2 tbl minced shallot
2 tbl sweet radish
1 tbl minced garlic
1 bunch fresh chives, 1 inch peices
1 egg
2 tbl oil
1/3 cup crushed, roasted peanuts
2 lime wedges
2-3 cups bean sprouts
1 1/2 cups cooked chicken or shrimp

Directions:
Mix all sauce ingredients in small bowl until sugar has dissolved. Set aside.
Soak noodles for 10 minutes in hot water. Rinse with cold water. Drain, set aside.
Heat oil in a large pan on medium-high heat. Add garlic and shallots and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add tofu and radish and stir-fry another 30 seconds. Add noodles and 1/2 of reserved sauce. Stir for about 1 minute, adding remaining sauce. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes. Add the egg to the side of the pan, scrambling it a bit with your stirring utensil, also moving the noodles around until egg is set. If at any time the pan gets too dry, you can add a very small amount of water just to loosen the noodles. Add bean sprouts and 1/3 of your chives. Add cooked chicken or shrimp. Stir-fry to heat through.
Arrange on plate using peanuts, remaining chives and lime wedges for garnish.
