Description: 
I had to make something QUICK for a Mexican themed birthday party, so I threw this together and got RAVE reviews. Some ate it separately most though added it to their burrito and/or fajita mixin's...As usual, I rarely measure, so these measurements are appproximate and by memory...sorry! TRY to make the night before, but it's still good when made on the fly!
