Add ground beef to the top of the pot and cover, cooking low until cabbage begins to make its own juices.  Stir pot occasionally and keep covered until Cabbage is tender and beef is cooked well.

Description: 
My mother was a country cook, plain and simple. But as I have traveled and worked and experienced foods from around the world, I look back and realize that many of the dishes she prepared, while simple, was perfect for that moment.  Sometimes we have to put emotion and love in a dish to make it extra special.  The dish I am going to give you today is one like that.  Simple and easy, yet full of love and goodness, enjoy an Ozark Memory of:
