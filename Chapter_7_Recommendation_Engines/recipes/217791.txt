Ingredients:
1/2 cup DianaÂ® Marinade, Garlic & Herb flavour
1/2 cup Heinz Tomato Ketchup
2 teaspoons dried oregano leaves
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 pound pork tenderloin, cut into 16 bite-size chunks
16 bite-size chunks zucchini
16 cherry tomatoes

Directions:
Soak 8 long bamboo skewers in cold water for 30 minutes. Preheat the grill to medium-high and grease the grate. Stir the marinade with the ketchup, oregano and lemon juice until well combined. Toss half of this mixture with the pork and the vegetables; let stand for 15 minutes.
Thread 2 pieces each of pork, zucchini and cherry tomatoes alternately onto each skewer. Grill the skewers; turn as needed and baste occasionally with remaining marinade mixture for 10 to 12 minutes or until pork is cooked through
