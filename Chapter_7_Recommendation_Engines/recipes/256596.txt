Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup thick buttermilk
1 cup chickpea flour
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon asafoetida powder
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
salt to taste
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
1 teaspoon chopped curry leaves
1 teaspoon asafoetida powder

Directions:
Combine water, buttermilk, chickpea flour, sugar, 1 teaspoon asafoetida powder, turmeric, and salt in a microwave-safe bowl; beat into a smooth batter with no lumps remaining.
Cook chickpea mixture in the microwave on high for 90 seconds. Beat mixture to break up any lumps. Repeat 3 times, cooking at 90-second intervals and beating after each interval until mixture is slightly thicker than hummus.
Spread mixture into 2 thin 12x18-inch sheets on a clean and dry steel, granite, or marble kitchen counter using a palette knife. Let cool, 5 to 10 minutes.
Cut sheet into 1-inch thick ribbons. Roll up ribbons like a jelly roll.
Heat peanut oil in a saucepan over low heat. Add mustard seeds; cook until they start to pop, about 30 seconds. Stir in curry leaves and 1 teaspoon asafoetida powder.
Spoon oil mixture over rolls.
