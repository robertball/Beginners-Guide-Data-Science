Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks - drained with juice reserved
2 teaspoons rice wine vinegar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 teaspoon vanilla-flavored vodka
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1 (1 1/2-pound) beef sirloin steak, cut into 1/4-inch strips
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 cup long grain white rice
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Stir together 1/3 cup reserved pineapple juice, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, olive oil, vanilla vodka, ginger, brown sugar, and white sugar in a mixing bowl until blended. Adjust the sugar to taste.
Place the steak strips in a large, resealable plastic bag. Pour in the pineapple juice mixture and seal the bag. Turn the bag gently to evenly coat steak with the marinade. Refrigerate 3 to 4 hours.
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 20 minutes.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Remove steak strips from marinade and place in the skillet. Cook and stir the steak strips until browned and no longer pink, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from the heat, cover and keep warm.
Place the pineapple chunks in a separate skillet. Cook over medium heat until slightly soft and heated through, about 4 minutes. To serve, divide the rice between two bowls, top with steak strips and pineapple chunks, and toss briefly.

Description: 
I was sitting around one day and had a craving for warm pineapple and steak. A recipe was born! This recipe is really easy to double up on, but watch the sugar if you do.
