Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup white sugar
4 eggs
1 1/4 cups vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups frozen strawberries, thawed and drained
1 1/2 cups chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.
In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, cinnamon, baking powder and white sugar. In a separate bowl, beat together eggs and oil. Stir egg mixture into dry ingredients until just moistened. Fold in strawberries and walnuts. Spoon batter into prepared loaf pans.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Let cool 10 minutes in pans and then move to a wire rack to cool completely.
