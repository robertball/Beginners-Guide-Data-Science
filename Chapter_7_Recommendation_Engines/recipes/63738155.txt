Ingredients:
1 1/2 Cups long grain rice
3 cups reduced sodium chicken broth
4 cups diced Zucchini
1 red bell pepper chopped
1 green bell pepper chopped
1 large onion diced
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups milk
3 tablespoons of flour
2 1/2 cups shredded pepper jack cheese, divided
1 cup corn kernels
1 lb. ground turkey
4 ounces cream cheese
1/4 cup chopped pickled jalapenos optional

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees
2. Pour rice into a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.
3. Bring broth to a simmer in a small saucepan. Stir hot broth into the rice along with zucchini (and/or squash), bell peppers, onion and salt. Cover with foil. Bake for 45 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until the rice is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed, 35 to 45 minutes more.
4. Meanwhile, whisk milk and flour in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until bubbling and thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add 2 cups Jack cheese and corn and cook, stirring, until the cheese is melted. Set aside
5. In a large skillet over medium heat add ground turkey. Cook, stirring and breaking the turkey into small pieces with a spoon, until lightly browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
6. When the rice is done, stir in the turkey and cheese sauce. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup Jack cheese on top and dollop cream cheese by the teaspoonful over the casserole. Top with jalapenos(optional).
7.Return the casserole to the oven and bake until the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Let stand for about 10 minutes before serving.

My family loves this dish. When I cook it for my kids I leave off the jalapenos from one side of the casserole.
