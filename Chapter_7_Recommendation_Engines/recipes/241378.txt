Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) package pork spareribs
1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
1 cup ketchup
1/2 cup white vinegar
1/4 cup white sugar
4 teaspoons celery salt
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Sprinkle ribs with garlic salt and place into a roasting pan.
Stir ketchup, vinegar, sugar, celery salt, chili powder, salt, dry mustard, paprika, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour over the ribs.
Cook, basting with the pan drippings every half-hour, until the meat pulls away easily from the bone, about 90 minutes.
