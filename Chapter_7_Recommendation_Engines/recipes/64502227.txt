3/4  cup  brown rice flour
1/2 cup potato flour
1  cup sugar
1  tablespoon baking powder
4  eggs, beaten
1  egg white
1/2 cup  canola oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Spray cookie sheet with vegetable spray or use parchment paper.
In a large bowl, combine flours, vanilla, lavender, sugar and baking powder.  In a small bowl, combine oil and eggs and egg white.  Whisk together with a fork.  Make a well in the flour mixture and pour egg/oil mixture into it.  Mix until well blended.  Divide dough in half and form into 2 logs.  Transfer the logs to the cookie sheet.
Bake 30 minutes at 325 degrees.  Remove from oven and reduce temperature to 300 degrees.  Slice logs into 1/2 to 3/4  inch cookies.  They tend to be crumbly.  Lay on side and bake at 300 degrees for 10 minutes.  Turn cookies over and cook another 10 minutes.  Let cool.  To keep, seal tightly .
