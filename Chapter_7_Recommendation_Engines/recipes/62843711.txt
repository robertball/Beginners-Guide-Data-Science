Ingredients:
1 lb. of elbow macaroni
Kosher salt
1 pint heavy cream
1 pint whole (or 2%) milk
6 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons flour
8 oz. smoked gouda, shredded
8 oz. white cheddar, shredded
1 cup sharp cheddar, shredded, divided
1 1/2 teaspoons adobo sauce
2 tablespoons of diced chipotle chilies
4 roma tomatoes, diced
salt and pepper for seasoning

Directions:
In a small saucepan, add milk and cream and simmer to keep warm, but do not let it get too hot that it starts to boil.
Heat water for pasta and season well with kosher salt. Once the water is boiling, cook pasta al-dente according to package instructions.
In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Add flour and whisk for 2 minutes.
Add heated milk and cream to butter/flour mixture. Whisk constantly at medium-low heat for 5 minutes or until thickened.
Add the gouda, white cheddar, 3/4 cup of sharp cheddar, adobo sauce and chilies. Stir until cheese is melted and then remove from heat.
Season with salt and pepper to your liking.
Grease a 3-qt. baking dish. Pour cooked pasta and then cheese mixture on top. Add chopped tomatoes and stir until all is incorporated. Top with remaining sharp cheddar cheese.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a step up from your standard mac and cheese. Both kids and adults like it and it's super simple to adjust the spicyness to however you like it. You should be able to find canned chipotle chilies in adobo sauce at your local supermarket in the latin foods aisle.
