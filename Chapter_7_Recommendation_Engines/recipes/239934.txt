Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups dried great Northern beans, rinsed
2 large smoked neck bones
2 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon soul seasoning
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon white vinegar, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch white sugar, or to taste (optional)
1 dash hot sauce, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Place beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain and rinse.
Place neck bones in a slow cooker and pour chicken broth over the top; stir in soul seasoning.
Cook on High until meat is falling off the bones, about 1 hour. Transfer bones and meat to a plate and shred meat from bones; discard bones.
Stir beans, onion, vinegar, sugar, and hot sauce into slow cooker; spread shredded meat over beans.
Cook on High for 2 to 4 hours (or cook on Low for 4 to 6 hours).
