Ingredients:
Burgers:
1 1/4 pounds skinned salmon fillet
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
2 teaspoons soy sauce
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
Mayonnaise:
4 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger
1 teaspoon soy sauce
4 hamburger buns
4 thin slices red onion
4 slices ripe tomato

Directions:
Finely chop salmon fillet, discarding any bones. Place salmon in a bowl with mustard, grated ginger, soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Stir together until thoroughly combined. Form into four 3-inch patties.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add patties to the hot oil, and cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.
While patties are cooking, whisk mayonnaise, mustard, ginger, and soy in a small bowl. Let mayonnaise mixture sit until flavors meld, 1 to 2 minutes.
Serve cooked patties on hamburger buns with mayonnaise mixture, onions, and tomatoes.
