Ingredients:
3 teaspoons yeast
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 tablespoons gluten flour
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons honey
1 1/4 cups water

Directions:
1 Place all the above ingredients into bread machine, and select'dough' cycle.
2 Stop the bread machine 40 minutes after the mixing starts (1 hour and 10 minutes from beginning of dough cycle).
3 Tip bagel dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead by hand for about 1 minute.
4 Cut dough into 8 pieces.
5 Roll and'gently massage' each piece into a snake.
6 Dampen and overlap the ends pressing firmly to form a ring.
7 Place each ring on an individual piece of baking paper already lightly sprayed with oil.
8 Cover all rings with a sheet of baking paper and allow to rest.
9 Meanwhile, bring a large pan of water to the boil.
10 Carefully lowering each bagel one by one (about 4 at a time) into the pan of boiling water, slide the paper from each bagel ring away.
11 Gently turn bagels allowing about 40 seconds on each side.
12 Lift each bagel out and drain on absorbent paper towels.
13 Place drained bagels on baking baking tray already lined with baking paper.
14 Brush each bagel with lightly beaten egg mixed with 1 tablespoon water and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and sprinkle with lots of poppy seeds or toasted sesame seeds.
15 Bake in hot oven (220'C, Gas mark 7) for about 15 minutes- or until a nice deep golden brown colour.
16 Remove bagels from oven and place on wire rack.
