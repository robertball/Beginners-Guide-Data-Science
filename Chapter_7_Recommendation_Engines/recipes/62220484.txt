Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup margarine, softened
2 pkg. 8 oz. cream cheese, softened (not low-fat or fat-free)
2 cups powdered sugar
4 1/2 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Cream the butter, margarine, cream cheese and powdered sugar on high until light and fluffy. [do not skimp on creaming time]
Reduce speed to medium low and gradually beat in the flour and baking soda.
Divide the dough into four pieces, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.  (Dough can be frozen for 2 weeks.)
When ready to roll out, preheat oven to 325 degrees.
On a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin, rollout the dough.
Cut into desired shapes.
Arrange on cookie sheet, 1 inch apart.
Bake 10 minutes or until edges are lightly browned.
Cool on rack and ice if desired.
Yield depends on the size of the cookie cutter used.
