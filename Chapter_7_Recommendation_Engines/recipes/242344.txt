Ingredients:
4 cups water
1 (16 ounce) package yellow rice
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided (optional)
1 pound boneless chicken, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
1 (1 ounce) package chicken taco seasoning mix
1 (16 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 ½ cups shredded Mexican cheese blend
1 (4 ounce) can sliced olives
1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
12  corn tortillas
1 tablespoon bacon grease

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add rice and 1/4 cup olive oil. Bring liquid back to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover saucepan, and simmer until rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken and taco seasoning mix until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix rice, black beans, Mexican cheese blend, olives, and jalapeno pepper into chicken; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Heat a separate skillet over medium-high heat; warm tortillas in skillet until pliable, 1 to 2 minutes per tortilla.
Fill each tortilla with about 1/2 cup chicken-rice mixture, folding tortilla over filling.
Heat bacon grease in a skillet over medium heat; fry the filled tortillas until crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Description: 
Quick and full of flavor, you can adjust heat by removing the seeds from jalapeno. Garnish tacos with chipotle ranch, salsa verde, and avocado. I make the chipotle ranch with fat free sour cream to save a bit of calories.
