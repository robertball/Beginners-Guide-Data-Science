Ingredients:
1 lb fresh green beans, cut into bite size pieces
1 lb fresh asparagus, cut into bite size pieces
Extra-virgin olive oil
Kosher Salt
1/2 red onion, chopped
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped finely
2 cups cherry tomatoes, sliced in half
More Kosher salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Prepare green beans by washing and snapping of ends. Cut in bite size pieces.
In a small bowl toss the green bean pieces with olive oil and kosher salt.
Put in a roasting pan (sprayed with cooking spray) and roast until tender, about 22 minutes.
*The asparagus will take less time so add them about 10 minutes into the roasting time of the green beans.*
Prepare the asparagus by washing and snapping off the woody ends.
Cut in bite size pieces.
In a small bowl toss the asparagus pieces with olive oil and kosher salt.
Place in the same roasting pan as the green beans after 10 minutes and roast until tender.
Chop the onions, tomatoes, and parsley. Put all vegetables in a large bowl and add pepper and more olive oil to taste.

Description: 
Very tasty and healthy salad of roasted asparagus and green beans. 
I got the inspiration when I was indecisive about choosing between the two vegetables for a side dish. Roasting the vegetables brings out their great flavor and the addition of cherry tomatoes, onion and fresh parsley give it a lovely color.
