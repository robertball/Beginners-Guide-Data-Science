Ingredients:
6 pork chops
Thyme, salt free herb seasonings
salt and pepper to taste
garlic powder to taste
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 large onion, sliced
2-3 cloves garlic sliced thin
2 cups chicken broth heated
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream-use half at first
1/4 cup red wine, if available

Directions:
Season pork chops with salt, pepper, thyme, herb seasonings and garlic powder, and then dredge in 1/2 cup flour.  In a skillet over medium heat, lightly brown chops in a small  amount of oil.
Place chops in oven baker/casserole, and top with sauteed onion slices and garlic.  Heat chicken broth and pour over chops.  Cover, and cook at 300 for 3-4 ours.
Separately, saute sliced mushrooms and reserve for sauce.
After the chops have cooked, transfer chops to separate platter and keep in the oven to keep warm at 200 degrees F. Be careful, the chops are so tender they will fall apart. In a small bowl, blend 2 tablespoons flour with the sour cream; mix into meat juices in pot. Add mushrooms and 1/4 cup red wine if available. Slowly simmer sauce until sauce is slightly thickened.  Serve sauce over pork chops.

Description: 
These are very tender and the sauce goes well with noodles or rice. Budget meal that goes a long way. I don't use a slow cooker, so I use a heavy cast iron casserole pot.  Great recipe to make on a rainy weekend.Modified from: Sour Cream Pork Chops
