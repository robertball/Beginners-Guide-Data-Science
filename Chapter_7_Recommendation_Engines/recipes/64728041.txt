Ingredients:
1 5-7 lb bone-in ham smoked
4 cups apple juice
1 cup coca-cola optional
2 cloves garlic minced
1 cup brown sugar
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cayenne
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp onion powder

Directions:
In the pressure cooker, mix all wet and dry ingredients.
Add whole ham to the pot. Flat side down.
Close and lock lid. Cook on HI Pressure for 60 minutes for larger hams and 45 minutes for smaller with a natural release.
If ham is not "fall apart tender", continue cooking in 15-minute increments with a natural release.
Take ham out of the pot to remove from bone and then return meat to the juices to continue marinading and keep warm. Serve when convenient.
