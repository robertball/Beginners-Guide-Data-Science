Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup diced onion
1 tablespoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 cup diced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 cup sour cream
2 (14.5 ounce) cans French-style green beans, drained
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup crushed buttery round crackers
1/4 cup melted butter

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the onions, parsley, and mushrooms in the melted butter until the onions are translucent and the mushrooms are giving off their juices, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the flour, salt, pepper, and lemon juice; cook until the flour is slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir the sour cream into the mixture. Mix the green beans into the mixture. Pour the green bean mixture into a 9-inch square baking dish. Sprinkle the Cheddar cheese over the mixture. Stir the crackers and melted butter together in a small bowl until evenly mixed; spread evenly over the Cheddar cheese layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and brown, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe has been in my family for as long as I can remember. We only got to have it at holidays. Now, I use it for a special go-to side dish all year long. It's made from scratch but so easy there's no reason not to.
