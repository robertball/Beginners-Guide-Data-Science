Ingredients:
1 tablespoon instant yeast
2 teaspoons salt
1 and 1/2 cups rye flour
1 and 1/2 - 2 cups bread flour (withhold 1/2 cup)
1 cup high maize flour
4 tablespoons vital wheat gluten
2 cups milk
3 tablespoons honey or molasses
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons liquid lecithin
1 tablespoonspoon caraway seeds (or to taste)

Directions:
Put all ingredients in your bread machine as directed by manufacturer.
As dough comes together add 1 tablespoon of reserved flour at a time until dough comes away from the sides of the pan and forms a ball.  You may not need all of the flour.
Once the cycle is complete, remove dough to a lightly oiled surface.  Knead 2 minutes.
Divide dough into 2 equal portions, shape into loaves.
Place in 2 greased 9 x 5 loaf pans and cover.
Let rise until dough reaches the top of the pan.
Bake 375 degrees 25-30 minutes or until an insta-read thermometer reaches 190-200 degrees.
Rub crust with butter to soften.
Let cool in pans 10 minutes then remove to a wire rack to completely cool.
***If you want a shiny crust then before baking brush the dough with an egg wash made of 1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water and skip the butter step at the end***
