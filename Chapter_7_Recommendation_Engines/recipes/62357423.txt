Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) pork butt roast
salt and pepper to taste
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
1/4 cup brewed coffee

Directions:
Cut roast in half. Rub each half with salt and pepper, and place in the slow cooker. Pour broth and coffee over the meat.
Turn the slow cooker to Low, and cover. Cook  for 6 to 8 hours, or until the roast is fork tender.
Carefully remove the roast to a cutting board. Pull the meat off the bone with a fork. You may also chop it with a cleaver afterwards, if you like it really finely cut.
After you pull the pork empty the liquid (in the pot) & pour your favorite BBQ sauce, (to cover the bottom), add the meat & mix with sauce.  Add more sauce as needed.  Turn the pot on low for 2 to 4 hrs.  This allows the flavors to marry.
This freezes well & can be packaged in servings.
