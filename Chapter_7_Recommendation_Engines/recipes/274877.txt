Description: 
I'm fortunate to live in Oklahoma where we have a lovely Vietnamese community. This is my Americanized version of coconut-caramel shrimp. It's made in an Instant Pot®, and while it can be made on the stovetop you'll use more pots and pans. I love serving this with jasmine rice cooked in coconut milk.
