Grilled Raspberry Glazed Cheese Stuffed Chicken Breasts Recipe

https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1/2 cup bleu cheese, crumbled
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 tsp. dried rosemary
2 Tbsp. olive oil
4 medium length wood skewers
Glaze:
1/2 cup raspberry jam
1 Tbsp. prepared Dijon mustard
dash white pepper

Directions:
Prepare skewers by soaking in water for 30 minutes.
Cut a 3" slit in the thick side of each chicken breast to form a pocket (be careful not to go all the way through or pierce through the skin).  Combine cheese, parsley, rosemary and olive oil and mix gently.  Spoon one quarter of filling into each pocket. Use the soaked skewers to thread and close the slit in the chicken pocket.
Heat grill on high.
In a small bowl mix the raspberry jam and dijon mustard until thoroughly combined. Season with white pepper.
Place chicken breasts on lightly oiled grilling surface and cook on high heat.  Using a pastry brush, glaze each side of the breast with the raspberry/dijon mix frequently throughout cooking.  Chicken is done when it is no longer pink and juices run clear.  Discard any remaining glaze.  Remove skewers from chicken and serve.
