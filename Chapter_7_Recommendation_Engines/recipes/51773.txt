Ingredients:
5 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound ground beef
1 teaspoon ground paprika
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 (6.5 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 tablespoon chopped summer savory (chubritsa)
1 egg, lightly beaten
2/3 cup yogurt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook ground beef until evenly brown. Season with paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper. Stir in potatoes, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, and summer savory. Add enough water to just barely cover. Reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes.
Pour meat mixture into 9x13 inch baking dish, and spread evenly. In a small bowl, mix together the egg and yogurt; pour, and spread evenly over meat mixture.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until top is golden brown.

Description: 
I learned this from my Bulgarian mother in law though it's probably Turkish in origin.  The recipe calls for 'chubritsa', a Bulgarian herb that can be difficult to find in the states, so basil can be substituted in its place.
