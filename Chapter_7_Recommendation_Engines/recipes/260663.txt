Ingredients:
4 Granny Smith apples, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1/4 lemon, juiced
1/3 cup raisins (optional)
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons arrowroot powder
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 cup maple syrup
Topping:
3/4 cup rolled oats
1/4 cup coconut flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine Granny Smith apples and lemon juice in a large bowl. Add raisins, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, arrowroot powder, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves; toss to make sure all apple slices are coated.
Transfer apple mixture to a baking pan. Drizzle 1/4 cup maple syrup on top. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until apple slices are tender, about 35 minutes.
Place oats in a food processor. Pulse briefly until crumbly. Pour into a bowl. Sift in coconut flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and salt.
Mix olive oil, 1 tablespoon maple syrup, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Fold into the oat mixture with a fork to make a crumbly topping.
Toss baked apples. Flatten evenly with the back of a spatula or wooden spoon. Sprinkle topping evenly over the apples. Bake uncovered until top feels crispy, 25 to 30 minutes.
