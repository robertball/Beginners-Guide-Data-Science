Deluxe Corned Beef Hash Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
2 pounds cooked corned beef brisket (cook ahead or leftover from St. Patrick's Day)
5 large yukon gold pototoes - peeled and cut into small (1/4 inch) cubes.
1 large yellow onion - peeled and finely diced
1 large carrot, coarsely shredded
2 tablespoons fresh parsley - chopped
1/4 tsp of dried leaf thyme
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil
pepper to taste (1/2 tsp. approx.)
salt (optional - the corned beef has enough!)

Directions:
Cube cold, cooked corned beef, including the fat, and set aside. The fat is needed for flavor. You can use deli corned beef, but it is not as flavorful.
In large sautee pan, heat oil and butter, medium heat.
Add onions and cook until tender (beginning to caramelize.) Add carrots and potatoes and cook until tender.
Add corned beef cubes, parsley, thyme and pepper.
Fry until "crispy" - stirring and turning as frequently as needed.
The fat from the corned beef should prevent having to add additional oil.
Serve with fried eggs and brown soda bread (farls).

Description: 
I purposely cook a whole corned beef just to make hash.  There's nothing like the taste of fresh versus canned hash.  This is also good for leftover St. Paddy's day corned beef.  I throw the carrot in for color, claiming it's the Leprechaun's gold.
