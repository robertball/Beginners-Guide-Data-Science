Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sesame seeds
1/2 cup black sesame seeds
2 tsp course sea salt

Directions:
1.  Heat a heavy bottom pan on medium. Do not use a non-stick pan. Cast iron or heavy bottomed stainless steel would be best.
2. Add the salt. Heat throughout, about 1 minute. Pour the salt into a mortar. Add the sesame seeds to the pan. With a wooden spoon or spatula, stir constantly. Toast the seeds over medium heat until fragrant and the seeds start to crack. Do not over cook or burn, this will make them bitter and ruin the nutritional value. To test if they are ready, use the back of a stainless steel spoon. If the seeds stick, they are still wet, not ready. If they no longer stick, they are dry, which means they are ready.
3. Pour the toasted seeds into the mortar. Allow to cool slightly. Then, grind with a pestle by placing the mortar at hip level, preferably while seated. This will save your shoulders from hurting and ensure an even stir. Use the pestle to grind until the seeds have opened and the salt pulverizes. The finished product should resemble rough sand.
4. Use immediately or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to one month.
