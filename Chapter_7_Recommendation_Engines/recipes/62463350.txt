Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
1 cup natural peanut butter
2 eggs
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unbleached white whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups old fashioned oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together butter, brown sugar, white sugar, and peanut butter until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time until well blended, add vanilla and mix. Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in the oats until just combined. Drop by onto ungreased cookie sheets - I used an 1/8 cup measuering scoop.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until just light brown. Don't over-bake. Cool and store in an airtight container.

Description: 
To make the cookies a little healthier, I used half white flour and half white whole wheat unbleached flour (King Arthur brand) and boosted the oats and used old-fashioned. I also used real butter - no margarine or shortening here - and I used (sweetened) natural peanut butter :) I also added a little vanilla :)Modified from: Oatmeal Peanut Butter Cookies
