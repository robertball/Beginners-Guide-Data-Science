Ingredients:
4 cups reduced-sodium soy sauce
3 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon black food coloring paste
2 pinches onion powder, or to taste
2 pinches garlic powder, or to taste
1 pinch Cajun seasoning (optional)
1 (4 pound) package chicken wings

Directions:
Mix soy sauce, sugar, food coloring, onion powder, garlic powder, and Cajun seasoning together in a bowl until paste dissolves completely. Carefully open the bag of chicken wings, keeping the seal intact. Pour in the soy sauce mixture, seal bag, and lay it flat in the refrigerator. Marinate, turning occasionally to coat and dye every piece, at least 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Pour wings and marinade into a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn wings and bake until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Remove wings from the sauce and place in a bowl or platter labeled 'Bat Wings.'
