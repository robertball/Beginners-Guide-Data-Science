For Muffins:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/3 cup melted butter
1 egg
1/3 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cup fresh blueberries
For Streusel:
1/4 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon butter, cubed
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with muffin liners.
Combine 1 1/2 cups flour, 3/4 cup sugar, salt and baking powder. Place melted butter into a 1 cup measuring cup; add the egg and enough milk to fill the cup. Add teaspoon vanilla extract. Mix this with flour mixture. Fold in blueberries. Fill muffin cups right to the top, and sprinkle with crumb topping mixture.
To Make Crumb Topping: Mix together 1/4 cup brown sugar,  3 tablespoons flour, 1 tablespoon of butter,  and 3/4 teaspoons cinnamon. Mix with fork, and sprinkle over muffins before baking.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until done.
