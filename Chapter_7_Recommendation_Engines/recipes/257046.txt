Ingredients:
1 tablespoon tahini
1 1/2 cups boiling water
2 teaspoons whole anise seeds
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground turmeric
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/4 teaspoons anise seed powder
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
2 tablespoons pine nuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with tahini.
Combine boiling water and anise seeds in a glass measuring cup; let steep, about 5 minutes. Strain into a bowl; stir in sugar until dissolved. Discard anise seeds.
Mix flour, turmeric, baking powder, and anise seed powder together in a bowl. Make a well in the center; mix in oil and butter. Stir in sweetened anise water until batter is the consistency of thick yogurt.
Pour batter into the prepared baking pan. Score top into diamond shapes with the tip of a knife; place 1 pine nut in the center of each diamond.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This Lebanese cake flavored with anise seeds was one of my favorite treats growing up. It's a beautiful bright yellow thanks to turmeric powder. My grandmother shared her recipe with me so I can finally make it for myself!
