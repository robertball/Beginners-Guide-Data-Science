Ingredients:
2  tbsp olive oil, divided
1 pkg shrimp (any kind)
1/4 salt and pepper
1 onion (I only use about 3/4 onion)
1.5 garlic cloves
4 cups spinach (i use a little more)
1/2 red wine vinegar (I use a little less - I pour as I go until it tastes exactly the way I want it to)
1 container alfredo sauce (I have to use 2 if I am feeding 4 + people)
linguine

Directions:
Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Season shrimp with salt and pepper and saute on both sides until just barely cooked through. Transfer to a plate and return pan to the heat.
Heat remaining oil, add onion, garlic and spinach, and cook, stirring, until spinach is wilted. Add the cinegar and simmer. Stir in alfredo sauce and turn down heat. Add shrimp to mixture
I taste the pasta and see if I want a little more garlic, pepper, onion, vinegar etc. I like my food a little stronger than the recipe - so I tweak it until it fits.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta. Drain.
