1 1/2 cups grated daikon radish
2 teaspoons salt
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 red onion, chopped
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as SrirachaÂ®)
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Place the daikon in a large bowl and sprinkle with the salt. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Drain daikon. Stir in the garlic, onion, egg, bread crumbs, pepper, paprika, and chili garlic sauce. Mix well. Form into 8, small round patties.
Pour oil into a large skillet. Heat over medium heat. Fry patties in the hot oil until firm and nicely brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.

Description: 
These crispy savory cakes are a unique and tasty way to enjoy daikon radish. Like an Asian twist on a modified latke recipe. If you like spiciness and the bitter taste of radish, you'll love this recipe. If not, give it a try anyway, dipped in ketchup, sour cream, miso mayo, jam, or whatever floats your boat.
