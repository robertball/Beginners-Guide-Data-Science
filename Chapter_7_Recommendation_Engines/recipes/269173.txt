Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup tzatziki sauce
4 pita bread rounds
1 tomato, sliced
1/4 red onion, cut into strips
2 leaves lettuce, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a rimmed baking sheet.
Pat dry chickpeas with a paper towel, removing any skins that may come off. Toss chickpeas gently with olive oil, paprika, black pepper, cayenne, and salt. Spread onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned but not hard, about 20 minutes.
Spread some tzatziki onto one side of each pita. Sprinkle in the chickpeas and add tomato slices, red onion, and lettuce. Fold each gyro in half.
