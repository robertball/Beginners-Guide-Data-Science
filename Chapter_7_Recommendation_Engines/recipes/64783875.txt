Ingredients:
7 ounces thick spaghetti or bucatini
1 ripe avocado
2 tsp fresh lemon juice
2 egg yolks
3 ounces pancetta, cubed
1/4 cup pecorino romano, grated
1 tbsp fresh cracked pepper, divided
2 tbsp pecorino romano, grated

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until al dente.
While the pasta cooks, heat a non stick pan over medium heat. Add the cubed pancetta. Cook on medium low until tender and the fat has rendered. Turn off the heat.
Reserve one ladle of pasta water, set aside.
In a separate bowl, add the pulp of the avocado, use a hand blender to pur√©e. Add the lemons juice, egg yolks, 1/4 cup pecorino romano, and 2 tsp course ground pepper. Stir well until creamy.
Use spaghetti tongs to add the pasta directly from the water to the pan with the pancetta. This will allow a bit of pasta water to help thin the sauce. Toss the pasta in the skillet to coat the pasta with the pancetta. Add the avocado sauce to the pasta, stirring constantly. Add the reserve pasta liquid if necessary.
Divide into two plates. Top with the remaining cheese and course ground black pepper. Serve immediately.
