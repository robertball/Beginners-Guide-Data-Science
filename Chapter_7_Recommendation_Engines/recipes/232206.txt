Ingredients:
Dressing:
1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon peeled and grated fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon white sugar, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground coriander
Salad:
2 cups water
1 cup bulgur
1 teaspoon salt
1 (10 ounce) package frozen lima beans
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 cup seeded and chopped tomato
1 cup peeled, seeded, and chopped cucumber
1/4 cup thinly sliced green onion
1/3 cup finely chopped fresh mint

Directions:
Whisk lemon juice, olive oil, ginger, garlic, sugar, and coriander together in a bowl.
Combine water, bulgur, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cover saucepan, reduce heat, and simmer until water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and fluff with a fork.
Bring a separate saucepan of water to a boil; add lima beans and garlic salt. Cook until lima beans are tender, 5 to 7 minutes; drain.
Mix bulgur, lima beans, tomato, cucumber, green onion, and mint together in a large bowl; drizzle dressing over bulgur mixture. Toss to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate to blend flavors, 2 hours to overnight.

Description: 
Lemon, ginger, and garlic infuse this salad with so much flavor, you don't miss the extra oil or cheese. Lima beans add some extra color, not to mention fiber and protein! I have substituted quinoa for the bulgur to great success (prepare according to package directions). Make sure to allow enough time to make ahead and let all the flavors marry in the fridge before serving.
