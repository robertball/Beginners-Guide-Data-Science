Ingredients:
Family size package of boneless skinless chicken thighs. (About 12 thighs)
For sauce:
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tsp. sesame oil
1/2 tsp. Chinese Five Spice
1 clove garlic, minced
1 Tbsp. sherry, madeira or marsala
2 Tbsp. Hoisin sauce
1/8 c. honey
1 Tbsp. Sriracha
1/8 tsp. liquid smoke (optional)
1 tbsp. red food coloring (optional)

Directions:
Mix all sauce ingredients thoroughly.
Marinate meat 24-48 hours in a large Ziploc or Rubbermaid container in the refrigerator. Move it around once or twice to make sure it marinates evenly.
Put the chicken in a roasting pan, preferably with a rack, lined with foil.
Roast at 350 degrees for one hour.
I put the marinade into a sauce pan and bring it to a boil, and then simmer it for a few minutes and then let sit until ready to use to baste the chicken a few times while it's roasting. Turn the chicken over once during roasting and baste it to make sure it is evenly coated.

Description: 
This dish is so easy to make, but so delicious! Due to the marinating time, you do need to plan ahead to make this, but the wait is worth it. I serve this with a cool, crisp Hawaiian slaw and there are never leftovers. Whether I roast it or grill it, this recipe never fails.
