Ingredients:
Sauce:
2 cups blueberries, fresh or frozen
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup water
2 teaspoons cornstarch or potato starch
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Pancakes:
6 eggs
1 cup low-fat cottage cheese
1/2 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons cooking oil
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Pancakes: Combine eggs, cottage cheese, flour, oil, baking powder, vanilla and salt in a blender. Cover and blend on high speed for 1 minute. Scrape down the side of the blender container and blend for a few seconds more. Alternately, combine ingredients in a bowl and beat well with an electric mixer.
For each pancake, pour 1/4cup batter into a lightly greased frying pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook until bubbles start to appear, then flip and cook the second side.
Sauce: Combine blueberries, sugar, water, cornstarch and cinnamon in a large saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved; continue cooking for a few minutes until mixture is slightly thickened. Keep sauce warm while preparing pancakes.
To serve, spoon about 2 tbsp blueberry sauce on one half of each pancake. Fold pancakes over blueberry mixture.
