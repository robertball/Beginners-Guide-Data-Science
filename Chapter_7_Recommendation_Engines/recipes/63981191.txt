Ingredients:
•	1 package of breakfast sausage (I use Jimmy Dean’s Regular Sausage)
•	2-3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
•	½ onion, diced
•	1 – 5 oz. can of Diced Chiles
•	Salt
•	Pepper
•	Lawry’s Seasoning Salt
•	Oregano
•	Cilantro
•	Cumin
•	Chili Pepper
•	Minced Garlic
•	12 Eggs
•	2-3 cups of Cheese, shredded
•	12-16 Flour Tortillas (I use the large ones)
•	Taco Sauce or Salsa
•	Tin Foil

Directions:
Put the entire package of sausage in a deep skillet. Break up into small chunks and start to brown. Add potatoes and onion. Stir well breaking up the sausage into tiny chunks as it browns. Add chiles and seasonings. I use a teaspoon or two of each seasoning, but it really just depends on how you like it. Cover and simmer until potatoes are done. Add eggs, mix well. Cover and continue to cook. Stir the burrito mixture well. Taste the mixture and add more seasonings to taste, if needed and stir again.  Add cheese. Turn off heat and allow it to sit for a minute or two. Stir the burrito mixture well to mix everything  together. Tear of 12-16 sheets of tin foil (about 12-15” in length each). Place a tortilla on a sheet of tin foil. Add about a cup of the burrito mixture in the center of the tortilla. I normally elongate the mixture so that it is about an inch from the ends of the tortilla. (It shouldn’t be just a glob in the center.) Pour on a little taco sauce or salsa. Fold in the ends of the tortilla and roll it up. Then using the tin foil, repeat that step. You should end up with a neat little pouch. Continue this process until all the meat mixture is used up.  Enjoy!

Description: 
Filling, warm, and tasty breakfast option. Makes quite a few burritos. They keep quite well in the fridge or the freezer when wrapped in tin foil. On days when you don't have time to make a full breakfast just reheat one and take it with you! Sure beats fast food!
