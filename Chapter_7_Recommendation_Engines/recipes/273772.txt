Ingredients:
4 tablespoons canola oil
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/8 teaspoon seasoned salt
4 medium potatoes, scrubbed and sliced length-wise

Directions:
Pour canola oil evenly into the bottom of a room-temperature, 10-inch cast iron skillet. Sprinkle rosemary and seasoned salt evenly over the canola oil. Place potatoes, cut-side down, in 1 layer in the bottom of the skillet. Press down on potatoes so cut-side is coated in canola oil.
Place the cold skillet into a cold oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, about 45 minutes.
