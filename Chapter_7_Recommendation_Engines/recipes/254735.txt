Ingredients:
1 pint heavy whipping cream, chilled
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk, chilled
6 fluid ounces orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier®), chilled

Directions:
Beat cream in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the cream will form soft mounds. Fold condensed milk and orange liqueur into beaten cream.
Place in an ice cream maker and follow manufacturer's instructions for ice cream, 2 to 4 hours.

Description: 
An incredibly easy way to round off a dinner party--but only if nobody has to drive home! I like to serve two small scoops in tiny dishes with homemade vanilla wafers or amaretti. You can vary this any way you like--try Cointreau® or Drambuie® (my favorite--very grown up!) liqueur, or add a few drops of real vanilla extract or seeds.
