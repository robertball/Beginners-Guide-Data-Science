Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dried navy beans
4 cups water, or more as needed
1/2 cup molasses
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon dry mustard
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 pound salt pork, thinly sliced
1 onion, sliced

Directions:
Place the navy beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain and transfer beans to a pot; add enough water to cover beans.
Bring water to a boil, reduce heat, cover pot, and simmer until beans are slightly tender, about 1 hour.
Mix 4 cups water, molasses, brown sugar, salt, mustard, and pepper together in a bowl until smooth.
Mix beans, salt pork, and onion together in a slow cooker. Add molasses mixture and more water to cover beans if needed; stir well.
Cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours.

Description: 
This recipe was handed down from my dad. I adjusted it to go into the slow cooker. It's a lot easier. Just set it and forget it.
