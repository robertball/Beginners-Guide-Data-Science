Ingredients:
3  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, halved lengthwise
salt and ground black pepper to taste
¼ cup olive oil, divided
6  mushrooms, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
½ (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed
2 tablespoons chopped green onions
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
12  toothpicks

Directions:
Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface; firmly pound with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/4-inch thickness. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine mushroom-garlic mixture, cream cheese, spinach, green onions, and red pepper flakes in a bowl.
Spoon 1 tablespoon cream cheese mixture into the middle of each chicken breast. Roll chicken breasts around mixture and secure with toothpicks.
Heat remaining 3 tablespoons in an ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Arrange chicken rolls in the skillet in a single layer; cook until golden, about 5 minutes per side.
Transfer skillet to the preheated oven; bake until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes more.
