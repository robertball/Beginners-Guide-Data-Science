Ingredients:
3 cups all- purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon all spice
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
3 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 3/4 cup granulated sugar
4 cups shredded zucchini (from about 2 medium sized zucchini)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Grease two loaf pans with cooking spray.
Shred zucchini and set aside. Using a hand grater is recommended, as this will help the zucchini retain it's moisture, which makes the bread very moist.
In a large bowl, combine flour, cinnamon, all spice, baking soda, baking powder and salt until well blended.
In another large bowl, beat eggs thoroughly with fork. Add the oils, sugar, vanilla, and zucchini. Mix until well combined.
Add the dry ingredients in two batches to the zucchini mixture; mix until just combined.
Divide the batter evenly into the loaf pans.

Description: 
This recipe  does not lack zucchini flavor like most zucchini breads. This version has almost half of the sugar of regular zucchini bread recipes, but it is equally delicious-and more nutritious!  With four cups of zucchini, the bread is moist and dense.  The extra virgin olive oil used is not only a great health bonus, but adds richness to the bread. This bread is a family favorite!
