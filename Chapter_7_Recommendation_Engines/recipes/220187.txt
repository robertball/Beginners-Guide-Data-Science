Ingredients:
15 ounces vanilla almond bark
1 (8.5 ounce) bag spicy cheese-flavored cornmeal snack (such as CheetosÂ® Flamin' Hot)

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with wax or parchment paper.
Melt the almond bark in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.
Mix the cheese-flavored snacks into the melted almond bark until fully incorporated.
Spread the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet in an even layer. Allow to cool completely.
Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares.
