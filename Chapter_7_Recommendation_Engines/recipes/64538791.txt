Italian Beef sandwiches Recipe

Ingredients:
3 lb beef chuck roast, boneless
6 beef bouillon, cubes
6 c very hot water
6 Tbsp sugar (you can also substitute stevia drops if you want to avoid the sugar, I have made it both ways)
2 tsp salt
2 tsp black pepper
2 tsp dried oregano
2 tsp italian seasoning or dried basil
Dash garlic salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Heat a 12 inch skillet over high heat. Brown beef roast on all sides.
In a large dutch oven or roaster (with a lid) combine water and bouillon cubes, making sure to dissolve bouillon. Add spices and sugar, mixing to combine.
Add roast to dutch oven, cover with foil and then the lid. Roast in oven 3-4 hours, until beef is tender and can be shredded apart with a fork. Place shredded meat back in the juice for a couple minutes. Serve on hard rolls with provolone cheese (putting cheese on bottom of the bun helps keep it from soaking in a bit). Some also like to eat with horseradish.
You can also make this in a crockpot.  Instead of combining all the ingredients in a roaster, put in a crock pot on low for 7-8 hours.

Description: 
This is one of my family's favorites! You can also make this recipe in a crock pot, cooking on low for 6-8 hours. Be sure to brown the beef prior to placing in the crock pot. Also can double for a large crowd.
