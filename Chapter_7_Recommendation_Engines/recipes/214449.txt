Bonquet Recipe

Ingredients:
Crust:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup chilled margarine, cut into cubes
1/2 cup cold water
Filling:
1/2 pound almond paste
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 egg, separated
2 teaspoons white sugar, or more to taste

Directions:
Place flour in a large bowl. Cut in margarine with 2 forks or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork, until flour mixture is moistened and sticks together when squeezed. Split dough into 3 portions, sealing each in plastic wrap.
Shred almond paste into a bowl using a grater. Add 1/2 cup sugar, egg, and egg yolk; mix well. Cover almond filling with plastic wrap. Refrigerate dough and almond filling, 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Roll each portion of dough onto a floured work surface into a 4x12-inch crust. Lay crusts on the prepared sheet. Spread a strip of almond filling onto the center of each crust. Fold each side toward the center and pinch ends to seal in the filling. Flip bonquets over, folded side-down.
Poke holes down the middle of each bonquet, 2 inches apart. Beat egg white in a small bowl; brush over bonquets. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons sugar on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); continue baking until golden brown, about 10 minutes more.
