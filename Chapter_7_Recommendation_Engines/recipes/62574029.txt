Ingredients:
1 pound butter
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup chopped walnuts
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
3 Tbs water
3 Tbs dark corn syrup

Directions:
In a heavy saucepan, combine butter, white sugar, and brown sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until mixture boils. Boil to brittle stage, 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) without stirring. Remove from heat.
Pour nuts and chocolate chips into a 9x13 inch dish. Pour hot mixture over the nuts and chocolate. Let the mixture cool and break it into pieces before serving.

Description: 
A simple concordance of butter, sugar, walnuts and chocolate yields a rich, indulgent toffee. For best results use a candy thermometer during the boiling stage, and use a lightly oiled wooden spoon if you want to spread out the mixture to cool.Modified from: Melt In Your Mouth Toffee
