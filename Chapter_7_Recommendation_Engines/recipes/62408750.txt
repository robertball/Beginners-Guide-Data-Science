Ingredients:
1 lb. bread flour (for bread machines)
1 lb. all-purpose flour
1 package, 2 1/4 tsp., instant or rapid rise yeast
1 1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 cup sugar
2 cups warm water - 110-120F
1 egg
2 tbs. butter
2 tbs. olive oil + more
1/2 cup bread flour + more for dusting
garlic powder

Directions:
combine 1 lb. bread flour, AP flour, yeast, salt, and sugar in the work bowl of a stand mixer. mix on low with dough hook for a couple of seconds. then add water and mix at low speed for 1 min, then turn speed up to 3 and work dough for 3 min. this will look dry don't worry about it just follow my instructions for the first time then make your own changes.
Turn speed back to low and add egg mix for 30 seconds, then turn speed up to 3 and mix for 4 min.
again turn speed to low but this time add butter and 2 tbs. olive oil. mix on low for 30 seconds, then turn to 3 and mix for 5 min. then turn off mixer and cover with a damp paper towel and let sit at room temperature for five minutes.
then add 1/2 cup bread flour and mix at low speed for 30 seconds, then turn up to 3 and mix for 6 min. then cover and let rise for 20 min.
punch dough down and divide into 20 equal pieces - these will weigh about 2.8 ounces a piece.
shape each piece into a 8 inch log and place 2 inches apart on a lightly greased baking sheet. cover and let rise for 45 min. the dough should be 2-3 times it's current size. about 20 min. before dough is finished rising preheat oven to 400F.
bake bread sticks uncovered until golden brown (sorry I do not have an exact time yet) remove from the oven and promptly brush with more olive oil and sprinkle with garlic powder. allow to cool for 5 min. before serving.

Description: 
bread sticks I am working on to recreate olive gardens bread sticks. I am warning you these are not as good as olive garden and suggestions are needed. JUST A WARNING THIS RECIPE MAKES 20 BREAD STICKS YOU CAN TRY AND SIZE IT DOWN IF YOU SO DESIRE. THESE CAN NOT BE MADE WITHOUT A STAND MIXER AND A DOUGH HOOK (I use a kitchen aid mixer and give the numbers used on my machine), THE TRADITIONAL DOUGH METHOD OF MAKING DOUGH DOES NOT GIVE THE RIGHT TEXTURE
