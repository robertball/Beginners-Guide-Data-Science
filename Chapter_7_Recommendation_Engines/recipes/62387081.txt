Description: 
I can't believe this isn't on here yet! A HUGE family favorite for years, this amazingly textured and flavorful stew/chowder/soup never fails to amaze and works for any meal, any occasion. Always even better the next day! We make it without the bacon, with chunky veggies and chicken, and lots of extra cheese. Perfect with sourdough.
