Ingredients:
Filling:
5 guajillo chile peppers, stemmed and seeded
5 limes, juiced
2 cloves garlic
2 pinches ground cumin
3 whole cloves
2 cups water, divided
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 onion, halved and cut into thin slices
1 1/2 (12 ounce) packages textured vegetable protein
Salsa:
4 tomatoes
4 dried chile de arbol peppers, stemmed
1 slice onion
1 clove garlic
salt to taste
1 (32 ounce) package corn tortillas
Garnish:
1 large onion, chopped
1 bunch cilantro, finely chopped

Directions:
Place guajillo peppers in a saucepan, cover with water, and boil until softened, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Combine lime juice, 2 cloves garlic, cumin, and cloves in a small saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes. Pour into a blender, add guajillo peppers, and blend until smooth. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the water if the sauce is too thick.
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and cook onion slices until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in vegetable protein; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Pour in guajillo sauce and remaining water; season with salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low cook, covered, until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Combine tomatoes and chile de arbol peppers in a baking dish.
Roast tomatoes and peppers until charred, 5 to 10 minutes. Cool tomatoes slightly. Peel.
Combine peeled tomatoes, peppers, 1 slice onion, 1 clove garlic, and salt in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour salsa into a small bowl.
Warm corn tortillas in a skillet. Divide vegetable protein mixture amongst tortillas and top with salsa, chopped onion, and cilantro.
