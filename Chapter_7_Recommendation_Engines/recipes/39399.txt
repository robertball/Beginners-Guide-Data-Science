Ingredients:
vegetable oil
12 (6 inch) corn tortillas, cut into 1-inch strips
1 cup (1 small) chopped onion
1 3/4 cups ORTEGA® Thick & Chunky Salsa
1 (10 ounce) can ORTEGA® Enchilada Sauce
1 1/2 cups SARGENTO® Fancy Shredded Monterey Jack Cheese
1/4 cup ORTEGA® Pickled Jalapeno Slices
Sour cream (optional)
Sliced avocado (optional)

Directions:
PREHEAT oven to 350 degrees F.
ADD vegetable oil to 1-inch depth in medium skillet; heat over high heat for 3 to 4 minutes. Place tortilla strips in oil; fry, turning frequently with tongs, until light golden brown. Remove from skillet; place on paper towels to soak.
REMOVE all but 1 tablespoon oil from skillet. Add onion; cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 to 2 minutes or until tender. Stir in salsa and enchilada sauce. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; cook, stirring frequently, for 3 to 4 minutes.
LAYER half of tortilla strips in ungreased 13 x 9-inch baking dish. Top with half of salsa mixture and half of cheese; repeat layers. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until cheese is melted. Top with jalapenos, sour cream and avocado just before serving.
NOTE: Frying step may be eliminated by breaking ORTEGA Taco Shells or ORTEGA Tostada shells into small pieces and using them in place of tortilla strips for a quick and easy alternative.
