1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste (optional)

Description: 
This is an adaptation of a recipe I found that has been changed to make it a little quicker and easier. It tastes just like the sauce served on the fried bratwurst at my favorite local German restaurant. Use hot curry powder if you like it a bit spicier or add some cayenne for a kick.
