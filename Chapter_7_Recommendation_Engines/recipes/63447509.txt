Ingredients:
8 ounces (1 packed cup) fresh Mexican chorizo sausage, casing removed
1 medium red onion, sliced 1/4-inch thick
3 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil
2 tablespoons light-flavored vinegar (rice vinegar is very good here)
2 teaspoons sugar
Salt
An 8-to-9 ounce package (about 8 cups) salad spinach, long stems removed
1/2 small jícama, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch cubes

Directions:
1.   Cook the chorizo and onion.   In a very large skillet, cook the chorizo over medium heat for 4 or 5 minutes until it has rendered a good amount of its fat.  Add the onion and continue cooking until the onion has started to soften but is still crunchy, about 5 minutes.
2.   Create the dressing, finish the salad.   To the skillet (still over medium heat), add the oil, vinegar, sugar and 2 tablespoons water.  Mix well, taste and season with salt, usually about 1/2 teaspoon.  Pour the warm mixture over the spinach, add the jícama, mix well and serve.
