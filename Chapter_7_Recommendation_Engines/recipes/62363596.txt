Ingredients:
1 large onion, cut into desired thickness
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon seasoning salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1-2 teaspoons paprika
1 egg
1 cup beer, or as needed
3/4 cup panko bread crumbs
seasoned salt to taste
1 quart oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
Separate the onion slices into rings, and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together all the dry ingredients.
Dip the onion slices into the flour mixture until they are all coated; set aside. Whisk the egg and beer together in a small bowl; stir into the flour mixture. Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat, then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping. The wire rack may be placed over a sheet of aluminum foil or paper towel for easier clean up. Spread the bread crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish. Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat. Give it a hard tap as you remove it from the crumbs. The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings.
Deep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove to paper towels to drain. Season with seasoning salt, and serve.

Description: 
Torn between two different onion ring recipes and wanting to incorporate a little beer, I came up with my own version. Not wanting bland onion rings, I added a few more seasonings and they are very good.  The beer adds a nice touch!
