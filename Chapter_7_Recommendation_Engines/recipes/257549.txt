Description: 
This is a hearty oatmeal that is baked in the oven so you can get ready in the morning instead of slaving over a stove. Plus it will please even the pickiest of eaters. All three kids (10, 4, and 2) ate in perfect silence.... It was quite nice! I hope it does the same for your family.
