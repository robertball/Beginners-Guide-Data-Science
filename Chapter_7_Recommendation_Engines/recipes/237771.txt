Ingredients:
salt to taste
4 (6 ounce) flat iron steaks
1/4 cup spicy brown mustard (such as Gulden'sÂ®), or as needed
8 black tea bags, cut open, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Rub a generous amount of salt over each steak. Spread a thick layer of mustard on each side of each steak. Sprinkle tea leaves over each steak until mustard is completely covered.
Cook the steaks on the preheated grill until desired degree of doneness is reached, 5 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).

Description: 
Mustard and tea leaves add flavor and keeps steak moist.
 My dad made this when we were young and everyone (including my mother) was saying 'Ewwww, yuck!' Well, after we tasted it we were literally begging for more! The tea and mustard make a delicious, flavorful crust which keeps the inside tender and juicy.
