Ingredients:
2tsp. Butter
1tbls. Cocoa
2/3cup Butter
5 squares semi-sweet baking chocolate (3/4 cup chocolate chips)
2 egg yolks (large)
2 large eggs
1 1/2 cups icing sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Grease six 3/4 cup ramekins with first amount of butter. Coat bottom and side of each ramekin with cocoa, discarding excess cocoa.
Heat second amount of butter and chocolate in small heavy saucepan on lowest heat, stirring often, until almost melted. Do not overheat. Remove from heat. Stir until smooth. Cool slightly.
Beat egg yolks and whole eggs in medium bowl for about 2 minutes until frothy. Beat in icing sugar on low. Add chocolate mixture and flour. Beat well until thick and glossy. Divide batter among prepared ramekins. Place on baking sheet. Bake in 450 F oven for about 12 minutes (8 for muffin tin) until evenly risen and edge appears set, but middle is wobbly. Let stand for 3 to 5 minutes. Run knife around side of cakes to loosen. Cover with individual plates and invert to remove from ramekins. (At this point, cakes may sit inverted without removing ramekins for up to 20 minutes. They will stay warm and the centre will still be "molten.") Makes 6 cakes.
Delicious served with ice cream.
