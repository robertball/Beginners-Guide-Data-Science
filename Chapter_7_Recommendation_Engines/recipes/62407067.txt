Ingredients:
2 pounds ground turkey
1 cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons onion powder
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
24 Kings Hawaiian dinner rolls , split
1/2 cup sliced pickles
yellow mustard

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.
In a large pan, saute onion over medium heat and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Mix together the ground turkey, onion powder, salt and pepper in with the onions; cook and stir over medium-high heat until the turkey is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink.  Remove from heat. Stir the mayonnaise and Cheddar cheese into the ground turkey mixture.
Lay the bottoms of the dinner rolls on the prepared baking sheet. Spread both sides with mustard, add pickles then add the cheese and turkey mixture on the bottom half of each roll. Replace the tops. Cover with another sheet of aluminum foil sprayed with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven until the burgers are heated through and cheese melts, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Cheesy, creamy seasoned ground turkey sliders!  I changed the original by replacing beef with turkey, and the onion soup mix with sauteed onion and onion powder to cut down on the salt.  I also tweaked the preparation by adding mustard and pickle to the bun before placing in the oven.Modified from: Slider-Style Mini Burgers
