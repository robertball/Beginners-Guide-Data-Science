Ingredients:
1/2 cup raisins
1 cup whole wheat flour
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup pumpkin puree
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1/4 cup canola oil
1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place raisins in a bowl and pour in boiling water to cover by 1 inch. Allow to sit until raisins are plump and rehydrated, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain raisins, and reserve 1/3 cup of the soaking water in a separate bowl.
Combine whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cloves, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Combine pumpkin puree, sugar, eggs, reserved soaking water, and oil in another bowl; mix with a spoon or whisk until well combined. Stir pumpkin mixture into flour mixture until just moistened. Fold in walnuts and raisins. Pour batter into a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan for 15 minutes then transfer to a wire rack.
