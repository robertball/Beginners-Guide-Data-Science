Chicken "N Dumplings Recipe

Ingredients:
3 1/2 to 4 pounds broiler-fryer chickens, cut up
1 onion, wedged
3 celery leaves
1 carrot, sliced
2 bay leaves
1 tablespoon salt
3 to 5 cups hot water
2 1/4 cups Bisquick
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, snipped (or 2 teaspoons dried parsley)
2/3 cup milk

Directions:
Combine chicken parts, onion, carrot, bay leaves, salt and water in a large pot.  Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce to medium heat.
Simmer, covered, for about 25 minutes.  Remove chicken from pot.  Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces, discarding skin and bones. Return chicken to pot.
Combine baking mix, parsley and milk in a large bowl, mix well until soft but not too sticky.  Roll dough into 12 balls on a lightly floured surface.  Gently flatten each dough ball.
Return broth to a boil.  Add dumplings to pot.  Cook for 10 minutes. Discard bay leaves.  Ladle into 4 bowls and serve.
MAKE AHEAD:  Double the quantity of chicken to be cooked and use the extra for a tasty chicken salad the next day.
VARIATION:  For a stronger chicken flavor, add 1 chicken bullion cube to the broth before cooking the dumplings.
COOKIN' EXPRESS:  Save the time of deboning the chicken by purchasing boneless breasts and thighs.
COOK'S MONEY SAVER:  Learning to cut up a whole chicken is easy and a great way to save money -- since whole chickens cost much less than parts. You also have the bonus of using the giblets for another recipe. (and yes, they freeze well and keep for 6 to 8 weeks.)
