Ingredients:
1 cup elbow macaroni
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
3/4 cup fat-free half-and-half
3/4 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard powder
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 pinch ground turmeric

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour until mixture is smooth. Slowly add half-and-half, whisking as it is poured in. Stir until sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese, salt, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, pepper, and turmeric; whisk to combine.
Drain macaroni and add to the cheese sauce. Stir until evenly coated.

Description: 
The movie Home Alone served as inspiration to this macaroni and cheese. Although it says it's meant for one, it will serve two if you're feeling generous!
