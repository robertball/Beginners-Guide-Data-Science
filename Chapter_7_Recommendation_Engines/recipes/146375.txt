Ingredients:
1/2 head cabbage, finely shredded
2 carrots, peeled and shredded
1/2 onion, thinly sliced lengthwise
1 teaspoon crumbled dried oregano
1/2 cup mayonnaise, or to taste
8 large crusty rolls, halved and lightly toasted
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 pounds leftover roast turkey meat, shredded
16 thin slices  ripe tomato
1/2 cucumber, thinly sliced
8 radishes, sliced

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Turn off heat and stir in cabbage and carrots; let stand for 2 minutes then drain in a colander. Rinse well with cold water, then squeeze dry.
Place shredded cabbage and carrots into a large bowl along with the onion, oregano, and mayonnaise. Mix together until you have a mixture resembling coleslaw. This is the curtido.
To prepare sandwiches, lightly spread each roll with mayonnaise and pile with shredded turkey. Place a scoop of curtido on top of the turkey, and finish with sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, and radishes.

Description: 
My family makes these sandwiches with the leftovers of our Salvadorian Roast Turkey. The sandwiches are really messy, but really yummy, and totally worth the work.
