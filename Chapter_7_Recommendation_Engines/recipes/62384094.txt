Ingredients:
3 16 oz. cans of Hunts Fire Roasted tomatoes (drained or undrained)
2-3 cloves of fresh garlic, whole
4 jalapeno peppers, chopped (including seeds and ribs)
Juice of 2 limes
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. fresh cracked black pepper
1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes
1 medium red or white onion, chopped
1/2 to 1 bundle of Cilantro leaves (no stems)

Directions:
Place whole garlic cloves and jalapenos in a 9 cup food processor.  Pulse a few times to chop and blend. Add the cans of fire roasted tomatoes, lime juice, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.  Pulse just to barely blend.  Next, add the cilantro and onion and pulse/blend until onion and cilantro is mixed in and finely chopped.  Store in quart size jars or a container and refrigerate.  Can be served immediately, but for best flavor, let sit over night in refrigerator.

Description: 
After many attempts to find the right combination of flavors for my homemade salsa, I have come up with a true winner.  Everyone who tries this salsa says it's the best they have had, and they say it's very addicting.  It's quick to make and you will find that you can change the heat level by changing your pepper preference.  I often triple or quadruple it in order to have enough to share with my friends.  I also think the right chip is important too, that's why I only buy Juanita's tortilla chips to serve with this salsa.
