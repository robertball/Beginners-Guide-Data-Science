Ingredients:
4 large potatoes, grated
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
In a medium bowl combine potatoes, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, paprika, flour and pepper.  Mix very well.
Coat a medium skillet with oil and heat on medium-high.  Using a fork or spoon quickly spread a thin layer of potato mixture over the entire bottom of the pan.  Make the pancake as thin as possible, without gaps or holes.  Fry for 2 minutes, or until golden brown.  Flip with a spatula and cook on the other side.
Repeat with remaining potato mixture.

These are thin, crispy, fried potato pancakes. They are delicious!! This recipe has been passed down generations in my Polish family. Platski are very easy to make and taste fabulous. But I must warn you: these are very addictive!!
