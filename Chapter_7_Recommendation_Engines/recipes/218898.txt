Ingredients:
1/2 cup prepared barbecue sauce
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup red wine
1/4 cup maple syrup
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon dry mustard powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Whisk together the barbecue sauce, soy sauce, red wine, maple syrup, chili powder, dry mustard powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin in a bowl until thoroughly combined.
Place the chicken breasts into a 9x13-inch baking dish, and pour the sauce over the chicken. Turn the chicken pieces over in the sauce to coat both sides.
Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the baking dish, and keep warm.
Pour the remaining sauce into a saucepan, place over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Whisk the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until smooth. Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the sauce; reduce heat to a simmer, and allow the sauce to thicken, whisking constantly. Return the chicken to the dish, and pour the thickened sauce over the chicken to serve.
