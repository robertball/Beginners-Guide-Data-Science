Ingredients:
3 frozen chicken breasts
1 12 oz bag frozen corn
1 can black beans
1 can Rotel (tomatoes & green chilies)
1 taco seasoning packet
1 cup chicken stock

Directions:
Throw your frozen chicken breasts (yes, frozen) into the bottom of your crock pot, then add in your corn, black beans, rotel and taco seasoning on top. I don't drain anything I just throw it all in there. Stir together, then add your chicken stock just to keep it moist while cooking. Cook on low for 8 hours
