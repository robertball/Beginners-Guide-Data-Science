Ingredients:
1-8oz package regular or light cream cheese at room temp
1/2-ball of smoked mozarella at room temp (freeze the other half for the next batch you will make)
5 pieces of sun dried tomatoes in olive oil and herbs (I use Trader Joe's if I don't have my own home made sun dried tomatoes from my garden)
2 Tablespoons of oil from the jar

Directions:
In food processor, chop mozarella until finely chopped.  Add sun dried tomatoes and process until finely chopped.  Add cream cheese and oil.  Blend until all ingredients are combined.  Best done a hour or two ahead of time to combine flavors.  Spread on or serve with hearty crackers or Tuscan toast crackers. Enjoy!!!

Description: 
I bought a supermarket prepackaged spread several years ago, loved it and decided to recreate it.  Make ahead.  Keeps for several weeks in the refrigerator. Yummy!!! Also great on a bagel in the morning, or spread on salami, rolled up with an olive and a toothpick to hold the rolls together for an appetizer.
