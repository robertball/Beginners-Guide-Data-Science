Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup oats
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup applesauce
6 ounces Greek yogurt
1/4 cup skim milk
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 egg
2 tablespoons skim milk, or as needed (optional)
1 cup blueberries, or more to taste
2/3 cup coarsely chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Combine flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; stir in applesauce, yogurt, 1/4 cup skim milk, vegetable oil, and egg. If the dough us a bit too dry, add extra milk 1 tablespoon at a time. Batter should be about the consistency of a thick oatmeal.
Fold blueberries and walnuts into the batter. Spoon into prepared muffin cups until almost full.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.
