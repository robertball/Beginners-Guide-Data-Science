Ingredients:
1 lb lean ground beef
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup milk
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1/4 tsp pepper
1 small onion, chopped (1/4 cup)
1 large egg

Directions:
Heat oven to 400F.
Mix all ingredients. Shape mixture into twenty 1 1/2-inch meatballs.
Place in ungreased rectangular pan or on rack in broiler pan. ( I used a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper for easy cleanup).
Bake uncovered 20-25 minutes or until no longer pink in center and juice is clear.
