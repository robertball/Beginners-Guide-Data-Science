Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 egg
2 cups crushed saltine crackers, divided
1/2 cup oil for frying

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, parsley, chili powder, salt, egg, and 1 cup of crushed saltine crackers. Form into 6 balls, then flatten into patties. Coat patties with remaining cracker crumbs, and place them on a plate. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry patties for about 7 minutes per side, or until the centers are well done and the outside is golden brown.

Description: 
I'm not sure where my mom got this recipe, but she used to make it at least once a month. Although she never served it with gravy, I think peppered gravy would go great with this.
