Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) package egg noodles
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/4 cup sour cream
3/4 cup milk
2 (6 ounce) can tuna (drained)
1 (4 ounce) can sliced mushrooms (drained)
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Add mushroom soup, sour cream, milk, tuna, and sliced mushrooms to pot of drained noodles and mix well. Pour mixture into a 2-quart baking dish. Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and melted butter in small bowl, mixing well. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture evenly over top of noodles.
Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
I tweaked and combined 3 separate tuna casserole recipes into this winner. It's good as a main dish or as a side dish. I love to serve this on the side with breaded pork chops.Modified from: Fern's Tuna Casserole
