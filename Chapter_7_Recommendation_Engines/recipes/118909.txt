Ingredients:
4 bone-in pork loin chops (6 ounces each)
2 teaspoons canola oil
1 medium green pepper, chopped
2/3 cup chopped celery
1/3 cup chopped onion
1 cup ketchup
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons chili powder

Directions:
In a large nonstick skillet, brown pork chops in oil over medium-high heat. Remove chops and keep warm. Add green pepper, celery and onion to the skillet; cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften.
Return pork chops to the pan. In a bowl, combine the ketchup, brown sugar, broth and chili powder. Pour over chops and vegetables. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30 minutes or until meat is tender.

Description: 
This is my favorite 'penny pincher' skillet supper. Sweet red peppers add color and flavor to this main dish, but when I'm watching our budget, I use less expensive green peppers.                   --Jorie Welch of Acworth, Georgia
