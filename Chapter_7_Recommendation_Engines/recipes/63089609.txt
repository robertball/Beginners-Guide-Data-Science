Ingredients:
1 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 pound feta cheese, crumbled
2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, divided
1 teaspoon dried oregano
6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
2 cups loosely packed torn fresh spinach leaves
1 ripe tomato (cherry or heirloom tomatoes--even better!), chopped

Directions:
On large plate, combine 1 tablespoon flour, salt, and pepper. Set aside. In a small bowl, combine cheese, lemon juice, and oregano.  Set aside.
With a meat mallet, pound each chicken breast to 1/2 inch thickness.  Spread cheese mixture on each chicken breast, leaving 1/2 inch border.  Fold chicken breasts in half;  secure each with toothpick.  Coat chicken breasts with flour mixture.
In large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Cook chicken breasts for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, until golden. Mix chicken broth and lemon juice in bowl. Pour chicken broth mixture over chicken breasts in pan.  Add tomato to skillet, and bring to boil.  Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink inside. Add baby spinach before last 2 min. of cooking--just until wilted. Discard toothpicks before serving.
