Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
1/3 cup butter
1 red bell pepper, chopped
2 zucchini, sliced
1/3 cup chopped garlic
3/4 cup chopped shallots
1/4 cup drained capers
salt and pepper to taste
2 1/2 pounds clams in shell, scrubbed
1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/4 cup fresh basil

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Melt butter in a large heavy skillet.  Add red pepper, zucchini, garlic, and shallots. Saute over high heat until the shallots begin to soften; about 4 minutes. Mix in capers, salt and pepper. Remove from heat and add clams and shrimp. Toss until it's fully mixed.
Transfer mixture to a large baking dish. Cover and bake in a preheated oven until the clams have all opened and shrimp is cooked.  Make sure the lid is not touching the shrimp or they'll burn and stick.  Cook about 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Pour the scampi over the linguine, top with fresh basil and serve.

Description: 
This is my own special recipe. The most requested dinner when friends and family come to visit from all over the country. It's so easy and trust me...I hate capers, but they add just the right flavor.  If you really don't like capers, put them in a empty tea bag, fasten with a twist tie and throw it away before serving, but trust me I've had no complaints! This is a perfect dinner to entertain with or just for a romantic night for two. Suggestion: Have a nice but simple spinach salad and a good gourmet Italian bread with it.
