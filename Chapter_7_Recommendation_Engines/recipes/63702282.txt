Ingredients:
1 pound skin-on halibut fillet
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 cups chopped, seedless watermelon
2 Thai chiles or 1 Serrano pepper, finely minced
1/4 cup finely chopped red onion (about 1/2 small)
1 medium clove garlic, minced (about 1 teaspoon)
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
1 tablespoon fresh juice from 1 lime

Directions:
Drizzle fish with olive oil and generously season with salt and pepper.
While the grill is heating, prepare the salsa by combining remaining ingredients in a medium bowl. Set aside.
Place fish over hot side of grill skin-side down. Cook without moving it until skin is crisp and rendered, about four minutes. Carefully flip fish with a wide spatula. and cook on second side until cooked through. Flesh should be slightly flaky and offer no resistance when pierced with a toothpick or cake tester.
Remove fish from grill and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Serve with watermelon salsa.
