Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray a 9x13 dish with cooking spray, set aside.
Mix cake according to directions but ommit the oil.  Make it with Egg Beaters or egg whites only, add Coconut flakes.  Bake for about 28 minutes.
Let cool for 10 minutes and then poke holes all over the top.
Mix together the sweetened condensed milk and the coconut extract and pour over warm cake, letting the mixture melt inside the cake.  Completely cool and then frost with 7 Minute Frosting I from this site.
