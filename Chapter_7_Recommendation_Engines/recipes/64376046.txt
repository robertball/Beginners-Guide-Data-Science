Ingredients:
2 inches fresh turmeric rhizomes (roots)
1 inch fresh ginger root
2 Tbsp coconut oil
1 tsp fresh ground black pepper
1/3 cup of fresh spring water, divided

Directions:
Peel the turmeric and ginger root. Grate both into a small saucepan.
Add the coconut oil and pepper.
Add 1/2 the water and warm the mixture over medium heat.
Just as the mixture begins to heat and small bubbles form around the edges, turn down the heat to low/medium. Stirring continually, add small amounts of water as needed until the mixture has simmered at least 5 minutes but no longer than 8 minutes total from the initial bubbles.
Put into a glass container and allow to cool. Once cooled, close it hermetically and keep in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. This can also be frozen*.
