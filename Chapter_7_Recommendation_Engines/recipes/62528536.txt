Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups flour (I use unbleached)
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup oil (I use canola)
1 cup honey
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup strong coffee (decaf is fine)
1/2 cup orange juice
1/4 cup whiskey (or substitute more orange juice)

Directions:
Pam spray a Bundt pan (or a 9" x 13" pan). Preheat oven to 350oF.
In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices.
In a separate bowl, whisk to combine oil, honey, sugar, eggs, vanilla, coffee, orange juice, and whiskey.
With mixer, blend dry ingredients into moist (not the other way around) until thoroughly incorporated.  Pour into prepared baking pan.
Bake at 350oF for one hour (Bundt) or 40 minutes (9"x13" pan), on top shelf of oven (as the honey seems to burn easily if lower).  Cook Bundt for 20 minutes before inverting onto dish.

Description: 
Spiced fragrant honey cake is a tradition on Rosh HaShanah (the Jewish New Year, which generally falls in September).  

Unfortunately, most honey cakes turn out to be dry, brick-like things, inedible except with a hot beverage.  Some call honey cake the fruitcake of the Jewish people.  

BUT NOT THIS ONE!  This cake is genuinely moist and yummy.  It will serve about 12 guests at a holiday meal, but I promise that your family will chisel away at it until it's gone before the morning comes.
