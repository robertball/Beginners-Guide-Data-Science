Description: 
This is a pared-down version of a traditional Mexican shredded beef supper. I substitute shaved steak for the more time-consuming brisket and my family likes it even more. By using pantry items, I have created a delicious meal suitable for even the busiest weeknight. Served over rice or warm tortillas, this is one meal your family will be asking for again and again!
