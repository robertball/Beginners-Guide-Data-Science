Ingredients:
8 New Zealand green mussels in the
shell, rinsed and drained
4 ounces enoki mushrooms
4 tablespoons masago (Smelt Egg)
2 sticks chopped imitation crab
1/2 cup Dynamite Suace
3 tablespoons chili garlic sauce
4 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions
1/4 cup tsume sweet sauce (eel sauce)
1 teaspoon sesame oil
salt and pepper

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F
2. Blanch mussels (still in shell) in boiling water for 2 min and drain.
3. Extract mussels from their shells. Rinse and drain well using a your hands to squeeze as much excess water from mussels.
4. Reserve shells and scrub thoroughly.
5. Cut each mussel into small pieces (about 4-6 pieces each)
6. Prepare the filling by mixing, in a mixing bowl, mussels, imitation crab, 1/2 of the masago, 1/2 of the chili garlic sauce, and sesame oil.
7. Spread the enoki mushrooms over the insides of the shells.
8. Layer the filling over the mushrooms and arrange on a foil-lined baking sheet.
9. Bake for 7-10 minutes then remove from oven.
10. Top with the rest of the dynamite
sauce and broil until the surface is golden brown (about 2-3 minutes).
11. Top with Tsume sweet sauce, masago, and green onions immediately before serving.
Alternate Serving Idea: This dish can also be prepared and served as a plate. Instead of cooking individually, place all ingredients on one serving medium such as an oven-proof plate. An inverted portabella mushroom with the stem removed works excellent as well!

Description: 
This is a very addicting dish - simple, yet elegant.  The enoki mushrooms add a great texture to the amazing flavor of mussels covered in a spicy creamy sauce.
