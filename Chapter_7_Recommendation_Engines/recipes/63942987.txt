Ingredients:
1/2 cup salted butter
2 tbsp olive oil
4 cups sliced onion
4 (10.5 oz cans) beef broth
1/2 cup white wine (sherry)
2 tsp dried thyme
1 tbsp Worchestershire sauce
1 tsp white sugar
1 tsp dried parsley
salt and pepper to taste (we like it extra salty)
4 slices of french bread
4 slices provolone cheese
2 slices Swiss cheese diced
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (divided)
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (divided)

Directions:
Melt the butter with olive oil in and 8 quart pot on medium heat. Add onions and stir until they are all tender and translucent. Slowly add the beef broth, wine, thyme, salt, pepper, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, and sugar. Let it simmer together for 30 minutes. Heat the oven broiler. Pour the soup into oven safe crocks. Place a slice of bread into each bowl and ladle the soup over the bread. Put a slice of provolone cheese, pieces of Swiss cheese, 1/4c shredded mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese so that the top is covered. Sprinkle with a little dried parsley then place the bowls on a cookie sheet and broil in the oven until the cheese melts and is slightly browned.

Took a very good recipe off this sight and added a few more ingredients to suit our taste. My husband loves salty French Onion soup and I make this for him on cold nights.
