Directions:
In a large skillet, cook all the chopped veggies in the butter over medium high heat for about 20 minutes, until all of their water has cooked off and the veggies have browned and caramelized
Push the veggies to the edges of the skillet and put the chicken breasts in the center to brown, 2 to 3 minutes.
Turn the chicken and let brown on the other side, 2 - 3 minutes again.
Pour the broth and cooking wine into the skillet and cover.
Turn down the heat to medium low and let simmer for 15 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.
Add the cream and stir. Serve immediately with the veggies piles over the chicken and plenty of sauce.
