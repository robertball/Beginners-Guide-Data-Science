1 1/2 - 2 lbs. round steak, cut into cubes
1/2 cup flour
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp garlic salt
3 tbsp olive oil
1 pkg dry onion soup mix
1 cup water

1 cup sour cream
1 pkg egg noodles

Directions:
In a large skillet, heat olive oil.
Flour and season cubes of meat and brown in oil.
Add soup mix and water and simmer at least 15 minutes. (Longer simmering makes for more tender meat.)
Add cream of mushroom soup and simmer 15 minutes. (May need to add more water for longer simmering).
Before serving, add sour cream to heat through.
