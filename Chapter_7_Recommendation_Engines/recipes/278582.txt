Description: 
Forget tortilla chips! Seeded whole grain bread, toasted to its full potential, is avocado's real soulmate. After a lifetime of knowing this power couple, I decided to throw some subtle spice and acid their way to better complement the healthy fats, especially when an egg is involved. Works the same if you skip the egg and make it vegan!
