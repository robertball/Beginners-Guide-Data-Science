Ingredients:
1/4 cup water
1 cup sugar
6 eggs, at room temperature
1 can evaporated milk
1 can of sweetened condensed milk
1 8oz package of cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
grated peel and juice of 1 lemon or lime (optional)

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.
In a medium sized sauce pan combine water and sugar and cook over low heat until golden. Remove from heat quickly and pour into a 9 inch cake pan and allow to cool.
Beat eggs until the whites and yolks are incorporated. Whisk in the evaporated milk. If desired strain the egg/milk mixture to ensure a smooth flan.
Mix the remainder of the ingredients with the egg/milk mixture using a hand mixer or blender until smooth.
Pour flan mixture into the caramelized mold and bake in a bain-marie until set when toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean; about 50-60 minutes or so.
Refrigerate for several hours prior to inverting on a plate and serving. For best results refrigerate overnight and serve with fresh fruit or whipped cream.
