Ingredients:
Coleslaw:
1 small head green cabbage
2/3 cup sour cream
1/2 red onion, sliced
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
Fish Tacos:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
4 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
1 pound white fish fillets
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
12 corn tortillas
2 avocados - peeled, pitted, and diced, or more to taste
2 ripe tomatoes, diced
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Quarter and thinly slice the cabbage; put in a large bowl. Mix sour cream, onion, cilantro, lime juice, cumin, garlic, and salt in a separate bowl. Pour sour cream mixture over the cabbage and toss to combine. Cover and set aside in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Mix olive oil, lime juice, cumin, and 1 teaspoon salt in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Place fish in the bowl and evenly coat with marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
While the fish is marinating, preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Sprinkle fish with remaining salt and pepper. Place on the preheated grill and cook until firm, about 10 minutes.
Divide fish among tortillas and top with coleslaw, avocados, tomatoes, and cilantro.

Description: 
This is a simple and fantastic quick dinner recipe for grilled fish tacos. Adapted from an Epicurious recipe, this dish is less spicy, but has tons of flavor.
 I also buy any firm white fish that's on sale (cod, tilapia, red snapper, halibut).
