Ingredients:
1 quart oil for deep frying
6 (6 ounce) fillets pork sirloin
1 cup cake flour
2 cups dry bread crumbs
2 eggs
1/4 cup milk
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place meat on a solid, level surface and pound with a mallet until it is 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick.
Place the flour and bread crumbs in separate dishes. Soup plates are useful. Lightly beat the eggs and add the milk.  Lightly season with salt and pepper and put this into another soup plate.
Coat the meat in flour, patting lightly by hand.  Using a fork to hold the meat, dip into the egg mixture and drain slightly.  Next, coat with the breadcrumbs by lightly pressing the crumbs into the meat.  When each piece of meat has been prepared, deep fry in cooking oil until golden brown.
