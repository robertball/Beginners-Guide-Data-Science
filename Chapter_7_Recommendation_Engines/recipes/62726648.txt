Ingredients:
Nonstick cooking spray
3/4  cup  cooked rice
1  teaspoon  cooking oil
2/3  cup  chopped cooked ham
1/3  cup  thinly sliced green onions
8    eggs
1/2  teaspoon  salt
Lettuce leaves (optional)
Sweet-and-Sour Plum Sauce (see recipe below)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degree F. Lightly coat twelve 2-1/2-inch muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray. Press about 1 tablespoon cooked rice into the bottom of each prepared muffin cup; set aside.
In a medium nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add ham and green onions; cook until green onions are tender. Spoon ham mixture evenly over rice in muffin cups. In a medium bowl, combine eggs and salt; beat with a wire whisk or rotary beater. Divide the egg mixture among muffin cups.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until egg mixture is slightly puffed and golden. Let stand for 2 minutes. Run a knife around edges of muffin cups to loosen; remove from cups. If desired, arrange on a lettuce-lined platter. Serve with Sweet-and-Sour Plum Sauce. Makes 6 servings.
Sweet-and-Sour Plum Sauce: In a small saucepan, combine 1/4 cup plum jam or preserves, 1/4 cup chicken broth, 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, 2 teaspoons soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon cornstarch. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more.
