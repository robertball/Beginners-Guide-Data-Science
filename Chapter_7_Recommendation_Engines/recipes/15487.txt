Description: 
This is a hot, creamy dip that may also be served as a casserole by halving the amount of Bechamel sauce and topping with Parmesan (instead of adding Parmesan to the mixture). Then bake in a medium baking dish for approximately 30 minutes at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) -- Delicious!
