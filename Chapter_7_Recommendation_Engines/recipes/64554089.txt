Ingredients:
1 1/2 tbsp butter
3/4 c. onion, chopped
1/2 c. celery, chopped
3/4 c. carrots, chopped
2 tsp. minced garlic
1 tsp. dried thyme
1 tsp. dried oregano
2-3 bay leaves
4 c. homemade stock (turkey or chicken)
2 chicken breasts, cooked and cubed
3 medium zucchini, spiralized
1 tsp. smoked paprika
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in pan and add onion, celery, carrots, and garlic. Saute until tendercrisp.
Add thyme, smoked paprikia, and oregano and stir.
Add bay leaves and stock. Scrape the bottom of the pan to get all the herbs off the bottom of the pan. Bring to a simmer for about 10 minutes.
Add the chicken breasts and simmer for about 15-20 more minutes. (Side Note: Because we use homemade stock--it was very concentrated flavor so I added 2 c. water. If you are using boxed broth or your homemade broth is not as strong, you may want to add another cup or two of broth).
Put in spiralized zucchini in soup and turn the heat off. Let sit for about 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper if needed and enjoy!
