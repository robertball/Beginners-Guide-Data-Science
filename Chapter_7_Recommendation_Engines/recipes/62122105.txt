Ingredients:
1 8 oz package cream cheese, softened
1 6 oz can minced clams, drained, liquid reserved.
1 lemon, juiced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 dashes of Tabasco sauce
Freshly ground pepper
1/2 t kosher salt

Directions:
Using a fork, mash together the cream cheese, garlic and clams.
As the mixture begins to smooth add all of the lemon juice, tabasco, salt and pepper. Continue to mix.
Add the reserved clam juice little by little until your dip reaches the desired consistency (usually it takes about half of the juice).
Discard remaining clam juice, or use for another purpose.
