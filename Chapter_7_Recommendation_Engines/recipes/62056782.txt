Ingredients:
8 large jalapenos
4oz cream cheese
4 slices of bacon (cut in half)
8 toothpicks

Directions:
Cut jalapenos in half and hollow out, removing stem, membrane, and seeds (this is where most of the heat comes from, so if you are feeling a bit rambunctious, leave a bit of the membrane and seeds in the pepper (but be ready with the milk)). Fill cavity of pepper generously with cream cheese. Take one of the bacon slices that has been halved, wrap jalapeno securing the cheese inside. Put toothpick through pepper securing the bacon. Repeat for the remainder of the peppers. Place in toaster over (or conventional oven) on broil, for aproximately 10 minutes (or until cheese is toasty brown on top and bacon is done). Remove from oven and enjoy!!

Description: 
These jalapenos are non-fried and non-breaded. Can easily be adapted to cook on the grill, oven, or toaster oven. While the bacon lends a smokey, deep flavor to the cream cheese, the cream cheese fairly balances out the heat from the jalapeno. So simple with only 3 ingrediants, yet simply delicious!
