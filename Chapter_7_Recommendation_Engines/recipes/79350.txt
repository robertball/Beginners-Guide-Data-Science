Ingredients:
3 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup sugar
6 cups warm water
1 cup shortening, melted
2 teaspoons salt
5 pounds all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir yeast into 1 cup warm water to dissolve. Stir in 1/4 cup sugar. In a separate large bowl, stir salt into 5 cups warm water to dissolve; stir in shortening and remaining 1/4 cup sugar. After yeast foams, stir salt mixture into yeast mixture.
Mix in the 1/2 of the flour, and then mix in remaining flour 2 cups at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic.
Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl, and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Form the dough into approximately 30 to 40 rounds. Place on lightly greased baking sheets. Cover the rolls with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake rolls in preheated oven 15 to 20 minutes, or until brown. Serve warm.

Description: 
These are by far the best rolls I've ever had!  My neighbor's mom makes these and passed the recipe along. They are scrumptious! This recipe makes a lot of rolls. You can freeze the dough after forming it into rolls.
