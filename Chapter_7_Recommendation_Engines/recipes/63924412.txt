Ingredients:
2 quarts vegetable oil
1 (16-ounce) jar hamburger dill pickle chips
2 cups buttermilk
2 cups whole-wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne peppe

Directions:
Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a large pot. Cover a platter with a few layers of paper towels. Drain the pickles in a colander.
Place the pickles in a medium bowl and cover with the buttermilk. Stir the flours, salt, paprika, and cayenne together in another bowl; mix well. Take about a handful of the pickles out of the buttermilk and dredge in the seasoned flour. Shake off the excess flour and place the coated pickles in the hot grease. Be careful not to place too many pickles into the hot grease, or the pickles wonâ€™t fry up crisp. Fry the pickles until golden brown. Scoop them out with a slotted spoon and put them on the paper towels to drain. Continue frying pickles until all are done.
