Description: 
Yummy and low in fat!  Chipped turkey, colby cheese, lettuce, tomato, ranch dressing and salsa wrapped up in a flour tortilla and served cold.  They are a great summer treat, easy to make and a real crowd pleaser.  We make up a bunch every time we go camping, fishing or on a road trip.  Wrap them in foil and keep them in the cooler with the soft drinks, nothing could be easier or more satisfying.
