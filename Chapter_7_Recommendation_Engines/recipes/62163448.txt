Ingredients:
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup cocoa powder
2/3 cup evaporated milk
1/3 cup light corn syrup
1/3 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Combine sugar, cocoa evaporated milk and corn syrup together in saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture begins to boil. Boil for 5 minutes to thicken. Make sure you time it from a good rolling boil and not the first few bubbles that will persist for several minutes beforehand. If you want really thick hot fudge sauce, you can boil for a few more minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the butter and vanilla.
