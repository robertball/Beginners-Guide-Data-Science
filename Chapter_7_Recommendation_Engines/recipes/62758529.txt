Ingredients:
2 lbs. bread dough (divided into 1 lb. each)
1/2 lb. sliced deli ham
1/2 lb. sliced deli turkey
4 cups shredded Mozzarella cheese
salad peppers or jalapenos to taste

Directions:
Roll out each 1 lb. portion of bread dough into a rectangle about 6x12 inches.  On each portion of dough layer 1/4 lb. deli ham down the middle of the dough followed by 1 cup cheese.  Over the cheese layer 1/4 lb. deli turkey followed by 1 cup cheese.  Top cheese with peppers if you prefer.  Carefully roll the dough jellyroll style, pinching and sealing the sides and ends together (it will look like an uncooked loaf of french bread).  Transfer the loaves to a greased cookie sheet.  Cover.  Let rise for 30 minutes to an hour (until it is puffy).  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.
