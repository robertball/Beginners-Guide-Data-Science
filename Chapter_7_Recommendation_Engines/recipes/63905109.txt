Ingredients:
1 cup semi sweet choc. chips
1 3/4 cup all purpose flour
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
3 large very ripe bananas
1 tsp vanilla
2 eggs
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375, grease and flour a 9x5x3 baking pan
Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, salt, cinnamon
Melt butter, about 1 min in microwave and set aside to cool
Mash bananas with potato masher in a bowl
Add vanilla extract
Beat eggs in separate bowl and add to banana mixture.
Be sure butter has cooled but not solidified, add a tiny bit to banana mixture, stir in then add 3-4 increasingly larger increments stirring after each addition.
Add liquid to dry and stir until just mixed, 10 seconds is ideal but I found that hard to accomplish. At any rate be gentle.
Fold in chips and bake immediately.
Bake 50 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean. Begin testing at 45 min.
When pan is cool to touch, remove loaf by inverting pan. Finish cooling on a wire rack.
