Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie shell
3 apples
3 fresh peaches
1 pear
1 cup raspberries
3/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
6 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
Peel, core, and slice the peaches, apples, and pear. Place the fruit into a large bowl and add the raspberries. In a separate bowl, mix the white sugar, cinnamon, and 3 tablespoons flour. Pour the mixture over the fruit and gently toss the fruit to coat.
Mound fruit mixture into a 9-inch pie shell.
In a medium bowl, combine 3/4 cup flour and 1/3 cup brown sugar. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles small peas. Stir in the chopped pecans and sprinkle the crumble on top of the fruit.
Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 35 to 40 minutes, or until filling is bubbly and the crust is golden brown. Cool on wire rack.
