Ingredients:
2 (6 oz) Filet Mignon
1 teaspoon olive oil
salt and pepper
GORGONZOLA SAUCE:
1 tablespoon butter
1 shallot, minced
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 cup heavy cream
4 oz Gorgonzola cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring steaks to room temperature and rub with olive oil and generously season with salt and pepper.
Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Place a large oven proof skillet in the oven as it preheats. When the oven reaches 500 degrees carefully remove the hot skillet and place it on a burner set to high.
Immediately place steaks in the dry pan and cook one to two minutes on both sides turning with tongs.
Transfer the pan with the seared steaks back to the preheated oven and cook for 3-5 minutes until desired doneness is reached. A medium steak will be 140 degrees. Check meat with a meat thermometer for accuracy.
Transfer steaks to a warm platter and loosely tent with foil. Let steaks rest for 5-10 minutes. The steaks will continue to cook during this process and this internal temperature will rise by 5-10 degrees.
While steaks are cooking start your sauce.
Heat medium size sauce pan over medium heat.
Add butter to melt.
Add garlic and shallots until shallots are tender.
Add cream and reduce by half.
Turn heat to low and add cheese.
Let cheese melt and add salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
A very simple and delicious meal. A good sear on your steak will ensure a juicy tender steak. I have found this to be the best way to cook a steak indoors.
