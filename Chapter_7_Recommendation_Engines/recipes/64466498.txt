BASE
180g digestive biscuits
100g melted butter
2 tablespoons sugar
BROWNIES
220g butter
240g dark chocolate
1.3 cups of densely packed muscovado sugar
4 large eggs
0.25 teaspoon vanilla extract
0.5 cup plain flour
0.25 teaspoon salt

2. Blend biscuits to break them up and add butter, sugar, and salt.
3. Spread out the biscuit mix in the bottom of the tray and bake for 15 minutes. Leave to cool.
BROWNIES

2. Whisk eggs and sugar until white and porous (abt 5 minutes). Add vanilla.
3. Gently fold in the cooled chocolate. Add flour and salt.
4. Pour batter onto base and bake for about 25-30 minutes. Brownies should still be slightly gooey in the middle.
5. Raise temperature of oven to 390 degrees.
6. Pour marshmallows on top of brownies and bake for another couple of minutes. Keep a close eye on the cake so you don't burn it!
Leave to cool and then cut into 1x1" pieces. Enjoy!
