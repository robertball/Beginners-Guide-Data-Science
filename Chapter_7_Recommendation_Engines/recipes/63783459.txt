Ingredients:
1/4 C Olive Oil
1 small onion
3 Garlic Cloves
5 pounds Vine Ripened Tomatoes (9 cups quartered)
1 T Kosher Salt
Parsley to garnish

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil; meanwhile prepare a large bowl of ice water. With a paring knife, core the tomatoes and score an X on the bottoms. Working in batches, carefully lower the tomatoes in the boiling water. When the skins begin to split (anywhere from 5 - 30 seconds), use a slotted spoon to transfer the tomatoes in to the ice water.
When the tomatoes are cool, remove the skins (use a paring knife, if necessary). Halve the tomatoes then remove the seeds with a spoon, and discard. Next roughly chop the tomatoes.
Heat a large dutch over or heavy bottomed, non-reactive pot over medium heat. Add the olive oil along with the onion and garlic with a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally for about 5 minutes, until the onions/garlic become aromatic.
Next add in your chopped tomatoes with another pinch of salt and bring the mixture to a gentle boil. Mash down with a potato masher. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, continue to stir and mash as necessary.
