Ingredients:
buttermilk -> 1 tablespoon + 2/3 cup, divided
sour cream or creme fraiche, 2 tablespoons
granulated/dry onion, 1/2 teaspoon (or onion powder)
1 & 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, do-not peel, cut into 1" chunks
1 & 1/2 pounds sweet potatotes, peeled and cut into 1" chunks
1 small leek, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced -white and light green part only
2 tablespoons butter, cut into 4 pieces
1/4 teaspoon, freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons freshly minced fresh chives

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Meanwhile in a small bowl; combine 1 tablespoon buttermilk, sour cream, onion and pinch of salt.  Cover sauce and refrigerate while you cook the potatoes.
Leave the 2/3 cup of buttermilk set out as to not chill it again when added to cooked potatoes.  (I like to slightly warm the buttermilk to add to the hot cooked potatoes.)
Add both potatoes and leek to the boiling water, return to a boil; reduce heat to maintian a vigorous simmer & cook until tender enough to pierce with a knife. (12-15 minutes)
Drain and return the cooked potatoes and leek to the warm pot; remove from heat.  But keep near warm part of stovetop.
Add the remaining 2/3 cup buttermilk, remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt, butter and pepper to the pan; very coarsely mash with a potato masher leaving large chunks to show color of both potatoes.
Transfer potatoes to serving bowl; drizzle with sauce then sprinkle with the chives, serve.

Description: 
Gently hand mashing both potatoes together makes a pretty presentation of large chunk-mashed potatoes, you can see both colors with the 2 types of potatoes together.
The buttermilk sauce drizzled over the finished dish along with a sprinkle of the fresh chives is a really pretty & colorful.
