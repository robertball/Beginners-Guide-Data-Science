Ingredients:
1 5-6 lb whole chicken
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary plus (optional) one sprig for the cavity of the chicken
2 tablespoons melted butter
Zest from one orange
Zested orange cut in half
one medium or 2 small onions

Directions:
Wad three pieces of aluminum foil into 3 to 4 inch logs 1 inch in diameter, and place them in the bottom of the slow cooker.
Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold running water. Pat dry with paper towels. Slather with the melted butter. Mix the spices together and rub on the bird.  Lightly Squeeze the juice from the halved oranges into the slow cooker Stuff the bird with the onions and orange halves plus the sprig of rosemary if using and truss the bird. Place bird in the Slow Cooker and sprinkle the bird with the orange Zest.
Cook however you want to fit your time constraints,  I did 4.5-5 hrs on high but you can set the slow cooker to High for 1 hour, then turn down to Low for about 8 to 10 hours, or until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear.
