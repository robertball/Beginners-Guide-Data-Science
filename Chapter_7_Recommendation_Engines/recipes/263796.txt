Ingredients:
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed
2 (9 inch) frozen pastry crusts, at room temperature
3 (3x5-inch) loaf pans
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 medium potatoes, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
1/2 large white onion, chopped
1 large carrot, diced
1 pound ground beef
1/4 cup frozen peas
1/4 cup frozen corn
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle dark ale
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups reduced-sodium beef stock
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon tomato bouillon (optional)
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Lightly flour a work surface. Roll each crust out to about 1/8-inch thick. Cut dough to fit three 3x5-inch loaf pans. Push dough into tins and up the edges using your fingertips. Roll out remaining dough for use as top crusts and set aside.
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add potatoes, celery, onion, and carrot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef and cook until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add peas, corn, and ale; cook and stir until reduced by a bit more than half, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
Add flour to the vegetable-ale mixture and stir constantly until thick and almost pasty, 1 to 3 minutes. Add stock slowly, stirring constantly. Add ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt, tomato bouillon, rosemary, and garlic powder. Reduce heat and simmer until filling mixture reduces to desired thickness and potatoes are cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes.
Remove pot from heat and allow filling to cool slightly. Fill crusts with filling. Top with remaining dough and pinch edges to seal. Brush tops of pies with beaten egg wash. Cut 3 slits in the top of each pie for air to escape. Place tins on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
