Ingredients:
2 Pounds Mixed Fresh Mushrooms
2 Garlic Cloves, Chopped
1/2 Cup Olive Oil
Salt & Pepper
1 Teaspoon Chopped Fresh Rosemary
1 Teaspoon Chopped Fresh Sage
1/4 Cup Chopped Fresh Parsley
1 Teaspoon Balsamic Vinegar

Directions:
Remove the stems from the caps, chop off the ends, and cut into large pieces.
Cut the mushrooms into pieces no larger than 2 inches in size.
Mix the olive oil with the garlic, herbs and seasonings in an ovenproof casserole dish large enough to fit all of the mushrooms.
Add the mushrooms, and mix well, coating the mushrooms with the flavored oil.
Bake for about 30 to 40 minutes, or until cooked through.
Remove from the heat, and drizzle with the balsamic vinegar.

Description: 
Roasting any vegetable caramelizes them which brings out the full flavor. I like to mix a combination of mushrooms together, such as portabella, shitake and oyster mushrooms. You can mix your own favorites, or simply just use one. These mushrooms are just as good at room temperature as they are served warm. This is a great side dish for grilled or roasted meats.
