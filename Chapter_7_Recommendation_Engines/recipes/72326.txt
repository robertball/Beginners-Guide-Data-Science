Ingredients:
1 cup unsweetened coconut cream
1 (12 ounce) can green curry sauce
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium green bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 medium red onion, thinly sliced
1/2 leek, thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, diced
1 pound cod

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a saucepan over medium-low heat, mix the coconut cream, curry sauce, dill, salt, and pepper. Cook until heated through.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the pepper, onion, leek, and garlic about 5 minutes.
Place the cod in a baking dish. Cover with the vegetables, and top with the coconut cream mixture.
Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, stirring sauce and vegetables occasionally, until fish is easily flaked with a fork.
