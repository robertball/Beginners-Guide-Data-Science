Ingredients:
1 cup butter/margarine, softened
1 1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tbsp vanilla
2 eggs
4 cups flour
2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
3 cups chocolate chips

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix butter, sugars, vanilla, and eggs in a large bowl with electric mixer. Mix together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together. Gradually add to sugar mixture, about 1 cup at a time. The dough will be very thick. Stir in chocolate chips.
Drop by rounded tablespoons about 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet. Bake 10-12 minutes. They will be slightly puffy but will settle (this is to retain moisture.) Remove to wire rack to cool.

Description: 
This recipe makes very moist, chewy cookies full of chocolate chips. The cinnamon adds an extra little something but can omit if you'd like. If you want more cake-like cookies, add about 1/2 cup extra flour, and they'll still taste just as good.
