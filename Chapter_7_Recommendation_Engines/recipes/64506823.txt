Ingredients:
2 medium zucchini
2 teaspoons salt
1 cup wild rice, cooked
1 cup fresh breadcrumbs (not dried)
1/2 medium onion, minced
1/2 cup hazelnuts
1/4 cup whole milk
2 medium eggs
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cracked black pepper (or to taste)
Garnish:
3/4 cup creme fraiche or sour cream
chopped tarragon or mint

Directions:
Grate zucchini, mix with 2 teaspoons salt, and place in a sieve for approximately 10 minutes to extract liquid. Squeeze out the liquid and place in a medium bowl.
Meanwhile, toast hazelnuts in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes or until golden and fragrant. Chop hazelnuts coarsely.
Mix wild rice, fresh breadcrumbs, minced onion, and chopped hazelnuts with zucchini and toss to distribute ingredients evenly.
Whisk eggs, milk, baking soda, and black pepper in a separate bowl. Add to zucchini mixture and stir well to fully incorporate. Mixture should be wet but not runny. Add more milk or more breadcrumbs as needed to reach desired consistency.
Pan-fry 1/8 cup - 1/4 cup sized scoops of the mixture in olive oil, flattening  with a spatula, approximately 3 - 4 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Top with teaspoon-sized dollops of creme fraiche and tarragon or mint leaves. Serve immediately.
Note: Batter can be made ahead of time and stored in a refrigerator for up to 3 days.
