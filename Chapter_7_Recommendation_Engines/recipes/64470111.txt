*1/8 cup cocoa powder
*pinch salt
*1-2 tsp kale powder/ spirulina/ any other super food powder

Directions:
*Soak nuts and seeds for 4hours - this makes them activated, or LIVE!! There is no evidence to suggest Dinomite is a carrion eater... good food is LIVE! Drain once plump.
*Soak dried fruit for an hour. Drain.
*Blend fruit and nuts til chopped and sticky.
*Blend in coconut, cocoa and super food powders, and/or more or less anything you can get your tiny Dino hands on
*If you've poured in some creativity juice you might need to adjust dried ingredients. You want a consistency that will Shmoosh and Stick
*Shmoosh it. Roll into balls. Roll in extra coconut to give it that just-hatched-chickling fluffball look.
*Hide in the kale patch. Set up hidden camera. Return 17.6 seconds later to observe Dino feeding extravaganza.
*Repeat.
