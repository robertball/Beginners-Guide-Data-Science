Description: 
I was experimenting in the kitchen with milk and sugar, when suddenly the idea of chocolate came to my mind. I looked in the cabinet and saw a fresh bottle of chocolate syrup. I added it to my hot cup of milk and sugar and ta-da! Secret simple hot chocolate! Add marshmallows, whipped cream, or Cool WhipÂ® to make even tastier.
