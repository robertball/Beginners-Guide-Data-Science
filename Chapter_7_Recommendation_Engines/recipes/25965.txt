Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.  Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, mixing just until incorporated. Sir in blueberries. Pour batter into prepared pan.
In a small bowl, combine flour and sugar. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over top of batter.
