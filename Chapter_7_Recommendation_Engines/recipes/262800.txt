Ingredients:
1 red bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
1/2 English cucumber, diced
3 scallions, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces
1/4 cup fresh mint leaves, finely sliced
lemon, zested and juiced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/4 cups water
1 cup couscous (such as Bob's Red MillÂ®)
2 tablespoons butter
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 (8 ounce) package feta cheese, cut into 1/4-inch cubes

Directions:
Combine red bell pepper, cucumber, scallions, mint leaves, lemon juice, lemon zest, and olive oil in a bowl. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat and stir in couscous, butter, and salt. Cover saucepan and let stand until water is absorbed completely, about 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork; place on a baking sheet to cool.
Combine couscous, bell pepper mixture, and feta cheese together in a bowl, stirring with a fork to prevent clumps.

Description: 
I created this Mediterranean salad to pair with a white-blend wine from South Africa. The saltiness of the feta and the freshness of the mint and vegetables made a perfect accompaniment to the citrus and herb notes of the wine. I cut up and dressed the vegetables the night before and then the morning that I was serving the salad, I cooked up the couscous following the directions on the package then tossed it with the vegetables and feta.
