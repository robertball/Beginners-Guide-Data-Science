Ingredients:
3 pounds bone-in pork roast
2 tablespoons dried marjoram
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons caraway seed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Heat a roasting pan over medium high heat until hot. Rub the roast with the marjoram, salt and pepper. Brown all sides of the roast in the hot roasting pan. Sprinkle caraway seeds over all and pour in enough water to come halfway up the sides of the roast.
Cover and place roast in the preheated oven. Bake for 1 1/2  hours, or until an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) is reached, about 30 minutes per pound. Remove from oven and let sit for 10 minutes before carving.

Description: 
When I lived in Chicago used to go to Cicero for a treat like this, served with steamed dumplings and mashed potatoes. Use the drippings to make an incredible gravy.
