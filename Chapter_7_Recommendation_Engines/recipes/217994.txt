Ingredients:
3 tomatoes
1 teaspoon salt, or as needed
1 summer squash, finely diced
1/2 cup dry herb stuffing mix
2 teaspoons dried basil
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Slice the tomatoes in half horizontally, sprinkle each cut side with salt, and place cut sides down on paper towels for about 5 minutes. Hollow out the tomato halves, leaving sides 1/4 inch thick; remove seeds from pulp, and chop the pulp.
Place the chopped tomato pulp, squash, herb stuffing mix, basil, black pepper, and mozzarella cheese in a bowl, and mix until thoroughly combined. Stuff the mixture into the hollowed-out tomato halves.
Bake in the preheated oven until the squash is tender and the cheese has melted, about 20 minutes.
