Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti, broken in half
6 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder, or more to taste
4 hard-boiled eggs, halved and sliced
2 leeks, halved and thinly sliced
1 cup cubed fully cooked ham
2 tablespoons dark soy sauce, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, stir vegetable oil, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, sugar, salt, and Chinese five-spice powder in a bowl to make dressing.
Drain spaghetti and place in a large bowl. Immediately pour dressing over spaghetti and mix well, so the warm spaghetti can soak up the dressing. Allow to cool completely, about 1 hour.
Mix eggs, leeks, and ham into the cold spaghetti and set aside for 1 hour for flavors to combine. Season with dark sweet soy sauce and more Chinese five-spice powder.
