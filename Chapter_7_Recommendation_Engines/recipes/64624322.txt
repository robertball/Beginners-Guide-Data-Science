Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 medium yellow onion, sliced into thin strips
1 green bell pepper, sliced into thin strips
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
3 Tablespoons steak sauce
6 hoagie buns

Directions:
Spray inside of crock pot with non-stick spray. Lay the onion and bell pepper slices in the bottom of crock pot. Pour chicken broth over the veggies. Lay chicken breasts over the top of vegetables. Sprinkle salt, pepper, garlic powder and steak sauce over the chicken.
Cover with lid and cook on low heat for 6 to 7 hours OR on high heat for 3 to 4 hours (or until chicken is tender and cooked through)
Carefully remove chicken from crock pot and shred with two forks. Return to crock pot and stir to combine the shredded chicken and veggies. (There will be liquid in the crock pot but I leave it in to keep the chicken moist)
Using a slotted spoon scoop up chicken mixture and place inside hoagie buns. Top with desired kind of cheese. (I used white queso velveeta on ours and it was amazing. Provolone or white american would be delish, too)
