Ingredients:
1/4 cup teriyaki sauce
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup balsamic vinaigrette
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
2 teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 drops hot sauce (such as Dave's Insanity Sauce Â®), or to taste
1 pound top round steak, cut into 1/4 inch strips
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Combine the teriyaki sauce, Worcestershire sauce, balsamic vinaigrette, garlic powder, onion powder, liquid smoke, salt, and hot sauce in a resealable plastic bag. Add the meat strips and coat evenly with the marinade. Seal and refrigerate 24 hours.
Preheat an oven to 175 degrees F (80 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack on top.
Remove the beef strips from the marinade and shake off excess marinade. Discard the remaining marinade. Place the meat strips onto the wire rack and sprinkle with black pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until firm and dry, at least 3 hours. Allow the jerky to cool completely before storing in a sealed container.

Description: 
My husband and I wanted to start making our own jerky, but couldn't find a recipe here to suit our tastes, so I made up my own. It's not too strong, yet has a great after-taste. Enjoy!
