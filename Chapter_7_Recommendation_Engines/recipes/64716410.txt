Ingredients:
12 whole jalapeños
12 strips bacon
4 oz. (1/2 package) cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup sausage, cooked and crumbled
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1/4 cup minced onion
1 cup mayonnaise
1 dash chili habañero sauce
2 tbsp tequila

Directions:
Leaving the stem intact, make a slice down one side of the jalapeño and gently open up.
Carefully remove the ribs and seeds (try not to rip the pepper open).
Repeat with the remaining peppers.
In a medium bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, cooked sausage, shredded cheddar, and onion. Mix well.
Carefully spoon the cream cheese mixture into the jalapeños. (Do not overfill.)
Wrap each jalapeño in a strip of bacon and secure closed with a toothpick.
Smoke the jalapeños for about 1 1/2 hours. Alternatively, you can throw them in a 400°F oven for about 20 minutes, until the bacon is crisp.
(TIP: Be sure to wash your hands well after handling the peppers. Or better yet, wear gloves!)
While the jalapeños are cooking, prepare the tequila aioli by whisking together the mayonnaise, a dash of chili habañero sauce, and the tequila until smooth.
Serve the jalapeño poppers with the tequila aioli and enjoy!
If you want to get fancy with the presentation, place a spoonful of the aioli in a shot glass and top with a jalapeño popper.
