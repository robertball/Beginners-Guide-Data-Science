Ingredients:
1 cup pecans
1 tablespoon butter
cooking spray
3 cups grated zucchini
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
3 eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 cups white sugar
10 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
Cream Cheese Icing:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup salted butter, softened
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Spread pecans onto a baking sheet. Cut butter into small pieces and scatter on top of pecans.
Broil in the preheated oven until pecans start to turn golden brown and become fragrant, about 5 minutes, watching carefully to prevent burning. Remove from oven and allow to cool, about 10 minutes. Transfer pecans to a cutting board and smash or crush into small pieces.
Turn off broiler and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 cups of a muffin tin with paper liners. Spray inside of liners with cooking spray.
Combine zucchini, oil, and eggs in a large mixing bowl.
Mix flour, sugar, toasted pecans, sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Add zucchini mixture and stir to combine. Fill muffin tin cups 3/4 full with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
While cupcakes bake, cut softened cream cheese and butter into small pieces and place in a mixing bowl. Add sugar and almond extract. Mix icing using an electric mixer until smooth, about 5 minutes. Store in the refrigerator until use.
Remove cupcakes from the oven and let cool completely before frosting, about 1 hour.

Description: 
I just love chocolate but I am not the hottest for really rich food during the summer, so a nice alternate to this dilemma is zucchini-chocolate cupcakes with cream cheese icing!
