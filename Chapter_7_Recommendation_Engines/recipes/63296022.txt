Slowly add the liquid through the liquid dispenser while pulsing until a dough forms.  Shape into two balls.  Flour the balls, flatten, then roll out between 2 sheets of waxed paper. Use as desired for 2 single crust pies or 1 top and bottom crust pie.
OR Mix-by-hand method:  Mix flour and salt.  Stir in 2/3 of the shortening intil mixture resembles cornmeal.  Cut in remaining shortening until particles are the size of small peas.
