Ingredients:
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
3 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons butter
1 3/4 cups sliced fresh strawberries
2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Butter a 9x9 inch dish.
Combine milk, sugar and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; boil.  Stir in strawberries and lemon juice.  Heat, stirring constantly, to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.
Remove from heat and quickly spread in prepared pan.  Let cool before cutting and serving.
