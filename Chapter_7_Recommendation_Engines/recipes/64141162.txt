Ingredients:
Turkey neck, heart, and gizzard
1/2 unpeeled medium yellow onion, rinsed
1 tablespoon butter, plus more if needed to augment your drippings
7 cups water
Turkey drippings in roasting pan
3/4 cup flour
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
1 Brown neck, heart, gizzard, and onion in butter in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-
high heat.
2 Add 6 cups water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and gently simmer, partially
covered, 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until liquid has reduced by one-third and meat is
tender.
3 Strain broth. (You should have 4 cups; add some water if you’re short.) If you want
meaty bits in your gravy, reserve neck and giblets; when cool enough to handle, remove
meat from neck and finely chop along with giblets.
4 Set turkey roasting pan with drippings (minus the turkey, of course!) over two burners
on low heat. Add remaining 1 cup water, and stir to release browned bits.
5 Pour liquid from roasting pan into a fat separator or a small bowl, and let fat rise to
the top. Pour liquid from separator, leaving fat in separator (or, if using a bowl, skim off
and reserve fat). Strain liquid through a fine-mesh sieve into a 2-cup measuring cup. If
you have less than 3/4 cup fat, add enough butter to make 3/4 cup. If you have less than
2 cups liquid, add enough water to make 2 cups, and combine it with giblet broth for a
total of 6 cups liquid. Let cool.
6 Heat fat in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour until smooth and let
bubble for 2 minutes, whisking frequently, to make a blond roux.
7 Gradually add cool broth mixture to hot roux, whisking until smooth. Bring to a
boil; boil 1 full minute, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes or until
thickened, whisking often. Add chopped giblets and neck meat, if using. Taste and
season with salt and pepper. Keep warm until serving, whisking occasionally.
