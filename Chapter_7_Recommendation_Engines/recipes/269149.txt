Description: 
This cranberry sauce practically makes itself! It's quick, and you won't have to keep a constant eye on it. Substitute the water for apple or orange juice, or do half water and half rum! Can be made several days ahead of time, will keep for at least a week in the refrigerator, and can even be frozen if needed.
