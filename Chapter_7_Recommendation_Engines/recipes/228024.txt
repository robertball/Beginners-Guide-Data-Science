Ingredients:
1 tablespoon dried minced shallots (optional)
1 tablespoon hot water
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon Saigon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
2 eggs
2 cups mashed, cooked butternut squash
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup dried currants
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1/2 cup fat free sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon maple syrup

Directions:
Hydrate shallots with hot water in a small bowl, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain.
Sift flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Whisk eggs, squash, shallots, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until just mixed. Fold currants into batter.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Scoop about 1/4 cup batter and drop into hot oil. Cook pancakes until crisp and lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining batter.
Mix sour cream, vanilla extract, and maple syrup together in a bowl. Serve atop the squash pancakes.

Description: 
This is a breakfast alternative and can be served with omelets and/or breakfast meat. They are not meant to be sweet, although the squash has it's own sweetness. The dried shallots add a subtle background flavor and are not at all obvious. No one will have a clue that they are eating squash, so it's a good way to get nutrients into those picky eaters. If desired, you could serve them with maple syrup.
