Ingredients:
2 turkey legs without skin
1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/4 cup prepared yellow mustard
1 tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

Directions:
Spray the inside of a slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray, and place the turkey legs into the cooker. In a bowl, mix together the brown sugar, yellow mustard, smoke flavoring, ketchup, cider vinegar, hot pepper sauce, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the mixture over the turkey legs.
Cover the cooker, set to Low, and cook 8 to 10 hours. Remove the turkey legs from the cooker, separate meat from bones and tendons, and shred the meat; return the meat to the sauce for serving.

Slow-cook inexpensive turkey legs for a tasty sandwich filling. Serve on hamburger buns. I like to top these with coleslaw.
