Ingredients:
2 tablespoons coconut oil
3/4 cup unsweetened flaked coconut
1/2 cup coconut flour
sea salt to taste
3 eggs, beaten
4 (4 ounce) fillets tilapia fillets, or more as needed

Directions:
Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
Mix unsweetened coconut, coconut flour, and salt together on a plate.
Brush egg over each tilapia fillet. Press each fillet into coconut mixture until evenly coated. Gently toss between your hands so any coconut that hasn't stuck can fall away. Place the coated fillets onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.
Fry fillets in the hot oil until golden brown and fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
