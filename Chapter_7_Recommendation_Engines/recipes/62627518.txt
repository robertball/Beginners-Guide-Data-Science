Image:

Ingredients:
5 links sweet Italian sausage
5 links hot Italian sausage
1 large sweet onion
2 green bell peppers
1 or 2 cloves minced garlic
1 28-ounce can tomato sauce
14 ounces water
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Remove casings from sausages.  Peel onion and cut into 1-inch chunks.  Remove seeds and ribs from green peppers and cut into 1-inch chunks.
Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  With fingers, break off 1-inch pieces of sausages and cook in the olive oil until no longer pink.  Add onions, green peppers and garlic.  Saute until onions and green peppers soften slightly, about 5 minutes, and until sausage is lightly browned, stirring often.
Add tomato sauce and water.  Stir and bring to a simmer.  Add parmesan cheese and stir.  Cover and reduce heat to low.  Simmer for at least 2 hours.  The longer it simmers, the more the flavors develop.
If sauce is too thin, uncover to thicken.
