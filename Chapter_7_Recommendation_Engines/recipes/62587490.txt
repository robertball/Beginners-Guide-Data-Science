Ingredients:
¾ pound ground turkey breast
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 tbsp Italian style breadcrumbs
1 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese
1 tbsp freshly chopped parsley
1 clove minced garlic
1 tsp onion powder
Dash of salt and freshly ground black pepper
6 cups chicken broth
¾ cup uncooked acini de pepe
1 cup chopped carrots
½ Vidalia onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
Salt and pepper, to taste
¾ bag of frozen chopped spinach

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Place meat in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl combine the breadcrumbs, cheese, parsley, minced garlic, onion powder, salt and pepper well. Add to the bowl with the meat and pour beaten egg over top.
Mix well with hands. Shape into 3/4-inch balls. Place on parchment paper lined baking sheet. Bake for 30 mins.
(Check at 20 and 25 – you want a very slight brown tint – it is turkey so it’s not going to be that brown-ish of a color). Once done, remove from oven and cover.
In a boiling pot of lightly salted water, cooked the pasta till al dente.
Heat the chicken broth in a large pot at medium-high heat (and keep on heat).
Sauté chopped carrots and onion with the minced garlic (place in pan last to prevent burning) and a pinch of salt and pepper.
Once mixture is tender, add it to the broth. Strain the cooked pasta and add to the broth with the carrots and onions. Place frozen chopped spinach in the broth mixture. Stir and allow to heat through completely. Add the meatballs and allow to heat for another 1-2 minutes.
Enjoy!
