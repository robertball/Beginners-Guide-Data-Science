Ingredients:
4 lamb shanks
1/2 cup cider vinegar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon tamarind concentrate
1 1/2 tablespoons garam masala
1 onion, chopped
8 cloves garlic, peeled
1/3 cup sliced fresh ginger
1 cup cherry tomatoes
1/2 cup water
1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
1 large onion, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 teaspoons brown sugar
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Place lamb shanks in a large resealable plastic bag. Whisk together cider vinegar, oil, salt, tamarind concentrate, and garam masala in a bowl, and pour into the bag. Squeeze out excess air and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a foil-lined baking sheet.
Remove marinated lamb shanks and place on the prepared baking sheet. Season all sides with salt. Roast in the preheated oven until well-browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Reserve marinade in the bag.
Combine 1 onion, garlic, ginger, cherry tomatoes, and water in a blender and pulse on and off until smooth. Set aside.
Combine cayenne pepper, paprika, cinnamon, cumin, dried mustard, and black pepper in a small bowl.
Melt clarified butter in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir 1 onion until softened and well-browned, about 30 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and pour in cayenne pepper mixture. Cook and stir until spices are aromatic, about 2 minutes.
Pour marinade from the bag into the stockpot, and stir in tomato-onion mixture and brown sugar. Bring mixture to a simmer. Place lamb shanks in the pan and reduce heat to low. Cover and cook, turning occasionally, until meat is tender and easily pierced with a fork, 3 to 4 hours.
Remove lamb from the pot and cover with foil. Increase heat and simmer the sauce for a few minutes, skimming the fat from the top. Taste and add salt if needed. Serve lamb shanks with sauce spooned over the top. Garnish with cilantro.

I have very little experience cooking Indian food, so that this came out as deliciously as it did is nothing short of amazing.
