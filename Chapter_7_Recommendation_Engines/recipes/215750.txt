6 cloves garlic
1 cup fresh basil leaves

1 cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese
1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:

Description: 
The difference between good pesto and great pesto is always using the highest quality ingredients â€“ especially the olive oil and Parmesan cheese. Make sure basil is well coated with lemon juice and olive oil or the basil sprigs will turn black. Try drizzling on a little olive oil on the surface of the pesto to create an air barrier, if you won't be serving immediately.
