Ingredients:
5 pieces of roma (grape) tomatoes (halved), 10 pieces of red seedless grapes(halved), 3 oz, about half a cup of white meat chicken breast, 1 oz of minced almonds, 1 oz of chopped celery,1 oz white or minced red onion,2 table spoons of gluten free mayo (1 oz), 1 table spoon of sour cream, 1 teaspoon of olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of ground paprika,1/4 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of fresh ground pepper, 1/4 teaspoon of cumin, 1 teaspoon of freshly minced thyme, and finally, 1/2 teaspoon of freshly minced sage.

Directions:
Chop thawed chicken breast into cubes or shreds-whichever you prefer- place in sauce pan/pot and  cover with water until cubes are fully submerged, about 1 cup of water per 3 oz-half a cup of chicken, then add a spits worth of salt to it. while chicken is boiling, mix all ingredients except mayo, sour cream, celery, and onions, into a bowl.  Set aside mixed ingredients, place onions and celery into another microwavable bowl and fill with water, so the contents are fully submerged, place in microwave and cook for 1 minute; this tenderizes the onions and celery, but doesn't 'over cook' them!  Mix celery and onions into bowl along with all other ingredients.  After chicken is cooked, let it rest for a few minutes them combine along with mayo and sour cream.  Mix everything together now and refrigerate for 2 hours.  Eat with gluten free whole grain bread. Enjoy!
