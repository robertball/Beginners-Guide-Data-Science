Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 bay leaves
6 small onions, halved, or 2 large onions, cut into 2-inch pieces
7 large cloves garlic, peeled and halved
3 sprigs fresh thyme
6 fresh sage leaves
12 small or 3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 3-inch lengths
12 ounces small new potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1 1/2-inch wedges
8 ounces yellow wax beans or a mixture of beans, trimmed and cut in half
5 medium tomatoes, peeled (see Tip), seeded and quartered, juice reserved
1 large yellow or orange bell pepper, cut into strips
1 pound summer squash, cut into 2-inch pieces
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
Green Herb Sauce
1/3 cup packed fresh basil leaves
1/3 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves
2 tablespoons fresh marjoram leaves
1 small clove garlic
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons water, or more if necessary
2 tablespoons capers, rinsed
Pinch of salt

Directions:
1.To prepare vegetable braise: Heat oil and bay leaves in a large Dutch oven over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in onions, garlic, thyme and sage; cover and cook, without stirring, 3 minutes. Layer carrots, potatoes, beans, tomatoes, bell pepper and squash on top without stirring. Season with salt and pepper, and pour the reserved tomato juice over the vegetables. Cover and cook until the vegetables are tender and juicy, 40 to 60 minutes. After 30 minutes, if the pot seems dry, add a few tablespoons water.
2.To prepare green herb sauce: Puree basil, parsley, marjoram, garlic and oil in a food processor or blender. With the motor running, add water and process until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Transfer the sauce to a bowl, stir in capers and season with salt.
3.Remove the bay leaves and thyme sprigs from the vegetables. Serve drizzled with the green herb sauce.

Description: 
From EatingWell.com.   This sophisticated dish of braised vegetablescarrots, potatoes, beans, tomatoes, bell pepper and squashdrizzled with a pestolike sauce made from garden-fresh herbs was inspired by a summer stroll through the farmers’ market. Feel free to mix up the produce based on what you have on hand, and make extra sauce since it freezes well and is perfect for tossing with pasta or swirling into soups. If they’re available, try adding fresh fava or other shell beans to bump up the protein in this quintessentially summery dish.
