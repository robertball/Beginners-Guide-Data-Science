Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 tilapia filet, thawed
Salt and pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons salted butter OR 2 tablespoons unsalted plus 1/2 teaspoon of salt
1/2 teaspoon oregano
3/4 teaspoon tarragon
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
Pre-heat a nonstick skillet with a little olive oil or vegetable oil over medium-high heat, until a few drops of water dance around, then evaporate when dropped onto the pan.
Salt and pepper your tilapia to taste. Then, place in the skillet. Do not touch for at least 30 seconds, or else the fish will stick and tear.
Cook for about 2 minutes,. Check to see that the bottom is nice and seared. It should have a deep brown color. If so, flip it. If not, wait another 30 seconds.
Cook the second side for 2 minutes, then remove from heat, and brush with the lemon butter.
Garnish with fresh lemon if desired, and serve.

Description: 
A simple, easy way to cook up a delicious tilapia filet. Pan-seared and brushed with a tarragon, oregano, garlic and lemon butter.  The recipe is for 1 tilapia filet, as I usually buy them frozen, and individually wrapped. You can scale this to however many filets you want to cook. 

Tilapia usually comes in very thin filets that cook of very fast, so you can have dinner in no time.
