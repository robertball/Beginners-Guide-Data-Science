Ingredients:
2 squares (1 ounce each) unsweetened chocolate
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon chocolate extract (if you don't have this then just you another teaspoon of vanilla extract)
Peppermint extract to taste (optional)
1 cup flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Melt the chocolate in the top of a double broiler set over simmering water or microwave; set aside to cool slightly. Combine the eggs, sugar, oil and extracts in a large bowl; whisk to combine. Stir in the chocolate; set aside.
Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Add chocolate mixture to flour mixture, stirring until well combined. Cover; refrigerate at least 4 hours.
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spread confectioners' sugar on a plate; set aside. Scoop walnut-size balls of dough; roll each in the sugar. Place on a greased or parchment-lined cookie sheet 2 inches apart. Bake until edges are firm, about 10 minutes per batch. Remove cookies to a wire rack; cool.

Description: 
These are yummy especially with the peppermint and are still great without it. This dough can be VERY sticky if you aren't patient enough with your refrigerating time.
