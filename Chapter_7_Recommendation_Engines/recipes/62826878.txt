Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon brown sugar
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 1/3 cups AP flour
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Put the warm water in your bread machine. Add the yeast and brown sugar to the water, and let sit for 10 minutes. Add the oil to the yeast solution. Cover the liquid mixture with the flour, and then the salt. Put the machine on the dough setting and start it. Remove the dough and place on a clean, lightly floured surface. Knead for about 10 minutes, using a little more flour as needed. Allow the dough to rest for a minute. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Put the dough on a pizza pan, on top of a piece of parchment paper. Stretch the dough out to the edges of the paper and cover with a light layer of olive oil. Then trim the edges of the paper except for one corner. Bake for 8 minutes, then remove from the oven and lower the temperature to 400 degrees Flip the crust over onto the pan and  throw away the paper. Top with your favorite sauce and toppings. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are golden brown, about 30 minutes.
