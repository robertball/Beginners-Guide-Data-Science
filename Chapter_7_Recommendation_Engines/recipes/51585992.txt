Ingredients:
1/2 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and shredded
3 1/4 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 onion, diced
8 ounces white mushrooms, sliced
5-ounce bag baby spinach
3 large eggs
1 cup skim milk
1 ounce Gruyere or cheddar cheese, shredded in a food processor or on the large holes of a grater

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Lightly grease a 9-inch glass or ceramic pie dish with 1/4 teaspoon oil. Toss potatoes with 1 teaspoon oil and 1/8 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Press into an even layer in pie dish, up the sides like a crust. Bake until golden brown at the edges and dry, about 20 minutes. Let cool.
Lower the oven to 325 degrees. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened and golden, about 5 minutes. Add remaining teaspoon oil and mushrooms and cook, stirring, until mushrooms release their liquid and most of the liquid evaporates, about 8 minutes. Add spinach and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, just until spinach wilts, about 30 seconds. Let cool slightly.
Whisk together eggs, milk and remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt and pepper. Spread the mushroom mixture in an even layer in the pie dish, and top with an even layer of the cheese. Carefully pour in egg mixture. Bake until firm around the edges but still wobbly in the center, about 20 minutes. Let cool, and serve warm or at room temperature.
