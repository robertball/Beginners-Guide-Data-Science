Ingredients:
1 1/8 cups water (70 to 80 degrees F)
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 quarts water
1/2 cup baking soda

Directions:
In bread machine pan, place the first four ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer.  Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons water or flour if needed).
When cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface.  Divide dough into eight balls.  Roll each into a 20-in. rope; form into pretzel shape.  In a saucepan, bring water and baking soda to a boil.  Drop pretzels into boiling water, two at a time; boil for 10-15 seconds.  Remove with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels.
Place pretzels on greased baking sheets.  Bake at 425 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown.  Spritz or lightly brush with water.  Sprinkle with salt.
