Ingredients:
3 cups flour (sometimes I use half white, half cake flour)
2 cups sugar
1 Tbsp baking powder
3/4 tsp salt
1 cup butter
4 eggs
1 cup milk
1 tsp vanilla
1 cup butter, softened
6-8 cups confectioners sugar
1/2 cup milk
2 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl.
Add butter, cut in pieces, and stir just till butter is coated in flour mixture.
In a separate bowl, mix eggs, milk and vanilla. Gradually add to flour mixture and blend till smooth.
Fill cupcake liners 2/3 full and bake at 325 degrees for 17-20 minutes.
For frosting:
Whip softened butter for at least 2 minutes or until very soft and fluffy. Mix in 3 cups of confectioners sugar, then add milk and vanilla. Mix in 3 more cups of sugar and beat till fluffy. Add up to 2 more cups sugar or until desired frosting consistency is reached.
