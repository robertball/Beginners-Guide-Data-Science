Ingredients:
2 medium to large purple eggplant (you may use other eggplant as well)
4 cloves of garlic, chopped finely
3 green onions, chopped finely
2 t sesame seed
2-3 t peanuts, chopped finely
Sauce:
2 T vinegar
6 T soy sauce
1 t chicken powder(a type of chicken stock powder, you may get it at QFC or Asian market)
4 T vegetable oil or sesame oil

Directions:
Put eggplant in a steamer. Steam for about 15 minutes.
Take eggplant out of steamer and let it cool down for about 5 to 10 minutes. Use your hand to peel them into small strips. Put them in a bowl that can withstand high heat. Then put the peanuts, sesame seed, green onion and garlic on top of the eggplant.
Heat up the vegetable oil or sesame oil in a pan until smoking. Quickly pour the oil over the eggplant (Try to pour the oil evenly over eggplant so that the oil will cover the green onion and garlic). Quickly cover the bowl. Let the mixture steam for about 15 minutes. Open it up, and you are ready to serve!
You may stir up the eggplant a little bit so that it will be covered with the sauce.

Description: 
Eggplant is the type of vegetable that people either like or not. Personally, I like it very much, because you can spend little time preparing it but still have a tasty dish. Some people don't like eggplant just because they feel that eggplant doesn't have much flavor. Eggplant is like tofu at some point. It is hard to get the flavor into it.
30 minute eggplant will allow the flavor soak into the eggplant but it doesn't take long.
