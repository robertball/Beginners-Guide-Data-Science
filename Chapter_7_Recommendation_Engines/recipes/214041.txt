Ingredients:
1 pound dried black-eyed peas, sorted and rinsed
1 onion, cut into large dice
2 bay leaves
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
canola oil for frying
2 teaspoons seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
Place the black-eyed peas into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight.
The next day, drain and rinse the peas. Pour in enough water to cover the peas by 3-inches, then stir in the onion, bay leaves, and jalapeno pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the peas are tender but not mushy, 40 to 50 minutes. Add more water if needed to keep the peas covered while cooking. Drain the peas in a colander set in the sink, and spread them onto a baking sheet lined with paper towels or dish towels to drain. Discard bay leaves, and refrigerate the peas until ready to fry.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Carefully pour about 1 1/2 cups of peas into the hot oil per batch, and fry until crisp, 4 to 7 minutes. Remove the peas, drain on paper towels, and toss the hot peas in a bowl with seafood seasoning and kosher salt. Serve hot.

Description: 
Fun, funky and full of flavor! Think 'far out bar goodies' or your next full-fledged addiction. There's a crazy depth to the flavor and a buttery afterburn.  Precooking the peas can be done a day in advance, making serving quick and easy.  Enjoy!
