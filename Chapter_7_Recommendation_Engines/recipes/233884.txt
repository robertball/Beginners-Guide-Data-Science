1 large onion, thinly sliced

Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Cook garlic and the 1 jalapeno pepper in the hot oil for 2 minutes. Add onion.

Add bell peppers and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of fajita seasoning to skillet. Cook and stir for 6 to 8 minutes or until peppers are tender. Add peppers to onion mixture; cover and keep warm.
Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet. Add 1/2 of the bison flank steak strips to skillet. Cook and stir for 1 to 2 minutes or until bison flank steak is browned. Remove from skillet and cook remaining bison flank steak.
