Description: 
Stew beef, condensed golden mushroom soup, chopped onion and Worcestershire sauce simmer in a slow cooker. SO GOOD!  Serve over or with noodles or mashed potatoes.

Note:  I don't use cream cheese or sour cream (should it still be called stroganoff?!)...  If you feel you need it, add 4 oz. at the end.Modified from: Slow Cooker Beef Stroganoff I
