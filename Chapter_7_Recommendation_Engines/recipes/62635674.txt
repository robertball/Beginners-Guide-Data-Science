Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 cup sugar
2 cups cheddar cheese shredded
2 large eggs
8 ounces sour cream
1/2 cup canola oil
1/3 cup milk

Directions:
Combine the first 5 ingredients and then fold in the shredded cheese.
In a small bowl, combine the eggs, sour cream, oil and milk.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir just until moistened.
On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough 10 to 12 times and then pat it out to a 3/4 inch thickness.
Cut dough with a 3" round cutter, or simply cut into 3" squares.
Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 15 minutes.
