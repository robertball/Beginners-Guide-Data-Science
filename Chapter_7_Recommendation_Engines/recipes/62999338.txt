Ingredients:
BARS:
1 Betty Crocker white cake mix
2 egg whites OR 1 egg
8 oz. cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup milk
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1 cup chocolate chips
1 cup raspberry tidbits
ICING:
1 (7 oz.) tube of Betty Crocker RED cookie icing
1 cup raspberry tidbits
1 Tablespoon cream or milk
Wilton white Sparkling Sugar Cyrstals

Directions:
FOR THE BARS:
Preheat oven to 375Â°
Lightly grease or spray a 9x13 pan.
Cream together the cream cheese and butter.
Add the egg whites, vanilla and milk and mix well.
Gradually add the cake mix and mix until well combined.
Stir in the chocolate chips and raspberry tidbits.
Press onto prepared pan.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until evenly and lightly browned.
Cool.
MAKE THE ICING:
Combine raspberry tidbits and cream in a 2 cup measuring cup or bowl and microwave for
15-20 seconds, then stir.  The tidbits will continue to melt so don't over heat them.
Cut the big end (not the tip) off the tube of frosting.
Squeeze the icing from the tube into the melted
tidbits and mix well.
Frost the cooled bars and sprinkle with sugar crystals.
Chill and then cut into squares.
