Ingredients:
Cake:
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 (3 ounce) package instant white chocolate pudding mix
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
5 tablespoons Key lime juice
1 tablespoon Key lime zest
4 eggs
Frosting:
1 (16 ounce) container lemon frosting
1/4 cup grated white chocolate
1 tablespoon Key lime zest
1 tablespoon Key lime juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Mix cake mix and pudding mix together in a bowl. Beat milk, vegetable oil, 5 tablespoons Key lime juice, and 1 tablespoon Key lime zest into cake mix mixture just until batter is smooth. Beat eggs, 1 at a time, into batter, beating until each egg is incorporated before adding the next. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool cake to room temperature.
Mix lemon frosting, white chocolate, 1 tablespoon Key lime zest, and 1 tablespoon Key lime juice together in a bowl. Spread frosting over cake.
