Ingredients:
1 (2 1/2 pound) fryer chicken or equivalent pieces
½ cup creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste
¼ cup raisins
1  ripe mango, peeled and diced (optional)

Directions:
Put the chicken in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium. Allow the chicken to simmer until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove the chicken to a cutting board. Use a pair of forks to remove and shred the meat from the chicken. Discard the remains. Place shredded chicken in a single layer on a plate and allow to cool completely in refrigerator, about 15 minutes.
Stir together the salad dressing and sugar in a large bowl. Stir the chicken and raisins into the salad dressing. Add the mango and gently fold into the mixture. Refrigerate overnight or 8 hours before serving.

Description: 
This chicken salad can be made with many different variations of fruit. It is also a hit as a dip when served with Town House crackers! Also try currants in place of the raisins.
