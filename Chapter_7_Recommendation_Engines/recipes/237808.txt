Ingredients:
1 pound round steak, thinly sliced
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and thinly sliced
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon butter
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 onion, chopped
12 mushrooms, sliced
1/4 cup sweet and sour sauce
4 cups cooked rice

Directions:
Place steak, ginger, and soy sauce in a bowl; turn to coat steak. Cover tightly; marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.
Heat a wok over high heat; pour in beef mixture. Cover wok; cook until beef is browned, about 5 minutes. Remove beef from wok.
Heat butter in wok over high heat; stir in bell pepper, onion, mushrooms, and sweet and sour sauce. Cover and cook until vegetables begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir cooked beef into vegetable mixture; cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Serve over cooked rice.

Description: 
In looking for a healthier version of the standard ginger beef, I came up with this non-deep fried version. The longer you marinate the beef, the more ginger flavor it soaks up.
