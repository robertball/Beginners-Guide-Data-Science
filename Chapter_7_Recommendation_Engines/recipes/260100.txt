Ingredients:
Donuts:
4 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 cup Sugar In The Raw®
1/2 cup Stevia In The Raw®
10 tablespoons butter, melted
4 large eggs
1 1/2 cups low-fat milk
1 tablespoon vanilla
Glaze:
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon fresh or dried lavender buds, plus more for garnish
2 cups powdered sugar, sifted
1/2 cup Stevia In The Raw®
2 teaspoons lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease a mini donut pan. In a large mixing bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. In a second large bowl whisk together Sugar In The Raw(R), Stevia In The Raw(R), butter, eggs, milk, and vanilla until sugar is dissolved. Fold flour into milk mixture until combined.
Add two teaspoons of dough to each donut cup. Bake 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool completely in the pan.
In a small saucepan bring milk to a simmer, add lavender, cover, remove from the heat, and let sit 15 minutes. Strain milk and discard lavender. In a medium bowl whisk 2 tablespoons lavender milk into powdered sugar and Stevia In The Raw(R), then whisk in lemon juice. If needed, add a little more lavender milk to reach desired consistency.
Dip the top of each doughnut in the glaze and place on a rack. While still wet, sprinkle with lavender and let set.
