1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
½ cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar

1 cup mashed ripe bananas
¼ cup milk

Combine first five ingredients in a large bowl; stir well. Set aside.
Beat butter until creamy; gradually add sugar, beating well.
Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition.
Add banana and milk to creamed mixture; add to dry ingredients, stirring just until dry ingredients are moistened.
Pour batter into a buttered and cinnamon-sugared loaf pan, sugar top of loaf.
Bake at 350° F for one hour, or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Let cool in pan ten minutes; remove from pan and let cool on wire rack.

Description: 
Absolutely the best banana bread in the universe.  The crust on most recipes is dry because the pan is buttered and floured... but the crust becomes the best part when the pan is buttered and cinnamon-sugared!
