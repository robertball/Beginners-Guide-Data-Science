Ingredients:
1 lb. raw cashews
2 to 3 Tbsp. fresh rosemary leaves, finely ground
1/2 tsp. fennel seeds, finely ground
1/4 to 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, ground
3 Tbsp. brown sugar
1 tsp. coarse salt
2 to 3 Tbsp. butter, melted

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees.
Spread cashews on sheet pan and roast for 10 minutes.
Toss warm cashews in melted butter and spread on sheet pan.
Mix the remaining ingredients together and sprinkle over cashews. (Don't try to put the cashews and remaining ingredients in a bowl to coat; the coating won't stick to the cashews and all you have is roasted cashews in the end.)
Mix gently with cashews and put back in oven for about 5 minutes.
