Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh cranberries
1 3/4 cups white sugar
1/4 cup orange juice
2 teaspoons grated orange zest
1 pinch salt
1 cinnamon stick

Directions:
Combine cranberries, sugar, orange juice, orange zest, and salt in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove lid. Add cinnamon stick and select Saute function; cook until sauce thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove and discard cinnamon stick.
Blend sauce with an immersion blender for a smoother consistency. Let cool; sauce will continue to thicken naturally.
