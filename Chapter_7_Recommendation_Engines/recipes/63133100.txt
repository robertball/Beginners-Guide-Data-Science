Ingredients:
2 large Idaho potatoes (1/2 pound each)
12 slices of bacon
2 cups canola oil
1 TBSP honey
1 TBSP chopped scallions
1/2 tsp chopped parsley
Kosher salt
freshly cracked pepper

Directions:
Cut each potato lengthwise into 6 wedges each. Wrap each wedge with a slice of bacon and secure the ends with a toothpick. Place the oil and potatoes in a large saucepan. Oil should come at least halfway up the potato. Over medium heat, cook wedges until tender, turning occasionally, about 20 minutes. In a small bowl, mix the melted butter, honey, scallions, parsley, salt and pepper. Transfer cooked potatoes to a paper towel lined plate to drain. Then to a clean plate, remove toothpicks, and drizzle with the honey~scallion mixture. Serve.

A twist to a potato side dish... crunchy and tasty. Extra flavor added from the fresh herbs grown in my garden. My teens Love this dish and always request extra honey~scallion sauce for their dipping pleasure.
