Ingredients:
1 lb tri colored rotini
Food coloring*
Water
1 C sugar
3/4 C cider vinegar
1/2 C vegetable oil
1 tsp salt
1 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp pepper
3-4 tblsp parsley flakes
1 sm onion, grated
1/2 green pepper, diced
4-5 carrots, grated

Directions:
Cook pasta according to directions on box.
While pasta boils, place 2 TBSP water and 5 drops of food coloring (if using gel coloring, 20 drops if using traditional liquid food coloring) in a plastic bag (different plastic bag for each color).
Drain pasta & rinse with cold water.
Separate pasta evenly amongst bags of water/coloring.
Squeeze to evenly color color pasta and allow to sit while you chop veggies and make dressing.
Grate onion & carrot and dice green pepper.
Combine the remaining ingredients (oil, vinegar, sugar, salt, garlic powder, parsley) and mix well.
Rinse pasta with cold water and place in large bowl.
Add veggies and mix.
Pour dressing over pasta veggie mixture and mix to coat.
For best flavor, allow to sit in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving (tastes great fresh made, too, but the flavors meld more with time).
