Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons milk
1 3/8 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup chopped candied citron
1 egg white
1 1/2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup finely chopped almonds
2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon water
2 teaspoons red food coloring

Directions:
Cream butter and white sugar until fluffy.  Stir in egg yolk and milk. Add  citron to butter mixture and stir in.  Add  flour and baking powder; blend well.  Chill until firm, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a clean, dry, glass or metal bowl, whip egg white until frothy. Gradually incorporate 1 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar; beat until meringue holds its shape.  Fold in almonds.
Roll dough 1/8 inch thick on lightly floured board; cut out small rounds with 2 inch cookie cutter.  Place 1 inch  apart on a greased baking sheet.  Put 1 teaspoon Almond Meringue in center of each round to make it look like the crown of a hat.
Bake 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden. To Make Icing:  Gradually add water to 2  cups confectioner's sugar, mixing until icing is stiff.  Add 1 to 2 drops of food coloring.  When cookies are cool, pipe around crown of hat with Icing to look like a hatband.
