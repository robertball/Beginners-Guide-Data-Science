Description: 
This is a Greek beef stew made with small onions. This is my mom's recipe, and every Fall without fail you could smell it simmering in the kitchen.  Serve it with a large bowl of mashed potatoes.  Of course a Greek salad, some feta & olives and crusty bread give this meal the final touches.  The onions can be time consuming to clean, but well worth it when your family sits down to eat.
