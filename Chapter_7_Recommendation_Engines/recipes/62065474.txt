Ingredients:
1 package semi-sweet chocolate pieces (12 oz)
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 can sweetened condensed milk (14 oz)

Directions:
Milt chocolate in a double broiler on stove-top. When all pieces are melted remove from heat. Stir in condensed milk and salt. Mix until mixture is smooth. Cover with plastic and let stand over night at room tempurature.
Following morning, spoon mixture into Cookie Press. (The star disc usually works best for me.) Line your cookie sheet with wax paper to prevent sticking. Make your chocolate mound 1 inch in diameter and 3/4 inches high. Let stand or a couple hours before removing from wax paper.
