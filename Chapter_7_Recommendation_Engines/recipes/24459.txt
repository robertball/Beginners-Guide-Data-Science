Remove brownies from pan, using foil to lift. Cut brownies into football shapes, using cookie cutter. Frost footballs with frosting.
Place baking chips, milk and butter in small microwavable bowl. Microwave uncovered on Medium-High 1 minute; stir. Microwave about 10 seconds longer or until chips are melted. Drizzle melted chips over frosting to look like football laces.
