Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) chicken breasts
½ (17 ounce) bottle sriracha sauce
1 ½ tablespoons grated habanero peppers, or to taste
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1 dash ground paprika
1 dash ground black pepper

Directions:
Combine chicken, sriracha sauce, habanero peppers, butter, paprika, and black pepper together in a resealable container. Marinate in the refrigerator, 4 to 5 hours.
Preheat grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Lay a sheet of aluminum foil over the grill and cut slits into it.
Place the marinated chicken on the aluminum-foil lined grill. Cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
