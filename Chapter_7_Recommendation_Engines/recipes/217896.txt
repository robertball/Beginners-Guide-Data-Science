Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups rice flour
1 cup soy flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt

1/2 cup oil
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup infant rice cereal
1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Whisk rice flour, soy flour, sugar, and salt together in a bowl; stir in pumpkin, oil, and eggs.
Mix rice cereal and baking powder together in a bowl; stir into pumpkin mixture until batter is combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
When we started a gluten-free, casein-free diet for my son, I desperately needed a good muffin recipe. This is it! These gluten-free, dairy-free (watch ingredients on chocolate chips!) muffins are the best my family has tasted. My 6-year-old would eat these all day if I let him.
