Ingredients:
1 cup rolled oats (not instant)
1 15 oz. can cannelloni beans (or Great Northern or other white beans)
2 to 2 1/2 T. corn starch (see note)
1 to 2 T. nutritional yeast (opt) or 1 T mustard
1 to 2 T. of chili garlic sauce (optional)
If not using chili-garlic sauce, add 2 cloves of garlic to the blender and 1 to 2 T. of paprika for flavor and color.
1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups water

Directions:
Rinse and drain beans (to remove salt).
Using a blender or food processor, starting first with the beans only, pulse a few times, then add the rest of the ingredients, reserving the water to add slowly while increasing the processing speed and gauging the thickness of the batter until it’s a smooth and thick pancake-like batter.
Pour sauce over the top of your pizza, sprinkle with ground black pepper or red paprika, and bake your pizza in at 425 to 450 degree F. for 15 to 20 minutes (or until brown).
