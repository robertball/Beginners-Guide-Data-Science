Ingredients:
1 cup salted mixed nuts
4 sprigs fresh thyme
1 cup honey
1/2-3/4 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper (depending on taste)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Spread the nuts on baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes. This is to release some of the oils in the nuts.
Transfer warm nuts to a clean kitchen towel.  If using hazelnuts, fold the towel over and rub the nuts between the towel layers to remove any loose skins. Cool.
Rinse thyme sprigs well and pat with paper towels until completely dry.
In a small saucepan combine the honey, thyme, and black pepper, heating on low for 5 minutes, and stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and cool slightly.
Divide nuts between four clean 4-ounce jars and pour the honey mixture evenly between them.
Gently tap jars to remove air bubbles. Seal and refrigerate up to 1 month.
