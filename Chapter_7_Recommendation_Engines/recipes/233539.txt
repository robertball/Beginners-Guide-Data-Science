Ingredients:
Dough:
4 cups bread flour
1 1/3 cups warm water
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon oil, for greasing pan
1 teaspoon cornmeal, or as needed
1 (14 ounce) can vegan pizza sauce
1/2 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
1 green bell pepper, sliced
1 onion, sliced
20 kalamata olives, sliced
oregano, or to taste
crushed red pepper to taste (optional)
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as desired

Directions:
Mix bread flour, water, 3 tablespoons olive oil, yeast, and salt together in a large bowl; when the dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
Place dough in a large, lightly-oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for 2 hours.
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 14-inch pizza pans with 1 teaspoon oil; lightly dust each pan with cornmeal.
Divide dough in half and roll out into 2 thin rounds. Transfer each round to a prepared pizza pan.
Spread pizza sauce over dough; top with mushrooms, peppers, onions, olives, and oregano. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Bake pizzas in the preheated oven until crust is golden and sauce is bubbling, about 20 minutes. Garnish with crushed red pepper.
