Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (4 ounce) container crumbled feta cheese
2 ounces goat cheese
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup Greek yogurt
1/4 cup diced cucumber
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Mix ground beef, feta cheese, goat cheese, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, olive oil, oregano, and garlic together in a large bowl using your hands. Form meat into 4 patties.
Stir Greek yogurt, cucumber, and 3 tablespoons lemon juice together in a bowl.
Heat a frying pan over medium heat for about 2 minutes; cook burgers to desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Serve with yogurt sauce.

Description: 
I was craving some Greek food one night, but was also interested in a cheeseburger. I had some Mediterranean-esque ingredients in my fridge. Thankfully, the burgers came out AMAZING! Every person that has had the burgers though they were amazing, too. Enjoy! Serve with yogurt sauce, toasted hamburger buns, lettuce, and tomato. Try also with ground lamb.
