Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package low fat cream cheese
1 cup chunky salsa
1/2 to 1 cup onions, grated
1 small can green chilies
1 small can sliced olives
2 cups chopped cooked chicken breast meat
1 (15.5 ounce) can pinto beans, drained
(or refried beans)
Enchilada sauce (how much is your choice)
6-8 (6 inch) flour tortillas
3-4 green onions, sliced (for garnish)
2 cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the cream cheese and salsa. Cook, stirring until melted and well blended. Stir in green chilies, onion, olives, chicken and pinto beans. Or you can save the olives to put on top. Cover bottom of baking dish with enchilada sauce. Fill tortillas with the mixture, roll and place into the prepared baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce over the top. Spread cheese over the top. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until heated through. Garnish with green onions. You can add chopped tomatoes, or lettuce or sour cream, whatever you like.
