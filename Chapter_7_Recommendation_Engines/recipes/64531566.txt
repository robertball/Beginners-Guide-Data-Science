Ingredients:
4 Cups Shredded Hash Browns, thawed
4 Tbsp. Butter, melted
1 tsp. Salt
1 tsp. Pepper
8 Eggs
1 ½ Cups Shredded Cheddar Cheese
½ Cup Green Onion, Chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°.
In a large bowl combine the Hash browns, Butter, Salt and Pepper.
Spray a muffin tin with cooking spray. Fill the cups about ¾ of the way full with the Hash browns.
Press with your fingers to mold the Hash browns to the cups all the way to the top. Don’t worry if they stick out a little. Try to make the sides the same thickness all the way around for even cooking. Make sure there are Hash browns on the bottom of the cup.
Bake 20-25 minutes, or until they are starting to brown. Let cool slightly.
Reduce oven to 350°.
Take half of the Shredded Cheese and sprinkle in the bottom of the cups. Repeat with half of the Green Onion.
Whisk the eggs together and fill the cups until almost full.
Top with the second half of Cheese and Onion.
Bake until eggs are set, 20-25 minutes.
