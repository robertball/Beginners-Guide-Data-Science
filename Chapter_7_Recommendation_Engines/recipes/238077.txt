Ingredients:
vegetable oil for frying
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
3 ounces vanilla yogurt
1 egg
1 cup peeled and diced fresh peaches, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, and salt together in a bowl. Beat cream, vanilla yogurt, and egg together in a separate bowl until smooth. Pour flour mixture into cream mixture and mix until a sticky dough forms; fold in peaches.
Drop spoonfuls of the dough, working in batches, into the hot oil and fry until fritters are golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove fritters with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.

We had a case of lovely O'Henry peaches and a fryer with leftover oil. Put two and two together and created this warm variation on various fruit fritter recipes. Kids loved 'em!
