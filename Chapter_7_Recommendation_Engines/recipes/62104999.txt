Ingredients:
1 package crescent rolls
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons cinnamon
1 cup confectioner's sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
2-3 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Spread out the crescent roll dough on a silicon mat. Rip the dough along the dotted lines to give you four rectangles. With your fingers, work together the diagonal lines in the dough until they are gone. Mix the dark brown sugar and cinnamon together and spread out on the dough. Roll the dough, and cut each log into 1/2 inch thick slices. That's about four or five per log. Put the rolls onto a baking sheet close to one another and bake in a 350 degree oven for 10-13 minutes. While the rolls are in the oven, combine the confectioner's sugar, vanilla, and milk to make the icing. After you pull the rolls out of the oven, take them out, and place them on a dish. Let them cool for a minute and pour the icing on top of the rolls and enjoy!
