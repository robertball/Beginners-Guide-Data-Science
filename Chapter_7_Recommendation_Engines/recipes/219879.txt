2 cubes chicken bouillon
1 (48 ounce) jar navy beans, rinsed and drained
2 cups water

Directions:
Combine the chicken, green chilies, salsa, chicken bouillon, navy beans, and water in a slow cooker.
Cook on High until the chicken falls apart, about 4 hours.
Mash the chili with a potato masher to give a thicker texture, if desired.

Description: 
A long-time Wellington, Ohio friend shared this recipe with me and has become an all-time favorite. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and salsa. You can brown the chicken in a skillet first if you prefer. I have found it makes little difference.
