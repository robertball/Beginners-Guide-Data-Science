Ingredients:
1 c. Sugar
1 stick butter, softened
2 large or 3 small eggs
1 tsp. vanilla
2 c. self rising flour
7 to 8 baking apples, peeled cut in halves and sliced very thin
1/2 c. cinnamon and sugar, mixed

Directions:
Blend sugar with the softened butter (blend well). Add eggs, one at a time, and the vanilla; mix well. Gradually add the flour and mix well. The batter will be thick and "pulley". Grease a jelly roll pan or cookie sheet, 11x16 inches. Stretch the batter out into pan. Line apple slices up in rows close together, flat side down. Use up all the apple slices. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar mixture liberally. Bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 mins
