Ingredients:
8 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded
4 ounces cheddar cheese, shredded
3 eggs
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon basil, optional
Toppings and sauce of your choice

Directions:
Mix the cheeses, eggs, garlic powder and basil well. Line a 16 inch pizza pan with parchment paper or nonstick foil.
Evenly spread the cheese mixture in the pan, almost to the edge, making it as thin as possible.
Bake at 450º for 15-20 minutes until golden brown. I suggest checking it after about 10 minutes. If it's getting very dark on the edges and top, turn the oven down to 400º and continue baking until brown all over and no longer pale on the bottom.
Pat off any excess grease then add your toppings.
Keeping the oven rack in the center position, put the pizza under the broiler until the toppings are hot and any cheese you added is melted and bubbly, about 4-5 minutes.
You may want to sauté your mushrooms, peppers and other vegetable toppings before using, because the pizza will only be baked briefly with the toppings on. I also recommend pre-warming any meat toppings as well. I put all of my toppings, except the sauce and cheese, in a big skillet and heated them up together.
