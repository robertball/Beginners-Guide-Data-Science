Ingredients:
4 lb. rump or chuck roast (any inexpensive roast will work)
1 can beef broth
1 (10.5 oz) can condensed French onion soup  I used Campbells
1 (12 oz.) can or bottle of beer
French rolls
Butter

Directions:
Put raw roast in slow cooker and add broth, soup and beer.  Cook on low setting approx. 10 hours or until very tender.  Shred or slice meat – whichever you prefer.  (I like it shredded).  Split rolls and spread with butter.  Bake 10 min. or until heated through.  Put meat on rolls and serve the sauce for dipping.  (Cheese is good on sandwich too)
