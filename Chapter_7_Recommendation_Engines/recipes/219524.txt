Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 medium red pepper, cut into 2-inch-long strips
1 medium yellow pepper, cut into 2-inch-long strips
1 medium green pepper, cut into 2-inch-long strips
1 large onion, cut in half and thinly sliced
1 cup broccoli florets
1 (24 ounce) jar PregoÂ® Veggie Smart Chunky & Savory Italian Sauce

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 10 minutes or until well browned on both sides. Remove the chicken from the skillet.
Heat the remaining oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the peppers and onion and cook until the vegetables are tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Stir in the broccoli and cook for 2 minutes.
Stir in the sauce. Return the chicken to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Slice the chicken before serving.
