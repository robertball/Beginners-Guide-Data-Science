Ingredients:
1 small loaf of day-old French bread
5 eggs
3 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups milk
*************
1/4 cup flour
6 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 cup butter
***************
1 cup blueberries
1 cup sliced strawberries

Directions:
Lightly grease a 9/13 pan.  Cut the bread in 3/4-inch slices.  Layer in the the pan, fitting snuggly.  In a bowl, lightly beat the eggs, sugar and vanilla.  Stir in the milk.  Pour over the bread; turn bread slices over.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.
In the morning, pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees.  Combine the flour, brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.  Cut in the butter to make a crumb topping.  Remove pan from the fridge and carefully turn the bread pieces over.  Scatter the berries over the bread and top with the crumb mixture.  Bake at 375 for approximately 35-40 minutes.  It will come out a nice golden brown and very puffy!
