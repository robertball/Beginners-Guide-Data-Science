Ingredients:
4 cups fresh or frozen blueberries, thawed
3/4 cup sugar, divided
3 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons lemon juice

1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons grated lemon peel
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3 tablespoons cold butter
3/4 cup buttermilk

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the blueberries, 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, cinnamon and nutmeg. Transfer to a 2-qt. baking dish coated with cooking spray.
In a small bowl, combine the flour, lemon peel, baking powder, salt, baking soda and remaining sugar; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in buttermilk just until moistened. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto blueberry mixture.
Bake, uncovered, at 375° for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm. Yield: 8 servings.
