Ingredients:
3 (3 ounce) boxes Jell-O or generic store-brand gelatin (any colors)
3 cups water, divided
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
2 envelopes unflavored gelatin (Knox brand)
2 cups water, divided

Directions:
For each flavor, dissolve one box of jello in one cup of boiling water.  Pour into a container/tupperware and chill in the refridgerator for 2 hours or until firm.  After chilling the three flavors, cut them into small blocks.
Gently mix all colors in a 9x13 glass or ceramic pan. Set aside in the fridge until needed later.
In a separate bowl, sprinkle 2 envelopes unflavored gelatin into 1/2 cup cold water. After the gelatin blooms, add 1 1/2 cup boiling water and dissolve. Add the can of condensed milk. Stir and cool. Pour cooled milk mixture over jello and chill until firm.
