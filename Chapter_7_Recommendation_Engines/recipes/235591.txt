Ingredients:
Vegetable cooking spray
3 tablespoons plain dry bread crumbs
1 teaspoon butter, melted
1 (10.75 ounce) can  Campbell'sÂ® Condensed Cheddar Cheese Soup
2 tablespoons milk
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups rotini or medium shell-shaped pasta, cooked and drained
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray 8 (2 1/2-inch) muffin-pan cups with the cooking spray and lightly coat with 1 tablespoon bread crumbs. Stir the remaining bread crumbs and the butter in a small bowl.
Stir the soup, milk, black pepper, rotini and 3/4 cup cheese in a medium bowl. Spoon about 1/3 cup rotini mixture into each muffin-pan cup. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and bread crumb mixture.
Bake for 20 minutes or until the rotini mixture is hot and bubbling. Let stand for 10 minutes before removing the minis from the pan.
