Ingredients:
1- 1lb rib eye steak, grilled medium rare and chopped into bite-sized bits
(or broiled, if grill isn't available)
1- red bell pepper, chopped
1 cup chopped baby bella's
1 medium onion, chopped
2 tbs olive oil
salt to taste
pepper to taste
6 slices American cheese
1 loaf italian bread, unsliced

Directions:
In a pan heat olive oil and add onions and peppers. Cook until peppers are soft enough to stick your knife into without resistance. Add mushrooms and chopped, grilled rib eye. Add salt and pepper to taste. Turn heat to high and separate into four portions. Break up cheese slices and place equal amount on each portion. Fold cheese into portions until it is equally melted.
Prepare bread by cutting loaf into equal quarters. With your hands, gut the quarters leaving about 1/2 of bread adhered to the crust. In an oven, toast the quarters for 2 minutes. (Adding butter and fresh garlic to this adds a lot of great flavor.)
When toasted to your liking remove from the oven and fill each quarter with one of the portions in the pan.
