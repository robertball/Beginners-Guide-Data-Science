Description: 
This French toast is a great way to celebrate winter. The orange flavor stimulates the senses and adds comfort and warmth after a great morning of skiing. Serve with freshly squeezed or high calcium orange juice to get that extra boost, and top with pure maple syrup or a sprinkle of icing sugar.Modified from: Apres Ski French Toast
