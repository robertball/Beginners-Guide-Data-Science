Ingredients:
1 tsp. Granulated Sugar
1/4 Cup Whipping Cream
2 oz. Bittersweet Chocolate, broken into pieces
1 Cup Light Brown Sugar
1 Cup Light Corn Syrup
6 Tbsp. Unsalted Butter, Melted
2 tsp. Vanilla Extract
2 Tbsp. Bourbon (or Kahlua or Rum)
5 Eggs
1 Cup Pecan Pieces
1 9-inch Pie Shell, Unbaked

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a sauce pan over medium heat, heat cream and sugar, stirring until sugar dissolves
Turn heat to low and add chocolate, stirring until chocolate is just about melted. Turn off heat and stir until chocolate melts completely and then let cool for a few minutes.
Spread chocolate mixture in bottom of unbaked pie shell and freeze for about 15 minutes or until chocolate is set.
Remove the pie shell from the freezer and let return to room temperature.
Mix the brown sugar, syrup, bourbon and vanilla until smooth.
Add eggs, one at at time, blending well after each addition.
Beat in the butter.
Arrange pecans on bottom of the pie shell and carefully pour the filling over them.
Bake for 47-50 minutes or until set (it should still be jiggly).
Remove from oven and cool, then chill for at least 1 hour before serving.
