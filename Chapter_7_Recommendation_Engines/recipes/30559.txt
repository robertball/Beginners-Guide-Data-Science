Ingredients:
1 pound cube steak
salt and pepper to taste
all-purpose flour for dredging
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 medium onion, sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 green bell pepper, sliced
2 cups water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season the steak with salt and pepper to taste.  Dredge in the flour and shake off the excess.  Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat.  Brown the steaks in the oil, then transfer to a large, shallow casserole dish.  Sprinkle the garlic, onion, and green pepper over top, pour in water, and wrap with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven until steak is tender and vegetables are soft, about 1 1/2 hours.
