Ingredients:
100 grams raw wheat berries
4 cups water
1 tsp honey
1-3/4 cup reserved wheat berry water (110* - 120*F)
3 Tbsp active dry yeast
1/2 cup sugar
1 tsp malted barley syrup
1/4 cup or 60 grams of butter, melted and cooled
(3 cups stone ground whole wheat flour + 2 cups of white flour) or
(685 grams unbleached high gluten bread flour, min 12% protein)
1 handful of rye flour
50 grams of wheat bran
50 grams of wheat germ
100 grams of oats
100 grams of sunflower seeds
50 grams of pumpkin seeds (optional)
40 grams of amaranto
20 grams of sesame seeds
40 grams of flax seeds
1 Tbsp salt
Vegetable oil for oiling bowl
Vegetable spray for oiling the bread pans

Directions:
Place wheat berries in a sauce pan w/4 cups water.  Heat to boil then simmer for 1 hour.  Pour off excess water and reserve 1 cup of liquid for future use.  Allow wheat berries to cool and set aside.
Stir unbleached flour, rye flour, wheat gluten, salt, sugar and all other grains and seeds in a large bowl. Set aside.
Stir together reserved wheat berry water, yeast, and 1 teaspoon honey in a small bowl; let stand until foamy, 5 minutes.
Stir yeast mixture, melted butter, and malted barley syrup into cooled wheat berries.
Add wheat berry mixture to flour mixture, stirring until a soft dough forms.
Turn out onto a floured surface and knead adding enough addl unbleached flour to keep from sticking, until dough is smooth, soft, and elastic, about 10 minutes (dough will be slightly sticky). During kneading, periodically slam dough onto work surface to help develop the gluten.
Form dough into a ball and transfer to oiled large bowl, turning to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel; let rise at warm room temperature until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead several times to remove air.
Divide dough in half and shape each half into a loaf, then place 1 loaf in each oiled pan.
Cover loaf pans loosely with a kitchen towel and let dough rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375Â°F.  Bake until bread is golden and loaves sound hollow when tapped, 35 to 40 minutes.
Remove bread from pans and transfer to a rack to cool completely, about 1 1/2 hours.
