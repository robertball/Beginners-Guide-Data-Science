Ingredients:
4 sweet potatoes, scrubbed
1 tablespoon orange zest
2 teaspoons finely minced fresh ginger root
2 egg yolks
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup orange juice, or to taste
1/2 cup 2% low-fat milk
1/3 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place oven rack in middle position. Lightly grease a 1 1/2 quart baking dish, and set aside.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Pierce each sweet potato several times with a fork, and place on the prepared baking sheet.
Roast the sweet potatoes in preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
Remove sweet potatoes from the oven, and cool about 15 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
When sweet potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut in half, and scoop flesh into the bowl of a food processor. Discard potato skins. Add the orange zest, ginger; and egg yolks; process to make a smooth mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour in the orange juice and milk; if desired, add more orange juice to taste. Spoon sweet potato mixture into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle top with pecans.
Bake in preheated oven until heated through and pecans are toasted, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is my version of a traditional Thanksgiving favorite. I love sweet potatoes, but find I don't need any sweetener, so I substituted orange juice. You'll find yourself serving this casserole quite often! You can cut the prep time on serving day by cooking the sweet potatoes up to two days in advance; simply remove their skins and store in the fridge in an airtight container until needed.
