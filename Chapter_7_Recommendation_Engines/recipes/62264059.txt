Ingredients:
1 can of black beans
2 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne (optional)
Fried or baked chicken fingers from the supermarket deli
1 bag baby spinach

Directions:
Open beans and pour into a small saucepan.
Add water, garlic powder and cumin and cook over medium heat.  Cover and let simmer for about 5 minutes.
Mash about a tablespoon of beans against the side of the pan and stir.
If your family likes spicy beans, add cayenne pepper.
Reduce heat to low and cook for another 3 minutes.
While the beans simmer, place a small handful of spinach leaves (about 1 cup) on each plate.
Cut chicken finger crossways into 3-4 pieces and place about 3/4 cup on top of the spinach.
Spoon about 1/2 cup of beans and bean liquid over chicken.
If you like more sauce, add another tablespoon or two.
