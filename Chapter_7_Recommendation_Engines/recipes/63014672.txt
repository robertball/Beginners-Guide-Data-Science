Description: 
The only valid reasons for which I’ll make this dressing is for it to be a condiment on a Reuben Sandwich or slow cooked brats/butcher sausage. I am totally a fan of Reubens. This recipe is my own take and I call it my favorite over every Reuben I have had. For me, a Reuben must be made from a cooked at home corned beef brisket or real New York Style Pastrami. If either of these staples is not available, I will not consider making a Reuben. When it’s time to slice the corned beef I don’t let myself be sissified. I cut nice slices about 1/4 thick. I leave the fat on.
