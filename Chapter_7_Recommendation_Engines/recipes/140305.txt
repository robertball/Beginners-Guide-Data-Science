Ingredients:
1/4 (16 ounce) package saltine crackers, crushed
1 cup butter, melted
1 (16 ounce) package chocolate chips
1 cup walnuts, chopped

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil and set aside.
Place the crushed crackers in a bowl, pour the melted butter over them, and stir gently to coat the cracker pieces with butter. Spread the crackers out on the foil-lined baking sheet, and bake for about 10 minutes, until the crackers have started to brown.
Remove the sheet from the oven, and sprinkle the chocolate chips in an even layer over the hot crackers. Let the chips melt for about 1 minute, then spread the chocolate evenly over the crackers with a spatula. Sprinkle the walnuts on top.
Let the candy cool and harden for about 30 minutes, until the chocolate is set. Break the candy into pieces to serve.
