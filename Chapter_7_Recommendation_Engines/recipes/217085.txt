Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
6 large eggs, at room temperature
2 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups self-rising flour
1/8 teaspoon ground mace
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (1.5 fluid ounce) jigger Irish whiskey

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a tube pan.
Beat the butter and cream cheese with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the sugar until well blended. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the 2 tablespoons flour with the last egg.  Stir in the remaining 2 cups flour until just combined; stir in the mac, vanilla, and whiskey. Pour into the prepared tube pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
