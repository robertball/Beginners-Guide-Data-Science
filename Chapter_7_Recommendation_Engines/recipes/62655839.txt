Ingredients:
2 1/4 tsp yeast
1 cup warm water
2 Tbsp olive oil divided
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp each dried oregano, thyme and rosemary crushed
1/2 tsp. dried basil
dash pepper
2 to 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
2 plum tomatoes, thinly sliced
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 Tbsp grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.  Add 1 Tbsp oil, salt, sugar, garlic powder, herbs, pepper and 1 1/2 cups flour.  Beat until smooth.  Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (dough will be sticky)
Turn onto a floured surgace; knead until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled about an hour.
Punch down dough.  Cover and let rest for 10 min.  Shape into a 13" x 9" rectangle; place on a greased baking sheet.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 min. With fingertips, make several dimples over top of dough.
Brush dough with remaining oil; arrange tomatoes over the top. Sprinkle with cheeses.  Bake at 400 for 20-25 min or until golden brown.  Remove to a wire rack.
