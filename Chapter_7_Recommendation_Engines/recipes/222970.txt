Ingredients:
24 frozen dinner rolls

1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup light corn syrup

Directions:
Arrange dinner roll dough in a grease tube pan.
Heat butter and brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar is dissolved about 5 minutes; pour over rolls. Sprinkle with pecans and pudding mix. Mix white sugar and cinnamon in a bowl; sprinkle over pudding mix. Pour corn syrup evenly over cinnamon mixture. Cover tube pan with a sheet of greased aluminum foil and allow dough to rise overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Move rack to the lower half of the oven.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow bread to rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Invert pan onto a baking sheet or large plate to serve.

Description: 
This recipe is a big treat, and I often make it at our lake house when we takes guests there. Use the maximum amount of brown sugar listed and all of the pudding package for a sweeter dish. The corn syrup makes it gooey! Make sure you plan ahead - this recipe needs to sit overnight.
