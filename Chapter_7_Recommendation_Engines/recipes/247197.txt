Ingredients:
Shredded Beef:
1 pound beef chuck roast, cubed
1 cup beef broth
1 small onion, finely chopped
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons chili powder
3 cloves garlic, grated
2 teaspoons ground cumin
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Fry Bread:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
vegetable oil for frying
Pinto Beans:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix beef chuck, beef broth, onion, red wine vinegar, 2 tablespoons chili powder, garlic, 2 teaspoons cumin, salt, and black pepper together in a slow cooker.
Cook on High until beef is tender, about 4 hours. Transfer beef from slow cooker to a cutting board. Shred using 2 forks. Return shredded beef to the slow cooker. Cook on High until flavors combine, about 1 hour. Drain excess juice.
Combine flour, baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl. Pour in milk; mix until a dough forms.
Knead dough on a floured work surface until smooth, about 5 minutes. Let dough rest, about 5 minutes. Divide into 4 equal sections and roll out into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Poke a hole into the center of each with your finger.
Heat vegetable oil to a depth of 1 1/2 inches in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry each dough round until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a small pot. Add pinto beans, 1 tablespoon chili powder, 1 teaspoon cumin, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper; stir and mash until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Top fry bread with pinto bean mixture and shredded beef.
