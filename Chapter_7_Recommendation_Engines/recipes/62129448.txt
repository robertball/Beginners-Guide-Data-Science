Ingredients:
18.25 ounce Yellow cake mix following package directions
1 package strawberry gelatin
2 cups miniture marshmallows
2 - 10 ounce packages strawberries with liquid (thawed)
12 to 16 ounces Whipped Topping (I prefer whipping cream)

Directions:
Grease bottom only 9" x 13" pan
1. Put marshmallows in bottom of pan.
2. Mix cake mix following directions on the box. Pour carefully over the marshmallows. Set aside.
3. Mix the dry packet of gelatin with the strawberries (DO NOT ADD WATER).
Gently spoon the berry mixture over the cake batter.
Bake 350o for 40 to 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted 1/2 way to center of comes out clean. Cool, cut and turn each piece upside down with a serving of whip topping. This way the berries are on top. Store left overs in the refrigerator.
NOTE: Sometimes berries are more juicy than other times. That is why the large difference in baking time. I always start check my oven window after 35 minutes. You can sometimes see cake starting to pull away from sides which is also an indication that the cake is ready for the toothpick test.
