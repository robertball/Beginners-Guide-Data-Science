Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package ziti pasta
1 (15 ounce) jar Alfredo sauce
8 ounces sour cream
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix Alfredo sauce and sour cream together in a bowl. Add cooked pasta and stir until evenly coated.
Mix ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, and eggs together in another bowl. Pour 1/2 of the pasta mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread ricotta-egg mixture over the top. Cover with remaining pasta mixture. Sprinkle, or completely cover, with mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes.
