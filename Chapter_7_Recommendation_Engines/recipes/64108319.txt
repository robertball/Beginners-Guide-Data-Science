Ingredients:
½ cup butter, softened (or try 1/4 cup applesauce and butter)
½ cup brown sugar (I used ½ cup sugar with a squeeze of molasses)
½ cup white sugar (I used ½ cup zevia)
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
½ cup instant oatmeal (I used a packet – could probably have used more and no one would be able to tell)
1 ¾ cup white whole grain flour
¾ cup cocoa powder
1 tsp baking soda
½ tsp salt
2-3 cups shredded and chopped zucchini (I shredded in my food processor, then chopped it so that it is tiny pieces that the boys wont notice!
¼ tsp of instant espresso powder (kicks up the chocolate flavor)
1 cup chocolate chips (I actually did ¾ of dark and ¼ white because that is what I had – I loved the contrast and flavor, one boy did, the other did not)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Cream together Butter and sugars, add egg and vanilla.
Add oatmeal, flour, salt, & baking soda and mix until just combined.
Stir in zucchini, chocolate chips, and espresso powder.
Drop by teaspoons with a cookie scoop onto greased or parchment lined cookie sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes until just done.

Description: 
YUMMY zucchini cookies to use up the harvest. My kids ate a whole batch in 2 days. They turn out pretty cakey – kind of like a muffin top the next day. I plan on baking them up and then freezing 3 in snack size bags for the kids to take to school this fall for breakfast or lunch.
