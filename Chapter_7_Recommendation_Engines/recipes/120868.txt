Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
2 cups warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 teaspoons salt
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted
2 teaspoons garlic salt

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, cheese, sugar, oil, salt, cayenne and 2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Punch dough down. Turn onto a floured surface; divide in half. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Roll each into a 16-in. x 10-in. rectangle.  brush with butter; sprinkle with garlic salt. Cut into four 10-in. x 4-in. rectangles. Stack butter side up. Cut each stack into five 4-in. x 2-in. strips. Place five strips, cut side down, in a greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
I've been making this bread since my college days, when I shared an apartment with five home economics majors. My family likes this best fresh out of the oven, but it also freezes and reheats well.
