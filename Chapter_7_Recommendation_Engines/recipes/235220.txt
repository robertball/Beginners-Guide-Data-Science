Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup canned pumpkin
1/3 cup soy milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup molasses
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 18 muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper liners.
Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, cinnamon, ginger, baking soda, nutmeg, allspice, and salt together in a bowl; form a well in the center.
Stir brown sugar, pumpkin, soy milk, oil, molasses, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until well mixed. Pour brown sugar mixture into the well of the flour mixture and stir until batter is just combined; fold in chocolate chips. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Remove muffins from pan immediately and cool completely on a wire rack.
