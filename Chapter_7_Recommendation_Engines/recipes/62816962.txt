Description: 
Rochester NY has many versions of a hamburger based hot sauce used by many local burger/hot dog places...While no local establishment will share their secret recipes, this is as close as I can find to something similar

It is somewhat on the hot side.  My family LOVES it on mac salad as it is severed at many late night eateries.
