Ingredients:
1 cup of wild rice
6-8 pieces of chicken (I suggest not to use boneless chicken as it might come out dry)
3 cups of water
2-3 Tbsp of Sofrito (homemade is best)
1 Tbsp of Olive Oil
1/2 Tbsp of Vinegar
2 Tbsp of Tomato Sauce
1 packet of Sazon (I use *homemade* Sazon)
*1/8 tsp of Ground Cumin*
*1/8 tsp of Ground Coriander*
*1/8 tsp of Ground Oregano*
*1/8 tsp of Ground Annato (Achiote) or Turmeric*
1 Tbsp of Sea Salt (use more if you want)
1/8 tsp of Paprika

Directions:
Step 1: Simmer the Olive Oil, Vinegar, Sofrito, and Tomato Sauce for 1-2 minutes.
Step 2: Add the wild rice and sazon. Then stir it all together.
Step 3: Add the chicken and water, and bring to a boil.
Step 4: Then cook on low heat till the rice is done. Should take about an hour for the rice to cook.

Description: 
This dish is a version of  Arroz con Pollo just that the white rice has been replaced with wild rice. I like to serve this dish with an avocado, carrot, and red cabbage salad using olive oil or lime juice for dressing.
