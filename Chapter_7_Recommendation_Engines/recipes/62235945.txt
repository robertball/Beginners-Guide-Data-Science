Ingredients:
FILLING / TOPPING
2/3 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons of flour
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
-
LOAF OR MUFFINS: DRY
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
-
LOAF OR MUFFINS: WET
1 omega-3 egg, beaten
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon non-sweetened applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 cup cooking oil
1.5 cups finely shredded, peeled apple
1/2 cup diced, peeled apple
-
OPTIONAL
1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans, toasted (see footnote)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and grease the bottom and 1/2" up sides of a 8x4x2" bread pan, set aside.
In a small bowl, stir filling ingredients: brown sugar, flour and cinnamon. Cut in 2 tablespoons of butter or margarine until mixture resembles course crumbs. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, baking powder and nutmeg. Make a well in the centre of the mixture; set aside.
In another bowl, combine egg, sugars, vanilla, applesauce, apples and oil.  Add the wet mixture all at once to the well of the dry mixture. Stir until just moistened (batter will be lumpy; do not over mix). Fold in nuts, if desired.
Spoon half the loaf mixture into the bread pan. Spread a ribbon of filling mixture down the centre using 2/3 of the mixture.  Spoon the rest of the loaf into the loaf pan and top with the rest of the filling mixture. (Same process for muffins -- see footnotes).
Bake for 50 to 55 minutes or until a wooden stick/skewer or toothpick inserted near the centre comes out clean.  Cool in pan on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove from pan. Cool completely on wire rack. Wrap and store overnight before slicing.

Description: 
One of my favourite recipes for a ladies tea or lunch. Also a tasty breakfast treat or snack. I originallly developed this loaf recipe for my M.I.L.'s -- that's my Mother in Law's -- jewelry show.  A big hit and it disappeared fast!  Just don't tell them that it's a healthier variation of an old favourite. Can be made as a bread loaf or muffins.
