Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/2 cup milk
1/3 cup butter, melted
1/3 cup butter
4 tablespoons white sugar
4 tablespoons brown sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
In a medium mixing bowl, stir together flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, nutmeg and salt.  Make a well in the center of the mixture. Stir together egg, milk, vanilla and 1/3 cup melted butter.  Add egg mixture to flour mixture; stir until just moistened (batter may be lumpy).  Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer until creamy. Mix flour and cinnamon into creamed butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Top muffins with streusel and store remainder in an airtight container in the freezer until needed.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes until done. Serve warm.
