Ingredients:
Half a loaf of stale french bread
butter, or margarine
1/2 cup golden raisins
2 egg
2 cups warm milk
3/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Any stale (hard) unsliced bread is the best, but even regular sandwich bread will do.  Cut the bread into 1/2 inch slices.  Butter each slice of bread on one side.  Grease a large brownie pan.  Tear pieces off of the buttered bread and make one layer.  Sprinkle with 1/4 sugar evenly.  Sprinkle 1/3 of the raisins.  Repeat this twice to form 3 layers of bread, sugar, and raisins.  In separate bowl beat eggs.  Add warmed milk and mix well.  Pour mixture over the bread.  Let sit for 15-20 minutes so bread can soak.  Sprinkle with sugar right before putting in the oven.  Oven should be preheated to 350 degrees F.  Bake for about 30 mins or until golden and crunchy on top.  If you like it more moist add more milk and let soak longer.  Serve hot with a little cold milk in a bowl.
