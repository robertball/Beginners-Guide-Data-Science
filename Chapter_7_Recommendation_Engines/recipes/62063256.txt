Slowly add spinach liquid, then evaporated milk, celery salt, cheese and jalapeno.  Season with black pepper and add spinach.  Stir until completely blended.  Scoop into a buttered casserole dish.  Top with the bread crumbs.  Bake for about 45 minutes or until bubbly and bread crumbs are toasted.

I tossed this together last night and my husbands reaction was Wow.  How can you not submit a recipe that gets that kind of reaction?!  Use jalepenos to taste; seed if too hot.
