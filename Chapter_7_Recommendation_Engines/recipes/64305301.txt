Ingredients:
2 Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts, pounded thin
1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup Progresso Garlic & Herb Bread Crumbs
2 teaspoons 'Perfect Pinch' Roasted Garlic and Bell Pepper Seasoning
1 teaspoon freeze dried chives
3 Tablespoons butter
3 cloves of garlic, minced
1/2 cup Chicken Broth
1/4 can of Italian diced tomatoes, drained and finely chopped
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese blend
2 Tablespoons freeze dried (or fresh) basil
dash of fresh ground black pepper

Directions:
Place bread crumbs, Roasted Garlic and Bell Pepper Seasoning and freeze dried chives in a shallow bowl; mix thoroughly.
Place milk in a separate shallow bowl.
In a skillet, heat butter on medium heat. Meanwhile, pound chicken flat and thin for even cooking (if you haven't done so already).
Dip the chicken in the milk, then coat with crumb mixture.
Cook chicken in butter until browned and cooked through (about ten minutes). Remove and keep warm
In the same skillet, add garlic and saute for approximately 1 minute.
Add chicken broth and bring to a boil over medium heat. Stir occasionally to loosen browned parts from the pan.
Stir in cream and tomatoes; bring to a boil and stir for one minute.
Reduce heat to low; add Parmesan cheese, basil and a dash of pepper, stir sauce and cook until heated through and thickened. (about 5 minutes)
Serve by pouring the sauce over the chicken. For added flair, serve the chicken and sauce over cooked pasta.
