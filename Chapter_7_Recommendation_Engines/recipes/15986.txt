Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 egg
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, stir together the cake mix, egg and whipped topping until a dough forms. In a small bowl, stir together the cinnamon and sugar. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls and roll the balls in the cinnamon sugar mixture. Place on an unprepared cookie sheet about 1 to 2 inches apart.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies will be golden brown. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before removing to cool on wire racks.
