Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup unsalted butter - chilled, cut into tablespoon-size pieces
1/2 teaspoon salt
7 tablespoons ice water
1 tablespoon cider vinegar

Directions:
Combine flour, salt, and butter in a food processor. Pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 1-second pulses.
Stir water and vinegar in a small bowl.
Pour half the ice water and vinegar mixture into the flour and butter mixture. Pulse to combine, about 3 (1-second) pulses. Pour in remaining ice water and vinegar mixture. Pulse until mixture just starts to come together, about 8 (1-second) pulses.
Turn dough out onto a wooden surface, pat into round shape and divide in half. Form each half into a disc about 5 inches wide.
Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes until ready to use.

Description: 
This pie crust is my personal favorite and is made using a food processor, which makes cutting the butter into the flour very simple. By the way, you can make a double batch of this, and freeze the individually wrapped dough for future pie-related adventures.
