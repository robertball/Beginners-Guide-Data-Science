Ingredients:
Salad:
2 cups water
1 cup uncooked quinoa
1 Granny Smith apple, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 cup dried cranberries
Vinaigrette:
6 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon wine vinegar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 1/2 cups chopped kale leaves, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat, fluff using a fork, and allow to cool, about 1 hour.
Combine cooled quinoa, apple, bell pepper, and cranberries in a large mixing bowl.
Combine olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, black pepper, and Dijon mustard in a small bowl and whisk together. Pour vinaigrette over quinoa mixture and toss until all ingredients are coated.
Add chopped kale to the bowl with the quinoa mixture and toss in before serving.
