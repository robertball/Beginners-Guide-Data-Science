Hereâ€™s how to make Slow Cooker Pineapple Chicken:
Ingredients:
1 cup pineapple juice
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
3 tablespoons reduced sodium soy sauce
3 cloves garlic, minced
12 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
1 (20-ounce) can pineapple chunks, juices reserved*
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
Directions:
In a large bowl, combine pineapple juice, chicken broth, brown sugar, soy sauce and garlic.
Place chicken thighs into a 6-qt slow cooker. Stir in pineapple juice mixture. Top with pineapple chunks and reserved juices.
Cover and cook on low heat for 5-6 hours or high for 2-3 hours, basting every few hours.
In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup water and cornstarch. Stir in mixture into the slow cooker. Cover and cook on high heat for an additional 30 minutes, or until sauce is thickened.
OPTIONAL: Preheat oven to broil. Place chicken thighs onto a baking sheet, skin side up, and broil until crisp, about 3-4 minutes.
Serve chicken immediately, garnished with sesame seeds and parsley, if desired.
