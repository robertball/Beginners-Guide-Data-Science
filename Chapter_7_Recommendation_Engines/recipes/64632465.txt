Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 - 1 1/2 cups sugar
4 eggs
2 cups buttermilk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Dry Ingredients:
2 cups fine corn meal
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a 9x13 pan. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together melted butter and sugar until combined. Add eggs and mix well. Add buttermilk and vanilla and stir until combined.
3. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together all of the Dry Ingredients. Pour dry ingredients into buttermilk mixture and fold together then stir just until flour is all moistened (the batter will still be lumpy).
4. Pour batter into prepared pan and bake 25-30 minutes at 350 degrees F or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool 10 minutes before serving.
5. Store in an airtight container and reheat individual servings for 15 seconds or so (with or without a slab of butter!) Super good drizzled with honey!
Recipe Notes:
1 cup sugar for "sweet," 1 1/4 cups for "definitely sweet" and 1 1/2 cups for "cake-like sweet."
