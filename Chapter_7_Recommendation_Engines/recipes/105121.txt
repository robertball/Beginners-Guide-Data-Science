Ingredients:
12 ounces fresh or frozen sea scallops
16 cherry tomatoes
1 medium yellow summer squash, halved lengthwise and cut into 1/2-inch slices
3 tablespoons bottled sesame-ginger stir-fry sauce

Directions:
Thaw scallops, if frozen. Rinse scallops; pat dry with paper towels. Alternately thread scallops, tomatoes, and squash pieces onto 8 metal skewers.
For a charcoal grill, grill kabobs on the greased grill rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium coals for 5 to 8 minutes or until scallops turn opaque, turning once and brushing frequently with stir-fry sauce the last few minutes of grilling. (For a gas grill, preheat grill. Reduce heat to medium. Place kabobs on greased grill rack over heat. Cover and grill as above.)
