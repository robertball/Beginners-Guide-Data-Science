Ingredients:
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup peanut butter
1 tsp vanilla
1 3/4 cup flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup granulated sugar, plus about another 1/2 cup to roll the dough in when done
1 egg
2 tbls milk
1 bag Hershey's kisses

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Combine all ingredients except for kisses, blend together
make 48 equal sized dough balls
roll each in the extra 1/2 cup sugar
put on baking sheet, 1 dozen at a time
bake about 11 minutes
remove from sheet and put on cooling rack
top each cookie (after baking) with a Hershey's kiss
these cookies are best when warm and the chocolate on top is melting, can be thrown into the microwave for 25 seconds later to soften up cookie and remelt the chocolate somewhat
stores well for several days -- if they last that long in your house :)

Description: 
This is a great and easy recipe, everything is mixed together at once.
I got this from my mother who has had it since she was in high school, it is my favorite of this kind of recipe, I tried others of the same kind but I think this is the best.
