Ingredients:
½ small spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
⅓ cup peanut butter
2 tablespoons tamari
½ teaspoon agave syrup
¼ teaspoon sea salt
¼ teaspoon minced fresh ginger
¼ teaspoon minced garlic
½  lime, juiced
1 dash sriracha hot sauce (optional)
1 cup shredded cabbage
1 cup chopped broccoli
1 small cucumber, cut into matchstick-size pieces
1  carrot, shredded
2  scallions, minced
1 sprig fresh mint, thinly sliced
¼ cup roasted, salted peanuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place squash, cut-side down, on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until squash is tender, about 30 minutes. Cool until easily handled.
Combine peanut butter, tamari, agave syrup, sea salt, ginger, and garlic in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until sauce is smooth, about 1 minute. Stir lime juice and sriracha into sauce.
Shred squash into a large bowl using a fork or your fingers. Add cabbage, broccoli, cucumber, carrot, scallions, and mint; drizzle peanut sauce over mixture and toss to coat. Top salad with peanuts.
