Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) fillets tilapia
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
.5 tsp Old Bay or to taste

Directions:
Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season both sides of each fillet with Old Bay, salt and pepper. Place the flour in a shallow dish; gently press each fillet into the flour to coat and shake off the excess flour.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook the tilapia in the hot oil until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side. Brush the melted butter onto the tilapia in the last minute before removing from the skillet. Serve immediately.
