Ingredients:
2 soft over-ripened bananas
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/4 cup oat flour
1/4 cup oat bran
1 egg
2 teaspoons honey
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons canola oil
3/4 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients and beat until smooth. The bananas need to be over-ripe in order to be blended completely within the pancake batter, much like banana bread.
Cook pancakes on an oiled and pre-heated (375-400 degrees) pan or griddle. Turn the pancakes when bubbles begin to form on the top surface and the edges begin to dry and brown.
