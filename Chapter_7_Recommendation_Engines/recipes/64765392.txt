Ingredients:
1 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp freshly cracked ground black pepper
1/2 tsp dark brown sugar
1 tsp rubbed sage
1/4 tsp ground coriander
1/4 tsp ground ginger

Directions:
1. Mix all the seasonings together. Use immediately by mixing into 1 lbs of ground pork, or keep seasoning stored in a tightly sealed container until ready for use.
Note: You can also make a spicy variation by adding red pepper flakes to taste. To make mixing the seasoning into the ground pork a little easier, I like to add 1 tbsp of water into the meat alongside the seasonings, before mixing it all together--this ensures everything combines evenly.

Description: 
My husband makes some of the best breakfast sausage I've ever had, and he was gracious enough to share the seasoning recipe! He doesn't make it too sweet on purpose--because I usually drench the sausage patties with maple syrup anyway--so if you prefer a sweeter variation, you could always add more brown sugar to taste. This seasoning amount is enough for 1 lbs of ground pork.
