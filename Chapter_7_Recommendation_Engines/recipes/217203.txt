Ingredients:
9 lasagna noodles
3 cubes chicken bouillon
2 cups boiling water
1/2 cup butter
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups milk
6 ounces cream cheese, cubed
2 large carrots, finely chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups small curd cottage cheese, divided
1 large zucchini, cut into 1/8-inch thick rounds
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Fill a pot with salted water, bring to a boil, and place the lasagna noodles into the boiling water, one at a time. Stir gently to keep the noodles from sticking together; set heat to medium, and boil until the noodles are tender but still firm to the bite, 8 to 9 minutes. Drain in a colander set in the sink.
Dissolve the bouillon cubes in the boiling water, and set aside.
In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter, and cook and stir the onion and garlic until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat if necessary to keep the vegetables from burning. Whisk the flour and salt into the skillet, then whisk in chicken bouillon mixture and milk in small additions, whisking to create a smooth sauce. Stir the cream cheese into the sauce, mixing until the cream cheese melts and incorporates into the sauce. Stir in carrots, basil, and black pepper, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the sauce almost returns to a boil. Remove from heat.
Spread 1 cup of sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish, and top with 3 lasagna noodles. Spread 1 cup of cottage cheese over the noodles, then top with 1 more cup of sauce. Spread half of the sliced zucchini over the sauce, and sprinkle with 1/3 cup of Parmesan cheese and 2/3 cup of mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers twice more, ending with 3 lasagna noodles, final 1 cup of sauce, final 1/3 cup of Parmesan cheese, and final 2/3 cup of mozzarella cheese. Cover the dish with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbling, about 35 minutes; remove the foil, return to oven, and bake until cheese is golden brown, about 15 more minutes. Allow lasagna to stand 10 minutes before serving.
