Ingredients:
4 cups butternut squash - peeled, seeded, quartered, and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices
1 cup thinly sliced red onion
1 cup pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon Mazola® Corn Oil
1/2 teaspoon Spice Islands® Thyme
1/4 teaspoon Spice Islands® Fine Grind Black Pepper
4 cups thinly sliced kale
1 1/2 tablespoons grated Parmesan or Romano cheese
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped toasted pecans
Maple Dijon Vinaigrette:
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
1 1/2 teaspoons Mazola® Corn Oil
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon Spice Islands® Sea Salt
1/4 teaspoon Spice Islands® Fine Grind Black Pepper

Directions:
Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Toss squash, onion, maple syrup, oil, thyme and black pepper in a large bowl. Place evenly on large rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper; roast 30 minutes or until squash is tender and edges are starting to brown.
Place kale in the same large bowl. Toss with hot, cooked squash and onions and set aside. Whisk vinaigrette ingredients together. Drizzle over salad and toss to combine. Sprinkle with cheese and pecans; serve immediately.
