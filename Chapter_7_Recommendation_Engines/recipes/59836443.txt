Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
4 slices Swiss cheese
4 slices ham
1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
2 eggs
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)
Pound chicken breasts if they are too thick. Place a slice of cheese on top of the chicken breast and wrap a  ham slice around each breast.
In a shallow dish, beat the 2 eggs.  In another shallow dish combine the Italian bread crumbs and panko bread crumbs.  Coat the chicken breast in beaten eggs, then dredge in the bread crumbs, set aside on a plate and repeat the process with remaining breasts.
Heat half of the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Place two chicken breasts at a time into the pan.  Brown on both sides and place on baking sheet.  Repeat with the next two, and place into preheated oven to finish baking.  Approximately 10-15 minutes depending on the thickness of the chicken breast.

Description: 
This is an inside out version of cordon bleu.  The ham and cheese is wrapped around the outside of the chicken instead of inside, making this dish a bit less complicated to assemble yet equally satisfying. I removed the sauce from the original recipe, this dish is rich enough as it is and I prefer to serve it with a salad or fresh veggies to offset the richness of this dish.If you have leftovers they make a great sandwich!Modified from: Chicken Cordon Bleu II
