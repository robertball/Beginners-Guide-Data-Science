Ingredients:
12 ounces fresh cranberries
1 organic navel unpeeled orange, scrubbed and cut into 8 pieces
2 apples, peeled and cut into 8 pieces
1/4 to 1 cup natural sugar
1/3 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Wash the cranberries and remove any stems, bad cranberries, or inedible stuff you find.
Put half of the cranberries, orange (unpeeled), and apple into the food processor and pulse to chop coarsely. Some larger pieces are okay, but nothing big enough to choke on.
Pour into a bowl and process the other half of the fruit. Put it into the bowl, add the sugar to taste, and mix in the pecans.
Refrigerate it for a day or two to allow the flavors to develop.
