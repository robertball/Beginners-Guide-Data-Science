Ingredients:
6 medium yams, peeled and cut into 1 inch cubes
1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more for topping
1/4 cup sugar in the raw, plus more for topping
1 tsp. cinnamon
1/4 tsp. ground allspice
1/8 tsp. ground cardamom

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.  Put baking sheet in cold oven, then preheat oven to 425 degrees.
While oven preheats, toss yams with oil, sugar, cinnamon, allspice and cardamom in a large bowl.  Make sure all yams are evenly coated with oil/spice mixture.
Once oven is preheated, remove baking sheet and immediately pour yams onto baking sheet (yams should sizzle).
Place baking sheet back in oven and allow yams to cook until fork tender, about 20-25 minutes.
Remove baking sheet from oven and stir yams.  Drizzle with more oil and top with more sugar in the raw.
Change oven setting to broil.
Place baking sheet back in the oven and allow yams to cook a little longer until sugar begins to caramelize and yams begin to blister.
Remove from oven.  Allow to cool 5-10 minutes prior to serving.

Description: 
I created this side dish to be served with pork tenderloin.  The best part about these yams is the texture- slightly crisp on the outside and perfectly soft on the inside.  Be sure to use plenty of vegetable oil so the yams don't stick to your baking sheet.  Also- watch closely- you want the yams to blister but not burn.
