Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 cup blanched almond flour
1/4 cup coconut flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon low-calorie natural sweetener (such as SwerveÂ®)
1 tablespoon chia seeds (optional)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1/8 teaspoon salt
4 large eggs
1/3 cup milk, or more as needed
2 ounces cream cheese, softened in the microwave
1 teaspoon maple extract
1 tablespoon coconut oil, or as needed

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook, stirring frequently, until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool while preparing the batter.
Whisk almond flour, coconut flour, baking powder, sweetener, chia seeds, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Add browned butter, eggs, milk, softened cream cheese, and maple extract; mix until batter is no longer lumpy. Mix in more milk if batter is too thick.
Heat some coconut oil in the same skillet over medium-low heat. Drop spoonfuls of batter into the skillet, making 2-inch silver dollar pancakes. Cook until pancakes appear set, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until browned on the second side, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining coconut oil and batter.

Description: 
While this recipe is slightly more involved, it is full of flavor, keto-friendly and best of all, has a texture a lot like regular pancakes. Top with your choice of keto-approved syrup, keto whipped cream, and/or berries.
