Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package potato gnocchi
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 small onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
2 Cubanelle peppers, chopped
1 (32 fluid ounce) container vegetable broth
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
6 leaves fresh basil, chopped, or to taste
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain.
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and Cubanelle peppers; cook for 2 minutes. Pour in vegetable broth and tomatoes. Bring soup to a boil; simmer until peppers are tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir basil and red pepper flakes into the soup; season with salt and pepper. Add gnocchi and simmer until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Ladle soup into bowls and sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.

Description: 
This is my sister's soup recipe and I love it. I'll make a big pot and eat it all week long! It can be as spicy as you like and is delish. Tastes even better the next day after the flavors have had time to hang out.
