Ingredients:
cooking spray
6 eggs
1/4 cup milk
freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 pinches dried dill weed
11 frozen bite-size seasoned potato nuggets (such as Crispy CrownsÂ®), or to taste
1/2 cup chopped cooked corned beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch pie pan with cooking spray.
Whisk eggs and milk together in a bowl. Season with black pepper and dill.
Place potato nuggets in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until almost thawed, about 5 minutes. Add corned beef and onion; cook and stir until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool briefly, about 5 minutes.
Stir potato nugget mixture into egg mixture. Fold in Cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese. Pour into pie pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are firm and cheeses are melted, about 30 minutes.
