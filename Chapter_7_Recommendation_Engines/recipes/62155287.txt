Description: 
This recipe is perfect for anyone who is trying to stick to a low-carb diet, but still love mashed potatoes.  When done right, the cauliflower tastes just like real mashed potatoes and I love this recipe cause it's so simple to make and people usually don't know the difference unless I tell them.
