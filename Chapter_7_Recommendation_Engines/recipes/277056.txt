1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon oil
8 medium red-skinned potatoes, chopped
3 cups vegetable broth
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried sage
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup pumpkin puree

Directions:
Combine onion, garlic, and oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes, vegetable broth, thyme, sage, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Simmer until potatoes are fork-tender, about 8 minutes.
