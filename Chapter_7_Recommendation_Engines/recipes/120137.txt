Ingredients:
2 large russet potatoes
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
Dash pepper
2 tablespoons sliced green onion
2 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled

Directions:
Bake potatoes at 375 degrees F for 1 hour or until tender. When cool enough to handle, cut a thin slice off the top of each potato; scoop out pulp, leaving a thin shell. In a bowl, mash the pulp, egg, milk, mayonnaise, 1/2 cup of cheese, salt and pepper. Spoon into potato shells. Top with onion, bacon and remaining cheese.
Place in a small ungreased baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until heated through.

Description: 
This is a perfect recipe for two, but I also prepare it in large quantities for special occasions when we have dinner guests. One of these potatoes is practically a meal in itself. -Dolores Nemec, Garfield Heights, Ohio
