Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped almonds
2 cups Ghirardelli Milk Chocolate Chips
1 tablespoon solid vegetable shortening
1 cup cranberries

Directions:
Line a 9 by 13-inch baking pan with parchment paper. Set aside.
In a small skillet, toast the almonds over medium heat, stirring occasionally to promote even cooking, just until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.
In the top of a double boiler or in a heatproof bowl over barely simmering water, melt the chocolate chips and shortening, stirring until smooth. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/4 cup of the toasted nuts and 1/2 cup of the cranberries. Spread the mixture in the prepared pan, and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup nuts and 1/2 cup cranberries. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or until solid. Break into small pieces to serve.
