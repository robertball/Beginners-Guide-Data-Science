Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes, halved and cut into 4x1/2-inch wedges
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place sweet potato fries on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Spread out on pan in an even layer so that they aren't touching.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 minutes. Turn fries over; bake until crispy, about 10 minutes more.

I use this recipe about once a week. It's really easy since it just uses the oven to bake the sweet potato fries, and they are delicious!
