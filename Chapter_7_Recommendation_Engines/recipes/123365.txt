Description: 
What do folks eat at a ball game? Hot dogs, of course! For our baseball theme party, I jazzed them up with an easy homemade barbecue sauce and a tangy relish that's become a family tradition. I make up a supply when our garden's booming with zucchini. -Sue Gronholz, Columbus, Wisconsin
