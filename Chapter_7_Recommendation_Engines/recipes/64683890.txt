Description: 
This was a recipe that was passed down from my wife's grandmother. I doubled the broth in this recipe. The only alteration I made was to optionally add celery and other combinations of seafood to make this by my definition a seafood stew. If you like more broth for dipping that french bread into then if your using either fish base or clam base then mix up more to add.
