Ingredients:
1-12 oz can evaporated milk
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup sugar
4 large eggs, whole
1/3 cup cocoa powder
1 tsp vanilla extract
ice

Directions:
Beat eggs and cocoa powder in a mixing bowl for several minutes, working the sides with a spatula to remove powdery clumps.  Blend until smooth.
In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, add milk, evaporated milk, sugar and the egg/cocoa mixture and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a whisk.  Gradually bring the mixture to 180 degrees F, at which point the mixture will become thickened enough to coat a spoon.
Quickly remove the saucepan from the stove and place immediately in a sink containing several inches of ice and water to halt the cooking, still continuing to stir for a few minutes longer.  Stir in vanilla.
Once custard has reached at least 40 degrees F, place in an ice cream maker and follow the manufacturers directions.
Let ice cream chill in the freezer for several hours before serving.

Description: 
This is a pantry-friendly recipe for custard-style, chocolate ice cream.  No heavy cream or corn starch is necessary and is successful with 2% milk, yet the results are still creamy and smooth!  A digital kitchen thermometer is highly recommended while cooking to ensure you've reached the proper cooking temperature.
