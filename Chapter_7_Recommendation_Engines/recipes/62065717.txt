Ingredients:
2 cups water
1/2 cup cinnamon red hots
1/4 cup sugar
1 pkg. (6 oz.) cherry jello
2 cups peeled, diced apple
1 sm. can mandarin oranges, drained
1/2 c. coarsely chopped pecans or walnuts

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine water, red hots, and sugar; boil till sugar is melted and red hots have dissolved.
Stir in 1-1/2 cups cold water; chill until jello is very thick but not set.
Meanwhile, spread orange segments on paper toweling to absorb excess juice.
When jello is thickened, stir in apples, well-drained oranges, and nuts. Pour into a 6-cup mold or cut glass bowl and chill till firm.
