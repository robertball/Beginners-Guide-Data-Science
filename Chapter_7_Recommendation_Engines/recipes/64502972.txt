Ingredients:
2 TBS Vegetable Oil
4 Fillets (Halibut, Cod or similar), 6 oz each
1/ 4 cup Flour
3 TBS Butter
2 sprigs of Thyme
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
Sauce:
1/2 cup white wine
1/2 cup fresh orange juice (plus 1 strip of peel)
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (plus 1 strip of peel)
1 Shallot (peeled and thinly sliced)
2 sprigs thyme
1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
2 sticks cold butter (cubed)

Directions:
FISH:
1.  In a nonstick saute pan, add the vegetable oil (and a little butter).  Place over medium heat.
2.  In a baking dish, sprinkle salt over both sides of the fillets, then dredge in the flour.  Shake off any excess flour, then add to the saute pan.
3.  Cook until golden (about 4-5 minutes), then flip and cook another 4-5 minutes until golden and the flesh is opaque.
SAUCE:
1.  In a small pot add the wine, orange juice & peel, lemon juice and peel, shallot, thyme and peppercorns.  Heat over medium-high heat and bring to a boil.
2.  Stirring frequently, boil until the liquid is reduced to about 1 tablespoon remaining (about 15 minutes).
3.  Lower the heat to medium, reduce another half, about 2 minutes.
4.  Strain to separate the liquid from all else.  Put the liquid back into the pot.
5.  Over low-medium heat, add a few cubes of butter at a time, whisking until all added.
