Ingredients:
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon oregano
3 eggs
1 1/2 tablespoon water
1 cup flour
1 cup panko/ bread crumbs
5 tablespoons butter at room temperature
4 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves of garlic, minced
1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup dry white wine
Juice of 1 lemon - no seeds
Lemon thinly sliced - no seeds
1/2 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoons drained capers
3 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley
Parmesan shavings

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Place a small cookie sheet into the oven to warm
Pat chicken dry with paper towels & cut each breast in half horizontally to form 2 thin pieces. Place chicken between 2 sheets of parchment paper & pound out to 3/8-inch thick. Cut each piece twice making 3 strips per piece. Sprinkle both sides with dash of salt & pepper
Mix flour, salt, pepper & oregano on plate. In a bowl beat egg & water. Place bread crumbs on another plate. Dredge chicken in the flour shaking off the excess. Dip in egg then coat with breadcrumbs
Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry chicken breasts until golden brown on both sides; about 3 minutes per side.* Do not crowd pieces. Place chicken on cookie sheet with a dash of salt. If needed, add another mix of butter/oil and repeat with the remaining chicken
Remove heat. Dab the pan and soak up half of the oil. Leave a small coating on the bottom
Add garlic and saut√© for about 20 seconds over medium heat
Pour in the chicken broth and wine and squeeze in the juice of the lemon.  Scrape & dissolve any brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Bring the mixture to a boil. Allow the sauce to cook and thicken until reduced by about half. Add in a little salt and pepper as it's cooking. **
Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the cream. Add the capers and lemon slices then cook for about 5 minutes until the sauce thickens ***
Drop the last tablespoon of butter into the skillet and swirl it into the sauce by tilting the skillet until the butter is melted and incorporated. Add the parsley; remove from heat and set aside ****
Pull out the chicken and arrange on plates or over pasta. Pour the lemon sauce over the chicken
