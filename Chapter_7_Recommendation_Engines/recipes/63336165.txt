Ingredients:
1 Can Biscuits (flaky kind, grands do well)
1 Pkg Bacon, cooked, chopped (Sausage or ham will work just as well)
6 eggs
Grated/Shredded cheese (any flavor)
Salt & Pepper (to taste)
*optional toppings*
Mushrooms
Onions

Directions:
Preheat oven according to biscuit directions. Pull one biscuit apart into two, lay into muffin tin, mold into cup.
In a bowl, mix together eggs until all blended, add splash of milk for fluffy-ness. Fill each muffin halfway with egg (it will grow when baking), fill rest with toppings, meats & cheese.
Bake until golden brown, and center is no longer "gooey". Allow to cool, munch on.
