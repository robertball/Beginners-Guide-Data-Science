1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2 In a small bowl mix the soup, enchilada sauce and sour cream; set aside.
3 Saute chicken in a medium saucepan over medium high heat until no longer pink. Add Rotel, cumin and chili powder.  Saute until tender enough to shred and liquid reduces. Stir in chile peppers, and 2 tablespoons of the soup mixture. Cook and stir until heated through.
4 Spread 1/2 cup of the soup mixture in a 9x13 inch
baking dish. Spoon about 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla, sprinkle some cheese. Roll up tortillas, and place, seam-side-down, in the baking dish. Spoon remaining soup mixture on top, and sprinkle with remaining cheese.
5 Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until bubbly and lightly browned.
