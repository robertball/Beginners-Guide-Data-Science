Ingredients:
1/8 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
6 ounces boneless pork loin, cut into 1/4 inch cubes
1/2 teaspoon fennel seed, crushed
1 1/2 teaspoons canola oil, divided
2 cups broccoli florets
1 celery rib with leaves, sliced
1/2 cup shredded carrot
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1 1/2 cups cold cooked brown rice
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce

Directions:
Sprinkle five-spice powder over pork and toss to coat. In a large nonstick skillet or wok coated with nonstick cooking spray, stir-fry pork for 3 minutes or until brown. Remove and keep warm. Stir-fry fennel seed in 3/4 teaspoon oil for 30 seconds. Add the broccoli, celery, carrot and onions; stir-fry for 3 minutes or until crisp-tender. Remove and keep warm.
Stir-fry the rice in remaining oil for 2 minutes. Stir in soy sauce and pepper. Return pork and vegetables to the pan; cook and stir until heated through.
