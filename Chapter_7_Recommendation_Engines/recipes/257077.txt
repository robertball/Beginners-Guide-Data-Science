Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) sweet potato
1/4 cup water
1 orange - peeled, segmented, and seeded
1 tablespoon raisins
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon honey
1 pinch salt
4 walnut halves, chopped

Directions:
Place sweet potato into a microwave steamer with a rack; add water. Cook in the microwave until sweet potato is soft but not mushy, about 8 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes.
Peel cooled sweet potato and cut into 1/2-inch cubes.
Cut each orange segment into 3 pieces. Place sweet potato and orange pieces in a bowl; add raisins.
Mix lemon juice and honey together in a bowl; pour over potato-orange mixture. Add a pinch of salt and sprinkle walnuts over salad.

Description: 
My daughter and I found this recipe several years ago, and since then it has become a regular on our Christmas menu.
 Strangely, this dish appeals especially to women. Women always return for seconds and request the recipe, while men may politely try a bite or two. 
We serve it mainly with chicken or turkey. With an apple or banana on the side, it also makes a filling and nutritious packed lunch. Somehow the sweet potato sticks by you so that you're not reaching for a snack at mid-afternoon.
