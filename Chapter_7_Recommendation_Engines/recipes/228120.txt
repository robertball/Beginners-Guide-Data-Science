Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup biscuit baking mix
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons ground nutmeg
2 teaspoons ground cloves
2 teaspoons ground ginger
3 tablespoons butter, cubed
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
2 eggs
1 (15 ounce) can solid pack pumpkin puree
1/4 cup applesauce
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Lightly grease a small (1-quart) slow cooker.
Combine brown sugar, baking mix, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger in a food processor. Pulse 3 to 4 times to mix. Add butter, evaporated milk, and eggs, and pulse until combined, 5 to 6 pulses. Pour in pumpkin puree, applesauce, and vanilla extract and process until smooth, about 30 seconds.
Pour the pumpkin mixture into the prepared slow cooker. Heat on Low until very thick, about 4 hours.

Description: 
This is a thick pudding so don't expect a traditional box pudding texture. My children aren't crazy about pie crust so this is perfect for them. It is REALLY good! Serve warm or cold with whipped cream.
