Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 cups butter, softened
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 (3.4 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix
4 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 cups semisweet chocolate chips
2 cups white chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
sprinkles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift together the flour and baking soda, set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar. Beat in the instant pudding mix until blended. Stir in the eggs and vanilla. Blend in the flour mixture. Finally, stir in the chocolate chips, 1 cup white chocolate chips, and nuts. Drop cookies by rounded spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Edges should be golden brown.
Allow cookies to cool. Melt one cup white chocolate chips and spread over cooled cookies. Add sprinkles to top.

Description: 
My kids love this recipe since it is so moist with the pudding. I love to frost it with melted chocolate and add some sprinkles to make them more exciting than plain chocolate chip cookies for my kids.Modified from: Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies
