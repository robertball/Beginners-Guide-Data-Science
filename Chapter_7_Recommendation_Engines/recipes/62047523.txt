Description: 
This is a simple recipe that just tastes great. No fancy ingredients needed to make this the best basic potato soup you will ever taste. Everyone that has tried this soup has liked it. The key is in slicing the potatos real thin. The juices of the potato get extracted into the soup. Thank you mom!
