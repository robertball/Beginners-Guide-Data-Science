Ingredients:
2 cups yellow cornmeal
1 (9oz) package yellow cake mix
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs, beaten
2 Tablespoons light brown sugar
2 Tablespoons honey
1 Tablespoon miracle whip light

Directions:
In a large bowl whisk together cornmeal, cake mix, baking powder, salt & cayenne pepper, set aside. In a medium sized bowl, stir together milk, buttermilk, oil, eggs, brown sugar, and honey. Add the milk mixture to the cornmeal mixture and stir gently to combine, taking care to not over mix. Fold in miracle whip. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Place your muffin liners in the muffin tin. Spoon batter into the liners filling approximately 2/3 full.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean.
Note:
You can add a can of whole kernel corn, drained when you add in the miracle whip, if desired.
