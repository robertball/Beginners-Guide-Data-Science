Ingredients:
2 cups whole milk
1 quart chicken stock
2 tablespoons butter
3 1/4 cups dry polenta
3 ounces Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste
1 quart vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
In a large saucepan, combine milk, chicken stock, and butter; bring to rolling boil. Slowly whisk in polenta. Turn down heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until polenta pulls from edge of pan. Mix in cheese and parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Spread polenta evenly over a cookie sheet, and refrigerate until cold.
Transfer polenta to cutting board and cut into cut 3/4 by 3/4 by 3 1/2 inch sticks.
Heat oil in deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Fry polenta sticks in batches until crispy. Place on dry paper towels to drain.
