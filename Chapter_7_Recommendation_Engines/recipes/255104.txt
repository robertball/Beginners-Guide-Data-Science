Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 pounds fingerling potatoes, halved lengthwise
2 cups sliced mixed wild mushrooms (small portobella, crimini, shiitake)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 large shallot, thinly sliced
1 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup dried mixed wild mushrooms
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
3/4 teaspoon herbes de Provence
1/2 cup creme fraiche or heavy cream
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
Chopped fresh thyme

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add potatoes; cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or until potatoes are tender. (Tenting with foil will speed up cooking.)
Stir in fresh mushrooms, garlic and shallot; cook for 10 minutes more. Add broth, dried mushrooms, mustard and herbs; cook over high heat for 5 minutes or until most of the broth has cooked off. Stir in creme fraiche and cook for 5 minutes more. Season with pepper and fresh thyme.
