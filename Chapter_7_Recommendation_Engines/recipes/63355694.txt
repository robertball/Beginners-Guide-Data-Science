Ingredients:
1 Tsp Salt
2 Cups Macaroni (I like the "salad noodles" but you can use elbow)
1 can Small Shrimp, drained
1-2 Sweet Pickles, diced
2 Cups Mayonaise
Dash of Garlic Salt

Directions:
Cook 2 cups salad maccoroni in boiling salted water (1 tsp. Salt), when tender drain and rinse in cold water.  Drain thoroughly.
Put noodles into large bowl and add 1 can broken small shrimp, drained.  Chop 1 or 2 sweet pickles and add to bowl.
Moisten noodle mix with mayonnaise and stir together (the noodles will absorb a lot of the mayonnaise so check it about 10 minutes later and you may need to add more) and a dash of garlic salt to taste.
Put mixture in the refrigerator until cold, at least 30 minutes. Serve cold.
