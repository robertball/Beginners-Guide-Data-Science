Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package penne pasta
2 tablespoons butter
1  shallot, minced
1 cup sliced baby portabella mushrooms
1 cup bite-sized pieces fresh asparagus
¼ cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup Marsala wine
1 (3 pound) rotisserie chicken, bones removed and meat cut into bite-size pieces
3 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon softened butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook penne pasta at a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir shallot in melted butter until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir mushrooms, asparagus, and sun-dried tomatoes into shallot and butter mixture; cook and stir until asparagus begins to soften, about 10 minutes more.
Pour chicken broth and Marsala wine into the skillet; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and stir chicken and cream into mixture.
Mix softened butter and flour into a paste in a bowl; stir into chicken mixture. Cook, stirring continually, until the flour is cooked and the liquid thickens, 1 to 2 minutes; ladle over the cooked penne pasta and top with Parmesan cheese to serve.

Description: 
I use a deli-roasted chicken from our local grocery store to speed up prep time on this dish. You can change the vegetables to suit your tastes. Serve with a loaf of crusty french bread and a glass of wine.
