Description: 
I found this recipe calling for only apples or peaches, but found it worked wonderfully with any fruit you have available.  Please experiment! If using primarily apples, try a bit of shredded cheddar cheese, sprinkled on top of crumble topping the last 10 minutes of baking.  Tastes wonderful with vanilla ice cream.
