Description: 
This recipe is from my mom, and the best bearnaise I ever tasted. Although it is a fattening treat, it is worth every calorie! Best served over a good steak and really good on asparagus too! Or can be used instead of hollandaise on eggs Benedict. To keep warm, keep it in double boiler over hot water (removed from heat) until ready to serve.
