Ingredients:
1-2 tablespoons of any type of jelly
1 tablespoon of natural creamy or chunky peanut butter
2 slices of your favorite bread

Directions:
1. Lay one slice of bread on a serving plate, and layer on the tablespoon of peanut butter. If there is not enough to cover the slice, or if more is desired, carefully add more. Be careful not to overflow the sandwich, as the contents may seep out of the sides.
2. Lay the other slice next to the slice with peanut butter and layer on the jelly of your choice. To evenly spread the jelly,it helps to mix it well in the jar. Jam is sometimes easier to spread.
3. Combine the slices of bread as neatly and as quickly as possible. If desired, cut.
4. Enjoy!
