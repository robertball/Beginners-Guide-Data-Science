Ingredients:
1 pound small Brussels sprouts, rinsed
2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 pound thinly sliced prosciutto
coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.
Slice the Brussels sprouts in half, lengthwise. Don't trim the ends, as they'll hold together better with them.
Toss the sprouts on a rimmed baking baking sheet with the oil and a good sprinkle of salt and pepper.
Bake for 25 minutes, shake around on pan, continue baking for 15 minutes more.
While the sprouts are cooking, chop up the prosciutto into small chunks. Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high. Add the prosciutto and saute for about 5 minutes, until nice and crispy. Set aside.
Remove the sprouts from the oven and let them cool about 5 minutes.
Assemble the poppers using toothpicks. Slide on a sprout half, followed by several slices of prosciutto, then finish with another sprout half.
Arrange on a platter and serve immediately.

These are amazing little appetizers. I make them for tailgating, cocktail parties, or sometimes just as a snack for my daughter and her friends for a sleepover. They are yummy!
