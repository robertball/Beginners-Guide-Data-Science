2 teaspoons ground black pepper
For Service:
6 ounces Burrata cheese
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:

Ladle 1 cup cold Bloody Mary base into each serving bowl. Dollop 2 ounces Burrata cheese into the center. Season with black pepper and drizzle in olive oil.

Description: 
I don't think there's a difference between a liquid salad and a cold vegetable soup, but if there is, let's consider this Bloody Mary Burrata the former. It turns out that when you swap out the vodka for a dollop of Burrata cheese, Bloody Marys make a great gazpacho. Garnish with sliced olives, more cherry tomatoes, celery, and horseradish. For a larger serving, pair it with a crusty hunk of bread as a brunch item.
