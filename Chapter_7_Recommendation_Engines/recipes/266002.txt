Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white vinegar
1 1/2 cups water
3 large serrano peppers
4 large jalapeno peppers
2 medium tomatoes, chopped
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Inspect 4 half-pint jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water until sauce is ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water.
Combine vinegar, water, serrano peppers, jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook sauce for 50 minutes.
Run sauce through a tomato mill or a fine-mesh sieve 3 times.
Pack sauce into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe rims with a moist paper towel to remove any spills. Top with lids and screw rings on tightly.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes.
Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 24 hours. Press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down. Remove the rings for storage and store in a cool, dark area.

Description: 
A very flavorful homemade hot sauce, unlike most in the stores. It also has a nice burn to it.
