1/2 onion, thinly sliced
1 carrot, grated
1/2 (4.5 ounce) can mushroom pieces, drained

Remove udon noodles from outer bag. Pierce inner pouch several times and place on a microwave-safe plate. Cook in the microwave until tender, about 90 seconds.

Mix rice vinegar, soy sauce, olive oil, sesame oil, sugar, ginger, garlic, lime juice, white wine, sriracha sauce, and red pepper flakes together in a small bowl until sugar dissolves.
