Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups Confectioners (powdered) sugar
2 1/2 Tablespoons milk
1 Tablespoon butter
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract (optional)

Directions:
Place milk and butter in a double boiler and cook on medium heat until butter melts. Do not allow to boil. Lower cooking temperature to warm and add remaining ingredients. Mix until creamy. Continue to keep the mixture warm while spreading as the glaze will harden as it cools.
Add some flair by using 2 tsp lemon extract mixed with other ingredients for a lemony glaze.
