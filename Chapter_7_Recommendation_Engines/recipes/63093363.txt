1 tbs. extra virgin olive oil
1 large or 2 small onions
4 garlic cloves (or less)
1/2 tsp. oregano
1/2 tsp. basil
1/2 tsp. cumin
1/2 tsp. turmeric
1/2 tsp. sea salt (never use table salt)
1/4 tsp. fresh ground pepper

(or fresh if you prefer)
1 8 0z. pkg. cream cheese
1 8 oz. pkg. feta cheese
1 pie shell (non-lard)or make your own
Parmesan cheese to sprinkle on top

Directions:
Saute onions and garlic in oil over low heat until translucent, add herbs, pepper and salt and continue cooking another 5-10 minutes. Put in a large mixing bowl. Cook spinach for 2-3 minutes; drain off excess liquid and place in bowl with onion mix. Break up the feta and add it along with the cream cheese to the spinach onion mix. Blend everything in the bowl with a fork or spoon.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cook the pie shell alone for just ten minutes, pricking the bottom to let the steam out. Then put the spinach filling into the pie shell, sprinkle with parmesan cheese and cook for about 45-50 minutes.
