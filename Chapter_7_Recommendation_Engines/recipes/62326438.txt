Ingredients:
- Lemons; 4, small
- Butter; 50 gms (2 oz),  softened
- Cream cheese; 100 gms (4 oz)
- Sardines from a can; 125 gms (4 1/2 oz), drained (they can be either canned in oil or in brine)
- Black pepper; a good few grinds of the pepper mill
- Some salt
- Fresh Bay Leaves; 4 (for garnish)

Directions:
The lemons will be served standing up, so slice a flat piece of the base off each to give stability. Then slice a lid (or a "hat") off the top, thick enough to expose the flesh inside, without having too much flesh in the lid.
Scoop out the flesh from the bodies of the lemons with a grapefruit spoon and drop into a sieve over a small bowl. With a little pressure, harvest the juice and discard the fleshy remnants.
In a food processor, drop the butter, cheese and sardines and then add some of the lemon juice and add a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.
Using several (brief) bursts, and scraping the sides down regularly, whizz often, adding more lemon juice as required. We wish to end up with a  well-mixed, but not too smooth paste. Season to taste with salt and maybe some more black pepper. (There is nothing to stop you adding some chilliness, either!).
To serve, spoon the mixture into the lemon shells, and then you can place a bay leaf so that most of it hangs outside and hold that in place with the lemon "hats" (but see also Footnotes).

Description: 
A really smart first course - certainly different, but always popular. The lemons are a very handy way to avoid washing-up!
