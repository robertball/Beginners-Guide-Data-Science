Ingredients:
swai fish
Macaroni And Cheese
3 tablespoons uncooked macaroni pasta
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch pepper
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 cup milk
1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/8 teaspoon ground mustard
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
1 dash chipotle sauce
1 teaspoon panko bread crumbs
1 tablespoon shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Put It In A Hot Pan With Olive Oil And Pan Sear For 5 Mins On Each Side.
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease an oven-proof soup crock or 1 cup baking dish.
2. Fill a small saucepan with water, and bring to a boil. Stir in the macaroni; boil until cooked but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well, and reserve.
3. In the same saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Stir in the flour, salt, pepper, onion powder, and milk; whisk until smooth. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and whisk in 1/3 cup cheese, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and chipotle sauce. Stir in the cooked macaroni. Spoon the macaroni and cheese into the prepared dish. Sprinkle with panko bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon cheddar cheese.
4. Bake, uncovered, until the cheese is melted and the macaroni is heated through, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
swai fish is in the catfish family, and comes from Vietnam. It is a mild white fish and does not have a catfish flavor. I actually found it in wal-mart, and figured I would give it a try. I don't like catfish at all, but loved this fish.
