Ingredients:
For the hollandaise sauce:
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
6 large egg yolks
1/2 cup boiling water
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
Pinch cayenne pepper
Pinch white pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
For the Eggs Benedict:
2 English muffins, toasted***Someday I will get around to making my own, I promise
2 eggs, poached**For tips on how to poach an egg, see THIS post
1 large tomato (or two medium ones), slice to your desired thickness
4 ounces (about half one 8-ounce mozzarella ball), sliced to your desired thickness**I used 2 slices on each one.
1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, lightly packed
Salt and pepper, to taste
Chives, for garnish, optional
Special equipment: Instant-read thermometer

Directions:
1. For the hollandaise sauce: In a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water set on medium heat, whisk the butter and egg yolks together until smooth.
2. Veryâ€¦very slowly, add the 1/2 cup boiling water to the mixture, whisking constantly.  (You do not want the eggs to cook).
3. Whisking constantly, heat the mixture until it is thickened and reads 160 degrees on your instant-read thermometer.  (It took mine about 10 minutes or so).
4. Remove the saucepan from the heat.
5. Gently whisk in the lemon juice, cayenne pepper, white pepper, garlic salt, and sea salt.  Serve warm.
6.  To assemble the Eggs Benedict: Place the fresh basil on top of the toasted English muffin.  Top with tomatoes, mozzarella, and poached egg.  Lightly drizzle the hollandaise sauce over top.  Garnish with fresh chives, if using.
