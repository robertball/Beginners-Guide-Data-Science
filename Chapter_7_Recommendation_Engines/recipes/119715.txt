Description: 
'This hearty stew is oh-so-tasty, with a good variety of vegetables and spicy seasoning blend,' writes Betty Jean Howard of Prineville, Oregon. 'My husband and I enjoy if often. It's the perfect way to warm up a cool evening. Sometimes, I add a can of chopped green chilies for a little more heat.'
