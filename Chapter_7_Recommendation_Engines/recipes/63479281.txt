Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1/2 digestive biscuits package
3/4 tea biscuits package
1 1/2 sticks of softened butter
2 cups low fat yogurt
1 cup powder milk
1 cup white sugar
1 can of Mother's Maid strawberry pie filling

Directions:
Crush the biscuits into tiny crumbles.
In a bowl, mix the crumbles with the butter, and rub mixture with your hands until all is mixed well.
In a 10 inch pan spread the biscuit-butter mixture. Then press and flatten until the bottom of the pan is covered well.
Refrigerate pan for 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, mix yogurt, sugar, and milk powder in a blender.
Take out the pan and pour the white mixture carefully, and slowly above the biscuit layer. You may want to use a spoon, place it near the biscuit layer and pour the mixture over it to avoid the biscuit layer from getting damaged.
Bake the pan in oven for exactly 10 min. at 320 degrees.
Take out the pan, and allow to cool at room temperature for 5 min. then refrigerate for 20 min. or more(The white mixture will still be liquid-like, but it will be more solid as it cools down.)
Take out the pan and spread the strawberry topping very carefully.

Description: 
Cheese cakes usually tend to be very fatty, and heavy to the taste, but this is a recipe my mom always used to prepare a very light tasting cheese cake that can be served along with some fresh strawberries on the side. It's just crazy how many of our guests keep on asking us for the recipe!
