Ingredients:
1/4 lb. ham
1/4 lb. bologna
1/4 lb. pepperoni
1/4 lb. provolone cheese
1/4 lb. american cheese
1/4 head lettuce
1 small onion, chopped
2 tomatoes, chopped
3 Tbsp. Hellman's mayonnaise
1 Tbsp. oregano

Directions:
Using a food chopper if possible, chop meats, cheeses and onion and mix together in a bowl.  Finely chop lettuce and tomato and add along with oregano.  Mix in mayonnaise.  It may not seem like enough mayonnaise, but it will be.  For best results, let dip refrigerate overnight.  Serve as a sandwich filling or scoop up with bagel chips.  It disappears fast so make a few batches for parties!!!
