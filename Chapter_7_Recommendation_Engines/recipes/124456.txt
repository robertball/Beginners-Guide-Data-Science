Ingredients:
2 cups butter, softened
3 cups sugar
6 eggs
4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter until fluffy. Gradually add sugar, beating until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add flour to creamed mixture alternately with milk, beginning and ending with flour, just until blended. Stir in extracts. Pour batter into a greased and floured 10-in. tube pan.
Bake at 325 degrees F for about 1 hour and 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 15 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
We've always included pound cake on our family menus, and through the years, I've tried many recipes, I can honestly say this one is the best! It has a very fine, rich texture that makes it unusually smooth. That texture, plus fantastic flavor, makes this pound cake a special treat each time we serve it.
