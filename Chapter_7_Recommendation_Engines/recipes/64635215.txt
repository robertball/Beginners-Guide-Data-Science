Ingredients:
1 cup sugar free hot cereal
2 bananas
2 tsp Vanilla extract

Directions:
Make 1 cup of your favorite, sugar free hot cereal (I use an oat and barley blend but cream of wheat, oatmeal, malt-o-meal are also good cereals).
In a blender or food processor, blend the prepared hot cereal until creamy. Let the blended cereal cool. Add 2 bananas and vanilla extract and blend well until mixture is creamy. Stir mixture into small bowl or stir and put into reusable baby food pouches.

Description: 
Makes 2 cups baby food which is about four, 4oz containers of baby food. I save about $1.60 each time I make this instead of purchasing the 4oz containers of banana baby food at the store. Also store bought baby food is designed to be stored on shelves in grocery stores & supermarkets for 2 yrs. To stay â€˜fresh' longer on the shelves, it must be preserved & sterilized; organic as well as non-organic brands. So the food is heated to max. temps to ensure that it is not contaminated after months on the shelf. Along w/this heating process all vitamins & nutrients are killed off too.
