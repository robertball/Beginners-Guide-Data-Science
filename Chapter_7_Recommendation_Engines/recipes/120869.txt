Ingredients:
2 tablespoons active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
2 cups milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 egg whites
3 tablespoons honey
2 cups chopped cabbage
2 large carrots, sliced
1 large stalk celery, cut into chunks
1/2 cup cornmeal
1 tablespoon salt
5 cups whole wheat flour

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In a blender or food processor, combine the milk, oil, egg whites, honey and vegetables. Cover and process until smooth. Add cornmeal, salt and vegetable mixture to yeast mixture; mix well. Stir in enough flour to form a stiff dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes. Do not let rise. Divide in half. Shape into two loaves. Place in two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minute or until browned. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool. Store in the refrigerator.
