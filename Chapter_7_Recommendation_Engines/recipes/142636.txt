Ingredients:
12 chicken wings, tips removed and wings cut in half at joint
2 cloves cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped
1/2 onion, cut into chunks
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup Asian fish sauce
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
Place the chicken wings, garlic, and onion into a large bowl. Pour in soy sauce, fish sauce, lemon juice, and sesame oil. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and sugar; toss together until well coated. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 9x13 inch baking dish with aluminum foil.
Remove wings from marinade, reserving extra. Arrange wings in a single layer over bottom of prepared dish. Bake in preheated oven, turning once and brushing with reserved marinade, until deep, golden brown and meat juices run clear, approximately 30 minutes.
