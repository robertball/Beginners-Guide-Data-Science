Anne's Homemade Chorizo Recipe

Ingredients:
2lbs. ground beef
1lb. ground pork
3/4 c. red chile powder
3/4 tsp. oregano
3 cloves garlic minced
2 tsps. salt
3/4 c. dry red wine
1/4 c. white vinegar

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in a large glass bowl (I find that using my hands is the best)and refrigerate for 2-3 days to let the flavors mingle. Take chorizo out daily and mix thoroughly until you're ready to freeze or cook it. Divide into small 1-2lb. batches and put into sandwich bags for freezing.
To cook: Fry approximately 1/3 cup of chorizo per person in a skillet until cooked through. Scramble in eggs, stirring occasionally. When done, roll into a large tortilla and sprinkle with cotija cheese(for an authentic taste) or monterey jack cheese and a dollop of sour cream if desired.  You can also mix half chorizo and half ground beef together in a bowl (add desired salt and pepper to taste) before pressing the raw meat mixture onto a raw corn tortilla and frying for delicious authentic tacos! Enjoy!

Description: 
This chorizo recipe was handed down to me from my Mexican mother-in-law from Nogales, Arizona. It's delicious, easy to make and way better than store bought. I keep some in the freezer at all times for a quick and easy breakfast burrito. Mixing a variety of chilies gives the chorizo greater depth of flavor so I always use Santa Cruz dried red chili powder, a couple of tablespoons of chili paste and various New Mexico dried red chilies to equal the amount of chili called for.
