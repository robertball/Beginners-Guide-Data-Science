Ingredients:
Lips
1 apple with red skin
Mouth
3 T peanut butter (or almond butter, Nutella, sunflower butter, or cream cheese)
Teeth
15-30 mini marshmallows (or raisins, or square-shaped cereal)

Directions:
Depending on the size of the apple, divide into 4-6 sections and remove stem. seeds and flower end. The size of sections will depend on the size of the wearer's mouth - they will have to bite into the portion of the apple that had the seeds, so remember to size appropriately.
With a paring knife, etch the skin of one apple section into "lips". Remove the center part of the skin and with your knife, carve out a little bit the apple flesh to form the "mouth".  Repeat with other apple sections.
Spread peanut butter or whatever sticky material you are using into the "mouth". Arrange "teeth" in mouth. Repeat with remaining apple sections.
Bite into the fleshy part of the apple and show off your new dental work!
