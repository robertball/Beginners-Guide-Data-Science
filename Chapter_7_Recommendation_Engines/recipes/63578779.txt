Ingredients:
6 dried lasagna noodles, broken into 2-3 inch pieces
12 oz. bulk italian sausage
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 medium zucchini, coarsely shredded (about 1 1/2 cups)
1  24-26 oz jar marinara sauce
1 cup light ricotta cheese (about 1/2 of a 15 oz. carton)
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (3 oz.)
2 TBSP grated parmesan or romano cheese

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain thoroughly.
In a 10 inch skillet, cook sausage and onion over medium heat, until sausage is no longer pink, stirring to break up sausage as it cooks.
Add zucchini: cook and stir for one minute. Drain off fat. Remove meat mixture from skillet.
In the same skillet arrange about half of the noodle pieces. Cover with about half of the pasta sauce. Spoon cooked meat mixture over sauce. Spoon ricotta in mounds atop a meat mixture and sprinkle with 1/4 cup of the mozzarella cheese.
Arrange remaining noodle pieces atop cheese. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
Cook, covered, over medium heat about 10 minutes or until heated through and cheese is melted.
Remove skillet from heat. Let stand, uncovered, for 5 minutes before serving.
