Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 large onion, diced
1/2 large green bell pepper, diced
1 (4 ounce) jar chopped pimento peppers
2 eggs
1 (8 ounce) package corn muffin mix (such as Jiffy®)
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, with liquid
1 (15.25 ounce) can creamed corn
1 pint sour cream
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x12-inch baking pan.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and pimento peppers and saute until tender, about 5 minutes.
Combine eggs, corn muffin mix, green chiles, whole corn, and creamed corn in a large bowl with the onion mixture. Stir together and pour into the prepared baking pan. Drop sour cream by the spoonful on top of the mixture; cover with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is firm, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
My  mother won an award many, many years ago with this recipe in the Arizona Republic newspaper. I think it is delish and so different from a lot of other corn casseroles. Everybody I know asks for this recipe so I am giving it to everyone! Enjoy!
