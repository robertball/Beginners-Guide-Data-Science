Description: 
This won 1st place in county fair Dairy Main Dish Recipe Contest in 1972. Passed down in the family -- it's the dish I make when I make my first dinner for a boyfriend! Everyone loves this! (Even my daughter- picking out the mushrooms, of course!) Cook any kind of noodles or rice to have as a bed under the chicken and sauce. I always make double the sauce, because its sooo good! I use the sauce just with noodles as well.
