Ingredients:
12 new potatoes, halved
2 large red onions, each cut into 8 wedges
2 large yellow bell peppers, seeded and cubed
4 cloves garlic, peeled
1 eggplant, thickly sliced (optional)
1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt to taste
1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
1/3 cup toasted pine nuts
1 (10 ounce) bag baby spinach leaves
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place potatoes into a microwave safe dish, and place into the microwave. Cook on High until the potatoes are just tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Place the potatoes into a large bowl along with the onion, bell pepper, garlic, and eggplant. Sprinkle with rosemary, thyme, and olive oil. Toss to coat the vegetables with olive oil, then season with salt to taste. Spread vegetables onto prepared baking sheet.
Roast the vegetables in the preheated oven until they begin to brown at the edges, about 35 minutes. Stir in the cherry tomato halves, and continue cooking 15 minutes more.
Toss the roasted vegetables in a large bowl with the pine nuts, spinach, and balsamic vinegar.
