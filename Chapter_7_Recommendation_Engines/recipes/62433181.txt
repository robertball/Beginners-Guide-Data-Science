Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter, slightly softened
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed
1 whole egg
2 egg whites
1 Tbsp vanilla
1 1/2 cups of ripe mashed bananas (about 3 large)
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white whole wheat flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour a 9x5x3" loaf pan.
Beat the butter in a large mixing bowl until light and fluffy.  Add the sugars and beat well.  Add the egg, egg whites, and vanilla and beat until well blended.  Add the mashed banana and beat on high speed for 30 seconds.
Into a separate large bowl sift the dry ingredients and then whisk together.  Add the dry mixture to the wet ingredients alternately with the milk, ending with the flour mixture.
Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake about 1 hour, or until browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Cool the bread in the pan on a wire rack for about 20 minutes, then remove and completely cool.  Refrigerate overnight before slicing and serving.

Description: 
This bread is so moist and delicious, you'll want to eat the whole loaf at once.  I typically use skim milk, but any type of milk you have on hand will work.
