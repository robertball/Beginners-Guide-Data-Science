2 Tbsp sea salt
2/4 cup coconut milk

Fish: Heat oil in a skillet on medium heat.  Add garlic and onions. Cook until the onions begin to caramalize. Take out of skillet and set aside.
Add a bit more oil to the same pan, if needed. Place fish into skillet and sprinkle with sea salt. Brown slightly on each side. Pour about ¼ cup coconut milk over the fish and continue to cook. When almost done, put the chopped onions & minced garlic mixture on top of the fish.  Add additional ¼ cup coconut milk, more if needed.
Garlic Spinach: Place the onion and garlic in a pan with the olive oil and sauté for 1-2 minutes. Add the spinach and cook until it is properly wilted.
