Ingredients:
1 box French Vanilla cake mix
1/3 cup oil
2 eggs
1/4 cup butter, room temperature
2 cups powdered sugar
1 to 2 tablespoons of milk
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Mix together the cake mix, oil & eggs with a mixer just until it pulls together and away from the sides of the bowl.
Use a heaping tablespoon and drop onto ungreased baking sheet.  Press down with fingers to flatten just a bit.
Bake for 9-10 minutes, just until bottom is toasty brown.  Leave on sheet pan for 1 minute and then move to cooling rack.
While cookies are baking, mix the softened butter, powdered sugar, milk and vanilla together for 5 minutes with a mixer.  Frost the cookies while still slightly warm.
Let cookies air dry and then cover loosely with plastic wrap on a plate.
