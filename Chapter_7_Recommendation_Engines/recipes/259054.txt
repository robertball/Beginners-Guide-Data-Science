1 cup all-purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, or to taste
1/3 cup butterscotch chips
cooking spray

Directions:
Combine flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl.
Mix buttermilk, butter, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Add to flour mixture; stir until just combined. Fold butterscotch chips into batter; allow to rest 5 minutes.
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat; coat with cooking spray. Pour in 1/3 cup batter; spread with the back of a spoon into a circle just over 1/4-inch thick. Cook until edges are set; 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook 1 to 2 minutes more.
