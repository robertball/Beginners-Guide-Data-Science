Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Heat about 3 inches of oil in a saucepan to 375 degrees F (119 degrees C).  In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm water. Set aside for 10 minutes.
Sir the remaining 1/2 cup water into the bowl.  Add flour, beating vigorously until a soft dough forms.
Turn the dough out onto a smooth surface, and knead with greased hands until smooth.  Place dough in a greased bowl, and turn to coat the surface.  Cover with a damp cloth.  Let rise in a warm place until double in bulk, about 1 to 1/1/2 hours.
Fry golf ball sizes of dough in batches until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels.  Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar, and eat while still hot.
