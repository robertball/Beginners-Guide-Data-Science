3 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon ground all spice
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon bourbon vanilla
1/4 cup peach wine (or other fruit liquid)
5 cups sliced peeled peaches
1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon lemon juice
TOPPING:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
Dash salt
1/4 cup cold butter
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup egg beaters

Directions:
In a large saucepan, combine the brown sugar, cornstarch and mace. Stir in sherry or juice until blended. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Add the peaches, blueberries, pecans, butter and lemon juice. Pour into a greased shallow 2-qt. baking dish.
For topping, in a small bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in butter until coarse crumbs form. Stir in milk and egg. Spoon over fruit mixture. Bake at 400 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until bubbly and a toothpick inserted in the topping comes out clean. Serve warm.
