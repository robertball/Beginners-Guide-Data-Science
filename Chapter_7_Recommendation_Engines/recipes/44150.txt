Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 small green bell pepper, chopped
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 lime, juiced
1/2 cup pimento-stuffed green olives, sliced
1/4 cup canned diced green chiles, drained
3 large tomatoes, seeded and coarsely chopped
4 (8 ounce) fillets red snapper
1 tablespoon capers, rinsed and drained

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add green pepper, onion, and garlic, and cook until pepper is soft, about 5 minutes. Mix in the white pepper, cinnamon, lime juice, olives, and chiles; cook for 2 more minutes, to blend the flavors. Stir in the tomatoes, and cook until thickened, about 10 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the snapper filets into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour the tomato sauce over the filets, and bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Stir in the capers just before serving.
