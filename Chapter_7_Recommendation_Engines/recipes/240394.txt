Description: 
My Titi (auntie in Spanish) handed me down this recipe after I had this cake at her house during a Thanksgiving dinner, and I just to make it for my family at home. It's a great recipe that even my daughter loves! Now this cake makes its way onto my table every Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loves it. I even have a few copies of the recipe because someone always asks for it! Serve with a dollop of Cool WhipÂ®.
