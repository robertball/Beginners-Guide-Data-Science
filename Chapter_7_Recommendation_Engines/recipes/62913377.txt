Ingredients:
1 (2 ounce) package dried ancho chilies
1 teaspoon black pepper
2 teaspoons cumin powder
2 Tablespoons fresh oregano, chopped
6 cloves garlic
1/2 red onion, quartered
1/4 cup vegetable oil
4 chicken breast or small steaks (6 ounces)

Directions:
Soak dry chilies overnight in water, until soft. Remove seeds. Add all ingredients except meat in food processor. Puree until smooth.
Spread mixture over chicken, or other meats and refrigerate at least one hour, up to 24 hours.
After marinading, heat grill to about 400 degrees F, or if cooking inside, heat small amount of oil in skillet or grill pan over high heat. Salt meat to taste (optional), and grill lightly, turning only
once, until done. 4 minutes per side for chicken, 8-10 minutes per side for 3/4" thick steak.
