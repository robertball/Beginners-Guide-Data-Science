Ingredients:
3/4 cup pecans
3/4 cup cashews
3/4 cup blanched almonds
3/4 cup raw peanuts
1/8 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon peanut oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment.
Distribute pecans, cashews, almonds, and peanuts over prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes; shake pan to turn nut mixture and continue baking until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes more; allow to cool.
Place nut mixture with salt into the bowl of a food processor; blend until coarsely ground, about 3 minutes. Drizzle peanut oil into nut mixture; continue to blend until a smooth butter forms, about 2 minutes more, scraping bowl with rubber spatula as needed to push nut butter down into the bowl. Store nut butter in the refrigerator.

Description: 
I made my butter out of 4 varieties of nuts as I was getting tired of peanut butter. Make sure you get your nuts when bulk bins are on sale as this can get expensive. This recipe is for smooth butter; for a crunchy nuttier nut butter, coarsely chop an additional 2 teaspoons of each nut and stir in after food processing step is finished.
