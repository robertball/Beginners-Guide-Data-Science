Ingredients:
1-2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, diced
5 garlic cloves, rough chopped
1 cup carrots, diced
1 cup celery, diced
1 x 14.5 ounce can fire roasted diced tomatoes
1  small 4 ounce can, mild green chilies
2 lbs chicken thighs ( boneless, skinless)
1-2 cans black beans
6 cups chicken stock or broth
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons cumin
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
juice from 1-2 limes
optional: adobo sauce from canned chipotles
Add-ons:
Shredded Cheese
Sour Cream
Tortilla Chips
Avacado
Hot Sauce
Fresh Jalapeno

Directions:
Set the Instant pot to the Saute function. Saute onion and garlic in the oil for 3-4 minutes.
Add the carrots, celery, diced tomato, green chilies, chicken thighs (whole), black beans, chicken stock, salt and all the spices.  Give a good stir, and set the Instant pot to pressure cook on high. Pressure cook for 17 minutes. Manually let pressure out.
Shred chicken thighs with two forks. The soup will thicken. Squeeze with a generous amount of lime juice and taste for salt.  You want a good balance between lime and salt. ( If soup tastes bland, it probably needs more of each.)
Top with tortilla strips, cheese, sour cream or avocado and cilantro. Add hot sauce for added heat.
