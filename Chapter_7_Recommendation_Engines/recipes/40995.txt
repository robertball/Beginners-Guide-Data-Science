Ingredients:
3 medium artichokes
lemon juice
2 cups soft bread crumbs
1 1/2 cups peeled, seeded, and chopped tomato
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon snipped parsley
1 tablespoon snipped fresh mint or fresh basil
1 clove garlic, minced

Directions:
Wash artichokes. Remove stems and loose outer leaves from artichokes. Cut off 1 inch from top of each; snip off the sharp leaf tips. Cut in half lengthwise. Brush the cut edges with the lemon juice.
In large covered kettle cook artichokes in boiling salted water for 20 to 30 minutes or until a leaf pulls out easily. Drain cut side down. Remove center leaves and the fuzzy 'choke.' Sprinkle insides lightly with salt.
Combine bread crumbs, tomato, Parmesan or Romano cheese, parsley, mint or basil, and garlic. Spoon mixture into artichokes. Place in a 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Cover and bake in a 375 degree F. oven for 15 minutes. Uncover; bake about 10 to 15 minutes more or until tops are lightly golden brown.
