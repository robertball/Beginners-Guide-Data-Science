Description: 
This is a sweet (pear) sauce with a little kick (cranberry) in it; a wonderful chutney for just about any type of meat you can think of. This will be replacing my gravy at Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
My 4-year-old daughter loves it and so does half my neighborhood. It is so easy to make, too; all you do is you put everything in a big saucepan and you are good to go. The chutney will thicken more as it cools; store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
