Description: 
My husband is diabetic. He loves this and it doesn't make his sugar levels spike! I think it's good, too. First time I made it, he called his brother and said 'I just had my first sandwich in 23 years.' Make round patties and sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds for hamburger or hot dog buns.
