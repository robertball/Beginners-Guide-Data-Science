Ingredients:
3/4 cup milk
1 egg
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teasoon salt
1/3 cup oil (can use shortening, too)
1/3 cup sugar
2 1/4 teaspoons yeast (or what your bread machine uses)
1 1/2 tablespoons melted butter

Directions:
Place all ingredients except melted butter in pan.
Select Dough Only setting and press start. When dough has risen long enough, the machine will beep. Remove dough from pan.
Divide dough into 3 equal balls. Roll out each ball, one at a time, into a 9 inch circle (don't worry if you can't get it exactly 9 inch).
(Note: I always start rolling my dough and let it rest for awhile and resume rolling. The resting helps relax the dough).
With pizza cutter (works great!)or sharp knife, divide each circle into 8 wedges, as if cutting a pizza. Starting at the wide end, roll up each wedge toward the point. Cover and place in a warm oven (turn oven onto warm setting for 2 minutes and turn off, to make a good environment for dough).
Let rise for 30 to 40 minutes until doubled. Remove sheet from oven to preheat oven! Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Bake for 12-15 minutes until golden. Remove from oven. Brush rolls lightly with melted butter

Description: 
These were wonderful!! The dough was a dream to work with and they were very easy to make. Buttery, and tasty! I had to hide the rolls because every time my two year old left the room he came back in with a roll in each hand! Within a day and a half these were finished, and the majority by my little one!
