Ingredients:
1 (12 oz) al fresco Sweet Italian Style Chicken Sausage 3 oz day-old crusty Italian or French bread, cut or torn into bite-sized pieces
3 cups tomatoes, ripened, cut into bite-size chunks (may use grape tomatoes for maximum sweetness)

Directions:
Spread bread onto baking sheet. Allow bread to dry slightly while preparing other ingredients.
Place sausage on an oiled grill rack, set 4" to 5" over medium-low heat. Grill, with lid closed, using the direct grill method, turning with tongs, until cooked throughout, about 7 to 9 minutes. Cook until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees. Cool slightly and cut into bite-sized chunks.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, stir tomatoes, olives, green onions and vinaigrette together. Add bread and sausage. Toss to coat all surfaces.
Add Parmesan and chopped basil. Arrange 1/2 cup romaine on each plate and spoon salad atop lettuce. Garnish with extra basil. Serve immediately.
