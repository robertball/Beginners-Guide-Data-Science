Ingredients:
3/4 cup Raisins
1/2 cup Brown Sugar
1/4 cup Corn Syrup
3 tablespoons Butter
1 beaten egg
1 tablespoon Vanilla Extract
1/8 teaspoon Salt
12 prepared tart shells using your preferred recipe

Directions:
Sprinkle raisins evenly in each tart shell.
Combine the rest of the ingredients and pour the mixture evenly over the raisins.  It won't look like  much but the filling will swell with baking.
Bake at 350f for 35 minutes, or until done.

Description: 
A good friend, Mrs Walsh, gave me this recipe in the mid 1970's.  It's fail-proof; it's delicious, and it's quick and easy using ingredients I usually have on hand.  You can add a 1/2 c walnuts or pecans with the raisins if desired.
