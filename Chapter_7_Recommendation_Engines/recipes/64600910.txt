Vegan Sour Cream (Oh She Glows) Recipe

Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups (225 g) raw cashews, soaked
3/4 cup (190 mL) water
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
Scant 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt

Directions:
1.Place cashews in a bowl and cover with water. Soak overnight or for 8 hours if you have the time. For a quick-soak method, pour boiling water over the cashews and soak for 1 hour. Rinse and drain.
2.Place the drained cashews in a high-speed blender.
3.Add the water, lemon, vinegar, and salt. Blend on high until super smooth. You might have to stop to scrape down the blender now and then or add a touch more water to get it going.
4.Transfer into a small, air-tight container and chill in the fridge. The cream will thicken up as it chills. The cream will keep in the fridge for about 1 week. You can also freeze it for up to 1 month. I like to freeze it in silicone mini muffin cups. Once solid, transfer the cups into a freezer-safe zip bag for easy grab and go portions.

Description: 
Rich and tangy, this vegan sour cream is the perfect complement to My Favourite Vegan Chili or any Mexican entr√©e. Be sure to soak the cashews (either overnight or using my quick-soak method) before you begin.   (Still can't figure out how this tastes soooo much like dairy sour cream)
