Ingredients:
I think the Cake Mix Doctor, Anne Byrn, must be getting a lot of the same questions about the new size cake mix. Here's what she wrote the other day about the Almond Cream Cheese Pound Cake recipe that's in her original book: • If you are finicky about baking and have a kitchen scale, weigh out 1.75 ounces of flour and add it to the bowl. • No scale? Measure 6 tablespoons flour and add it to the bowl. • Not so picky? Add somewhere between 1/3 and ½ cup flour to the cake mix before adding other ingredients. • No flour? Bake the smaller mixes in 8-inch instead of 9-inch layers and you will have taller layers.

Directions:
Add additional flour to cake mix
