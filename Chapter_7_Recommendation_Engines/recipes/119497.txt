Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 envelope onion soup mix
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 cup chopped dried cranberries

1 (16 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce
3/4 cup ketchup
1/2 cup beef broth
3 tablespoons brown sugar
3 tablespoons finely chopped onion
2 teaspoons cider vinegar

Directions:
In a bowl, combine eggs, soup mix, bread crumbs, cranberries and parsley.  Crumble beef over mixture and mix well.  Shape into 1-in. balls; place 12 to 14 balls on a microwave-safe plate.  Cover with waxed paper; microwave on high for 3-4 minutes or until no longer pink.  Remove to paper towels to drain.  Repeat with remaining meatballs.
In a 2-qt. microwave-safe dish, combine sauce ingredients.  Cover and microwave on high for 3-4 minutes  or until heated through.

Description: 
Cranberry sauce and brown sugar create a tangy glaze for moist meatballs that are good as an appetizer or as a main dish over rice. 'We love them so much, I prepare them year-round,' says Joyce Bentley of Redlands, California.
