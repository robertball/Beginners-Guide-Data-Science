Terri's Favorite Fermented Veggies Recipe

Ingredients:
4 cups of vegetable of your choice, sliced or chopped. My favorites are chopped cabbage, carrots, kale, radishes, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and onions.
2 cups warm water
1 1/2 T. unrefined sea salt
1-2 T. lemon juice (brings a light, bright flavor to your ferment)
spices and herbs of choice (basil, DILL, peppercorns, red pepper flakes, mustard seeds, etc.)
1 Qt. wide mouth mason jar, fermenting stone and air lock lid

Directions:
Place vegetables and any spices/herbs you're using in the mason jar right up to the bottom of the neck, there should be about 1 inch of space to the top.
Stir the salt and water together until dissolved.
Pour the salt water over the vegetables until it reaches just below the top of the jar. There should be about 1/2 inch of room left.
Pack the vegetable down with a sauer stick.
Place a sauer stone on top, making sure all the vegetables are submerged.
Assemble and attach an air lock lid and set aside. Temp should preferably be 68-75 degrees.
The vegetables are ready anywhere from 4-10 days. The longer they sit, the more tangy they'll be. Taste them starting on day 4 to figure out your preference. I like them best around day 5 or 6.
Once you decide they're the level of sourness you're looking for, place the the jar in the refrigerator where it will keep for a couple of months (not that they'll last that long!)
