Ingredients:
1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cup sour cream
3/4 cup chopped green onion
1 pound bacon slices
5 pounds unpeeled red potatoes

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add whole potatoes, and cook until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain, run under cold water to cool, and chop into 1 inch cubes. Transfer to a large serving bowl, and refrigerate until completely chilled, about 2 hours.
In a small bowl, stir together the ranch dressing mix, mayonnaise, sour cream,  and green onion. Cover, and refrigerate for about 2 hours to blend flavors.
Wrap bacon in paper towels and place on a plate. Cook in the microwave until crisp, about 15 minutes depending on the power of your microwave. Cool.
Stir the mayonnaise mixture into the bowl of potatoes. Crumble bacon into the bowl, and stir to distribute. Serve.

This is not your usual mustard mayo potato salad. These potatoes are slathered in a rich ranch dressing and bacon pieces. My family and friends love this potato salad! It is requested at every cook-out.Modified from: Texas Ranch Potato Salad
