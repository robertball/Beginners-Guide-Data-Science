Ingredients:
1 18 oz package Funfetti cake mix
3 eggs
2 16 oz cans lemon pie filling
1 basket fresh strawberries
1 8 oz container frozen whipped topping, thawed
1 3.5 oz package instant lemon pudding mix
1 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease bottom of 2 round cake pans.
Mix together cake mix, eggs, and one can of lemon pie filling. Stir until just combined. Pour into prepared pans.
Bake in 350 degree oven ~30 minutes, checking and removing when toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Let cool.
To make frosting: in medium bowl, combine pudding mix and milk with whisk, until smooth. Gently fold in whipped topping until no streaks remain. Refrigerate until needed.
To assemble: remove one cake from pan and place upside down on cake plate. Rinse and slice strawberries, placing slices atop cake. Top with (most of) second can of lemon pie filling. Remove second cake from pan, and set atop first cake, rightside up. Frost top and sides of cake with frosting.
Cover and store in refrigerator.
