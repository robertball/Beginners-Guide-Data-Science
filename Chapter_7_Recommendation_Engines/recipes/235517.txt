Ingredients:
2 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat brown sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is fully combined.
Pour confectioners' sugar onto a large plate. Spoon dough, 1 1/2 teaspoons per cookie, onto confectioners' sugar and roll to coat. Arrange coated dough on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 12 to 14 minutes. Cool cookies on baking pan for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
These are really tasty. The flavor is even stronger if you let them sit after baking them overnight!
