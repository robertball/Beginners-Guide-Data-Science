Ingredients:
1-8 ounce package of Chipped Beef
1-8 ounce package of Shredded Cheddar Cheese
Miracle Whip or Mayonnaise
2 loaves of party rye bread

Directions:
Stack the chipped beef and cut through to make 4-5 strips. Now turn and cut through it again. You should have a pile of little pieces. Place into a mixing bowl and add the shredded cheddar cheese. Mix in enough Miracle Whip or Mayonnaise to hold everything together. Spread a spoonful of the ingredients onto the rye and place on a cookie sheet. Broil until the cheese melts. Serve immediately...I hope you enjoy a family favorite of ours

This appetizer recipe has been a holiday must for close to 40 years. These little treats are quick and easy and very delicious. The original recipe uses the Miracle Whip and that's what we use, but Mayonnaise can be substituted.
