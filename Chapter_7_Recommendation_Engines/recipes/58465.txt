Ingredients:
Pudding:
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1/2 cup milk
1 cup superfine sugar
2 eggs
1 tablespoon apricot jelly
1 1/3 cups cake flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
Sauce:
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup water, orange juice, or sherry

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small saucepan over low heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter or margarine together with vinegar and milk. Remove from heat, and set aside.  Meanwhile, sift  flour, baking soda, and salt together into a separate bowl.
Beat  1 cup sugar and eggs with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy and light colored, about 5 minutes. Gradually mix in the apricot jam. Fold the dry ingredients into the egg mixture alternately with warmed milk mixture using a spatula. Pour batter into a greased, 1 quart oven-proof baking dish.
Bake approximately 45 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
Place cream, butter, 1/2 cup sugar, and water in a saucepan and stir over moderate heat until the butter has melted and sugar is dissolved. Do not allow the mixture to boil.
Remove pudding from the oven, pierce several times with a skewer or fork, and pour the hot cream mixture immediately over the pudding. Serve hot or cold.

Description: 
This rich, South African pudding contains no marshmallows, but probably got its name from its spongy texture! Delicious served hot or cold with cream.
