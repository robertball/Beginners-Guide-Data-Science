Ingredients:
1 bunch kale
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon seasoning salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Wash and thoroughly dry kale with a salad spinner. With a knife or kitchen shears carefully remove the leaves from the thick stems and tear into bite size pieces. Place on a noninsulated cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with seasoning salt. Bake for 10-15 minutes until the edges brown but not burn.
