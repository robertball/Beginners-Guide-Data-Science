1/2 gluten free all purpose flour
1/4 cup coconut flour

1 cup soy milk (1tbs vinegar added)
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup honey

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 16 muffin cups.
In a large bowl, mix the flours, millet flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, mix the soy milk/vinegar mixture, egg, applesauce, and honey. Stir buttermilk mixture into the flour mixture just until evenly moist. Transfer batter to the prepared muffin cups.
