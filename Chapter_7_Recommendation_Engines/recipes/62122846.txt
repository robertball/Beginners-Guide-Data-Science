Ingredients:
1- Jar of your favorite salsa- however hot you like it. (I use Hot Pace Picante sauce.)
1- Block of cream cheese
1- Pound of ground beef
1- Bag of tortilla chips

Directions:
Brown the ground beef in a pot on medium heat until fully cooked.
Drain the fat from the beef and return pot to stove.
Add the jar of salsa to the drained beef.
Stir the salsa-meat mixture and continue stirring until it is heated through.
Cut the cream cheese in big chunks and add to the warming salsa mixture and continue stirring until the cream cheese is completely melted.
Place in a small crock pot or small chaffing dish.
Serve with tortilla chips.
