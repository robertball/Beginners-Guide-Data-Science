Description: 
I am goigng to give my Dad credit for creating this one.  I know I have never seen it anywhere else.  This is an easy early morning breakfast for a change.  Great for a crowd when you are just a little short on eggs.  Use left over rice from dinner the night before or make it fresh that morning either way it works.
