Ingredients:
2 large portabella mushrooms
2 sticks light string cheese
1/4 cup canned crushed tomatoes
1/2 tsp. chopped garlic
Dash Italian seasoning
8 slices turkey pepperoni (like the kind by Hormel), chopped
2 tbsp. canned sliced black olives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Remove mushroom stems, chop, and set aside. Place mushroom caps on a baking sheet sprayed with nonstick spray. Bake in the oven for 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, break each stick of string cheese into thirds and place in a food processor or blender -- blend at high speed until cheese takes on a shredded or grated consistency. (Or just tear string cheese into pieces and roughly chop.) Set aside.
Remove sheet from the oven but leave oven on. Blot excess liquid from mushroom caps and set aside.
In a small bowl, combine crushed tomatoes, garlic, and Italian seasoning. Mix well and equally distribute between mushroom caps; spread until smooth and even. Sprinkle shredded/grated cheese over the saucy layer on each cap. Top with chopped mushroom stems, pepperoni, and olives.
Bake in the oven for 8 - 10 minutes, until cheese has melted. Eat as soon as you can without burning your mouth!
