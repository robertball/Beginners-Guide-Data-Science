Description: 
I am really ready to wrap up this weekin a bow and a Spicy Chicken Lettuce Wrap.  In less than 30 minutes (which I never say), you will have the tastiest, healthiest weekend dinner on record.  Our daughter was eating out of the pan and we sat and grazed, fighting for the last wrap, enjoying our dinner to the fullest.  Make this one of your go too’s.  Get your hands messy and invite your friends over.  You deserve an easy night.  Spring is almost here…
