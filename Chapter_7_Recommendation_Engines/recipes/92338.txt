Ingredients:
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 pound New York strip steaks, cut 3/4 inch thick
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 cup minced shallot
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons red wine
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix together the paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and thyme. Sprinkle onto each side of the steaks, pressing in so it adheres. Set aside.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallots; cook and stir for about 1 minute. Add the mushrooms, and cook for a few more minutes, until tender. Stir in the red wine, and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat and keep warm.
Heat the oil in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Fry steaks for 5 to 7 minutes per side, or to your desired degree of doneness. Remove to a plate and let rest for a few minutes. Top with mushrooms and serve.
