Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup brown sugar, packed
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup tahini
1/4 cup honey
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 large eggs
1 cup coconut
1 cup rolled oats
3/4 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Beat butter, brown sugar, white sugar, tahini, honey, and ground cinnamon together in a separate large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add eggs; mix well. Beat flour mixture in gradually until dough is just combined. Stir in coconut, oats, and almonds. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until edges are golden, 9 to 11minutes. Cool on baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I bought tahini to make hummus. I had a lot left over, so I decided to make a yummy cookie with them. They passed the husband taste test, so I thought I would share with all.
