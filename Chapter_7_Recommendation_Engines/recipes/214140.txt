Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (divided)
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons hot chili powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 lime, zested and juiced
1 cup canned corn kernels, drained
1 cup canned pink or red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 (4 ounce) can mushroom pieces and stems, drained
1 cup canned, whole green beans, drained
1 medium onion, halved and sliced
1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and cut in strips
1 cup canned, diced tomatoes, preferably fire-roasted
1 (10.5 ounce) can asparagus cuts and tips, drained
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro (optional)
8 (8 inch) flour tortillas, preferably whole wheat, warmed by package directions
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 cup sour cream (optional)
1/2 cup prepared guacamole (optional)

Directions:
Mix 1 tablespoon olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, chili powder, oregano, cumin, pepper, lime zest and lime juice in a medium mixing bowl. Add corn, kidney beans, mushrooms and green beans. Toss gently until all vegetables are coated. Set aside for 10 minutes.
Heat the remaining one tablespoon oil in a large, well seasoned skillet over high heat until smoking. Add onion and bell pepper and saute until browned and tender, about 5 minutes. Add marinated corn-bean mixture with the marinade and tomatoes; cook until steaming hot, about 4 minutes, stirring often. Gently fold in asparagus and cilantro, if used, and heat through, about 1 minute.
To assemble fajitas; spoon 3/4 cup vegetable filling into the center of each warm tortilla. Top with 2 tablespoons shredded cheese, fold in one side and roll up. Serve with sour cream and/or guacamole, if desired.
