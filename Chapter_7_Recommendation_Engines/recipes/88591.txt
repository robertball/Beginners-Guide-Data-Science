Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
8 hot dogs
8 hot dog buns
1 (15 ounce) can sloppy joe sauce

Directions:
Crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until evenly browned. Drain off grease, and reduce the heat to medium. Stir in the sloppy joe sauce, and bring to a simmer. Add the hot dogs, and cook until heated through.
Place hot dogs into buns and cover with the sloppy joe mixture. Eat with a fork, or use just a little bit of the sauce and eat like a regular hot dog.

My Mama used to make this when I was a kid. It's a twist on the Chili Dog and we ate them with a fork.
