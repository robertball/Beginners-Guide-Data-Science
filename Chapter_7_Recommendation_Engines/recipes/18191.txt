Ingredients:
3 egg whites
1 cup white sugar
3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with foil or parchment paper.
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Quickly beat in the cardamom. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 60 to 90 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are completely dried out. Let cool before peeling off of the sheets. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 month.
