2 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cups butter (preferably Smart Balance Lite)
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
3/4 cup sugar baking substitute (i.e. Splenda for baking)
1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons Splenda brown sugar blend (If using regular brown sugar, use 3/4 cup)
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 large eggs
2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped pecans (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375, or 350 for convection oven.
Grease a cookie sheet.
Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl, and set aside.
Beat butter, baking sugar substitute, brown sugar blend, applesauce, and vanilla extract in large mixer bowl until creamy.
Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Gradually beat in flour mixture. Stir in chocolate chips and nuts.
Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the cookie sheet, and bake for 9-12 minutes.  Cookies should get deep golden brown on top.

This is my husband's favorite healthy cookie.  I make this almost every week, but it keeps him from grabbing sweets that are horrible for him.  These really are delicious!
