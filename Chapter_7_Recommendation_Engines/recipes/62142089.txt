Ingredients:
1 medium-sized butternut squash
3 sweet potatoes
3 cups vegetable broth
2 cups light cream
1 Tbsp butter
1/2 cup sweet onion, diced
1 Tbsp minced garlic
1/4 tsp sweet basil
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp course sea salt
1/8 tsp ginger
1/4 tsp nutmeg

Directions:
Put the vegetable broth in the blender
Cut the squash in half and microwave cut-sides down for about 10 minutes. Scoop/cut flesh into a blender.
Cut and microwave sweet potatoes in the same fashion. All 3 sweet potatoes should take 9-10 minutes in the microwave. Scoop the flesh into the blender with the vegetable broth and squash.
In a high-edged sauce pan on medium heat melt the butter and saut√© the onions and garlic until translucent. Add basil and black pepper.
While the onions are heating, puree the squash, sweet potatoes, and broth. Once the onions are translucent, add this puree to the saucepan and stir.
Add ginger, nutmeg, and sea salt.
Slowly add the light cream, stir, and allow the puree to heat.
Once puree has a few bubbles through it, transfer to the blender and use the "liquefy" option if available. Blend for 2 minutes or until a light, almost fluffy consistency has been reached.
Transfer back to saucepan, or soup bowl for serving. Use additional salt and pepper to taste.
