Ingredients:
1 long, slender 6" eggplant
Salt
1 cup flour
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp oregano
1 egg
1/2 cup milk or buttermilk
2 cups Panko breadcrumbs
1 tsp oregano
oil for frying
1 T olive oil
1/2 tsp minced or grated garlic
1 (28oz) can pureed tomatoes
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp chopped fresh basil
1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
Cooked pasta

Directions:
Slice eggplant into 1/2" discs.  Lay them out on a wire rack and sprinkle with salt.  Leave for 30 minutes.  This helps remove water and bitterness.
Meanwhile, prepare the dredging mixtures.  In a shallow dish (or a zip plastic bag), combine flour, salt, and oregano.  In another dish, combine egg and milk.  In a third dish, combine breadcrumbs and oregano.
To prepare the sauce, heat olive oil in saucepan over medium heat.  Add garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds).  Add tomatoes.  (Do not add herbs yet.  They begin to lose flavor with heat).  Bring to a boil, then simmer at least 20-30 minutes.
Heat oil in your fryer or a heavy pot with at least 2-3" of oil.  Pat down the eggplant with paper towels. Dredge in flour mix, then egg mix, then breadcrumb mix.  Carefully drop in oil.  Fry until golden brown, flipping over once.  Drain on paper towels.
Add herbs to tomato sauce 5 minutes before serving.  Plate pasta, eggplant, then sprinkle Parmesan on top of eggplant, and top with tomato sauce.
