Ingredients:
1 (19 oz.) can garbanzo beans, drained
2 Tbsp. tahini
2 Tbsp. lemon juice
1 Tbsp. water, or amount as needed
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 tsp. ground cumin
1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
1 hot chili pepper
Salt,to taste
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
Paprika, to taste

Directions:
Process garbanzo beans, tahini, chili pepper, garlic, and lemon juice in a food processor or blender (I use a mini-chopper) until smooth. Add water as needed to achieve the consistency you prefer.
Place mixture into a glass bowl. Stir in cumin, cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper.
Cover and refrigerate for at least a couple of hours. The flavor improves greatly if given this time to develop.

Description: 
I have tried a lot of hummus recipes, and this one is a combination of a few of my favorites, and is now the only one I use. I grow my own little Super Hot Chili Peppers and so that is what I use, but you can substitute any pepper you like, or use hot pepper flakes. I like a lot of garlic and a bit of a kick, but this recipe is easily alterable to your own tastes so adjust it as you see fit. I like my hummus thick so I usually skip the water. Another nice variation is to add a bit of red, green, and yellow bell peppers. It makes the hummus really pretty!
