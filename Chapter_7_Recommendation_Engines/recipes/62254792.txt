Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/3 cups water
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 egg whites
1 Jar of Raspberry SEEDLESS Jam
1 container of ready made vanilla whipped frosting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour an 11x13 inch cake pan.
With a large mixing spoon stir together the white cake mix, flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl until well mixed. Pour in the water, sour cream, vegetable oil, almond & vanilla extracts. Add your egg WHITES to the bowl & beat with an electric mixer on low until all the ingredients are mixed & moistened but some lumps still remain. About 3-4 minutes.
Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is a light GOLDEN brown AND a toothpick inserted into the CENTER of the cake comes out clean & dry. Baking time should be 25-30 minutes*. BEFORE COOLING cake carefully poke holes all over the top of your cake with a LARGE drinking straw. Spread on your warmed** jam all over the top of the cake being sure to fill up each hole with plenty of jam. Allow the cake to cool. Add about 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract to your frosting & stir it up in the container. Finally: frost your cake & drizzle on some left over warmed jam for a nice presentation.
