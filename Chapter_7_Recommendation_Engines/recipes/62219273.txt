Put boneless, skinless chicken breasts on top of dried beef.
Put one slice of bacon on each chicken breast. You may need to cut the slice of bacon in half and put the two halves on the chicken.
Mix remaining ingredients well.  Pour sauce mixture over the chicken.  Bake uncovered at 275° for 3 hours (SEE NOTE 1 BELOW).  If the top begins getting too brown, cover loosely with foil.
