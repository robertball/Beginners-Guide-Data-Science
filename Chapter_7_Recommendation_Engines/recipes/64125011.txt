Ingredients:
2 lb - Sea Scallops - rinsed & patted dry
8 TB - Butter (separated 4&4)
4 oz - Bourbon Whiskey
1 TB - Olive Oil
1 TB - Brown Sugar
1/2 tsp - Cayenne Pepper
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine 4 TB Butter, Olive Oil & 2oz of Bourbon in a large skillet/pan on medium high heat. When butter has melted and pan is hot, slowly lay in the Sea Scallops so as not to splatter or burn yourself. Brown on each side or just toss & saut√© until almost cooked through. Remove Scallops from pan and place on serving dish as scallops will finish cooking on the plate. Pour off the excess liquid from the scallops. Combine the rest of the butter, bourbon, brown sugar & spices and whisk until the sauce has reduced and the alcohol in the bourbon has cooked off. Drizzle over the scallops & serve.
