Ingredients:
BROWNIES
3 oz (90g) unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, cut into pieces
3 large eggs
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
1/2 cup plus 2 TB all-purpose flour
1/3 tsp salt
CARAMEL TOPPING
40 Kraft caramels (10 oz), unwrapped
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
2 cups pecan halves, toasted (optional to toast, I usually don't.)
GANACHE
2 oz semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
TOASTED PECANS: Bake at 350 degrees for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned and fragrant.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and place rack in center of oven.  Spray 9x13-inch rectangular baking pan with non-stick spray.
BROWNIES:  Put 3 oz chopped chocolate and 1 1/2 sticks butter over a double broiler.  Melt chocolate, stirring occasionally.
In an electric mixer, beat 3 eggs, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar until smooth.
Beat in 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract then add melted chocolate mixture.
Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat in 1/2 cup + 2 TB flour & 1/4 tsp salt on low speed.
Pour into prepared pan and bake for about 20 minutes or just until the brownies are barely firm to touch.  Remove from oven and place on wire rack.
CARAMEL TOPPING: Place the caramels and 1/2 cup cream in a saucepan and melt, over low heat (stirring frequently), until smooth.  Remove from heat and stir in the pecans.
Spread caramel topping evenly over the still warm brownies and let cool to room temperature.  Cover and refrigerate brownies for about an hour or until brownies are firm.
GANACHE TOPPING:  Place 2 oz chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl.  Put 1/4 cup cream in a saucepan and bring just to a boil over medium heat.  Immediately pour the boiling cream over the chocolate and allow to stand for 5 minutes.  Stir with whisk until smooth.
Remove the brownies from refrigerator and use a fork to drizzle the ganache over the brownies in a zigzag pattern.
Cover and refrigerate until chocolate is set.  Slice with serrated knife.
