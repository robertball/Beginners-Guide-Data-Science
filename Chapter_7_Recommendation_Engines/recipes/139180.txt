Ingredients:
1/4 cup mango chutney
4 slices crusty bread, cut diagonally from a large loaf
6 slices black forest ham
4 slices white Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons butter, softened

Directions:
Spread chutney onto two slices of bread. Place three slices of ham on top of each piece of bread followed by two slices of Cheddar cheese. Place the remaining slices of bread on top of the cheese, then butter the outsides of the sandwiches on both sides.
Cook in a large skillet over medium heat until golden brown, then flip over, and continue cooking until cheese is melted and sandwiches are golden brown on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
