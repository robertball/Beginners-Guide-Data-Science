Description: 
This was a happy mistake one night for dinner. With not much left in my cupboards, I tried this very simple and easy combination with amazing results. It may not look like much on the plate, but oh my the flavour of the dish and its combination of ingredients is super yummy. It's also very low in calories and healthy if you choose brown rice over white. Hope you like it!
