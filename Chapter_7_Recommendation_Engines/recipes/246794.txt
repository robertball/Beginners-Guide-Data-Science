Description: 
These turkey teriyaki meatballs from Natasha Kravchuk of Natasha's Kitchen are juicy and so flavorful with a homemade teriyaki glaze. They come together quickly making them an easy dinner idea for a busy weeknight. Try them over a bed of steamy rice or with toothpicks as an appetizer. Baking the teriyaki meatballs at a higher temperature sears in the natural juices and produces wonderfully soft meatballs that are healthier than when fried. You can easily double this recipe to feed a crowd.
