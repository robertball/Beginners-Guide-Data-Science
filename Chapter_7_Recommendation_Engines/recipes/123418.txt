Ingredients:
DOUGH:
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees F)
3 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
3 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons instant nonfat dry milk powder
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups bread flour

1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1/4 cup corn syrup
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water; let stand for 5 minutes.  Add butter, sugar, milk powder, salt and 2 cups flour; beat on low for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.  turn onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl; turn once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. To prepare buns: Roll dough into a 16-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Spread with butter; sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. Roll up from a long side; pinch seam to seal. Cut into 12 slices; set aside. In a saucepan, combine brown sugar, butter and corn syrup; cook over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved. Stir in pecans. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Place buns with cut side down over sauce. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool in pan for 3 minutes. Invert onto a serving platter.
