Ingredients:
2 navel oranges, thinly sliced
2 lemons, thinly sliced
2 limes, thinly sliced
1 pear, cored and chopped
1 kiwi, peeled and sliced
1 cup fresh strawberries, sliced
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks in juice
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup Cointreau or other orange liqueur
1 cup white rum
1/3 cup coconut-flavored rum
2 cups orange juice
2 (750 milliliter) bottles dry red wine, chilled
1/2 (12 fluid ounce) can frozen pink lemonade concentrate, thawed
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 cup lemon-lime soda, chilled

Directions:
Place the oranges, lemons, limes, pear, kiwi, strawberries, pineapple chunks and juice, and white sugar into a large bowl. Pour the Cointreau, white rum, coconut-flavored rum, and orange juice over the fruit. Stir gently to dissolve the sugar. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.
Add the red wine, pink lemonade concentrate, lemon juice, and lime juice. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours, or overnight.
Before serving, add the chilled lemon-lime soda. Serve over ice, spooning the fruit into the glass with the liquid. Garnish with an orange slice or maraschino cherries.

Description: 
I've been looking for a good sangria recipe for some time. I checked out several recipes, combined the best of everything and came up with the perfect mix that would easily rival my favorite local lounge's sangria! Measurements are approximate and to taste but don't scrimp on any of the flavors. Add more juice or rum until it knocks your socks off....then it's your perfect sangria.
