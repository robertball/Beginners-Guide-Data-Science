Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
12  chicken tenders, sliced into strips
3 cloves garlic, minced
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
¼ cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and chopped
2 tablespoons sliced green olives
½ cup dry white wine
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
½ cup sour cream
1 cup milk
½ teaspoon salt
1 ½ teaspoons cornstarch
¼ cup water

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken and garlic in the pan. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Stir in the tomatoes, olives, wine, and parsley. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking until the chicken is no longer pink in the center. Remove chicken and place on a plate, leaving the sauce in the pan. Stir sour cream, milk, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt into the remaining sauce.
Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl. Increase heat to medium and whisk in the cornstarch mixture. Continue stirring until the sauce has thickened. Serve the sauce with the chicken.

Description: 
Tangy, flavor-packed chicken in a rich cream sauce. Great with farfalle (bow tie) pasta (though I like to serve it with the unlikely partner of a hearty brown rice because I'm a rice nut). Killer Artichokes (from this site) and a glass of chardonnay make outstanding partners.
