Ingredients:
3 to 4 pounds stew beef
1/2 cup flour
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon pepper
12 small white onions, peeled
4 strips bacon, diced
16 ounces sliced mushrooms
1 can (12 ounces or 1 1/2 cups) beer
1 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon vinegar
1/2 teaspoon dried leaf thyme, crushed
1 small bay leaf

Directions:
Combine flour, salt, paprika, and pepper in a large shallow bowl or food storage bag. Toss beef cubes in flour mixture to coat thoroughly. Place onions, bacon and about half of the mushrooms in crockpot. Add beef and remaining mushrooms. Combine beer, sugar, vinegar, thyme, and bay leaf; pour over beef. Cover and cook on LOW for 8 to 10 hours. Serve beef with noodles or rice.
If desired, make a gravy from juices. Strain cooking liquids into a saucepan and simmer for about 5 minutes to reduce slightly. Combine 2 tablespoons of flour with about 3 to 4 tablespoons of water to make a smooth paste. Pour into beef juice mixture and simmer until thickened.
Serves 8.
