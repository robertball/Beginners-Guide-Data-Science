Ingredients:
1 cup sour cream
1 tsp baking soda
4 cups flour
1 cup sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp cream of tartar
1 tsp salt
3/4 cup butter (softened)
1 egg
1 cup cranberries
1.5 tsp vanilla
3 tbsp of plain lowfat yogart

Directions:
Directions for scones:
1. Combine baking soda (1 tsp) and sour cream (1 cup) in a bowl and set aside.
2. Mix butter (3/4 cup) with sugar (1 cup).  Add vanilla (1.5 tsp) and egg (1 egg) in another bowl.
3. In a 3rd bowl, mix dry ingredients together.
4. Combine everything together and don't over mix.  Add yogart slowly until all of the flour is absorbed and it is barely moist.  Should take between 2-3 tbsp depending on flour.
5. Add dried cranberries and mix.
6. Put teaspoon balls on lightly greased cookie sheets. DO NOT touch with hands.  Use two spoons to form balls.  Store bowl in freezer between batches.   The key to moist scones is to keep the batter as cool as possible and to handle as little as possible.  Cook for 15 min on 350 degrees.
