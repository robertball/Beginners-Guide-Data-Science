Ingredients:
BROWN SUGAR OAT STREUSEL
2/3 cups (60g) old-fashioned or quick oats
1/2 cup (100g) light or dark brown sugar
2 Tablespoons (16g) all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup (60g) unsalted butter, cold
1 Tablespoon (10g) semi-sweet chocolate chips (optional)
ZUCCHINI BREAD & MUFFINS
1 large egg, beaten
1/2 cup (100g) light or dark brown sugar
1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil*
1 cup grated zucchini (about 1 large)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 and 1/2 cups (190g) all-purpose flour (careful not to overmeasure)
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3/4 cup (135g) semi-sweet chocolate chips, optional (or use pecans or walnuts)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Spray a 9x5 (or 8x4) loaf pan with nonstick spray. If making muffins, preheat oven to 425F degrees and spray a 12-count pan with nonstick spray. Set aside.
Make the streusel first by combining the oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and flour together in a medium bowl. Cut in the cold butter with two knives or a pasty cutter (preferred) - or you may use your hands. Mix until the streusel resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the chocolate chips with a spoon. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the beaten egg, brown sugar, granulated sugar, oil, zucchini, and vanilla until evenly combined.
In a large bowl, toss the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and chocolate chips together. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix with a large wooden spoon or rubber spatula until combined. Avoid over mixing.
If making muffins, fill 9-10 muffin cups all the way to the top. Press the streusel into the tops of each muffin. Bake for 5 minutes at 425F degrees and, keeping the muffins in the oven, lower the oven temperature to 350F degrees and continue to bake for an additional 13-14 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Allow to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before serving.
