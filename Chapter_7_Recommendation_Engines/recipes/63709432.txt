Ingredients:
2 cups grated zucchini ( about 1 medium)
1 egg
1/2 cup grated Parmesan Cheese
optional: 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, salt & pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Spray a mini muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray. In a bowl mix the zucchini, egg, cheese and cilantro. You do not have to add any salt or pepper since the Parmesan is salty enough . Evenly divide the mixture into the mini muffin pan filling to the top, packed down in each cup. Bake for 15- 18 minutes until golden brown around the edges.
