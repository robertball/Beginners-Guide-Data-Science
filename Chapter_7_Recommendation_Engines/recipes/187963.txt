Ingredients:
¼ cup butter
2 (3 ounce) packages Oriental-flavor ramen noodle soup, seasoning packet reserved
½ cup slivered almonds
¼ cup sesame seeds
1 (16 ounce) package broccoli coleslaw mix
½ cup chopped green onion
½ cup salad oil
¼ cup apple cider vinegar
½ cup white sugar
2 tablespoons soy sauce

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave. Crush the ramen noodles into small pieces; stir the crushed noodles, almonds, and sesame seeds into the butter. Spread the mixture onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and crunchy, 8 to 10 minutes; allow to cool completely.
Toss together the coleslaw mix and the green onion in a large bowl.
Whisk together the salad oil, vinegar, sugar, soy sauce, and reserved seasoning packets in a separate bowl; stir the noodle mixture into the dressing. Pour the dressing over the coleslaw mix and toss to coat.
