2 teaspoons cayenne pepper, or to taste

Grease a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-low heat. Add sugar snap peas, cherry tomatoes, fruit and nut mix, mushrooms, bell pepper, and chia seeds. Stir-fry about 2 minutes. Season with cayenne, garlic, and salt. Cook and stir about 2 minutes more.
Stir in egg whites slowly, mixing until they are cooked through, but not crusty, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer stir-fry to a large bowl and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Let cheese melt and serve.
