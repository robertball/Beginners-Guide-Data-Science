Ingredients:
2 cups sourdough starter
2 tbs sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 egg, beaten
4 tbs oil (or melted butter)
1 tsp baking soda mixed thoroughly in 1 tbs warm water

Directions:
In a non metal bowl, combine starter, eggs, sugar, salt and oil, and mix well.  Get griddle warm and then add the baking soda/water mixture and mix well.  The mixture will foam up like meringue.  Let sit for 1 minute, then pour 3 inch diameter cakes onto griddle.  They only take about 1 minute per side, will bubble up nicely, and brown.  Flip for another minute and serve.
Optional:  add blueberries, pineapple chunks, or other fruits to the batter immediately after pouring it on the griddle if desired.
NOTE: These will not be like traditional pancakes.  They will be very thin, and light.  If you like a more dense cake, add some flour to the batter until the desired consistency is reached.

Description: 
Light and fluffy, almost crepe like.  If you did it right, you should be able to see through them.  Top with the topping of your liking, or do like I do... eat them plain!  YUM!
