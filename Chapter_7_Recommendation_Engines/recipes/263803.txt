Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook bamboo shoots for 5 minutes. Drain.
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat and cook curry paste until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add pork, increase heat and cook until starting to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add bamboo shoots, coconut milk, and red bell pepper. Reduce heat and bring to a simmer. Season with sugar and salt; simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in kaffir lime leaves. Cook for 1 more minute. Season with fish sauce. Stir in Thai basil and serve.

Description: 
This is a classic Thai green curry (kaeng kiau wan) and my favorite curry of all time! You can substitute chicken or tofu for the pork, but make sure you serve it with lots of jasmine rice.
