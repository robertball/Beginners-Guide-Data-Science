Ingredients:
6 cups popped popcorn
2 cups crushed corn flakes
1 (10 ounce) bag egg-shaped malted milk balls (such as WhoppersÂ® Robin Eggs)
2 (6 ounce) packages white chocolate baking squares
3 tablespoons malted milk powder
2 tablespoons shortening

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Mix popcorn, corn flakes, and malted milk balls in a large bowl.
Place white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until white chocolate is completely melted, stirring after each 1-minute interval. Stir malted milk powder and shortening through the melted white chocolate until smooth.
Pour white chocolate mixture over popcorn mixture; toss to evenly coat. Spread popcorn mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes. Break apart and store in an airtight container.
