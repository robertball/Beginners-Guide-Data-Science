Ingredients:
2 cups precooked cornmeal (such as P.A.N.Â®)
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup butter
1 cup water
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup shredded mild Cheddar cheese
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, black pepper, paprika, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Add butter; use fingers to crumble into flour until the mixture resembles peas.
Combine water and milk in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer and remove from heat. Pour into cornmeal mixture; stir rapidly until dough forms a soft ball that separates from the sides of the bowl. Add Cheddar cheese; stir to combine.
Cover bowl with a clean dish cloth; allow dough to rest for 5 minutes.
Scoop a heaping teaspoon of dough; using your hands, form a ball and then roll into a stick. Repeat with remaining dough.
Heat oil in a large skillet; fry sticks until golden, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
