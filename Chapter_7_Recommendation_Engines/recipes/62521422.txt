Ingredients:
1 pounds ground beef
1/4 cup breadcrumbs
2 eggs
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon dried italian seasoning
1/4 cup minced onion (optional)
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons ketchup
4 tablespoons steak sauce
1 slice diced bacon

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, bacon, bread crumbs, eggs, cheese, seasoning and onion and season with salt and pepper to taste.
For meatballs: Form mixture into golf size balls and brown in a large skillet over medium heat for 5 to 10 minutes, or until well browned. Add to your favorite spaghetti sauce and simmer until meatballs are completely cooked through, about 15 to 20 minutes.
For meatloaf: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add 3 tablespoons ketchup to mixture, mix well, form into a loaf and place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 75 to 90 minutes.
For burgers: Add 3 to 4 tablespoons steak sauce to mixture, mix well and form into patties. Saute in a large skillet over medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or to desired doneness.
