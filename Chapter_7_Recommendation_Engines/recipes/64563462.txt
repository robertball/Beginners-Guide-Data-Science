Ingredients:
22 oz (600 grams) Bone-In Rib Eye Steak
1 tbls. vegetable oil
1 tbls. garlic powder
1 tbls. seasoned salt
1 tbls. cracked black pepper

Directions:
1.  Preheat oven to 275 degs. F (135C).
2.  Remove steak from fridge.  Season with salt, pepper and garlic. Let set until it reaches room temp.  Cooking at room temp, ensures more even cooking - that's a big chunk of meat!
3. Drizzle oil on steak and in HOT pan.  Sear on all sides, until nice and brown.
4. Put steak in a baking dish and place in pre-heated oven.  Bake for 1 hr for well, 45 mins. for med and 30 mins. for med rare - again adjust your cooking time.  I don't use the baking pan, I just stick my stainless pan in the oven.
5.  Remove from oven.  Cover with foil and let rest for 8-10 mins.

Description: 
I'm not much of a steak eater, but I found this recipe for rib eyes and it's been foolproof so far.  Takes a little while, but well worth it, in my humble opinion.  So tender and juicy.  Original recipe calls for a 22 oz bone-in, but I use about a 6-8 oz one.  Just adjust your time.
