Description: 
A sweet desert made with glutinous rice flour (also called sweet rice flour) and red bean paste. This recipe was given to me by my Chinese sister-in-law.  It is a favorite of my family.  It has a firm custard-like texture which is different to many western palates.  (Note: this is naturally a gluten free food!)
