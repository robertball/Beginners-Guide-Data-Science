Ingredients:
1/3 cup honey
1/4 cup ketchup
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 pound chicken breast, cut into 1-inch cubes

Directions:
Mix honey, ketchup, olive oil, sesame seeds, soy sauce, lemon juice, Sriracha sauce, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and ginger in a bowl until well combined. Add chicken pieces and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Transfer chicken and sauce into an oven-proof dish.
Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. Remove from oven and turn chicken pieces over. Bake until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 8 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
This is a 'healthier' version of honey-sesame chicken. It is baked instead of fried and the chicken is not battered, making it healthier. All the flavors are here and the only thing sacrificed are the calories! Serve over rice with additional sauce on the side.
