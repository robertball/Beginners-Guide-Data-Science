Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon paprika
4 slices fully cooked ham
1 cup soft bread crumbs
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup mayonnaise
SAUCE:
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese
2 tablespoons white wine or chicken broth

Directions:
Flatten the chicken to 1/2-in. thickness. Spread mustard on one side; sprinkle with paprika. Top with a ham slice. Roll up tightly; secure with toothpicks.
In a bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and pepper.
Brush chicken with mayonnaise; roll in crumb mixture. Place in a shallow 2-qt. microwave-safe dish; cover loosely. Microwave on high for 7 minutes. Turn the chicken; cook 7 minutes longer or until juices run clear. Remove toothpicks; set aside and keep warm.
In a 1-qt. microwave-safe dish, heat the butter on high for 30 seconds; stir in the flour until smooth. Cook, uncovered, on high for 30 seconds. Add milk and salt. Cook 3-4 minutes longer or until thickened. Stir in cheese until smooth. Add the wine or broth. Serve over chicken.
