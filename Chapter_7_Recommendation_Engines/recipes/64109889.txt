Ingredients:
2 T olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
Kosher salt and pepper
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
T chili powder
2 tsp ground cumin
1 1/4 lb lean ground turkey
1 28-oz can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
15-oz can refried beans
15-oz can black beans, rinsed
15-oz can kidney beans, rinsed
2 4-oz cans fire-roasted diced chiles
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
Sour cream, grated cheese and tortilla chips, for serving

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion, season with 1/2 tsp each salt and pepper and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until tender, 6 to 8 minutes.
Stir in the garlic, chili powder and cumin and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the turkey and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until it begins to brown, about 4 minutes.
Add the tomatoes (and their juices), beans, chiles and chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Serve with the sour cream, cheese and chips, if desired.
