1 1/2 tbsp. butter

2 cloves of garlic, minced
2 large chicken boullion cubes
Water

In a large soup pan (I use a 6.2L pan.) melt the butter over medium heat and add the leek.  Saute until tender.
Add the potatoes, carrots, and zucchini.
Add the curry powder, parsley, garlic, and chicken boullion cubes.
Add water until vegetables are totally covered.
Add salt and pepper.
Simmer over medium-low heat until vegetables are all tender.
