Ingredients:
5 eggs
2 tablespoons water
3/4 cup white sugar (1/2 + 1/4)
2/3 cup flour
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
pinch of salt
------- Whipped Cream filling ------
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
------- Fudge Frosting ------
2oz bitter chocolate
1/2 cup milk or cream
1 1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon Vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). Line one 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 inch jelly roll pan (cookie sheet) with parchment paper and grease and flour lightly.
--------- Chocolate Roll ---------
Separate the eggs.
Beat the whites until stiff. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup of the sugar.
Beat the egg yolks, water and 1/4 cup sugar until thick
Sift the cocoa, flour and other dry ingredients together.
Fold the flour mixture into them.
Carefully fold the egg whites into the flour/egg yolk mixture.
Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) for 10-15 minutes.
Let cake cool for 5 minutes.
Turn cake onto a towel sprinkled with confectioner's sugar, peel off parchment paper and roll cake up with the towel. Let cake cool completely.
--------- Cream Filling ---------
Cream must be very cold, beat until stiff then add sugar gradually and the vanilla. Continue beating until quite firm.
Unroll cake and spread with the whipped cream. Roll again.
--------- Fudge Frosting ---------
Melt Chocolate over very low heat.
Add milk and sugar.  Turn up heat slightly (not too hot) and boil (slow boil) until a few drops form a soft ball in cold water, at least 7 minutes (better to boil too long than too short).
Add butter and vanilla.
Let stand undisturbed a few minutes, then beat until cool enough to spread/pour.  If too thick, stir in a little cream.
I prefer to refrigerate till cold and then serve.  You can serve immediately and allow your guests to pour the frosting themselves, while frosting is still hot/warm.
Serves 10.
