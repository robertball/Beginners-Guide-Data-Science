Ingredients:
1 cup self raising flour
1/4 cup of butter
a few splashes of milk
some veggies and meat for toppings (I used lean beef sausage, thinly sliced red pepper (capsicum), mushrooms, grated zucchini and garlic)
some grated cheese
Olive oil spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200°C. Lightly spray a pan with cooking spray.
Make dough by mixing self raising flour with butter and rubbing until you get breadcrumb type mixture. (you can grate the butter straight from the fridge).
Slowly add milk a splash at a time and stirring with a spoon each time until you get a dough.
Knead with hands in a bowl, adding a little flour if it’s too sticky and split into 3 pieces.
Put dough on oiled baking tray and smoosh with fingers until it is the right size, it doesn’t have to be even.
Spread on some tomato sauce straight from the jar.
Sautée your veggies (like I did) or leave them raw, whatever you guys like. Add them to the tomato sauce. Top with grated cheese.
Put in the oven for about 10 minutes. Let them cool and cut them up in little pieces.
