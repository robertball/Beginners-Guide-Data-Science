Description: 
A crispy outside with thick softness within - my family won't stop enjoying them every week!
 The fact that this recipe is simple to remember and asks for minimal amounts of perishables makes it great for camp-outs or fund-raising breakfasts.
 This recipe is from a friend who used it to make fantastic pancakes: Thanks Mr. Hannula!
