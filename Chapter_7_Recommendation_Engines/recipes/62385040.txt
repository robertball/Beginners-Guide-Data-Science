Ingredients:
bananas
1/2 gallon Neapolitan ice cream (easiest if it's in a square container)
graham cracker crumbs
melted butter
chopped pecans or walnuts (your preference)
1 cup chocolate chips
1/2 cup butter
2 cups confectioner's sugar
1 1/2 cups evaporated milk

Directions:
Make a graham cracker crust and press into the bottom only of a 9 x 13 pan.
On top of crust, place a single layer of sliced bananas, cut in 1/4 inch slices (cut in discs, as you would slice a banana to put on top of cereal, and place them closely together so they cover the entire crust.)
Cut the box of ice cream evenly into slices and layer on top of bananas. (Be sure to cut so that each slice has all three flavors of ice cream in it.)
Sprinkle a handful of chopped nuts loosely on top and freeze hard (at least 4 hours.)
In a small saucepan, melt chocolate chips and butter over medium heat.
Add confectioner's sugar and evaporated milk.
Stir over heat until very thick.
Allow to cool completely and spread over frozen ice cream.
Top with another handful of nuts if desired.
Freeze overnight.
To serve, let sit on counter 10 minutes or so to make cutting easier.
