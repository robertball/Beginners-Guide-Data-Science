Ingredients:
3 eggs, lightly beaten
3 tablespoons milk
1 1/2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
2 tablespoons parsley
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
4 pork chops

Directions:
In a small bowl, beat together the eggs and milk.
In a separate small bowl, mix the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and parsley.
Heat the olive oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium heat.
Stir in the garlic, and cook until lightly browned.
Remove garlic, reserving for other uses.
Dip each pork chop into the egg mixture, then into the bread crumb mixture, coating evenly.
Place coated pork chops in the skillet, and brown about 5 minutes on each side.
Place the skillet and pork chops in the oven, and cook at 325Â° for 25 minutes, or until juices run clear.
