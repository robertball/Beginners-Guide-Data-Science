Ingredients:
1 pound sweet Italian pork sausage, casing removed
1 (26 ounce) jar PregoÂ® Traditional Italian Sauce
1/2 cup sliced pitted ripe olives
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
4 cups large tube-shaped pasta (ziti, rigatoni), cooked and drained

Directions:
Cook the sausage in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat until the sausage is well browned, stirring frequently to break up meat. Pour off any fat.
Stir in the pasta sauce, olives and garlic powder. Heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes or until the sausage is cooked through.
Stir in the cheese and pasta. Serve with additional cheese, if desired.
