Ingredients:
2 large oranges
1 large lemon
1 large lime
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
4 eggs
1 pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1 tablespoon milk
2 teaspoons white sugar

Directions:
Wash the oranges, lemon, and lime thoroughly and slice as thinly as possible.  Combine the sliced fruit, 2 cups of the sugar and the nutmeg in a large bowl.  Toss to combine.  Let stand for at least 2 hours or up to overnight, stirring occasionally.
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Beat eggs in a small bowl.  Line a 9 inch pie pan with one half of the prepared pastry.  Remove the sliced fruit from the bowl and arrange in the crust, leaving any accumulated juices behind.  Pour the beaten eggs over fruit.
Place the top crust on the pie, crimp the edges, and poke decorative holes to vent.  Brush crust with milk and sprinkle with the remaining 2 teaspoons of sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.  Reduce the oven heat to 350 degrees F and bake pie until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 additional minutes.
Allow pie to cool and refrigerate.  Serve cold.

Description: 
This pie is perfect for people who think that traditional pies (pecan, cherry, etc.) are just too sweet. It puts a light and tangy spin on any holiday, or picnic! It was a huge hit at Thanksgiving this year, and I plan to make it again for Christmas!
