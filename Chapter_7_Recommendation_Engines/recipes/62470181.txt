Description: 
In high school, my boyfriend's mother used to make this dish for lunch on Sundays after we all got home from church.  I have tried to recreate it over the past 15 years, but it was never quite the same.  Just recently, I found her on facebook and was able to get the original recipe from her!!!  PLEASE ENJOY... this is one of my FAVORITES!!
