Ingredients:
12 oz fresh cranberries
20 oz can crushed pineapple, with juice
1/2 c orange juice
12 oz honey
1 c chopped pecans
If you'd like it sweeter add some brown sugar.  I like mine tart.
Optional:
1/4 c brown sugar
1/4 tsp cinnamon

Directions:
Combine all ingredients except the pecans,  into a large sauce pan over low heat.  Cover for the first ten minutes or until cranberries have burst.   Remove cover and simmer on low for up to 60 minutes to reduce to your preferred consistency,  stirring occasionally.  Add chopped pecans during the last 5 minutes.  Pour into an attractive dish for optimal presentation.
