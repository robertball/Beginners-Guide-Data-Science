2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent rolls

1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 teaspoons milk
1/4 cup chopped walnuts

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Separate dough into 16 triangles.
In small bowl, combine sugar, flour and cinnamon. Dip 1 marshmallow in butter, roll in sugar mixture.  Place marshmallow on wide end of triangle. Roll up, starting at wide end of triangle and rolling to opposite point. Completely cover marshmallow with dough; firmly pinch edges to seal.
