Ingredients:
1 box of your favorite family size brownie mix (for 13 x 9 inch baking pan)
1 bag M&M;'s Brand Milk Chocolate Candies for the Holidays
1 16 oz. container cream cheese or vanilla frosting

Directions:
1. Prepare the brownie mix according to the directions on the box.
2. Mix 1 cup of M&M's Brand Milk Chocolate Candies for the Holidays into the batter before spreading it evenly around a lightly greased 9 x 13 inch baking pan.
3. Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 28 minutes. To check: insert a toothpick an inch away from the side of the pan, it should come clean.
4. Allow the brownies to completely cool.
5. Spread the top of the brownies with frosting, then randomly dot with red and green M&M's Milk Chocolate Candies for the Holidays. Cut the brownies into squares (6 lines across and 4 lines down).
