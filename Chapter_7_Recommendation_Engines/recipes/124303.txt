Description: 
THIS cookie recipe comes close to the wonderful taste of chocolate that Mama was able to produce in her cakes and cookies.   Because of the 'crackles' in these cookies, my granddaughter tells me I've made a mistake when I bake them. 'But they taste so good,' she adds. -Ruth Cain, Hartselle, Alabama
