Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 cup chopped celery
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/2 (16 ounce) package bow-tie pasta (farfalle)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, celery, garlic, and red pepper flakes in the hot oil for about 5 minutes. Add shrimp, bay leaf, thyme, oregano, pepper, and rosemary. Reduce heat and let simmer until shrimp are bright pink, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain pasta.
Stir veggie and shrimp mixture into the drained pasta and serve.

Description: 
I used to make this skillet dinner with fresh Gulf shrimp just caught that morning in Louisiana, but it's still yummy with frozen shrimp here in Missouri. Pair it with crusty French bread and a glass of wine and you have good eatin'!
