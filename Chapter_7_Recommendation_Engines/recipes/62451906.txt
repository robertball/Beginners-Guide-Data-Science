Ingredients:
1 lb. boneless skinless chicken breasts
16 oz. ricotta cheese
8 oz. mozzarella cheese
3 green onions, chopped
1/4 tsp. garlic powder
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper
8 6-inch flour tortillas
Green sauce:
10 oz. can cream of chicken soup
small can diced green chiles
6 green pitted olives, minced
1/4 tsp. chili powder
1/4 tsp. garlic powder
salt and pepper

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the ingredients for the sauce. Heat to a boil; reduce to low and simmer. Season with salt and pepper taste.
Fill a separate saucepan with water and heat to a boil. On a cutting board, cut chicken into large chunks and place in water to poach. Boil until no longer pink in the middle. Place on a plate to cool.
In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, green onions, garlic powder, salt, pepper and 3/4 of the mozzarella, reserving some for top. Using your fingers, shred the chicken into bite-size pieces and mix into the cheese mixture.
On a flat surface, lay out a tortilla. Spoon 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture. Roll up the tortilla and place seam side down in a small baking dish. Repeat with all tortillas.
Microwave on high for 5 minutes. Pour the warm sauce over the top and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Microwave on high 3 minutes. Serve with guacamole.

Description: 
I created these one night because I had extra ricotta on hand. I was tired of the same old chicken enchiladas with sour cream. I even made them in the microwave because I don't have an oven.
