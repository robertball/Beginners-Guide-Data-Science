Ingredients:
1/2 zucchini, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch slices
1/2 small eggplant, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch slices
1 red bell pepper, quartered
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
ground black pepper to taste
1 small whole-grain baguette, cut into two halves and split lengthwise
1/4 cup basil pesto
4 ounces fresh baby mozzarella, sliced
2 plum tomatoes, sliced

Directions:
Combine zucchini, eggplant, and red bell pepper in a bowl. Sprinkle salt over the mixture. Set aside to allow the vegetables to tenderize, at least 3 hours.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Drain moisture from vegetable mixture. Brush vegetables with olive oil to coat; season with black pepper.
Cook vegetables on hot grill until tender, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
Toast cut sides of baguette in a toaster oven until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Spread basil pesto evenly over toasted surface. Arrange grilled vegetables evenly onto 2 of the baguette halves. Top each with sliced mozzarella and plum tomato slices; top sandwich with the remaining baguette pieces to serve.
