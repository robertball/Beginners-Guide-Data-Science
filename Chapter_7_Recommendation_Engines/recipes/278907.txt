Description: 
It's a family tradition to have tea with a citrus cake. In the pursuit of being able to enjoy this delicious treat and watch my diet and sugar intake, after thorough research, I came up with this recipe and I love it. It is very moist and it will make your house smell delicious, not to mention its charming orange flavor. I made it with olive oil and I promise it does not taste like it. I hope you enjoy it!
