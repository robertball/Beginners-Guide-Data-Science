Ingredients:
Ingredients:
1 handful (1/4 cup) of raisins
1 16 oz. package fettuccine or spaghetti
1 medium red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch square pieces
1 medium green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch square pieces
1 medium onion, chopped into 1-inch pieces
1 medium eggplant (can substitute butternut squash, summer squash or zucchini this dish is super flexible), peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
3/4 lb. large scallops, fresh or frozen (1 bag of Trader Joe’s frozen scallops works well. If you are not a seafood person, substitute an equal amount of turkey sausage)
1 handful (1/4 cup) of pine nuts
1 jar (~26 oz.) spaghetti sauce (Hunt’s traditional sauce is yummy and cheap)
3-4 leaves of fresh basil, chopped (or ¼ tsp. dried basil)
1-1/2 Tbsp. olive oil
4 cloves garlic, crushed

Directions:
Set the raisins in a small cup or bowl and cover with water, so they can plump up. Meanwhile, boil a large pot of water. Cook noodles to taste; set aside.
Add olive oil and crushed garlic to a large saucepan and heat over medium. Roast the peppers, onion and eggplant until tender; pepper to taste and transfer to a platter.
Add the scallops into the same saucepan used for the veggies. Cook until the pink just fades and they are nice and white. Drain the now plump raisins and add to the scallops along with the pine nuts, spaghetti sauce, veggies and noodles. Stir well to combine. Top with chopped basil. ENJOY!
