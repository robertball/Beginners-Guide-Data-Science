Description: 
These are olive appetizers I made one day after school, years ago. I came to find that they are great for social gatherings like hosted wine tastings and drink parties. Dry mixed drinks complement these appetizers well. They are easy to prepare ahead of time; you can refrigerate them until cooking time.
