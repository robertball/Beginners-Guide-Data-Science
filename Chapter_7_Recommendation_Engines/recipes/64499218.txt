Ingredients:
1/2 medium butternut squash, cut into bite-sized cubes
2 cloves of garlic, chopped
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 can of black beans
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
pinch of salt
1 yellow onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 box of mexican/spanish rice (optional)
1 lime, cut into slices
1/2 cup green onions, chopped
1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
8 small taco shells

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 375.
Combine cubed butternut squash, 1 tablespoon oil, garlic and red pepper flakes into a large mixing bowl and mix to coat. Once coated, lay the mixture out on a baking sheet and put in pre-heated oven. Cook until tender, about 25 minutes.
While the squash mixture is baking, warm the black beans in a small saucepan with the cumin, chili powder and salt. Cook on medium-low to let the flavors mix, about 10 minutes
Meanwhile,  add the other tablespoon of oil to a frying pan and cook the onions and red pepper. Cook on medium-high until tender, about 5 or 10 minutes. Optionally, you can make some mexican rice according to the box, and add the onions and red peppers to that instead.
Warm the taco shells on a flat pan, flipping until cooked.
Fill shells with squash mixture, beans and salsa (and/or rice). Top with cilantro and green onion. Garnish with lime.
Makes enough for 4 people, 2 or 3 tacos each.
Tip: Sometimes, I forgo the mexican rice and make cilantro lime rice instead. Either way, it's a delicious meal!
