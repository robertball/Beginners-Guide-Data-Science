Description: 
This is similar to an alfredo sauce with vegetables and herbs. This recipe was customized to omit the hot pepper to turn down the heat in this creamy shrimp and scallop sauce. Fresh basil, thyme and parsley add just the right counterpoint, while Parmesan cheese adds its own sharp flavors. Perfect over fettucine!Modified from: Cajun Seafood Pasta revised as suggested AND omitted swiss cheese
