Ingredients:
1 serving cooking spray
6 tablespoons warm water
2 envelopes unflavored gelatin
1 1/3 cups white sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup, plus
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1/4 cup water
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon pure peppermint extract
red food coloring
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Line a 9x9 pan with plastic wrap, leaving enough overhang to cover the top.  Spray plastic wrap lightly with cooking spray.   Place the 6 tablespoons of warm water in a large bowl, and sprinkle gelatin on top.  Let gelatin soften in the water for 5 minutes.
Combine the white sugar, corn syrup, and 1/4 cup water in a tall saucepan.  Bring to a boil, stirring constantly.  Boil for one full minute, 240 degrees F on a candy thermometer.  Pour the hot syrup over the softened gelatin, and add the salt.  Beat at high speed with an electric mixer until the mixture increases in volume and holds a peak, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Stir in the vanilla and peppermint extracts.
Pour into prepared pan, add several drops of red food coloring, and swirl with a toothpick.  Cover lightly with plastic wrap, and let stand at room temperature for 4 hours.  Cut into 18 squares, using a knife sprayed with cooking spray. Combine cornstarch and powdered sugar in a bowl. Toss cut marshmallows in the reserved powdered sugar mixture. Store in airtight container or resealable plastic bag.

Description: 
These easy, fluffy marshmallows have a hint of peppermint.  They are wonderful with chocolate fondue and melt delightfully in hot chocolate.  A great treat for winter!
