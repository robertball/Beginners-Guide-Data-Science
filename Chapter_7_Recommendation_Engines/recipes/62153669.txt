To cook sauce, heat olive oil over medium heat in a large iron skillet or heavy saucepan. Add garlic and cook until tender. Add fresh tomatoes and cook until heated through.

Description: 
After you've had this sauce, you will never make another sauce again!  If you want to reduce acidity, you can add 1-2 Tablespoons of sugar to your sauce.  I like to also add 1/4 cup of Chiante red wine.  All fresh ingredients is recommended, but it will still be good with what you have on hand.  For best results, let sauce simmer 1-4 hours.
