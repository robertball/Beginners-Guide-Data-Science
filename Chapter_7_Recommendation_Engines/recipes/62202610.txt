Ingredients:
1 cup skim milk
1 15 oz. can sweetened cream of coconut
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup sweetened coconut flakes
2 canned pineapple slices, rinsed and diced

Directions:
Whisk coconut cream and milk in a bowl.
Stir in heavy cream and coconut flakes.
Pour the mixture into prepared ice cream maker and turn the machine on.
Dice pineapple slices into chocolate chip-size chunks (1/4" x 1/4").
After approximately 15 minutes or when the ice cream begins to thicken, add the pineapple chunks into the ice cream maker and let the machine run for another 15 minutes.
If consistency is too soft for your liking, store ice cream in freezer-safe container for at least an hour and it should be as set as store-bought ice cream.
