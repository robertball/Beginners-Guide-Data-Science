Description: 
Besides being tasty, this soup is also low in calories and fat, inexpensive, and very quick to make. The ingredients are ones that I usually stock in my kitchen, but aren't expensive to buy if you don't. They can be used in many other ways, too, so you won't be wasting anything. This soup reheats and freezes well.
