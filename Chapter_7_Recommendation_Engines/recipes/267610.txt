Ingredients:
For the Sauce:
3 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste), or to taste
1/4 cup hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon ketchup
1/3 cup seasoned rice vinegar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon finely grated ginger
3 small zucchini, cubed
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 1/4 pounds ground pork
2 fresh cayenne peppers, seeded and minced, or to taste
1/4 cup sliced green onions, white and light green parts only
1 (14 ounce) package firm tofu, cubed
1 sprig fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)

Directions:
Combine gochujang, hoisin sauce, ketchup, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger. Whisk sauce and set aside.
Toss zucchini with salt in a large bowl. Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes to draw out the liquid. Drain in a colander, rinse, and let zucchini continue to drain.
Cook pork in a pan over high heat, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add cayenne peppers and green onions; cook and stir for 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium. Stir in the sauce; simmer until bubbling, 1 to 2 minutes.
Add tofu and the drained zucchini. Cook, stirring often, until zucchini is tender yet crisp to the bite, about 5 minutes. Turn off heat and stir in cilantro.

Description: 
If you can't decide what to make for dinner, try this spicy pork and vegetable tofu dish: fast, easy, and tasty, it checks all the boxes for a satisfying meal and acts as a catch-all for any seasonal produce. All the individual ingredients taste distinct while blending seamlessly into one harmonious flavor bomb. Zucchini is our favorite veggie to showcase, especially if you take the extra 15 minutes to salt it, but pretty much any vegetables will shine.
