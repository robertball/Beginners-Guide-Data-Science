Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into strips
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 small onion, chopped
2  apples - peeled, cored and chopped
¼ cup mild green tomatillo salsa

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place the chicken strips in the skillet, and sprinkle with the red wine vinegar. Season with 1/2 the pepper, 1/2 the oregano, 1/2 the garlic powder, and 1/2 the nutmeg. Cook 5 minutes, turn, and season with remaining pepper, oregano, garlic powder, and nutmeg.
Place the cilantro, onion, and apples over the chicken in the skillet. Cover, and continue cooking 5 minutes, until chicken juices run clear and apples are slightly tender.
Place the tomatillo salsa in a bowl, and cook in the microwave 2 minutes on High, or until heated through. Serve over the cooked chicken and apples.
