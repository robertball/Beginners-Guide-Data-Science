Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 egg yolk
1 1/2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest
1 teaspoon lemon extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat butter and cream cheese together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Mix in sugar until light and fluffy. Add egg yolk, lemon zest, lemon extract, and vanilla extract. Mix well. Add flour and salt gradually until dough is combined.
Shape dough into small logs; place a log into a cookie press and press out onto ungreased cookie sheets. Repeat with remaining dough logs.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 12 to 14 minutes.
