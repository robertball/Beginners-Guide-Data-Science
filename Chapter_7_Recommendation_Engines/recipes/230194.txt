Ingredients:
1 cup orange juice
1 cup water
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup honey
2 (12 ounce) packages cranberries
2 cups blueberries
1 cup raspberries
1 orange, juiced and zested
1/8 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

Directions:
Stir 1 cup orange juice, water, sugar, and honey together in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil and stir cranberries, blueberries, raspberries, orange juice, and orange zest into mixture. Reduce heat to low and simmer, mashing berries occasionally to create a thicker texture, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir pumpkin pie spice into sauce. Refrigerate at least 3 hours up to overnight before serving.

Description: 
Great semisweet recipe for those who prefer less white sugar in their cranberry sauce. The blueberries and raspberries give it an added flair. Great on pie and turkey, it has become a favorite part of our holiday meals. Add more sugar or honey for a sweeter sauce.
