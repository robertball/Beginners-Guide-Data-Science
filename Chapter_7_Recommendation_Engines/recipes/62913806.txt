https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1/2 cup orange marmalade
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
4 salmon fillets (6 ounces each)

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the first six ingredients; set aside 1/4 cup. Brush remaining glaze over salmon.
Moisten a paper towel with cooking oil; using long-handled tongs, lightly coat the grill rack. Place salmon skin side down on grill rack. (I put a sheet of heavy aluminum foil in the grates and cooked the salmon on it.)
Grill, covered, over medium heat or broil 4 in. from the heat for 10-12 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork, basting occasionally with remaining glaze. Yield: 4 servings.
