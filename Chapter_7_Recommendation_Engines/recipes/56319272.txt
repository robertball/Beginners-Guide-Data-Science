Ingredients:
1 cup red onion, chopped
1 cup green bell pepper, chopped
1 cup red bell pepper, chopped
1 cup celery, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained & rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can black-eyed peas, drained & rinsed
2 (12 ounce) cans white shoepeg corn, drained
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup sugar or Splenda
3/4 cup canola oil (not olive oil)

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together red onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, celery, black beans, black-eyed peas and white shoepeg corn.
In a seperate bowl, mix together the oil, sugar, cider vinegar, salt and pepper until the sugar is dissolved.  I usually mix up a little more vinegar with a splash of oil and throw in some more Splenda...  I like vinegar!
Add this to the bean mixture, stirring to coat everything.
Cover and chill in the refrigerator approximately 1/2 hours.
Serve with Tostitos Scoops Tortilla Chips.
