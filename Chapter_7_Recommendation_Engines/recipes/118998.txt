Description: 
Creamy Tortellini Carbonara sent in by Cathy Croyle calls for only five ingredients and comes together in mere moments.    The Davidsville, Pennsylvania cook simmers a rich bacon and Parmesan cheese sauce in one pan while boiling packaged tortellini to perfection in another. Then she combines the two to create a memorable main dish.    'Add more cheese or additional parsley to the sauce to fit your family's taste,' Cathy recommends.
