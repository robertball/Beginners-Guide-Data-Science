Making fluffy brown rice: Add the water, rice, olive oil and salt.  Do not stir.  Bring this to a boil and reduce to low and cover.  Simmer until the water has been absorbed.  Remove from the heat and let sit for 10 minutes before fluffing and serving.
The Ragout:Add the Olive Oil to the hot pan.
Add garlic, red pepper flakes and shallot and saute for 45 seconds.
Add the tomatoes and begin to stew them down for about 5 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper.
Add the chicken stock and cook until it begins to reduce and thicken up.  About 10 minutes.
Add the rinsed beans and torn basil and heat them through - about 2 minutes.
Spoon the rice onto each plate and then spoon the ragout on top of the rice.

Description: 
This is a fantastic side dish that I like to serve with grilled chicken.  While this recipe will serve 4, it would also make a perfect main dish for 2.
