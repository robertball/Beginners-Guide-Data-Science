Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder

1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons milk
1 cup cooked and mashed sweet potatoes
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup golden raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F ( 165 degrees C ). Grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan.
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg cinnamon, and sugar. Add the eggs, oil, and milk; mix until well blended. Finally, stir in the mashed sweet potatoes, pecans, and golden raisins. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake for 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Allow bread to cool in the pan at least 15 minutes before removing. For best flavor, store overnight before serving.
