1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add egg and vanilla; mix well. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well. Divide dough into four equal portions; shape each into a 12-in. x 3/4-in. log. Place 4 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Make a 1/2-in. depression down center of logs; fill with jam.
Bake at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool for 2 minutes; cut diagonally into 3/4-in. slices. Remove to wire racks to cool completely.
