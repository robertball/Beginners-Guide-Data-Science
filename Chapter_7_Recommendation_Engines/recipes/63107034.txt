Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
6 strips of thick bacon
1/2 cup crushed buttery round crackers
1 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons steak sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir the ground beef, crushed crackers, 1 cups of Cheddar cheese, and onion soup mix in a large bowl until well combined.  Whisk the eggs, ketchup, and steak sauce in a separate bowl until smooth.  Mix the eggs into the meat until evenly combined, if the mixture seems too dry, add a little water. Press into a 9x5 inch loaf pan.  Top with remaining 1/2 cup of cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until the meatloaf reaches 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) and is no longer pink in the center, 45 to 60 minutes.
