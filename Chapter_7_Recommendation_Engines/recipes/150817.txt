Ingredients:
30 eggs
1 cup white sugar
1 cup light brown sugar
1 cup dark brown sugar
1 tablespoon allspice
1 teaspoon ground mace
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 tablespoon freshly ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon freshly ground cinnamon stick

Description: 
This eggnog is great for a crowd during the holiday season. It's very rich so a little goes a long way. Usually, 4 to 6 ounces per person is enough for a serving. The best part is that you can alter the liquors you like or make it without any liquor, too. Use brandy, or substitute Calvados, Cognac, Frangelico, Godiva, or Praline. Have a 4 gallon bowl or container handy to mix the eggnog, and plan to make this 30 days before your party so it seasons well.
