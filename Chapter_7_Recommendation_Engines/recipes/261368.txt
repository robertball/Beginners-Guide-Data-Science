Ingredients:
2 cups Belgian waffle mix (such as Aunt JemimaÂ®)
1 1/2 cups water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
cooking spray
1 pound chicken wings with skin
1 cup maple syrup
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Combine waffle mix, water, and vegetable oil in a large bowl; stir until no lumps remain. Let stand until thickened, 4 to 5 minutes.
Heat a Belgian waffle iron according to manufacturers' instructions. Grease with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 of the waffle batter into the iron; close and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Cool waffles on a wire rack.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cut waffles into small pieces. Stuff pieces between the meat and skin of the chicken wings. Place chicken wings on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until wings are golden brown and crisp, 45 to 50 minutes. Let cool.
Bring maple syrup to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in cayenne pepper. Simmer until thickened to a glaze, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
Combine cooled chicken wings and maple glaze in a large bowl; toss until coated.

Description: 
Love chicken and waffles? Then you will love these wings! Waffle pieces are stuffed inside a chicken wing, deep fried, and coated in a cayenne maple syrup. Use a homemade waffle mix, or a box mix, it doesn't matter. I  will be using a box mix in this recipe.
