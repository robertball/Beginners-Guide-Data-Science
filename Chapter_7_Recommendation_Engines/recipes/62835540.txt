Description: 
Delicious, healthy, and filling turkey taco nachos that everyone will love.  You can top it with your favorite taco toppings such as lettuce, pico de gallo, light sour cream, or guacamole.  I use pre-chopped and pre-shredded vegetables and pico de gallo from the grocery store to save preparation time on a weeknight.  I like to include chopped or shredded vegetables I have on hand to boost the nutrition.
