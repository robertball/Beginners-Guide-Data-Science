Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 medium onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup beef stock
1 cup frozen peas
2 carrots, diced
4 tablespoons tomato paste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste
Topping:
4 large potatoes, peeled and diced
1/4 cup butter
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, and beef. Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add stock, peas, carrots, tomato paste, parsley, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat and cover. Simmer until carrots are tender, about 20 minutes.
While beef mixture is cooking, place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Add Cheddar cheese and butter to the pot and mash together with the potatoes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Spoon beef mixture into a baking dish. Top with potato-cheese mash.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 30 minutes.
