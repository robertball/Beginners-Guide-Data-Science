Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
3 medium apples - peeled, cored and thinly sliced
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
add 1 t vanilla, 1/2 t nutmeg, cut the apples (granny smith) into chunks instead of slices. Also top the batter with 3 T. softened butter, 1/3 brown sugar and 1/2 t cinnamon mixed together until crumbly. For me, it seemed to take closer to an hour to bake it

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9 inch baking dish.
In a large bowl, beat together the melted butter, sugar, and egg until fluffy. Fold in the apples and walnuts. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon. Stir the flour mixture into the wet mixture until just blended. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared baking dish.
Bake 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

Description: 
This was my Mom's recipe. Easy and quick to make. Apples and walnuts are packed into a cinnamon spiced blonde brownie. Always a hit when I bring it to parties. Very moist and great to make in the fall when apples are plentiful.Modified from: Apple Brownies
