Description: 
This recipe is so quick (and easy, as the title suggests!)  It makes quite a bit.  I usually make it around a holiday season and keep it on hand to put out whenever people pop over. We happen to love garlic, so I use a heavy hand when making ours, but the recipe is so adaptable...that's what I like about this one.
