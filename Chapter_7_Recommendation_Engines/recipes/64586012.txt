Description: 
After trying a recipe for slow cooker chili mac and seeing others for tortellini chili, I had this idea for a version of American Goulash. As a child, my mom made American Goulash often and always added corn, so I included southwest-style corn in this version. You don't need to cook the tortellini separately, so it saves you another pot to wash. This is very easy to make, filling comfort food!
