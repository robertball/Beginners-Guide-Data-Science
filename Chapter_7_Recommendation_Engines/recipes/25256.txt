Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pear - peeled, cored and diced
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
1 egg
3 tablespoons milk
oil for deep frying

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.  Saute the pears until caramelized; set aside to cool.
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine flour, baking powder, salt and pepper; form a well in the center.  In a small, separate bowl beat the egg with the milk and pour into the dry ingredients; mix well.
Gently fold pears into the batter.
Heat deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drop batter by rounded spoonfuls into hot oil, and fry until golden brown. Drain briefly on paper towels. Serve hot.

Description: 
Pear fritters are SOOO good with ham! Really with any meat where a little sweetness is a good thing. This would be good with sausages in the morning, as well! Mmmmmm...
