Ingredients:
Sweet Dough:
1 Cup lukewarm milk at 110F-115F
2 1/2 tsp yeast
1/2 Cup sugar
4 1/2 Cups bread flour
1 tsp salt
1/3 Cup butter, melted and cooled to room temp
2 eggs, room temp
_______________________________________
Cinnamon Sugar Filling:
1 Cup brown sugar, packed
2 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon
1/3 Cup butter, room temp
_______________________________________
Cream Cheese Frosting:
3 oz cream cheese, room temp
1/4 Cup butter, room temp
1 1/2 Cups confectioners' sugar (may need more or less depending on desired consistency)
1/2 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Pour the milk over the sugar and yeast in a large bowl. Let it sit for ten minutes, do not stir.
Meanwhile, in another bowl, combine the bread flour and salt.
After yeast has been activated, add eggs and melted butter. Begin adding the flour in 1/2 to 1 cup increments until it is firm enough to roll by hand. Pour onto a lightly floured counter and knead, working in remaining flour, until gluten is fully developed. About 15 minutes.
Place dough into a well oiled bowl, oil the top and cover with plastic wrap. Place in fridge overnight or at least 8 hours.
In the morning, after dough has at least doubled, roll out to about 1/4" thickness on a lightly floured surface. If the dough is too elastic, cover and let rest ten minutes before you resume rolling. The ideal dimensions are 16x21. Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl, then spread butter over the rolled dough, leaving an 1" clear on the side farthest from you. Sprinkle over and press in the filling, then roll, sealing the clean 1" by wetting it slightly with water. Cut into 12 pieces with a sharp knife or dental floss, and set each individual piece onto a lightly floured or greased sheet pan or baking dish. Be sure there is at least an inch between each roll or the rise will be affected. Let set, covered, in a warm place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400F
Bake risen rolls until golden brown, about 15-17 minutes. While rolls are baking, prepare the cream cheese frosting;
Beat together cream cheese and butter until well combined. Sift in confectioners' sugar, bit by bit. Beat about 5 minutes until light and fluffy, then briefly beat in vanilla. Spread frosting on warm rolls before serving.

Description: 
These are the most delicious from scratch cinnamon rolls you'll ever have. They taste exactly like a clone of that sweet, gooey variety you find in the food court at the mall, except you won't have to interact with rude teenagers to get them!
