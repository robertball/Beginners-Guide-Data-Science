Ingredients:
2 lbs. turkey tenderloins, sliced 1/2 inch thick
1 large egg, beaten
1/4 cup milk
1 1/2 cups cornflake crumbs
1 tsp. coarse salt
3 tbsp. butter, divided
3 tbsp. olive oil, divided
1/2 cup chicken broth
2 tbsp. maple syrup
1/2 cup pecan halves

Directions:
Place the cutlets between sheets of plastic wrap and pound each cutlet to 1/4 inch thickness. In a shallow dish, combine the egg and milk and mix well. In a separate shallow dish combine the cornflakes and salt and mix well.
Dip the cutlets in the egg mixture and then in the cornflake mixture. Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet. Add a single layer of cutlets. Cook for 5 minutes or until no longer pink, turning once.
Place the cutlets on a serving plate and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining cutlets, adding the remaining butter and oil if needed.
Add the broth to the skillet and stir with a wooden spoon to loosen any brown bits. Cook on medium heat until liquid is reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir in the pecans and syrup. Cook for 2 minutes, or until the pecans are glazed, stirring frequently. Pour the sauce over the cutlets and serve.
