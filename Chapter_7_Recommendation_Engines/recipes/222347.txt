Description: 
This was the hit of my daughter's bridal shower brunch. I served 2 kinds of punch but had to make another batch of this one half way through the shower! One guest took the recipe and introduced it to her church where it became a staple at all gatherings. I like a stronger coffee flavor and sometimes use espresso granules.
