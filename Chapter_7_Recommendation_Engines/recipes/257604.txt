Ingredients:
1 cup coconut flour (such as Bob's Red Mill®)
1/3 cup low-calorie natural sweetener (such as Swerve®)
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
7 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup unsweetened almond milk
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup halved fresh cranberries
3 tablespoons minced jalapeno peppers
1 jalapeno, seeded and sliced into 12 rings

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
Combine coconut flour, sweetener, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Mix with a fork to break up any clumps. Add eggs, almond milk, and butter; stir vigorously. Add vanilla extract; stir until batter is smooth and well combined. Fold in cranberries and minced jalapeno peppers.
Scoop batter into the lined muffin cups. Place 1 jalapeno slice on top of each muffin.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the muffin tin for 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 10 minutes more.
