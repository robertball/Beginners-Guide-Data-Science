Ingredients:
6 cups frozen riced cauliflower
2 cups grated Parmesan cheese
2 cups grated mozzarella cheese
1 cup gluten-free baking mix (such as Wheat Belly)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dried basil
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder, or more to taste
3/4 teaspoon onion powder, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
Preheat an indoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly grease.
Place riced cauliflower into the bowl of a food processor and grind smaller if needed. Wring out excess water. Place into a large bowl and add Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, baking mix, salt, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, and oregano. Mix together by hand or with an electric mixer on low speed.
Apply 1 to 1 1/2 cups of batter to the grill and cook until golden, about 3 minutes per side. Let cool on a wire rack before using immediately or freezing.
