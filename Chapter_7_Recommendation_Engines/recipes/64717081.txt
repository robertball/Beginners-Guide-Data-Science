Ingredients:
Two 12 ounce packages Jimmy Dean pork sausages
1/3 to 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
4 cups milk, or as needed
kosher salt

Directions:
Cook sausage over medium heat until cooked through and nicely browned. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
Whisk 1/3 cup four into the rendered grease in the skillet. Whisk in the milk until smooth. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Adjust the gravy' s consistency if necessary: if it is is too thin, whisk in more four 1 tablespoon at a time, or if it too thick, add milk a couple tablespoons at a time.
