Ingredients:
2 cups black sesame seeds
2 cups walnut pieces

Directions:
Cook and stir the sesame seeds in a large skillet over medium heat until the seeds smell toasted and begin to pop, about 7 minutes. While toasting the sesame seeds, cook the walnuts in the microwave until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Allow the sesame seeds and walnuts to cool to room temperature.
Once cool, place the sesame seeds and walnuts into a blender. Blend until finely ground. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

Description: 
This is my Chinese husband's grandmother's recipe. We usually add it into our milk. Way awesome. You can even sprinkle it over mochi (rice cake). I've actually added into my banana bread recipe and it's sooooooooooooo good!! My husband raves about it. Have to try this! Use it in whatever sounds good to you. Milk, oatmeal, banana bread, on rice cakes, or even on toasted bread. Get creative. You may also add in some sugar depending on your taste. Enjoy!
