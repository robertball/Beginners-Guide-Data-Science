Ingredients:
4 TBL good olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 pkg (7 oz) fresh baby spinach
3/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 large pork tenderloin (about 1 1/4 pounds), butterflied
3/4 cup grated cheddar cheese
1 1/3 pints grape tomatoes

Directions:
Heat 2 TBL of olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add onion and cook for 1 minute. Add spinach, pushing it down into the skillet and 1/4 tsp each of salt and pepper. Cover and cook over medium heat for about 1 1/2 minutes, until the spinach is wilted. Remove the lid and cook, uncovered, until the liquid from the spinach has evaporated. Transfer to a plate; cool.
Trim the tenderloin of silverskin and fat.
Open up the butterflied tenderloin and pound it a little to extend it to about 12" long by 7" wide.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Arrange half of the spinach mixture down the center of the tenderloin; top with cheese. Add remaining spinach, fold in the sides and roll ternderloin back and forth to distribute and encase the filling. Wrap 2 strips of aluminum foil, each 1-2"wide, around the tenderloin to secure the stuffing inside.
Heat remaining 2 TBL of oil in a large ovenproof skillet. Sprinkle outside of the tenderloin with 1/4 tsp each of salt & pepper. Place tenderloin in the skillet & brown it, turning occassionally for about 5 minutes.
Remove the aluminum strips from teh meat & bake in oven for 10 minutes; it will be slightly pink in the center. Transfer to plate; cover. Keep warm in the oven.
