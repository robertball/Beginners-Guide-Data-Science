Ingredients:
1 large eggplant sliced into 1/4 inch thick half circles, salt to taste, about 8oz olive oil, 6 cloves chopped garlic, 3/4 bunch of Italian parsley chopped, 3/4 bunch of green onion chopped, 1 can diced tomatoes, 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Directions:
cover a large pan with olive oil and heat until hot
add slices of eggplant to cover the pan and sprinkle salt onto each slice
turn slices and cook until soft and have a light brownish color. The eggplant soaks a lot of oil in the process and so you will need to add oil as needed as you cook all of the eggplant.
Layer eggplant,garlic, parsley, and green onion in serving tray as each batch of eggplant is cooked
after the final batch, add can of tomatoes to whatever olive oil is left in the pan and sautee for a few minutes
when done pour out tomato and olive oil mixture over the layers of eggplant
refrigerate and let sit for at least an hour (ideally overnight)
