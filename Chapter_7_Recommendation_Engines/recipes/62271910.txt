Ingredients:
1/4 C Rice(uncooked)
1 pound Ground Beef(uncooked)
1 tsp Salt
1/4 tsp Pepper
1/2 Onion-chopped
2 Eggs
1 head Cabbage
6 C Tomato juice(48 oz can, or use vegetable juice)
1 Tbsp Sugar

Directions:
Soften cabbage leaves by boiling, or cut core out, place in microwaveable bowl with water in bottom and plastic wrap top. Microwave on high 5-6 minutes. Mix rest of ingredients except juice and sugar. Roll 2 Tbsp mix in softened cabbage leave (cutting thick white membrane out). Roll up one end, bring sides up, roll to end and place in pot bottom side down. Make some 'porcupines', meat mix loaves without wrapping cabbage around them for the cabbage haters. Cut any extra cabbage up and put in LARGE pot with rolls, sprinkle sugar over and pour juice over the top. Cover and cook on low heat for 2 hours. Do not stir pot, shake to keep from sticking, add juice if needed.
