Ingredients:
1 tablespoon of olive oil
3 to 4 yellow onions, chopped
2 ribs of celery, chopped
2 carrots, chopped
2½ teaspoons kosher salt
¾ teaspoon cayenne
1 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon fresh basil, chopped
3 Bay leaves
3 to 4 tablespoons tomato paste
1 cup of brandy
4 quarts of shrimp stock
½ stick of butter, softened
¼ cup all-purpose flour
8 oz heavy cream
3 lbs medium shrimp, peeled, deveined, and chopped
½ cup or more of chopped parsley, for garnish
½ cup or more of chopped green onions, for garnish

Directions:
Heat a large heavy soup pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
Add the olive oil, followed by the onions, celery, carrots, 1 teaspoon of the salt, 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. Cook, stirring, until the vegetables are soft. About 6 minutes.
Add the herbs, tomato paste, and brandy, and cook, stirring, for another 2 or 3 minutes.
Add the shrimp stock and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 1 hour.
Meanwhile, combine the butter and flour in a bowl and mix with your fingers until you have a smooth paste.
After the bisque has simmered for one hour, begin adding this mixture to the pot one tablespoon at a time, whisking after each time. [You're really making something of a roux here.]
Cook for another 5 minutes, then slowly pour in the cream, continually whisking.
Add the shrimp. Stir the pot, and allow it to cook for another 15 minutes.
Remove from heat and serve.
Ladle into bowls and garnish with parsley and green onions.
