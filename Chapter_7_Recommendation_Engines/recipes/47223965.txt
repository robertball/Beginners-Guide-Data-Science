Ingredients:
28-32 ounce package of plain frozen or O'Brien hash brown (shredded) potatoes
1 lb previously cooked meat. (I've used hamburger meat, breakfast sauage meet, sausage links, and packaged beef sausage)
1 1/2 cups shredded cheese
12 eggs
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
Slow Cooker

Directions:
Spray the inside of your crock pot with cooking spray. Dump in the whole package of hash browns. Spread them out with your fingers, breaking up any clumps.
In a mixing bowel, mix the dozen eggs with the milk, salt and pepper, cheese, and meat. Pour everything on top of the hash browns.
Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours, or on high for 3-4. It's done when the eggs are fully cooked and the edges start to brown a bit.

Description: 
This ONE pot slow cooker casserole is the easiest hearty breakfast there is. I generally fix on a Saturday evening just before retiring for a Sunday-before-church filling breakfast. Just serve with toast, jam and fruit and you have a hearty breakfast meal for the whole family.
