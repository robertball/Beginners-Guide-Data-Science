Description: 
I tried this delicious concoction one night as I was rushing to throw some dinner together and needed to use what was left in the fridge. The key to this recipe is to make sure your eggs are very buttery, soft, and highly seasoned so they don't disappear among the other toppings! This recipe is very adaptable to your personal tastes, but you want a balance of ingredients that don't overwhelm the delicate eggs. Let them be the star.
