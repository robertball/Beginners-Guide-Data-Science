Ingredients:
1 (1 1/2 pound) fat-trimmed pork tenderloin
salt and pepper to taste
all-purpose flour for dusting
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (8 ounce) bottle Russian-style salad dressing
3/4 cup honey
1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Trim any excess fat from pork and pat dry with a paper towel. Season with salt and pepper. Dust with flour, shaking off any excess.
In a large skillet, heat 1 to 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Sear the pork in the oil, rotating to brown evenly all sides. Transfer to a baking dish just large enough to fit the tenderloin.
In a bowl, stir together the Russian-style salad dressing, honey, and onion soup mix. Pour evenly over the tenderloin, rolling the meat to coat on all sides. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake, covered, in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, basting with glaze every 10 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking another 30 minutes, or until pork is no longer pink in the center.
