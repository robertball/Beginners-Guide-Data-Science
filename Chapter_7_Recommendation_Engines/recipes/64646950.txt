Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 carrot, peeled and chopped (finely)
1 celery stalks, chopped (finely)
1/4 cup onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup leftover butternut squash or sweet potato mash
2 cups cooked turkey, white/dark combinations (shredded)
1 14 ounce can crushed tomatoes
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon sea salt
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper

Directions:
Add oil to a large pan or cast iron pot over medium heat.  Once hot add in carrots, celery, and onion. Let cook for about 3-4 minutes turning often with a wooden spoon.  Add in garlic and let cook for 1 minute.
Add in leftover butternut squash or sweet potato mash and stir into the vegetables.  Add in turkey.
Pour in crushed tomatoes and bring to a boil then add in paste.  Take the back of your spoon and press the paste against the pot to dissolve into the sauce.  Pour in chicken broth then add in seasonings, salt, and pepper.  Cover and reduce to a medium/low heat.
Cover and let simmer for 20 minutes.  Taste for any additional seasonings then enjoy with pasta or spaghetti squash.

Description: 
Don't we all love our Thanksgiving Leftovers!  We do in our house and we always make a soup which is always a hit.  Being Italian I love making a bolognese.  I love to add in some of the butternut squash to sweeten up the sauce.  To make this a paleo pasta dish use spaghetti squash which is what I do and it's so good!
