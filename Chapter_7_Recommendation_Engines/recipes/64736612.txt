Ingredients:
1 cup warm water sometimes I need more or less
1 tablespoon olive oil other oils will work, but olive oil is a healthier choice
1 egg
3 1/2 cups bread flour I use organic flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons yeast
1/2 cup raw honey you can use sugar here if you don't have honey but honey is a better option

Directions:
Instructions
Mix all ingredients together in mixer with dough blade until dough forms. It should be dry enough to not be sticky but wet enough to not crumble.
Lift dough out of bowl, spray with olive oil (I spray the bowl) and place dough back in bowl covered with towel, allow to rise for 30-60 minutes.
Knead with dough blade (will deflate).
Remove from bowl, place dough on flowered surface and knead by hand a few times.
Divide in half.
Roll into 2 loaf shapes and place in loaf pans (mist pan with olive oil first).
Cover and allow to rise (depends upon temp in room, but usually around 60 minutes - it should be slightly over the top edge of the pan, do not allow to over-rise).
Bake at 350 for around 20-30 minutes or until golden brown on top. At around the 15 minute mark, I mist the top of the loaf with olive oil and continue cooking until done.
