Ingredients:
3/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup milled flax seed
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup granular sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 cup nonfat plain yogurt
3 medium bananas, mashed
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips (optional)
1 tablespoon chopped walnuts
1 tablespoon miniature semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, flax seed, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg in a bowl. Beat butter, brown sugar, and sucralose sweetener in another bowl until light and fluffy. Beat  eggs, vanilla extract, and lemon juice into butter mixture until well combined.
Stir flour mixture into butter mixture until smooth. Add yogurt, bananas, 1/2 cup walnuts, and 1/2 cup chocolate chips, stirring until batter is just blended. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon walnuts and 1 tablespoon chocolate chips on top of batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
