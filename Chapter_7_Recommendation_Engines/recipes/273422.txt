Ingredients:
2 eggplant, ends trimmed, cut into 1-inch-thick slices
1 cup olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling
5 cloves garlic, minced
4 tablespoons white wine vinegar
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat an electric grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill eggplant for 8 minutes.
Heat 3/4 cup olive oil in a deep skillet. Fry grilled eggplant for 4 minutes. Turn and cook until soft but not falling apart, an additional 4 minutes. Drain eggplant on paper towels and discard oil.
Heat skillet again over medium heat and add remaining 1/4 oil. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add vinegar. Return sliced eggplant back to the skillet and cook for 2 to 4 minutes. Remove, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt.

Description: 
Eggplant is one of my favorite vegetables. I think it is an underestimated and underused vegetable. It tastes much better when fried. However, it can absorb much oil. I have learned that if I grill the eggplant first for a little, it will cook better and absorb less oil. 
This is a great side dish or an appetizer for a group of people. I also love to use the leftover to make an egg sandwich the next day. I tend to fry an egg and put it over the eggplant.
