Ingredients:
½  cup sugar
1 ½  cups mascarpone cheese
1 ¾  cups whipping cream, beaten to soft peaks
1 ¾  cups cold espresso (can be instant or strong brewed as well)
3 tablespoons brandy or coffee liqueur or a liquor of your choice
3  tablespoons Italian grappa (optional and makes the dessert ‘very’  potent)
1  package (3 oz each) lady fingers (48 cookies needed)
2  tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
1.  Beat whipping cream adding the sugar.  Combine whipped cream and mascarpone cheese in large bowl.  Fold until well blended and fluffy. Set aside. * crumbled semi-sweet chocolate crumbs can also be folded in at this time if desired *
2. Combine espresso, liquor of your choice and grappa if desired, in medium bowl.  Dip 24 lady fingers individually into espresso mixture and arrange side by side in a single layer in a 13 x 9 inch backing dish.  (dip the fingers quickly or they will absorb too much liquid and fall apart)
3.  Spread half of the mascarpone mixture evenly over the lady finger layer.  Sift 1 tablespoon of cocoa over the mascarpone layer.  Repeat with another layer of 24 lady fingers dipped in the espresso mixture.  Cover with remaining mascarpone mixture.  Sift remaining cocoa over top.
4.   Refigerate for 4 hours or overnight before serving.
