Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 cup low-fat milk
1 cup white whole wheat flour
1 cup white sugar
1 cup low-fat milk
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup white sugar
1 cup low-fat milk

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in water in a small bowl. Let stand 10 minutes. Combine 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup sugar in a 2-quart container. Mix thoroughly or flour will lump when milk is added. Slowly stir in 1 cup milk and dissolved yeast mixture. Cover loosely and let stand until bubbly. Consider this day 1 of the 10 day cycle. Leave loosely covered at room temperature.
On days 2 through 4: Stir starter with a spoon. Day 5: Stir in 1 cup white whole wheat flour, 1 cup sugar and 1 cup milk. Days 6 through 9: Stir only.
Day 10: Stir in 1/2 cup each all-purpose and white whole wheat flour, 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup milk. Remove 1 cup to make your first bread, give 2 cups to friends along with this recipe, and your favorite Amish Bread recipe. Store the remaining 1 cup starter in a container in the refrigerator, or begin the 10 day process over again (beginning with step 2).
