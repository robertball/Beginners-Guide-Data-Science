Description: 
Need heavy cream for a recipe but don't have any in the fridge?  Use this cheap and easy stand-in and you won't have to make one of those emergency trips to the supermarket.  Keep in mind that this substitute will not become frothy when whipped so it cannot be used to make whipped cream.
