Ingredients:
1/2 lb. lean ground beef
1 egg
2 T. fine dry bread crumbs
1 T. grated Parmesan cheese
6 to 10 basil leaves, chopped fine (or 1/2 t. dried)
2 T. finely chopped onion (or 1/2 t. onion powder)
12 c. chicken broth (or two 46 oz. cans)
1/3 c. finely chopped carrot
2 medium-size heads escarole, washed well and cut into 1/2 inch slices
1/2 c. Orzo or pastine
Grated Parmesan cheese to serve

Directions:
In a large pot, bring chicken broth to a boil.  Meanwhile make the meatballs, chop the carrot and wash, slice and drain the escarole.
In a medium bowl, combine meat, egg, bread crumbs, 1 T. Parmesan, basil and onion.  Meat should be a little more "wet" than dry.  Mix well.  Roll meat into 1/2 inch (or smaller) balls and set on a plate.
Add meatballs slowly to the chicken broth, stirring occasionally so they don't stick together.  Cook for about 5 minutes.  Add the carrot, then escarole and lower to a slow boil.
When escarole is limp, add the Orzo.  Cook for about 10 minutes until the Orzo is tender.

Description: 
Tiny meatballs, chicken broth and escarole are in this old-time recipe from my husband's grandmother. Serve with grated Parmesan to sprinkle on top and a nice crusty bread on the side. Make a big batch - it freezes well!
