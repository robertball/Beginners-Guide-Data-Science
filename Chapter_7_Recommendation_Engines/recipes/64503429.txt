Ingredients:
1 cup chopped broccoli florets
2 cups chopped cooked chicken breast
1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1 garlic clove
1/2  cup All Purpose Dill Mix (pampered chef)
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 package refrigerated crescent roll dough
1 egg white, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons slivered almonds
Pampered Chef Dill Mix:
3/4 teaspoon parsley flakes
3/4 tablespoon dried minced onions
1/8 teaspoon dried dill weed or seed
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup mayonnaise

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.
Make Dill Mix.
Combine broccoli, chicken, red pepper, cheese, dill mix, garlic, and salt in a large bowl; mix well.
Unroll one package of the crescent rolls; do not separate.  Arrange longest sides of dough across width of Rectangle Stone.  Repeat with remaining package or dough.  Using Baker's Roll, roll dough to seal perforations.  On longest sides of baking stone, cut dough into stripes 1-1/2 inch apart, 3 inches deep.  (There will be 6 inches in the center for filling).
Spread filling evenly over center of dough.  To braid, lift dough stripes across filling to meet in center, twisting each strip one turn.  Continue alternation stripes to form a braid.  Tuck ends to seal at end of braid.
Brush egg white over dough.  Sprinkle with almonds.
Bake 25-28 minutes or until deep golden brown.
