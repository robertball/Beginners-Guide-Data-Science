Ingredients:
2 baking potatoes
1 (12 ounce) package bulk pork sausage
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
Dash pepper
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Scrub and pierce potatoes; bake at 400 degrees F for 1 hour or until tender. In a skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Cool potatoes slightly; cut in half lengthwise. Scoop out the pulp and place in a mixing bowl; add butter and mash. Stir in Parmesan cheese, pepper and sausage. Spoon into potato shells.
Place in an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with cheddar cheese. Bake 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
