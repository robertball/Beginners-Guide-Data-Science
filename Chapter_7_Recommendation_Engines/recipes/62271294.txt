Ingredients:
•1 lb. dark chocolate
•1 lb. raisins
•1 Tbsp. Urfa biber
•Thermometer (low temp, lab, or instant-read)
•Double boiler

Directions:
Melt 2/3 of the chocolate (5 1/3 oz) in a double boiler and heat until it reaches 115 degrees. Remove from heat.
Add remaining chocolate, and stir to melt.
When chocolate lowers to 85 degrees, remove any remaining chunks and return to the boiler. Reheat until chocolate reaches 89 degrees, and remove immediately.
Add raisins and Urfa biber. Quickly stir so all raisins are covered and that the biber is well distributed.
Quickly spoon mixture onto baking sheet lined with wax paper and let cool.
Once cool, break into small clusters and enjoy!

Description: 
A delightful recipe that yields a wonderful texture chocolate encasing on the raisins, complemented by the flavor and mild heat of the Urfa biber pepper. My family goes crazy when I make this, and I am luck if a batch lasts more than two days.
