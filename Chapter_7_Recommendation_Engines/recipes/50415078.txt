Description: 
I never knew what I was missing until my mother-in-law made this! Everyone begged her for the recipe. A nice and easy way to feed a crowd. Thanks to my mother-in-law this has become a favorite dish!  Can be frozen very well and doubled for a larger crowd.  Top with your favorite shredded cheese.Modified from: Fantastic Black Bean Chili
