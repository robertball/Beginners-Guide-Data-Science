Description: 
Reduced-fat sour cream and mayo make a sumptuous, creamy dressing for a considerable lightened take on chicken salad.  Oven-poaching the chicken in broth intensifies its flavor and keeps it moist and succulent.  Combined with sweet grapes and aromatic tarragon, this is an elegant version of chicken salad that's wonderful on a bed of mixed greens or a sanwhich with nutty whole-grain bread.
