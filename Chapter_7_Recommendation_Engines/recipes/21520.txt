Ingredients:
1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 green bell pepper, diced
2 tablespoons butter
1 pound fettuccini pasta
1/2 large head broccoli, cut into florets
3/4 cup butter, divided
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 pint heavy cream
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
2 (6.5 ounce) cans minced clams, drained

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook mushrooms and bell pepper in 2 tablespoons butter until tender.  Remove from heat and set aside.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.  Steam broccoli in colander over pasta water, or in steamer, until bright green, 5 to 10 minutes.
Toss cooked pasta with 1/4 cup butter, Parmesan, oregano, parsley, garlic powder and black pepper.  Cover and set aside to keep warm.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt 1/2 cup butter.  Dump in flour all at once and whisk until smooth.  Whisk in cream and chicken broth a little at a time and cook until mixture thickens.  Stir in clams and reserved broccoli, mushrooms and bell pepper.  Heat through and toss with pasta.  Serve at once.
