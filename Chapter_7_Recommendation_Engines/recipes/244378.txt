Ingredients:
5 red potatoes, cubed
salt to taste
1/2 cup butter, divided
5 green onions, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced, or more to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and transfer potatoes to a large bowl.
Melt 1/4 cup butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir green onions, jalapeno pepper, and garlic until soft and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Mix green onion mixture and cream cheese together in a bowl; add remaining 1/4 cup butter and stir until butter melts. Add sour cream and mix well.
Mix cream cheese mixture with the potatoes using a potato masher until most of the lumps are gone; season with salt.

Description: 
I wanted to make mashed potatoes with a spicy kick, and since we had a lot of jalapenos and cream cheese needing to be used up, and because we love jalapeno poppers, I came up with this recipe. The fiance ate 3 servings and asked me to make this every time we have mashed potatoes! They were a little spicy but they were the best mashed potatoes I've ever eaten!
