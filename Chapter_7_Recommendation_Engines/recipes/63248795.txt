Ingredients:
5 pounds ground pork
1 tsp salt
1 tbs garlic salt
1/2  tsp ground black pepper
1 tbs ground paprika
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 tablespoon anise seed
2 tablespoon fennel seed
1 tbs red pepper flakes

Directions:
Place the ground pork into a large bowl. Season with salt, garlic salt, black pepper and paprika. In a blender or food processor, blend together the oil, anise seed, fennel seed and red pepper flakes. Mix everything into the ground pork until well blended. Refrigerate for 24 hours to let flavors blend. Bag and freeze in portions that suit your needs. Trick: after is sets overnight, fry up a meatball of it and check its flavor. Add what you think it needs and set it overnight again. If it's fresh you should be able to do this several times before you have to freeze it or cook it.
