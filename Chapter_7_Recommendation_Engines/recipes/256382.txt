Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (8.5 ounce) package dry corn muffin mix (such as JiffyÂ®)
5 eggs, divided
1/3 cup milk
1/4 cup diced ham, or to taste
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease an 8x10-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Stir corn muffin mix, 1 egg, and milk together in a bowl; batter will be slightly lumpy. Pour into the prepared baking dish, creating a 1-inch layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until corn bread has risen slightly, about 10 minutes.
Make 4 indentations in the corn bread using the bottom of a small ladle; fill with ham. Crack 1 egg into each indentation. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over eggs.
Bake in the preheated oven until corn bread starts to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
