Ingredients:
7 cups water
1 vegetable bouillon cube
1 box firm tofu (12.3 oz.)
1/2 cup bamboo shoots
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 Tbsp cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 cup water
1 green onion, finely chopped
1 teaspoon white pepper
Hot chili oil, to taste (optional)
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Bring the water and bouillon cube to a boil. In the meantime, cut tofu into small squares. Cut bamboo shoots into thin strips and then into fine slices. When the water is boiling, add the tofu.
Stir in the salt, sugar, soy sauce, vinegar and sesame oil.
Mix the cornstarch and water together. Slowly pour the cornstarch mixture into the soup, while stirring. Let the broth come back to a boil. As soon as it is boiling, add the green onion and the white pepper. Drizzle with chili oil if desired.
Slowly drop in the beaten egg, stirring in one direction at the same time. Serve hot.

Description: 
Hot and Sour soup is one of my favorite soups ever since coming across a version made by Mr. Fu of the Brass Wok. This isn't his exact recipe but I think it's pretty darn close!
