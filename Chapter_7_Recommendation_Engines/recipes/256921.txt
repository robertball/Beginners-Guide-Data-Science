Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (13 ounce) can Mexican cajeta caramel
Cake:
1 (18.25 ounce) box devil's food cake mix
1 1/2 cups water
3 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
Flan:
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
5 eggs
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
1/2 cup whole milk
1 1/2 teaspoons Mexican vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 15-cup fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray.
Pour cajeta into a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until smooth, 20 to 30 seconds. Pour into the bottom of the prepared pan.
Combine cake mix, water, 3 eggs, and vegetable oil in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium and beat until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes.
Pour cake batter over cajeta in the pan.
Combine condensed milk, evaporated milk, 5 eggs, cream cheese, milk, and vanilla extract in a blender; blend until smooth.
Pour milk mixture slowly over cake batter.
Wrap pan tightly with aluminum foil; place in a large baking dish. Pour enough water into the baking dish to come 2 inches up the sides of the pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, about 2 hours. Remove pan from the baking dish; let cool for 15 minutes. Unwrap the aluminum foil; invert cake onto a large rimmed plate. Let cake cool completely, about 30 minutes. Chill before serving.

Description: 
This cake layered with caramel, flan, and chocolate cake is sure to be a hit. You can find this cake in most Mexican bakeries. The first time I tried it, I knew I had to find a good recipe. Finally after much pleading the woman gave it to me! It's very time consuming but worth the end result!
