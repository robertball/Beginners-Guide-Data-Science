Ingredients:
5 cups chicken broth
4 small zucchini, diced
1 large potato, diced
1 large onion, chopped
3 eggs
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons dried dill weed
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring broth to a boil in a saucepan; add zucchini, potato, and onion. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the saucepan, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
Beat eggs and lemon juice together; add 1/2 cup of the hot broth from the saucepan and beat to temper the eggs. Pour the egg mixture into the broth in the saucepan. Increase heat to medium; cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove saucepan from heat, stir dill into the soup, and season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite soups. It's a family recipe. I love that it is dairy-free since I am lactose-intolerant. Serve immediately. Refrigerate any leftovers.
