Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 small onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (8 ounce) package wide egg noodles
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 (10.5 ounce) can beef consomme
1/2 cup white wine
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
Combine ground beef, mushrooms, onion, and garlic in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until beef is browned and mushrooms and onion are tender, about 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease from skillet.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes. Drain.
Stir flour into skillet with beef until beef is coated. Add consomme and wine; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Stir in sour cream and heat through, about 1 minute more. Serve over the cooked noodles.

Description: 
This quick beef stroganoff recipe is always requested by my husband and boys for birthdays and special occasions. It is so quick and easy to fix, who am I to argue. To save time, purchase fresh onions and mushrooms already sliced and diced.
