Ingredients:
3 pounds ground beef, or more to taste
1 large onion, chopped, or more to taste
2 (16 ounce) cans tomato sauce, or more to taste
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
ground black pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) can tomato puree, or more to taste

1 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard
1 tablespoon celery salt
1 tablespoon onion salt
1 tablespoon garlic salt
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook and stir ground beef and onion in a large pot until beef is no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.
Pour tomato sauce and tomato paste into the pot; season with pepper. Stir in tomato puree and ketchup. Add brown sugar, mustard, celery salt, onion salt, and garlic salt, stirring after each addition.
Simmer sauce over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until flavors combine, 30 to 45 minutes. Sprinkle in Parmesan cheese during the last 5 minutes of cooking.

Description: 
This is a recipe my grandma made for years and she never wrote it down until I was learning how to make it. It is a sweet meat sauce. I love it and just wanted to share it with everyone else. Let me know what you think. This recipe makes a lot of sauce. I usually put 4 cups in a resealable plastic bag and freeze for later use.
