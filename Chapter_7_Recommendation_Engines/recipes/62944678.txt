Ingredients:
1 cup whole milk
2 cups heavy cream
3/4 cups sugar
5 egg yolks
1 vanilla bean
1 tsp vanilla extract
8 oz white chocolate chips
12 oz frozen raspberries
pinch salt

Directions:
In a medium pan heat milk, sugar, salt and vanilla beans until warm.  (Scrape beans and add both the beans and the seeds to the milk)  Whisk together the egg yolks and a small amount of warmed milk mixture to temper the eggs.  Add the egg yolks to the rest of the milk mixture and, stirring continually, heat until the mixture coats the back of a heatproof spatula. Add chocolate chips to hot custard.  Stir until melted.  Pour warm mixture into a large bowl containing the 2 cups of cream.  Stir.  Add vanilla essence.  Place in fridge until cool.  After cooling, process the mixture in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturers directions.  Take frozen raspberries and heat in a small pot until defrosted and have broken down.  Place a strainer over a bowl and place raspberries in the strainer.  With a spatula, press the raspberries through the sieve to remove the seeds.  When ice cream is almost frozen add the raspberry sauce and stir it through the ice cream.  Do not stir it completely in.  Just make lines of raspberry throughout the ice cream.  Place in a container and freeze until set.  Enjoy
