Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 pounds beef flank steak, cut into bite-size pieces
2 green bell peppers, seeded and chopped
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef consomme (such as Campbell's ®)
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed French onion soup (such as Campbell's ®)
1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream

Directions:
Spray a large skillet with cooking spray, and cook the flank steak and green peppers over medium heat until the steak pieces have begun to brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer steak and peppers into a large saucepan, and stir in the beef consomme and French onion soup. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cover pan. Simmer until the beef is tender, about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Turn off heat.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Stir the sour cream into the meat mixture until thoroughly combined, and serve over the cooked noodles.
