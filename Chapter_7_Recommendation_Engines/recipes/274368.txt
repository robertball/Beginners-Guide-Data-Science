Ingredients:
8 ears corn in the husk
2 cups quartered cherry tomatoes
1 large red bell pepper, chopped
1 small red onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
Dressing:
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup rice vinegar
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon grated lime zest
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Trim corn husks of any long hanging parts and excess silk. Place in a large bowl with water and soak for 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place corn on the grill and turn every 6 minutes 1/4 turn until all 4 sides have been grilled, about 24 minutes. Allow corn to cool until cold enough to handle easily.
Remove husks from cooled corn and cut corn off into a serving bowl. Add cherry tomatoes, red pepper, onion, and basil.
Whisk together olive oil, rice vinegar, lime juice, salt, garlic, lime zest, and pepper in a small bowl until well blended. Pour dressing over corn salad and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 1 hour.
