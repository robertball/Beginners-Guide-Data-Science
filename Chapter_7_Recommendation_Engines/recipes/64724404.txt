Ingredients:
1 package yeast (8 grams)
1 and 1/4 cup  warm water
1 tsp salt
3 cups of flour

Directions:
In a large bowl combine water, yeast salt and 1 cup of the flour and beat until even consistency, then add the rest. You may need more or less flour. Keep gradually adding until a soft smooth dough forms. Divide into 6 balls, working each ball as you form it into a perfect ball. Let the balls rest for 15 minutes with a damp hot towel on top (I like to wet, ring and microwave the towel for 15 seconds) then roll them out into evenly flat disks.  Allow them to rise for 20 minutes then flip and allow to rise for 40 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 F. Flip pitas once again and bake for 10 minutes.
