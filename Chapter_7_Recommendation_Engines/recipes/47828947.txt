CHICKEN CUTLETS Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
8 boneless chicken breasts
4 Tbsp. Parmesan cheese
Lemon pepper, to taste
Fine bread crumbs
4 eggs
1/4 cup milk
2 4 Tbsp. olive oil

Directions:
Filet the chicken lengthwise. Pound the chicken with a tenderizer.
Mix eggs and milk together and set aside. In a separate bowl, combine bread crumbs, parmesan cheese and lemon pepper. Dip the chicken in the egg mixture and then into bread crumb mixture.
Preheat frying pan with olive oil. When the oil seems hot, panfry chicken until golden brown (1-2 minutes per side). Continue to panfry the rest of the chicken. I rinse out the pan between batches and add new olive oil. This prevents the chicken from picking up burnt bits of bread crumbs from the previous batch.
Place in oven at 350 degrees for about 25-30 minutes.
