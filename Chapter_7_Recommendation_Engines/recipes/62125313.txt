Ingredients:
1/2 head of Chinese cabbage
4 green onions - sliced on the diagonal
TOPPING:
1 rotisserie chicken - shredded (optional)
1 small can mandarin oranges
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1/4 cup sunflower seeds
1 package of Ramen noodles (broken into smaller pieces)
3 TBS butter
1 TBS water
DRESSING:
1 cup Canola oil
1/2 cup white vinegar
1/2 - 3/4 cup sugar (to taste)
2 TBS soy sauce

Directions:
Chop the cabbage (finely) and the green onions and set aside.
Saute the almonds, sunflower seeds and Ramen noodles in the butter and water until golden.  If you want the noodles to be crispier, saute for a shorter time.
Add all the dressing ingredients together and mix well.  Toss the salad with the dressing and layer the chicken, mandarin oranges, almonds, noodles and sunflower seeds over the top.

Description: 
This is a refreshingly different salad for a brunch or light lunch.  The Ramen noodles add an extra crunch and the Asian dressing is a great combination of sweet and salty.
