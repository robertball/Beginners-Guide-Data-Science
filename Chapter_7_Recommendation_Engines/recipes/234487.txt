Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1/2 onion, sliced
1/2 green bell pepper, sliced
salt to taste
4 flour tortillas
1/2 pound cooked steak, cut into 1/4-inch thick pieces
1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend

Directions:
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and green bell pepper in the hot oil until onions are softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Season mixture with salt and transfer to a bowl.
Brush 1 side of each tortilla with remaining oil. Place 1 tortilla, oil-side down, in the same skillet; sprinkle with 1/2 the steak, 1/2 the onion mixture, and 1/2 the Mexican cheese mixture. Place a second tortilla, oil-side up, onto cheese layer, pressing down with a spatula to seal.
Cook quesadilla over medium heat until cheese melts and tortillas are browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove quesadilla from skillet and cut into wedges. Repeat with remaining ingredients for second quesadilla.

Description: 
I came up with this one night when I didn't know what to cook. I had leftover steak in the fridge, so I decided to get creative. These came out wonderful! The measurements are approximations, so feel free to change them according to your tastes. Serve with salsa, guacamole, and sour cream.
