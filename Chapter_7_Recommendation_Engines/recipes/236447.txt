Ingredients:
4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth, divided
1 small yellow onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/8 teaspoon garam masala
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 cup red lentils
1 (14.5 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes, undrained
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (optional)
1 tablespoon crumbled feta cheese (optional)

Directions:
Bring 1/2 cup broth to a boil in a pot; reduce heat and simmer. Add onion and garlic and simmer until onion is translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Stir coriander, cinnamon, turmeric, garam masala, and cayenne pepper into onion mixture; simmer for 1 minute.
Stir lentils into spiced onion mixture; cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds. Add remaining 3 1/2 cups broth and tomatoes; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until lentils are tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir lemon juice into soup and garnish with feta cheese.
