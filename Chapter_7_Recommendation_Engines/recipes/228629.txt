Description: 
Pork roast and kraut slow-cooked and served with dumplings and sauerkraut 'gravy.' This recipe was from my mother's very German family. She always served it with mashed potatoes, creamed peas, and applesauce. Sometimes she baked the roast and kraut separately. We always have this on New Year's Day. I usually double the recipe for the dumplings. My mother didn't make hers with beer, but I have added this over the years to taste.
