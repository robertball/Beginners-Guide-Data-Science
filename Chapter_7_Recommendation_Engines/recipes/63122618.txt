Ingredients:
1/3 shopping bag fresh nettles
3 shallots
2 tbsp butter
1/3 cup cream
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
Salt and Pepper
Creme Fraiche or Ricotta cheese for garnish (optional)

Directions:
WARNING: Use rubber gloves when handling fresh nettles or you will get a rash! Once they are cooked, they are completely safe and nutritious.
Bring a very large pot of salted water to a boil. Toss the nettles into the boiling water and cook until wilted, about 4 minutes. Remove nettles from the water which may be reserved as a tea or for stock. Blend the nettles in a blender until smooth and set aside. Next, gently sautee the well-chopped shallots in the butter until they're very soft (about 10 minutes). Add the cream and season with salt and pepper. Simmer until the cream coats the back of a spoon (about 2 minutes) then add the grated parmesan and blended nettles.
Serve as a side dish with fried oysters or in a small bowl on its own. A dollop of creme fraiche or ricotta on the top would be classy.

Description: 
Stinging Nettle is one of the most nutritious foods native to North America. I absolutely love it in soup, in place of basil in pesto, or simply steamed with butter. This is one of my favourite ways of preparing nettles, though- with cream and cheese, how can one go wrong?
