Description: 
A creamy, multipurpose miso dressing. Great on salads, vegetables, or whatever else your heart desires. The ingredients are more true to the Japanese style. Mirin gives the dressing a slightly sweeter, more complex taste, tofu gives the dressing a creamy texture, and the sesame oil adds a distinct Japanese flavor to the finish.
