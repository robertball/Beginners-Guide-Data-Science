Ingredients:
1 pint vanilla ice cream
1 quart peach ice cream
1 quart raspberry sorbet or sherbet
1 1/2 cups frozen  red raspberries (thawed)
1/4 cup amaretto
1/2  tsp. vanilla
4-5 ripe peaches, peeled and sliced

Directions:
Spray a  10-inch spring form pan with Pam or line with plastic wrap.  Line bottom of pan with vanilla ice cream.  Freeze.
Line sides of pan with peach ice cream.  Freeze.
Fill pan with raspberry sorbet and freeze several hours.
Make sauce by  putting berries through a sieve,  then adding amaretto and vanilla.  Taste.  You might want to add a little sugar at this point.
Peel and slice peaches.  Pour sauce over them and let stand at least an hour.
Invert ice cream mold onto a dish with a rim (to catch the melted ice cream) and fill center with peaches and sauce.  Let them flow over the top too.
