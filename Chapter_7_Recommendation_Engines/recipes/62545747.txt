Ingredients:
3 pounds beef short ribs, about 10 ribs
Salt and pepper
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
10 to 12 garlic cloves, mashed
1-inch piece ginger, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch slices
12 ounces good ale (recommended: Bass)
3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
1 cup hoisin sauce

Directions:
Season the ribs with salt and pepper. Heat the vegetable oil in a large heavy pot with a lid over high heat. Brown the ribs on all sides. Remove the ribs and pour off all but a couple tablespoons of the fat.
Return the pot to the stove, lower the heat to medium and saute the garlic and ginger for about 3 minutes. Add the ribs back to the pot. Add the beer and the vinegar. Stir and then cover and simmer for 2 1/2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.
Pour the hoisin sauce over the ribs, move the pot to the oven, and cook, uncovered, for 30 minutes.
Remove ribs and ginger from sauce. Strain fat from the top of the pot.
