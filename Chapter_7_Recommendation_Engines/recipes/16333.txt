Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
2 eggs
1 onion, chopped
1/2 cup barbecue sauce
3/4 cup crushed crackers
1 cup crushed potato chips
3/4 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 pinch cayenne pepper
6 slices bacon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine the beef, eggs, onion, barbecue sauce, cracker crumbs, potato chips, liquid smoke, ground black pepper, salt, garlic powder and cayenne pepper and mix well.
On a lightly greased cookie sheet, shape the mixture into a loaf. Lay the bacon slices across the width of the loaf so that the entire surface is covered. Cover the loaf loosely with foil.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 1/2 hours.
