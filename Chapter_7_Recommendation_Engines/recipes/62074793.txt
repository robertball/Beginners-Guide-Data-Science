Ingredients:
Krustez Basic Cookie Dough Mix
2" Frozen Tart Shells
1/3 cup butter
3 oz. cream cheese
1 tsp. vanilla
2 cups powdered sugar
Pecans (chopped)

Directions:
Take 1 cup cookie dough mix and add 1 tablespoon water.  Mix together until dough forms.  Place 7 tart shells on a cookie sheet.  Roll dough the size of a walnut and place in tart shell.  After filling shells smash ball with fingers until flat.  Bake at 375 degrees for about 20 min. or until golden brown.  Cool cookies completely.  Mix butter and cream cheese until creamy.  Add vanilla and then add powdered sugar and mix until smooth.  Frost cookies and dip top in chopped pecans. I buy the tart shells and cookie mix at stores called URM, Cash & Carry or United Grocers.
