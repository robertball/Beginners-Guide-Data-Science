Description: 
This is delicious! It's a chicken version of Mexican Spinach & Hamburger Casserole and I think I may like it even better. I used white meat chicken, but I think it would be even better with dark meat or a combination of white and dark. This is amazingly easy and relatively inexpensive to make for something so tasty.
