Ingredients:
2 Cups Flour
1/2 Cup Toasted Sesame seeds
1 tsp salt
4 oz. butter
1/4 Cup Tahini paste
1 large egg
1 egg yoke
2 tbls heavy cream

Directions:
Place flour,butter, eggs,salt, and cream in the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix all ingredients together until well combined.
Turn the dough out onto a lighly floured surface and roll into a log about 1 1/2 inch around. Wrap the log in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Preheat your oven to 350F during the last 30 minutes of chilling.
Remove the chilled log, and slice into 1/4 inch thick rounds. Place them slightly apart on an ungreased baking tray. Press the cookies down gently with a fork, if you like.
Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the cookies are just golden around the edges and firm to the touch.
Cool on a wire rack.
