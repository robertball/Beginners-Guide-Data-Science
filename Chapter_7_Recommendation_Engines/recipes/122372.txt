Ingredients:
2/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup plain yogurt
1/2 cup raisins
TOPPING:
1/2 cup walnuts, chopped
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, beat sugar, oil, eggs and vanilla until smooth. Combine flour, baking soda and salt; add to the sugar mixture alternately with yogurt. Stir in raisins. Pour half of the batter into a greased 9-in. square baking pan. Combine topping ingredients; sprinkle half over batter. Top with remaining batter and topping. Cut through batter with a knife to swirl the topping. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
