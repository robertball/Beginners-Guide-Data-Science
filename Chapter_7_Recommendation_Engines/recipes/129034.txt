Ingredients:
1 cup wasabi peas
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 1/2 tablespoons snipped chives
1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Grind wasabi peas in a food processor to pebble and sand texture (or place peas in a 1-quart freezer bag and crush them with a rolling pin). Place in a shallow pan.
Mix cream cheese, chives, soy and pepper with a fork until well-blended. (Peas and cream cheese mixture can be covered and refrigerated for 2 days.)
About 30 minutes before serving, use a 1 tsp. measuring spoon to drop cheese mixture into the pan of wasabi peas; roll into balls, coating each with ground peas. Place on a serving platter.
