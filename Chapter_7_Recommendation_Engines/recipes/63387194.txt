Ingredients:
FOR THE BEANS
1 pound dried black beans, rinsed thoroughly
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1/2 large white onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
4 to 5 garlic cloves, crushed
1 bay leaf
FOR THE SOFRITO
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 large white onion, finely chopped
1 green bell pepper, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste
1 and 1/2 teaspoons salt, plus more to taste
2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup green olives stuffed with pimentos, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon sugar
Cooked white rice for serving (optional).

Directions:
In a large pot, soak beans overnight in 10 cups of water.
Add 1 tablespoon oil, the onion, bell pepper, garlic cloves and bay leaf to beans, and bring to a boil. Lower heat to medium and simmer for 1 hour, checking regularly and skimming the foam that forms on top.
Meanwhile, make the sofrito. Warm remaining 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the half onion, 1 bell pepper and 3 garlic cloves and sauté for about 5 minutes until soft. Add 1 bay leaf, cumin, oregano, black pepper and salt, and cook for 2 minutes more.
Add the sofrito to beans. Stir in sherry vinegar, wine and olives, and bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer and cook, covered, for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened and cooked through. Remove both bay leaves, and adjust salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and add sugar. Serve as soup or a side dish, or over white rice.
