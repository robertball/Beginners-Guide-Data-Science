Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup creamy peanut butter
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
20 fun size bars chocolate-coated caramel-peanut nougat candy

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, peanut butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. Stir in the flour, baking soda and salt until well blended. Cover and chill dough for at least one hour, or until no longer sticky.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Take about 1/3 cup of the dough, and wrap it around a candy bar. Repeat, using the rest of the dough and candy bars. Place cookies 3 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges begin to brown. Cool on baking sheets.
