Ingredients:
1/4 cup orange juice
1/4 cup tamari or soy sauce
1/4 cup horseradish mustard
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
2 tablespoons honey
4 salmon fillets (about 1 inch thick)
Hot cooked rice
Lemon slices
Garnish: green onions, chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
COMBINE first 5 ingredients in a shallow dish; add salmon.  Cover and chill 30 minutes, turning once.
REMOVE salmon from marinade, reserving marinade.  Bring marinade to a boil in a small saucepan.
GRILL salmon, covered with grill lid, over medium-high heat (350 degrees to 400 degrees) about 6 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork, basting frequently with reserved marinade.
ARRANGE salmon over rice; drizzle with any remaining marinade.  Serve with lemon slices, and garnish, if desired.
