Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon anise seeds
4 egg yolks
1 (750 milliliter) bottle 151 proof rum (such as BacardiÂ®)
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Bring water, sugar, and anise seeds to a boil in a saucepan; lower heat to medium-low. Simmer until thick and syrupy, about 10 more minutes. Remove from heat and pour through a strainer to separate the seeds out; set syrup aside to cool slightly.
Beat eggs yolks in a large bowl until light yellow; add rum, condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla extract. Stir in syrup mixture until mixture is smooth. Pour into decorative bottles and seal tightly. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours before drinking, the longer the better.
