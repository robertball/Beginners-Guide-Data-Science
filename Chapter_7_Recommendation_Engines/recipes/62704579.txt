Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 stick (8 tablespoons) softened butter
1 cup sugar
3 eggs
red, blue, green, and yellow food coloring

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners
Mix dry ingredients (except the sugar) in a large bowl. Combine milk, oil, and vanilla in a small bowl or two cup measuring cup
In a medium bowl, beat butter and sugar until fluffy with an electric mixer. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each egg. Add the flour and milk mixture, and beat until blended.
Separate batter into 4 small bowls. Add a different color food coloring to each bowl, and mix well, until color is how you want it.
Using a different spoon for each color batter, spoon a small spoonful of each color batter into cupcake wrappers, until 1/2 to 3/4 full. Do not mix batter once it is in the cupcake liner.
Bake for 15-20 minutes in preheated oven, or until a toothpick can be inserted and come out clean.
Cool, and frost with preferred frosting
