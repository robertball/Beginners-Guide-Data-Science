Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 teaspoons garlic powder
4 cloves garlic, minced
4 pounds beef top sirloin steaks
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.
In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat with garlic powder and minced garlic. Set aside.
Sprinkle both sides of each steak with salt and pepper.
Grill steaks 4 to 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. When done, transfer to warmed plates. Brush tops liberally with garlic butter, and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.
OMG - YUMMY!!!!!!!!!! I took round steak - the cheap stuff...added minced garlic from a jar, butter and mesquite seasoning, wrapped in foil and cooked in the oven. Nothing was left. I WILL make it again....and again.......and again.......

Description: 
I have never tasted any other steak that came even close to the ones made with this recipe. If you are having steak, don't skimp on flavor to save a few calories. The butter makes this steak melt in your mouth wonderful.Modified from: Sirloin Steak with Garlic Butter
