Ingredients:
4 (28 ounce) cans baked beans, drained
1/2 pound bacon
1 cup brown sugar
1 (12 fluid ounce) can cola soft drink (such as Coke®)

Directions:
In a slow cooker, alternately layer the baked beans, bacon, and brown sugar. Pour in some of the cola with each layer, until all has been used.
Cover, and cook 8 to 10 hours on Low or 4 to 6 hours on High. (See Cook's Note for oven directions.)
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Description: 
This is a favorite at potlucks and barbeques! I've often wondered if I get invited for my company or my Cola Beans! I've tried several different brands of colas, but have found that Coke® works best. I like to pre-cook the bacon about half-way so it doesn't make the beans too greasy, but it's not necessary. This recipe can also be baked in a conventional oven at 350 degrees F for about 1 hour.
