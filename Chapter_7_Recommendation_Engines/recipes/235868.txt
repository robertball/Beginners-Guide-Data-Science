Description: 
It's fall and there are a lot of overripe pears around, so try this recipe! You will love it! It is incredibly easy and you will wonder why you haven't made it before, once you taste it. Day-old, ugly, ripe pears that you would never eat are great for this recipe. Also, and most of all, make your food with love and encourage people as they make their own creations. It's all about the love, and when people finally sit down to partake, the experience and the way you made them feel will never be forgotten.
