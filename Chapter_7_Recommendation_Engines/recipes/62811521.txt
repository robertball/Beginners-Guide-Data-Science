Ingredients:
6 pork chops
1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 onion, chopped
1/2 cup fresh sliced mushrooms
2 (10.75 ounce) cans  condensed golden mushroom soup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Rinse pork chops, pat dry,  brown in a hot skillet.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Place them in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Saute the onion and shrooms. In a separate small bowl, combine the onion, mushrooms, thyme, sherry and soup. Mix together well and spoon over the chops.
Cover, and bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 minutes. Uncover, and bake for 15 more minutes. (Note: Time could be less or more depending on the thickness of the chops.) Pork chops are done when their internal temperature has reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
I've made the cream of mushroom version of this for years, but I like the Golden Mushroom version a lot, much more flavorful. By adding thyme and sherry, you can elevate this dish to a company dish. Mashed potatoes are my family's favorite. Definitely brown your chops first in a very hot pan and saut√©  the onions first.  Plate it with a mound of your starch, set the chop against the mound, put the gravy in a pool on one side of the plate and sprinkle with fresh thyme or fresh parsley.Modified from: Golden Pork Chops
