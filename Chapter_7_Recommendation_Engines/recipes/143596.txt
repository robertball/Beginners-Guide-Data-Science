Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 (15 ounce) can cream-style corn
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
2 (8.5 ounce) packages dry corn muffin mix

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottoms only of 12 muffin cups, or line with baking cups.
Place the eggs in a large bowl, and beat until light colored. Stir in the canned corn and sugar until well blended. Add the muffin mixes, and stir just until dry ingredients are moistened. The batter will be lumpy. Fill muffin cups 2/3 full.
Bake in preheated oven until toothpick inserted in center of a muffin comes out clean, 16 to 22 minutes. Cool 5 minutes in pan, then turn out on a rack.
