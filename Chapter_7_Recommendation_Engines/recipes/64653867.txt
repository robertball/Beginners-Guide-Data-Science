Ingredients:
1 package (8-1/2 ounces) corn bread/muffin mix
1/2 can creamed corn
1 can (4 ounces) chopped green chilies, undrained
1/8 tsp ground cumin
1/8 tsp dried oregano
Pinch rubbed sage
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cup (8 ounces) sour cream
1 envelope ranch salad dressing mix
2 cans (15 ounces each) pinto beans, rinsed and drained
2 cans (15-1/4 ounces each) whole kernel corn, drained
3 medium tomatoes, chopped
1 cup chopped green pepper
1 cup chopped green onions
10 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Prepare corn bread batter according to package directions. Stir in creamed corn, chilies, cumin, oregano and sage. Spread in a greased 8-in. square baking pan. Bake at 400Â° for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool.
In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream and dressing mix; set aside. Crumble half of the corn bread into a 13" x 9" dish. Layer with half of the beans, mayonnaise mixture, corn, tomatoes, green pepper, onions, bacon and cheese. Repeat layers (dish will be very full). Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.
Save time by using prepared corn bread. Just stir the chilies, cumin, oregano and sage into the mayonnaise mixture.
Feeling hot, hot hot? Add a diced jalapeno pepper or two to the mix.
