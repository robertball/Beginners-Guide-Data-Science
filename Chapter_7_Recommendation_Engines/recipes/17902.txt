Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 pounds cubed stew meat
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place the flour in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in the meat, seal the bag and shake well to coat. Spread the oil in the bottom of a 10x15 inch roasting pan, then arrange the meat in a single layer in the pan.
Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 30 minutes.
Remove from oven and add the tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, peas, water, onion soup mix, salt and ground black pepper. Stir with a wooden spoon, cover and return to the oven.
Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or to desired tenderness.
