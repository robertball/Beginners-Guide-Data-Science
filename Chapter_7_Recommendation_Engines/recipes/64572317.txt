Ingredients:
1 large lemon
1/4 cup kosher salt

Directions:
Wash lemon well and scrub with clean brush, if desired.
Using a microplane rasp, remove the yellow rind. Avoid removing the white pith, which is very bitter.
In a small bowl combine zest with the salt. Mix very well. Store in refrigerator in a covered glass container.
