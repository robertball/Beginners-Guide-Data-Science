Ingredients:
4 organic eggs
1/2 Cup Pace Organic Salsa
1/2 Cup bacon (pieces)
1/2 Cup almond flour

Directions:
1.  Preheat oven to 350*F.
2.  Cook 3-4 strips of bacon and cut it into small pieces.
3.  Put all ingredients in a blender on medium speed for 30 seconds, or until well-blended.
4.  Pour the mixture into muffin cups (makes enough for 8 muffins).  If you use a 12-muffin pan or two 6-muffin pans and have empty spots left, fill the empty spots 3/4 full with water so it cooks evenly.
5.  Bake on center rack for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.  Let cool, and eat!
