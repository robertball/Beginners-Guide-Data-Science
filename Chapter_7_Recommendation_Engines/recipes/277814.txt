Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into wedges
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
4 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray.
Place potatoes into a bowl and drizzle with oil.
Mix brown sugar, cumin, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl with a fork. Sprinkle mixture over potatoes to coat. Lay out wedges on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and turn the potatoes. Increase the heat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Continue to cook until fork-tender, about 20 minutes. Serve.

Description: 
After reading how good sweet potatoes are for us, I set out to find a fast, easy recipe that was also delicious. My sister and I developed this tasty side dish. The cayenne pepper can be increased to taste. I have found these wedges are even better reheated the next day, so make a bunch!
