Description: 
As a child every christmas my Grandmother would send a huge box of cookies and candies to us. She always included these cookies because they were my dads favorite (mine to.) I am allergic to walnuts so if i decide to add nuts i use almonds. Now my daughter and i enjoy making them together.
