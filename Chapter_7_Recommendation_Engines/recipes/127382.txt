Ingredients:
1 (20 ounce) can DOLE Crushed Pineapple, undrained
2 pkg. (4 serving size) JELL-O Brand Raspberry Flavor Gelatin
1 (16 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce
1 medium DOLE Apple, chopped
2/3 cup chopped PLANTERS Walnuts

Directions:
Drain pineapple, reserving liquid in 1-qt. liquid measuring cup. Remove 1 Tbsp. of the crushed pineapple; set aside for garnish. Add enough cold water to reserved liquid to measure 3 cups; pour into large saucepan. Bring to boil; remove from heat. Add gelatin; stir at least 2 min. until completely dissolved. Add cranberry sauce; stir until well blended. (Note: Due to the presence of whole berries in the cranberry sauce, the gelatin mixture will not be smooth.) Pour into large bowl. Refrigerate 1-1/2 hours or until slightly thickened (consistency of unbeaten egg whites.)
Stir in remaining pineapple, the apples and walnuts; stir gently until well blended. Pour into medium serving bowl.
Refrigerate 4 hours or until firm. Top with reserved crushed pineapple just before serving. Store leftover gelatin in refrigerator.
