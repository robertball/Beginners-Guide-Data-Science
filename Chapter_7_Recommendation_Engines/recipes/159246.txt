Ingredients:
1 pound elk breakfast sausage
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
1 onion, chopped
2 cups cubed butternut squash
2 beets, sliced into rounds
4 red potatoes, diced
4 carrots, chopped
1/2 medium head green cabbage, chopped
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®), or to taste
2 teaspoons dried dill weed
2 teaspoons dried rubbed sage
2 teaspoons dried thyme leaves
salt and black pepper to taste
2 quarts chicken broth
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/4 cup red wine vinegar

Directions:
Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the sausage in the hot pot until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease; reserve the browned sausage.
Pour the olive oil into the pot; stir in the garlic, ginger, onion, butternut squash, beets, red potatoes, carrots, and cabbage. Cook and stir for 10 minutes. Season with hot pepper sauce, dill, sage, thyme, salt, and pepper. Add the browned sausage, chicken broth, cream of mushroom soup, and vinegar. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until all of the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.

Talk about great flavor! This soup is unique and yummy- definitely put in the ingredients that sound bizarre like vinegar and Tabasco®. Tons of compliments await! Serve with a dollop of sour cream on top.
