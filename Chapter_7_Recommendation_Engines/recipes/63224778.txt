Ingredients:
2 Tbs Olive Oil
Mrs. Dash Table Blend
2 Frozen Boca Burgers, defrosted for 1/2 an hour
1 Can Cream of Mushroom Soup
1/2 can of water

Directions:
In a medium sized pan on medium high, heat the olive oil.  Sprinkle bottom of pan with Mrs. Dash and lay the Boca Burgers on it.  Sprinkle tops with Mrs. Dash.  Fry the burgers 'till they are slightly browned on both sides.  Add a dollop of soup to the top of each patty leaving about 1/2 the can, fill the can back up with water and stir.  Pour over the patties, lifting so the soup goes underneath them too.  Cover and simmer on LOW for 15-20 minutes.  When you are ready to eat, scoop the dollops off the patties and blend in with the rest of the soup, it makes an excellent 'gravy' for a baked potato.

Description: 
Using frozen Boca Burger patties and Cream of Mushroom soup you get a surprisingly quick and tasty salisbury steak.  To me it tastes like my old favorite TV dinner from long ago! Add canned green beans and a baked potato for a quick and satisfying meal.
