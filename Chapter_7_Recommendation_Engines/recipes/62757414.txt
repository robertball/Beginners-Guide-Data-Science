Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 egg
1 Tbsp cold water
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1 Tbsp chopped fresh coriander (or ½ tsp dried basil)
1 tsp Cajun seasoning
¼ tsp salt
Peanut Apricot Sauce:
¼ cup apple juice
¼ cup smooth peanut butter
2 Tbsp apricot jam
1 clove garlic, minced
1 ½ tsp cider vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F.
Slice each chicken breast lengthwise into 4 strips; set aside. In shallow bowl, whisk egg with cold water. In another shallow bowl, combine bread crumbs, coriander, Cajun seasoning and salt. Dip chicken strips into egg mixture, then into bread crumb mixture to coat all over.
Arrange chicken on greased rimmed baking sheet. Bake in oven until golden and no longer pink inside, about 15 minutes.
Peanut Apricot Sauce: Meanwhile, in microwavable bowl, combine apple juice, peanut butter, apricot jam, garlic and vinegar; cover and microwave at med-high for 2 minutes or until blended and warm, stirring once. Serve warm with chicken strips for dipping.
