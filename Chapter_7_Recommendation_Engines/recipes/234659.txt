Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 tablespoon dried minced onion
1 cube chicken bouillon
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons coconut oil
2 tablespoons curry powder
1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper (cayenne), or more to taste
1 pound pork tenderloin, cut into strips
2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup coconut milk
1/4 cup natural peanut butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat water, dried onion, chicken bouillon, garlic powder, rosemary, thyme, and salt in a microwave-safe bowl for 1 minute in the microwave; let stand until onion is rehydrated and bouillon is dissolved.
Heat coconut oil, curry powder, and ground red pepper in a large oven-proof skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly, until oil takes on the color of the curry powder, 5 to 6 minutes.
Cook and stir pork tenderloin slices in coconut oil mixture until pork begins to brown. Sprinkle flour over pork; cook and stir until slices cook through; 2 to 3 minutes more.
Stir bouillon mixture, coconut milk, and peanut butter into pork mixture; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cover skillet with an oven-proof lid and transfer to oven.
Cook pork in the preheated oven until tender and sauce is bubbling, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven, remove lid, and rest pork for 10 minutes to allow sauce to thicken.
