Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) beef tenderloin
MADEIRA SAUCE:
2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed beef consomme, undiluted
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 teaspoon beef bouillon granules
2 tablespoons butter, softened
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup Madeira wine
FILLING:
2 cups chopped fresh mushrooms
4 shallots, chopped
1/4 pound sliced deli ham, chopped
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley
1 (17.3 ounce) package frozen puff pastry sheets, thawed
2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Place the tenderloin in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan; fold until ends of meat. Bake, uncovered, at 475 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until browned. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until chilled.
For sauce, in a large saucepan, combine the consomme, tomato paste and bouillon granules. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes or until reduced to 2 cups. Combine butter and flour. Stir into sauce, a teaspoon at a time. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat; stir in wine and set aside.
For the filling, in a large skillet, combine the mushrooms, shallots, ham and 2 tablespoons Madeira sauce. Cook over low heat for 10 minutes longer or until liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally. Set aside.
On a lightly floured surface, unfold one puff pastry sheet; cut lengthwise along one fold line, forming two rectangles. Cut smaller rectangle into a 6-in. x 3-in. rectangle; use remaining piece for decorations if desired. Moisten a 6-in. edge of large rectangle with water. Attach smaller rectangle along that edge, pressing lightly to seal. Transfer to an ungreased baking sheet.
Spread half of the filling down the center of pastry. Place the tenderloin on the filling. Spread the remaining filling over the top of meat. Roll out remaining puff pastry into a rectangle 8 in. wide and 5 in. longer that the tenderloin; place over the meat. Brush pastry edges with milk; fold edges under meat.
Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 40 minutes (meat will be medium); cover lightly with foil if needed. Transfer to a serving platter. Let stand for 15 minutes before slicing. Rewarm Madeira sauce if necessary. Serve with tenderloin.
