Ingredients:
Crust
1/2 cup toasted pecans, cooled and crushed
2 cups chocolate Oreo cookie crumbs
1/4 cup sugar
6 tablespoons melted butter
Filling
2 1/4 lbs cream cheese, at room temp
1 2/3 cups sugar
5 eggs, at room temp
1 cup baileys original irish cream
1 tablespoon vanilla
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
Coffee Cream Topping
1 cup chilled whipping cream
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon instant coffee powder

Directions:
For the crust, mix all ingredients then press into a 10" spring form pan and up the sides one inch.  Bake at 325 for 7-10 minute.
Filling: Beat cream cheese with electric mixer until smooth. Beat sugar in gradually, and then add eggs one at a time. Blend in Bailey's and vanilla. Sprinkle half of chocolate chips over crust.
Spoon in filling.  Sprinkle with remaining chocolate chips.  Bake at 325 degrees approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes or until puffed, springy in center and golden brown. Place a pan of water on bottom rack of oven while baking to keep it moist.   Cool cake completely.
Coffee Cream Topping:   Beat all ingredients and spread over cooled cake.  Top with chocolate curls or Skor bits.  Be sure to make and refrigerate at least one day before serving.
