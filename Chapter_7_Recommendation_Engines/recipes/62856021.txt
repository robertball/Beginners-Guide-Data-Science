Ingredients:
4 eggs
1/4 head iceberg lettuce
8 bacon strips
3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 large tomato
4 tbs Ranch Dressing
1/2 Shallot, diced
Butter/Garlic Croutons

Directions:
Place Eggs in a medium covered saucepan, cover completely with cold water, then cover pan and bring to a boil on high heat. Remove pan from heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove from hot pan and plunge into ice water.
While the eggs are cooking, put half the Bacon between 2 paper towels. Repeat. Stack covered bacon on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high for 1 minute. Remove from microwave and check doneness. It may be necessary to rotate the bacon from top to bottom of stack, and from outside to inside to ensure even cooking. Continue cooking on high for 30 second intervals until bacon is crisp and well done.
Rough chop the lettuce and divide onto 2 dinner plates or pasta bowls.
Break the bacon into 1/2-inch pieces and add to lettuce, reserving a bit for garnish. Add Cheese.
Cut the Tomato in large chunks and add to plates along with Shallots. Toss.
Remove the chilled Eggs from water and peel, then quarter or slice and arrange alongside salads.
Top each salad with half the Ranch Dressing, remaining Bacon and Croutons. Serve immediately.
