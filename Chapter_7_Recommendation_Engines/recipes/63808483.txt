Ingredients:
12 oz. box uncooked orzo pasta
3 cups low sodium chicken broth (or stock)
8 oz. package uncured turkey bacon (or whatever is on hand)
2 tb. olive oil
16 oz. canned mushrooms, drained
1/2 bunch green onions (8-10 stalks), finely chopped
Fresh arugula and grape tomatoes (for garnish, optional)

Directions:
Heat chicken broth in medium saucepan to a boil.
Reduce heat and add orzo. Stir, cover and simmer for 7-8 minutes, stirring occasionally. When done remove from heat and set aside. Do not drain.
While orzo pasta cooks fry turkey bacon in large skillet until slightly browned, 3-5 minutes. Remove and set aside.
Using same skillet heat olive oil until surface gets wavy. Reduce heat to medium-low and add onions and mushrooms. Saute for about 3-5 minutes or until onions are tender.
Chop up turkey bacon into bite-sized pieces and add back into onion/mushroom mixture. Mix in and heat for 1 minute. Add mixture to cooked orzo and fold in gently. Spoon or ladle out to plates (or bowls) and garnish with arugula and grape tomatoes, if desired.

Description: 
This was originally a sour cream-based mushroom/bacon side dish I borrowed from my Cousin JoAnn who served it every New Year's Day for decades. But I don't always have sour cream on hand. So I adjusted it, using chicken stock and risotto (or broth and rice, which I usually had on hand).  This dish can be whipped up in less than 30 minutes and offers flavor and satisfaction for families active with school or sport activities. You can also scale it down to a cozy dinner for two to be eaten from a bowl in front of a fireplace or your favorite movie!
