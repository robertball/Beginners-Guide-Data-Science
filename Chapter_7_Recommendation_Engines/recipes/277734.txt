Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) leg of lamb
4 potatoes, peeled and quartered
4 carrots
4 stalks celery
6 cloves garlic
3 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
1 1/2 cups olive oil
2 lemons, juiced
1/3 cup dry white Retsina wine
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the leg of lamb into a large roasting pan. Distribute potatoes, carrots, and celery around the meat. Slice small slits all over the surface of the lamb and stuff them with garlic cloves. Sprinkle oregano and rosemary over meat.
Mix olive oil, lemon juice, wine, and mustard together and drizzle over the meat and vegetables.
Bake, covered, in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Uncover and continue baking until browned, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the lamb should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).
Let lamb cool for 5 minutes. Serve with the vegetables.
