Ingredients:
Bread Pudding:
6 thick slices sourdough bread, crusts removed and cut into small cubes
1/4 cup raisins (optional)
1/4 cup sliced almonds (optional)
2 cups milk
4 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons salted butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Sauce:
1 stick salted butter
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup amaretto liqueur

Directions:
Place bread cubes in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Add raisins and almonds.
Combine milk, eggs, sugar, butter, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a mixing bowl. Pour mixture over bread and let sit for about 30 minutes to let bread absorb and soften.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until top is lightly browned, about 50 minutes.
Melt 1 stick butter in a saucepan over low heat, 3 to 5 minutes. Add confectioners' sugar and stir well. Remove from heat. Stir in amaretto. Allow sauce to sit at room temperature until thickened, about 15 minutes. Pour sauce over bread pudding before serving.

Description: 
After trying numerous bread pudding recipes, I attempted to create my own, using flavors that I love. The sourdough adds to the recipe without being overwhelming, and the amaretto brings a light almond flavoring to the top. My family enjoys it, and I hope you do as well.
