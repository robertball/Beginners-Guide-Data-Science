Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups boiling chicken broth
3/4 cup long-grain white rice
1/4 cup frozen corn
1/4 cup frozen peas
1/4 cup chopped carrot
1 tablespoon minced onion, or to taste
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix chicken broth, rice, corn, peas, carrot, and onion together in a casserole dish; cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until rice is tender and broth has been absorbed, about 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and sprinkle pilaf with Cheddar cheese; cover with aluminum foil. Continue baking until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.
