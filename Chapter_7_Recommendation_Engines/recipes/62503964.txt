Ingredients:
4 boneless chicken breast halves, without skin
1/4 cup flour
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
2 tsp butter
1 tsp olive oil
1 1/2 cups dry white wine
2 tbsp lemon juice
1 cup artichoke hearts, drained
1/2 cup chopped parsley
4 cups cooked linguine, about 8 oz uncooked

Directions:
Flatten chicken breasts evenly to about 1/4 inch thickness between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Mix flour, salt, and pepper; dredge chicken in flour mixture.
Heat 1 teaspoon of butter and 1 tsp of olive oil in a large heavy skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken, cook 3 minutes on each side until nicely browned. Add 3/4 cup of white wine, lemon juice, and artichokes to pan. Scrape pan to loosen brown bits and cook for 2 minutes. Remove chicken and keep warm.
Stir in remaining white wine and cook over high heat for about 5 minutes, or until reduced to 1/2 cup. Stir in a teaspoon of butter and the chopped parsley. Serve over linguine or other pasta, and drizzle with sauce.
