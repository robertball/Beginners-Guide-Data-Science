Ingredients:
*  4 rolls of any kind
* 1 teaspoon olive oil
* 12 to 20 precooked meatballs (depending on size; found in the freezer or refrigerator case in most grocery stores)
* 1 1/2 cups pasta sauce
* 2 cups shredded mozzarella
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan
* pickle spears (optional)

Directions:
1.  Warm the rolls on a rack in a 250Â° F oven. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet, over medium heat. Add the meatballs. Cook until brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the sauce, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until it begins to bubble, about 3 minutes.
2. Remove the rolls from oven and slice lengthwise. Spoon the meatballs and sauce onto the rolls, then sprinkle with the mozzarella and Parmesan. Serve with the pickles, if desired.
