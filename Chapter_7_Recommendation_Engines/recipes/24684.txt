Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 pound ground sausage
1 onion, finely chopped
3/4 cup uncooked white rice
1 cup water
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 large head cabbage
1 (32 ounce) jar sauerkraut

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, sausage, chopped onion, rice, water, and salt and pepper.
Bring a large pot of water a boil. Separate 12 to 15 large cabbage leaves from the head, and place in boiling water. Boil until soft, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from water, and set aside.
Into the center of each leaf, place a small amount of the meat mixture. Fold in the sides, and roll up from the bottom. Secure with a toothpick.
Place a layer of  sauerkraut in the bottom of a large pot. Arrange cabbage rolls in a single layer over the sauerkraut. Cover with remaining sauerkraut.  Pour in enough water to cover the rolls.  Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer for 90 minutes.
