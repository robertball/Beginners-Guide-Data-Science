Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) pork tenderloin
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle root beer
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp liquid smoke
1 (18 ounce) bottle your favorite barbecue sauce
8 hamburger buns, split and lightly toasted
** don't worry about weight/meaurements.  If roast is too big, cut in1/2 lengthwise so that it covers the bottom of the crock.  Pour in the root beer to almost cover the roast.

Directions:
Place the pork tenderloin in a slow cooker; pour the root beer and liquid smoke over the seasoned meat. Cover and cook on low until well cooked and the pork shreds easily, 6 to 7 hours. Note: the actual length of time may vary according to individual slow cooker. Drain well. Stir in barbecue sauce. Serve over hamburger buns.
