Ingredients:
Bottled Ranch Dressing
1 1/2 c. Italian Bread Crumbs
1 pk. Dry Italian Dressing Mix
1 T Grated Parmesan Cheese
1 T grandulated garlic
4 large boneless center cut pork chops.
Canola Oil

Directions:
In a bowl mix all dry ingredients well.
In a rimmed plate start with 1/2c ranch dressing add more if needed.  Discard any left over dressing.
Dip each pork chop individually in ranch dressing. Then coat each chop in the breading mixture.  Lay on a plate until all chops are ready.
In a large fry pan, one that will hold all four chops in one layer, add enough oil to coat bottom of pan.  Heat oil over medium heat just enough to make chop sizzle when added.
Brown chops on each side.
Add one tablespoon of water to oil and cover.  Cook over medium heat for approx. 10 minutes.
Remove lid and continue to cook until chop feels firm but not hard.
Remove from pan onto paper towel.  Enjoy.
