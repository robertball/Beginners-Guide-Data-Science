Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 large head cauliflower, cut into florets
3 cups chicken stock
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion until fragrant, 1 minute. Add cauliflower and cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly tender, 10 minutes. Add chicken stock, ginger, and salt; season with black pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer until cauliflower is tender, 30 minutes. Cool slightly.
Pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return to pot and warm over low heat. Serve immediately.

Description: 
I never cared for cauliflower or fresh ginger, but I love this simple and tasty recipe. It's even better served with garlic or crusty bread.
