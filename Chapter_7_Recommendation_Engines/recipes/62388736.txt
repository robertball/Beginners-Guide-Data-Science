Ingredients:
1 round of Brie or other double creme cheese, like Camembert.
1 box of phyllo or puff pastry sheets
1 shallot
2 medium cloves of garlic
1/4 tsp ground white pepper
1 tablespoon of dry vermouth
melted butter
fancy table crackers or digestive biscuits

Directions:
Defrost pastry sheets
Finely mince shallot and garlic
Combine shallot, garlic, white pepper and vermouth in a small prep bowl.
Cut the rind off the top of the cheese, leaving a 1/4" lip around the edge.
Add mixture to reservoir on top of the brie
Lay pastry sheets over the top of the brie, trimming the corners so that you can tuck the pastry under the bottom of the cheese.  You want complete enclosure, but without too much overlap.
Brush pastry with butter to make it brown in the oven.
Bake at 350o until brown and crisp
Carefully transfer to serving plate, serve with crackers and/or apple wedges

Description: 
My ex-wife Jamie's been making this savory Brie en croute since way back before we were married.  I think she must have gotten the idea from a magazine, but I've never seen the recipe... I just wing it.  It can be made with either puff pastry sheets (quick and easy) or phyllo sheets (more work, flakier shell).
