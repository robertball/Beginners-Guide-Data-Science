Ingredients:
2 navel oranges
2 T all-purpose flour
1/2 t salt, divided
1/4 t pepper
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed and tenders removed
1 C chicken broth
1 T canola oil
1 C white wine
1/2 C golden raisins
2 T honey
1 3-in cinnamon stick
1/2 C slivered almonds, toasted
Tip: To toast almonds, cook in small dry skillet over med-low heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant and lightly browned, 2-4 min.

Directions:
Zest and juice one orange. Remove skin and white pith from other orange, then halve and slice. Reserve zest and juice separately from the orange slices.
Combine flour, 1/4 t salt and pepper in shallow dish. Dredge chicken in flour, shaking off any excess. Transfer remaining flour to small bowl, add broth and whisk to combine.
Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over med. heat. Add chicken and cook until browned, 3-4 min. per side. Transfer to plate. Add wine to pan and cook for 1 min. Add flour-broth mixture, reserved orange zest and juice, raisins, honey, cinnamon stick and remaining 1/4 t. salt; bring to boil. Reduce heat to simmer, return chicken and any accumulated juices to pan and cook, turning chicken once or tuice, until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of meat registers 165 degrees and sauce has thickened, 10-12 min.
Transfer chicken to serving platter. Discard cinnamon stick. Spoon sauce over chicken and garnish with reserved orange slices and almonds.
