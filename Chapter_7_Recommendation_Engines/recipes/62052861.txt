Ingredients:
8 medium white potatoes, peeles, and cubed
1 stick butter, the real thing is best
1/2-3/4 cup mayonnaise
Water to cover potatoes in pot
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook potatoes until tender, about 20 minutes, but not mushy.  Drain potatoes, and add butter.  Mash potatoes with a potato masher(a mixer or blender makes them slimy).  Add mayonnaise and incorporate well to desired consistency.  Add salt and pepper and stir.  Serve hot.

Description: 
This is the way my mom always made them, it was the only way I would even look at mayonnaise.  It gives the potatoes a very creamy texture though. Some of the best mashed potatoes you've ever eaten.
