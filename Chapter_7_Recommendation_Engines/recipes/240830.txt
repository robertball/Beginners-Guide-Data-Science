Ingredients:
1 pound bacon
½ cup butter, sliced into pats
12 slices bread
1 ½ tablespoons ground cinnamon, divided, or more to taste
1 ½ tablespoons white sugar, divided, or more to taste
1 tablespoon brown sugar, divided, or more to taste
1 pinch ground nutmeg, or more to taste (optional)
1 ½ cups milk
5  eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Scatter about 1/3 of the butter pats onto the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish and arrange 6 slices of bread in a single layer, overlapping as necessary, on top of the butter. Top bread slices with bacon slices.
Sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar, and nutmeg over bacon slices. Scatter 1/3 of the butter pats over bacon and top with remaining bread slices.
Whisk milk, eggs, remaining cinnamon, remaining white sugar, remaining brown sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Pour over bread mixture into baking dish. Scatter remaining butter pats over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and set, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Very kid-friendly! I made this one morning when I was craving French toast and came up with the idea to put bacon inside it somehow! Yummy! The measurements for the sugars and cinnamon can be adjusted to however one likes! Can top with pecans, confectioners' sugar, or whatever else is desired!
