1/4 cup shredded coconut, unsweetened
2 egg yolks

In a sauce pan over medium heat add in mixture and whisk in the 2 egg yolks.  Once it begins to boil remove from heat immediately and pour into a bowl.  Cover with plastic by pressing the plastic to the mixture.
Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for a minimum of 3 hours or overnight.
Place the mixture in an ice cream maker and churn by following the manufacturer’s directions, until desired consistency is reached. Immediately scoop ice cream out of the ice cream maker so it doesn’t freeze to the sides of the bowl.
Serve immediately and store in a freezer safe container.
