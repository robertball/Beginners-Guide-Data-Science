Ingredients:
Dough:
1 cup warm water
1 tablespoon honey
1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 1/4 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup tomato sauce
Toppings:
3 ounces sliced mozzarella cheese
2 heirloom tomatoes, thinly sliced
5 leaves fresh basil leaves, chopped

Directions:
Combine warm water, honey, and yeast in bowl; whisk well and let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer with a hook attachment; mix well on low speed. Pour in yeast mixture and olive oil slowly while mixing until slightly combined. Increase speed to medium-high and mix until a very soft dough is formed, about 4 minutes. Shape dough into a ball; cover and let rise for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (210 degrees C). Grease a 12-inch pizza pan with olive oil.
With greased hands, press dough onto the pizza pan. Brush dough with tomato sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven until slightly golden, about 15 minutes.
Top crust with mozzarella cheese, tomato slices, and basil leaves. Bake until cheese is bubbly and crust is golden, 8 to 10 minutes.
