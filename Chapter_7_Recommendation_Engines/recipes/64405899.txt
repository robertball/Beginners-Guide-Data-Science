Description: 
One night I was running late and wasn't going to make it home in time to cook dinner.  My husband offered to step in and make dinner.  When I arrived he had come up with his own recipe for chicken patty's.  What was even more amazing, was how awesome they were! I request he make these often.  We like ours with a local sweet and sour hot sauce on top!
