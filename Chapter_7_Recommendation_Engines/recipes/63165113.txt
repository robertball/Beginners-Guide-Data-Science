Ingredients:
4 lamb shanks
4 large garlic cloves, cut into halves
Generous dash of salt
Several grindings of black pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Generous dash of paprika
2½ to 3 cups cold water, as needed
1 large lemon, cut into 8 wedges

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F.
Rinse each lamb shank well under cold running water. Pat dry with paper towels. With the tip of a sharp knife, make 2 deep slits (wide enough to hold a piece of garlic clove) on either side of each shank. Stuff each slit with half a garlic clove. Sprinkle the shanks generously with salt and pepper and rub into the meat. Sprinkle each shank with ½ tablespoon of the oil and rub in as well.
Place the shanks in a deep, ovenproof casserole or roasting pan and sprinkle generously with paprika. Add 2 cups of the cold water, cover tightly, and place in the center of the oven. After 30 minutes, turn the shanks over, add ½ cup of the cold water, and continue to bake for an additional 1½ to 2 hours, turning the meat every 30 minutes (add ½ cup more cold water if the liquid appears to be drying up). The meat is done when very tender and falling off the bone.
Spoon the juices in the roasting pan over the shanks as you serve them. Serve hot with most any rice or bulgur dish and lemon wedges on side.
