Amazing Alfajores Recipe

https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/542630.jpg
Ingredients:
150 gr butter, soft
100 gr powdered sugar
4 egg yolks
1 tsp vanilla extract
150 gr cornstarch
150 gr flour
5 gr baking powder
For filling and rolling:
A jar of dulce de leche
Coconut flakes

Directions:
Cream butter and powdered sugar in the mixer (no mixer? see tips), add in the yolks one by one and then the vanilla extract.
In a separate bowl, mix the cornstarch, flour and baking powder, and add them into the butter mixture. Process only until a dough is formed, and not longer than that. Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 350F (180C).
Roll the dough 0.5cm (0.2 inches) thick, and cut cookies out of it using a glass or cookie cutters.
Bake for about 9 mins, or until the cookies just begin to change their color, but are still relatively light.
Pipe (or use teaspoonfulls) dulce de leche on top of one cookie, close it with a “clean” cookie and squeeze a bit, for the filling to show a little, so that it will easily stick to the coconut. Roll the cookies in coconut flakes.
