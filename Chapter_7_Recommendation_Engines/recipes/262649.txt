Ingredients:
1/2 cup almond flour
1/2 cup almond butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips
2 tablespoons chopped almonds

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine almond flour, almond butter, and vanilla extract in a bowl; mix until well combined and a soft dough is formed. Shape dough into 1/2-inch balls and place on the prepared baking sheet. Freeze until set, about 20 minutes.
Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes. Dip cookie balls in the melted chocolate and place on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with chopped almonds and let sit until chocolate is set, about 10 minutes.
