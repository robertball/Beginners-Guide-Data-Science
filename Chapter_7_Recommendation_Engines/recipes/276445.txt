Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) package smoked sausage, sliced
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
2 pounds frozen chopped collard greens
2 (15.8 ounce) cans great Northern beans, rinsed and drained
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO*TEL®)
1 (1.4 ounce) package dry vegetable soup mix (such as Knorr®)
2 dashes hot sauce, or to taste (optional)
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage and saute until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat.
Combine browned sausage, chicken broth, collard greens, beans, diced tomatoes with chiles, soup mix, hot sauce, salt, and pepper in a large pot. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and let simmer, stirring often, until greens are tender and flavors have melded, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Kind of came up with this one on my own one day when I just didn't feel up to going to the store, so I used what ingredients I had in my pantry and fridge and voila! This collard greens and bean soup is now in my daily meal rotation, especially in the fall and winter! Serve with cornbread or biscuits.
