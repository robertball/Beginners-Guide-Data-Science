Description: 
This recipe has been a Christmas tradition since I was a little girl.  My grown children now insist I make these every Christmas! They must have them green and they must have them pressed into trees, but any color/shape is good!  The recipe originally came from the recipe book included with the Mirro Cookie Press in the 1940's and 1950's. The ingredients differ slightly from most spritz recipes I've found.  These are wonderful !
