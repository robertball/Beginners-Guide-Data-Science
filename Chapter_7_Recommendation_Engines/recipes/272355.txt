Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 ripe bananas
1/2 cup white sugar
2/3 cup cinnamon-flavored applesauce

1 teaspoon baking powder
2 1/4 cups gluten-free all purpose baking flour (such as KrusteazlÂ®)
2/3 cup chopped dates
3/4 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a 9x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray (do not use a loaf pan).
Mash bananas in a bowl. Add sugar and applesauce and mix well. Mix in eggs, baking soda, and baking powder. Add flour 2 tablespoons at a time. Fold in dates and walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 60 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
