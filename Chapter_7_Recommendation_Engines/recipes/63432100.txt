1/2 cups sugar
3 tbsp. butter
3 eggs
6 tbsp. butter, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup sifted powdered sugar
3 tbsp. orange juice

Directions:
In large mixing bowl combine 2 cups of flour and the yeast package.
In a small saucepan, heat milk, salt, and butter until warm (115-120 degrees) stirring to melt butter.
Add to dry mixture: add eggs. Beat at low speed with electric mixer for 30 seconds, scraping bowl. Beat mixture on high speed for 3 minutes.
Stir in enough remaining flour to make a moderately soft dough. Knead on floured surface until smooth (3-5 minutes).
Place in greased bowl; turn once. Cover, let rise until double (1 to 1 1/2 hours). Punch down; divide in half. Cover; let rest 10 minutes.
Use a fine grater to grate the orange peel into small shavings. Set the shavings aside.
Roll each half to 12x8‚Äù rectangle. Combine 6 tbsp.
butter, 1/2 cup sugar, and grated orange peel; spread over dough.
Roll dough into a log. Seal seams. Slice each log into 12 rolls. Place rolls cut side down into greased 2 1/2 inch muffin pans. (Or, use two 9 x 1 1/2 inch round baking pans for softer rolls).
Cover; let rise until double (about 1 1/2 hours).
Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from pan immediately.
Combine powdered sugar and orange juice to make a glaze. Drizzle over warm rolls.
