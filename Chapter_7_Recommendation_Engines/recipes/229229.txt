Ingredients:
4 1/3 cups chicken stock
3/4 cup barley
3/4 cup brown and wild rice mix
1/4 teaspoon fennel seed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon butter
1 onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 apple, peeled and chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Mix chicken stock, barley, brown and wild rice, fennel seed, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice and barley are tender and stock has been absorbed, 35 to 40 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt in the melted butter until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Cook and stir apple into onion until apple begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add garlic, sage, rosemary, thyme, and black pepper to onion-apple mixture; cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir barley mixture into seasoned onion-apple mixture; transfer to the prepared casserole dish. Loosely cover stuffing with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and flavors have blended, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
I made turkey one day but had no bread to make stuffing. Though I don't stuff my bird to roast, I just couldn't imagine not having any on the side. So I dug out some things from the pantry and this is the result.
