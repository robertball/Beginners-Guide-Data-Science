Ingredients:
2 frozen tilapia pieces-thawed
1 tsp kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon flour

Directions:
Mix all dry ingredients together and sprinkle on both sides of fish. Take a cast iron pan and heat on medium-high heat with about 2 tbsp vegetable oil. Make sure the oil gets hot.  Place the fish in the hot oil and cook on one side for 5 minutes. Don't move the fish, wiggle it, or press it down. It will stick. Let the heat from the pan release the fish from the surface. After 5 minutes, turn and cook another 5 minutes.
Serve with zucchini ribbons. I took a zucchini and made curl ribbons, and baked it in a 375 degree oven for 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This is an extremely easy dish of Tilapia that I made one night on a whim. The fish had just enough crust to give it flavor and still be tender.
