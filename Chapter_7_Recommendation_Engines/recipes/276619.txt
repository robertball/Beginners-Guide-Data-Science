Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package rotini pasta
1 tablespoon liquid smoke
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 cup diced cooked bratwurst sausages
4 tablespoons sliced green onions, divided
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 yellow bell pepper, finely chopped
1 orange bell pepper, finely chopped
1/2 cup diced celery
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup spicy mustard
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rotini and liquid smoke; cook at a boil until rotini is tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
While pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add diced bratwurst, 2 tablespoons green onions, and garlic; cook until bratwurst is brown and crispy, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
Combine yellow and orange bell peppers, celery, parsley, mustard, mayonnaise, water, vinegar, sugar, and black pepper in a large bowl; stir to combine.
Drain pasta and add to vegetable mixture. Add bratwurst, onions, and garlic and stir gently until all ingredients are combined. Serve warm or cold.
