Ingredients:
1 c bread crumbs
1/3 c grated Parmesan cheese
2 T minced parsley (or 1 T dried)
2 t garlic salt
1/8 t pepper
1/2 t paprika
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (about 2 lb.)
1/2 c butter melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line a jelly-roll pan with non-stick aluminum foil and top with a wire rack.
Mix together the first six ingredients.  Dip chicken in butter and then into the crumb mix to coat well.  Arrange on wire rack; drizzle any remaining butter over chicken.  If no remaining butter, melt 2 Tablespoons more for drizzling.
Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes; reduce oven to 350 and continue baking until chicken is done.
