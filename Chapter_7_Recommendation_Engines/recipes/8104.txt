Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 egg
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup milk
1 (9 inch) graham cracker crust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix together cream cheese, sugar, and egg by hand.  Gradually mix in flour.  Stir in vanilla. Blend in milk until smooth; add more liquid if batter is too thick to pour.  Pour into graham or pastry shell.
Bake for 40 minutes, or until top is golden brown.  Refrigerate overnight.

Description: 
This is my husband's favorite recipe for cheesecake. The flour adds a texture that makes it unique.  You can use a pastry crust instead of graham, if you prefer.
