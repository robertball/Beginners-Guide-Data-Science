Ingredients:
1 pound mini red potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/4 cup prepared pesto, divided
4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix potatoes with 2 tablespoons pesto in a bowl. Transfer potatoes into a large 11x13-inch baking dish. Unfold chicken thighs in the same bowl; rub remaining pesto on all sides. Fold thighs back up into original shape and place into the baking dish next to the potatoes.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring potatoes occasionally, until potatoes are soft when pieced with a fork, 28 to 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper before serving.
