Ingredients:
1 pound cabbage, shredded
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 pound wide egg noodles
1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Place shredded cabbage in a bowl; sprinkle with salt and toss to combine. Allow cabbage to stand for 30 minutes; squeeze cabbage dry and discard juice.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir cabbage and onion until cabbage is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Drain well.
Lightly mix egg noodles into the cabbage mixture; season with salt and black pepper if needed and sprinkle with caraway seeds.

Description: 
That's comfort food for me. I think it's very similar to the Hungarian cabbage and noodles.
