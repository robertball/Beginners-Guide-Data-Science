Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil or ¼ cup water
½ small red onion, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 large or 2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and coarsely shredded
1½ cups home-cooked pinto beans, or 1 (15.5-ounce) can, drained and rinsed
2 canned chipotle chiles in adobo, minced
2 tablespoons tomato paste
? cup ketchup
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
1 tablespoon tamari soy sauce
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon liquid smoke
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
½ cup water
4 cups chopped fresh spinach or baby kale

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, 5 minutes. Stir in the sweet potato, cover, and cook until softened, about 7 minutes, or until tender. Stir in the pinto beans, chipotle chiles, tomato paste, ketchup, mustard, maple syrup, tamari, chili powder, liquid smoke, paprika, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in as much of the water as needed to make a smooth sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, to heat through and blend the flavors, about 5 minutes. Stir in the spinach and cook for a few more minutes, until wilted. To serve, divide the mixture evenly among serving bowls or onto buns.
