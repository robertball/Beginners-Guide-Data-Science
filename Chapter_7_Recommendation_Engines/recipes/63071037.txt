Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups walnuts, toasted and chopped
6 tablespoons canola oil
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1/2 cup non-fat, plain Greek yogurt
5 ripe bananas, mashed
1 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F. Line muffin tins with paper liners.
When the oven temperature reaches 350°F, place walnuts on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for 5 minutes. Remove from oven and chop.
In a medium mixing bowl combine the canola oil, walnut oil, brown sugar, egg, and yogurt. Whisk to combine, and then stir in the mashed banana and the toasted, chopped walnuts.
Stir in the flour, baking powder, and salt.
Use a ¼ cup measuring cup to portion out the batter into the 18 lined muffin cups.
Bake for 23 to 25 minutes, or until the tops of the muffins are nicely browned.
Cool in a wire rack.

Description: 
These are 100 percent whole wheat muffins. The yogurt helps develop the delicate texture and the toasted walnuts and walnut oil provide an appealing flavor and texture. If you don’t have walnut oil, just use all canola oil. You can enjoy these muffins warm or cool, but the banana flavor intensifies when the muffins cool to room temperature.
