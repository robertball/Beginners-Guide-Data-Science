Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
3 Hachiya persimmons, pulp extracted
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Beat butter, sugar, and persimmon pulp together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; beat  in eggs and vanilla extract. Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; add gradually to persimmon mixture until dough is thoroughly combined. Stir in chocolate chips. Drop spoonfuls of dough 1 inch apart onto lined baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 10 to 13 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
Great use for Hachiya persimmons. These cookies come out slightly crunchy on the outside and more cake-like in the center.
