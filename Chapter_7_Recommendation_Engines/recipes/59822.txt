Description: 
For those who really like sweet food, you may also top the pudding off with a drizzle of coconut cream or a mild fruit such as bananas.  This is a traditional recipe my friend's mother brought with her from Thailand.  Some of the ingredients might be hard to find in the non-coastal areas of the USA.  There are a number of online import retailers that carry these ingredients
