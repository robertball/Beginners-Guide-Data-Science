1 tablespoon ground annatto (or substitute with paprika)

1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon kosher salt (optional)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients and mix well.
Store in an airtight container.
1.5 tsp of this mix equals 1 packet of commercial Sazon.

Description: 
This is a copycat version of Sazon, which I always use in Puerto Rican dishes. Other versions of this recipe usually call for only paprika or turmeric. I find that adding both helps achieve the reddish orange color to dishes without affecting flavor, such as rice. The amount of salt in this recipe can be reduced or omitted as many dishes call for adding additional salt. If you want to replicate the salt taste from the the packets, please use the full amount of salt. I prefer to omit and just add salt as needed to dishes while I'm cooking. I hope you will enjoy it!
