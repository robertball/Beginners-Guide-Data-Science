Description: 
Often used during Lent, this meatless recipe has been passed down generation to generation in my family. This recipe makes a generous amount, which is great because Haluski tastes even better the second day. My Bubba (grandmother) made potato dumpling noodles to go with her cabbage. Also great served with any fish!
