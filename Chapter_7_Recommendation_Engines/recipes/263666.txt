Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup basmati rice
1 cup rice milk
3/4 cup coconut milk
1/2 cup soy creamer
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/3 cup raisins
1/3 cup sliced pistachios, toasted

Directions:
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Pour rice milk over the rice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.
Increase heat to medium and add coconut milk, soy creamer, sugar, and cardamom. Bring back to a boil. Reduce heat to low once again and simmer until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in raisins and pistachios. Adjust flavoring and sugar to desired strength and serve hot or cold.

Description: 
An Indian friend of mine gave me a recipe for kheer and I've adapted it to make it vegan. The original recipe calls for whole milk and heavy cream. I've made this several times for vegan bake sales and gotten wonderful compliments about it. I hope others enjoy the adaptation!
