Ingredients:
1 package yeast
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 eggs, beaten
1 cup butter, cold
4 cups flour
Filling:
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
2 cups finely chopped pecans
Powdered sugar

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in milk.
Add sugar, salt, and eggs.  Let it sit one hour.
Cut butter into flour, like pie crust.
Drop yeast mixture into the flour and mix with a wooden spoon.
Cover; refrigerate overnight.
Divide into three parts.  Roll thin, like a pie crust.
Brush each one with a third (2 tablespoons) of the butter.
Mix the sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle a third (1/3 cup sugar plus 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon) of the mixture on the buttered dough.
Sprinkle a third (2/3 cup) of chopped pecans over the butter/cinnamon/sugar mixture.
Roll up tightly, starting with the part closest to you.
Pull the two ends together and form a circular shape.
Place into greased 8" cake tin.
Prepare the other two cakes.
Let raise until doubled in size, about an hour.
Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes.
Cool ten minutes.
Glaze with a mixture of powdered sugar and water, mixed together to a consistency to your liking.

Description: 
This subtle yeast coffee cake is perfect for a light mid-morning coffee break.  Because it makes three cakes, it is perfect for gift-giving.  It is not overly sweet so it allows you to savor the taste of the pecans. The dough is made the night before.
