Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 pinch salt
3 egg whites
1/4 cup mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Sift 1/4 cup sugar, cocoa, and salt into a small bowl.
In a large bowl, beat egg whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks begin to form.  Mix in remaining 1/4 cup of sugar gradually, and beat until medium-firm peaks form.  Sprinkle in cocoa mixture gradually, and continue beating until egg whites are stiff.  Fold in chocolate chips. Drop mixture onto baking sheets by rounded teaspoonfuls, spacing about 1 inch apart.
Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes for crispy cookies. Cool cookies on baking sheets.

Description: 
An easy to make treat that everyone will enjoy for Passover or year round. Sift powdered sugar over meringues and add fresh strawberries to the dish for a lovely presentation. Works best with mini chocolate chips. Using parchment/cooking paper reduces the risk of burning the bottoms (can use foil instead).
