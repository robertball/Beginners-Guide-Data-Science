Description: 
It's a bonbon-type cookie with a candy filling all in one bite. A colorful surprise treat to add to a Christmas cookie plate or anytime when you want to have something special. Use spice or fruit-flavored gumdrops and any color food coloring for icing. I usually divide icing into 3 to 4 small bowls and tint icing for specific gumdrop color and flavors.
