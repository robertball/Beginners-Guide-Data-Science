Ingredients:
8 hard-cooked eggs
2 drops red gel food coloring
2 drops blue gel food coloring
1 cup water, divided
toothpicks
2 Tbsp mayonnaise
1.5 Tbsp prepared horseradish
1/2 tsp rice vinegar
1/4 tsp salt, or to taste
pinch freshly ground black pepper
1/8 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp snipped fresh chives (optional)

Directions:
Carefully peel the eggs. (I use a pressure cooker, which makes them easier to shell. See Cook's Note.)
Combine red food coloring and 1/2 cup water in a 6-ounce ramekin or shallow bowl; do the same with the blue food coloring in a separate ramekin.
Insert a toothpick or two into the center of an egg and balance it so one end is dipped in the dye. Let stand for 5-10 minutes, depending upon how strong you like the colors. Repeat the process, dipping the other end of the egg in the other color to the eggs have red, white, and blue bands. Let dry on paper towels.
When the eggs are colored, slice them in half lengthwise. Place the yolks through a sieve.
Mix in the mayonnaise, horseradish, rice vinegar, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning.
Using a piping bag fitted with a large star tip, pipe the filling into the egg white halves. Sprinkle each egg with pimenton and a few chives. Chill until ready to serve.
