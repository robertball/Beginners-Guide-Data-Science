Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, minced
8 cloves garlic, minced
2 Spanish chorizo links, sliced
2 thick slices smoked ham, diced, or more to taste
3 potatoes, peeled and diced
2 turnips, peeled and diced
8 cups chicken stock
1 (15 ounce) can white cannellini beans
3 cups chopped turnip greens

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a stockpot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in the hot oil until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Stir chorizo and ham into onion mixture and cook until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Mix potatoes and turnips into chorizo mixture; pour in chicken stock. Bring stock to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover stockpot, and simmer until potatoes and turnips are tender, about 20 minutes.
Increase heat to medium and stir cannellini beans and turnip greens into soup; cook until greens are desired tenderness, at least 3 minutes.

Description: 
During the winter months in Alaska, it is nice to sit down with family and enjoy a nice warm hearty meal. This is one that we crave. This is a traditional Cuban dish and they are garlic fanatics. You can use less if you want. Serve it with a rich chewy Cuban bread.
