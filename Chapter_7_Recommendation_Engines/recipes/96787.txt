Ingredients:
1 cup cooked brown rice
1 cup 2% low-fat milk
2 tablespoons dried blueberries
1 dash cinnamon
1 tablespoon honey
1 egg
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Combine the cooked brown rice, milk, blueberries, cinnamon, and honey in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes.
Beat the egg in a small bowl.  Temper the egg by whisking in some of the hot rice, a tablespoon at a time until you have incorporated about 6 tablespoons.  Stir the egg into the rice along with the vanilla and butter, and continue cooking over low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to thicken.
