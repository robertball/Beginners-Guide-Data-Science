Ingredients:
butter flavored cooking spray
6 cloves garlic, crushed
1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms
1 teaspoon garlic salt
6 eggs, beaten
4 (10 inch) flour tortillas
2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
16 cherry tomatoes
1 (5 ounce) package alfalfa sprouts

Directions:
Liberally spray a medium saucepan with cooking spray. Repeat spraying while cooking as needed. Over medium heat, cook the garlic approximately 3 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms, and season with garlic salt. Cook until mushrooms are tender, about 3 minutes, and set aside.
In the same saucepan, scramble eggs. Stir in the mushrooms, and continue to scramble until eggs are firm.
Transfer 1/4 of the egg mixture into each tortilla. Top each with 1/2 cup cheese, 4 cherry tomatoes and 1/4 of the sprouts. Roll tortillas, and serve.

Description: 
This is delicious brunch fare for anyone looking for something a little different! You can use it for breakfast too; however, I recommend it for brunch since it's fairly substantial.
