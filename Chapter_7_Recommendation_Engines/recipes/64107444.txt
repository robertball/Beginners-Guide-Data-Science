Ingredients:
MEATBALLS
1 pound ground turkey
2 scallions, very finely chopped
1/2 cup very finely chopped cilantro
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 cup fine, dry bread crumbs (unseasoned)
1 egg, lightly beaten
SWEET SOY DIPPING SAUCE
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
2 or 3 slices fresh ginger smashed with the side of a heavy knife

Directions:
1
To make the meatballs: Heat the oven to 400.
2
Gently mix together the ingredients (hands are best for this), then form meatballs by rolling tablespoon-sized scoops between your palms.
3
Arrange on a lightly oiled or parchment lined cookie sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, until well-browned and cooked through. Serve with toothpicks for dipping.
4
To make the dipping sauce: In a small pot, stir all the ingredients together over medium-low heat until the sugar dissolves.
5
Simmer 3 or so minutes, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens a bit.
6
Fish out the ginger and serve in small cups for dipping.

These addictive meatballs taste like Chinese dumplings (which kids love) and the sweet dipping sauce makes them totally over-the-top irresistible. Plus, they bake in the oven which makes for fuss-free cooking and quick clean-up. Serve them with rice and a cucumber salad for a lovely, simple dinner.
