6 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and halved
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
3 slices cooked turkey bacon, chopped, divided

2 teaspoons lime juice
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
sea salt to taste
1 jalapeno pepper, sliced (optional)
1 dash hot sauce, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Scoop egg yolks into a bowl; add avocado, 2/3 of chopped turkey bacon, mayonnaise, lime juice, garlic, cayenne pepper, and salt. Mash egg yolk mixture until filling is evenly combined.
Spoon filling into a piping bag or plastic bag with a snipped corner. Pipe filling into each egg white; top with a turkey bacon piece, jalapeno slice, and dash hot sauce.

Description: 
This is a twist on the traditional deviled egg. I usually use 1 or 2 fewer yolks for the filling.
