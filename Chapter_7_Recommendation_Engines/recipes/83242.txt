Ingredients:
2 cups skim milk
1/2 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 bananas, mashed
1/2 cup golden raisins (optional)

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the skim milk, evaporated milk, sugar and vanilla. Pour into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.
When the ice cream is done freezing, add the bananas and raisins and let them mix in. Transfer to a freezer container, and freeze overnight before serving to improve the texture.

Description: 
A cheap and easy ice cream recipe without cream: just evaporated milk, skim milk and sugar. I flavored the basic ice cream recipe with vanilla and banana puree to get rid of the evaporated milk taste but feel free to improvise!
