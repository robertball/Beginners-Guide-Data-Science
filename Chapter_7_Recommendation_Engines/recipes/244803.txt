Ingredients:
1 (24 ounce) package white chocolate-flavored almond bark (melting chocolate)
24 peppermint candy canes, broken into pieces
1 drop red food coloring, or as desired

Directions:
Melt white chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, 10 to 20 minutes.
Place candy canes in a food processor; pulse until powdery with tiny pieces. Stir candy cane powder into melted white chocolate until well mixed, thick, and somewhat lumpy. Add food coloring until desired color is reached.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spoon mixture, about 2 teaspoons per mint, onto the baking sheet, about 1-inch apart. Cool to room temperature and store mints in a resealable bag.

Description: 
Going for a fun Halloween idea, thought of my pink peppermint patties and instantly knew what to do. Same recipe, just different concept. Enjoy.
