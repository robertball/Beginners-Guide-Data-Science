Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1 dash salt
1 dash saffron
1 cup butter
2/3 cup water
2 tablespoons margarine
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, finely diced
1 teaspoon red curry powder
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 diced jalapeno
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup beef broth
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder, and pinch of salt. Cut in 1 cup butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water until mixture forms a ball. Shape dough into a log, and cut into 10 equal sections. Roll each section into a six inch circle (approximately 1/8 inch thick). Set aside.
Melt margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion until soft and translucent. Stir in ground beef. Season with 1 teaspoon curry powder, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, jalapeno, and pepper. Cook until beef is evenly brown, stirring constantly. Stir in beef broth and bread crumbs. Simmer until liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat.
Spoon equal amounts of filling into each pastry circle. Fold over and press edges together, making a half circle.  Use a fork to press edges, and brush the top of each patty with beaten egg.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
