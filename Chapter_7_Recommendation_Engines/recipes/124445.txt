Description: 
My mother used to bake these mouth-watering cookies for an after-school treat. Though it's been 55 years since I first found out about them, I still savor the smell that fills the house as these cookies bake. They stay moist and fresh for a long time, or the dough can be stored in the refrigerator for several days so you can bake as you need them.
