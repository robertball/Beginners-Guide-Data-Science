Ingredients:
1 lb lean ground beef
salt and pepper to taste
1 small green onion, diced
1 small yellow onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, diced
1 pkg taco seasoning
crushed red pepper to taste
2 tbsp canola or extra virgin olive oil
1 11 oz rolled pizza dough, thin crust
1 cup cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
Brown beef over medium heat. Season with salt and pepper. Drain fat.
Add pepper, onion, garlic, taco seasoning and crushed red pepper to beef mixture. Cook until vegetables are tender and flavors have begun to marry, approx 10 minutes.
While beef mixture is cooking, heat oil in separate pan over medium heat.
Roll out dough and cut into 6 equal sections.
When oil is hot, fry each piece of dough for approximately 1 minute on each side until golden.
Remove from pan and place on paper towels to capture extra oil.
Top each section with beef mixture and cheddar cheese.
Fold like a taco and enjoy!

Was looking for a quick and easy dinner for me and the man. Had left over pizza dough that I like to use for flatbreads. Simple to add in veggies to meat mixture and play with the flavors!
