Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) can jumbo, butter-flavored biscuits
1/3 cup olive oil
2 teaspoons dried rosemary, or more to taste
3 teaspoons granulated garlic
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 dash dried basil
1 dash dried oregano
1 dash ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Shape biscuit dough into 12 balls. Roll each ball into a 4- to 6-inch long strip.
Combine olive oil, rosemary, garlic, chili powder, salt, basil, oregano, and pepper in a bowl. Dip dough strips one-by-one into the oil mixture and roll until totally covered. Tie each strip into a knot, stretching as needed. Place knots on an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
