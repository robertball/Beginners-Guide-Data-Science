Ingredients:
5 boneless chicken breasts

2 tablespoons corn starch
3  tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1/2 teaspoon lemon/dill mix
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Rinse and pat dry the chicken.  Trim any cartilage or fat.  Cut chicken into bite sized pieces.  Add olive oil to skillet with a tight lid and heat on stove to medium.  Saute the chicken to lightly browned.  Add spices and cover tightly.  Simmer for about 10 minutes (add water as needed so not to burn).  Drain the juice from the oranges into a small bowl.  Add the cornstarch and set aside.  Add the oranges to the chicken and cook another 5-10 minutes.  Add the cornstarch/juice and simmer till thickened.  Serve with wild rice, recommended.
