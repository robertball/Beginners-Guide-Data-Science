Ingredients:
12 cups popped popcorn
1 cup candy corn
1 cup dry-roasted, salted peanuts
1/2 cup candy-coated peanut butter pieces (such as Reese's PiecesÂ®)
1 pound chocolate almond bark (chocolate confectionery coating), broken into chunks

Directions:
Mix popcorn, candy corn, peanuts, and peanut butter pieces together in a large bowl.
Melt the almond bark in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until smooth, 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch.
Pour melted almond bark over popcorn mixture; stir until popcorn is well coated. Spread popcorn mixture out onto a flat surface lined with waxed paper or parchment. Let dry completely, then break into clumps.
