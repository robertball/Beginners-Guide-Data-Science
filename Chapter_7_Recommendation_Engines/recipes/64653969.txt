Ingredients:
1 tablespoon oil
1 1/2 pounds lean ground sirloin
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 medium onion, diced
3 stalks celery, diced
2 cans diced green chiles, undrained
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1 tablespoon Chili Garlic Sauce or more to taste, such as Huy Fong Foods
1 30 oz. can chili beans, undrained
1 29 oz. can tomato sauce
1 29 oz. can pinto beans, drained (See cooks notes)
Optional garnish:
Lime
Cilantro
Diced onions
Cheddar cheese
Diced avocado

Directions:
Turn on saute function on the Instant Pot® and add the oil and ensure the bottom of the inner pot is coated.
When the indicator says hot cook the ground beef until browned.
Add the onion, celery and garlic to the ground beef stirring occasionally, cook until onion is translucent.
Turn off the Instant Pot® and add the green chiles, oregano, cumin, cider vinegar, chili garlic sauce and canned beans to the the ground beef and stir well.
Close lid and pressure cook for 10 minutes + Natural Release.
Cooks notes: Make sure you do not over fill your pressure cooker. In a 6 quart Instant Pot® place the pinto beans in last and and only use enough to fill the inner pot to 2/3 full. Add the balance of the pinto beans after pressure cooking the other ingredients. If you have an 8 quart Instant Pot® all of the ingredients will fit without overfilling.
