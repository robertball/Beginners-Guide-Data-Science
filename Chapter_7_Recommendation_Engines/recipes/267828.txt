Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes
For the Dressing:
1/2 pound bacon, sliced
1 cup diced yellow onion
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/2 cup white wine vinegar
1/4 cup freshly chopped Italian parsley

Directions:
Preheat a grill for 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Add potatoes. Grill, flipping occasionally, until potatoes are barely just tender when poked with a skewer, about 15 minutes. Let sit until cool enough to handle.
Cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until grease becomes foamy, about 5 minutes. Remove half the bacon with a slotted spoon; reserve for the topping. Add onion to the rest of the bacon in the pan; cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, peel potatoes. Cut into quarters, then into 1/2-inch slices. Place in a bowl.
Stir sugar, salt, black pepper, cayenne, and vinegar in with the bacon. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Stir and remove dressing from heat.
Pour dressing over the potatoes; toss to combine. Let sit for 5 minutes. Mix again and add parsley. Top with reserved bacon. Enjoy warm.

Description: 
The usually undercooked potatoes and lack of mayo characteristic of German potato salad have usually hindered my appreciation for this dish. So in my version, the potatoes are grilled over some smoky coals until tender. Best enjoyed warm, or at least room temp, this is the perfect addition to a sunny picnic table.
