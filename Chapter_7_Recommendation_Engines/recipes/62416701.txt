Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. ginger
1 tsp. nutmeg
1 cup Crisco shortening
1 cup white sugar
1 tsp. vanilla
1 cup dark brown molasses
1 cup water
1/2-1 cup additional flour
white sugar
raisins or strawberry jelly (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In large mixing bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, ginger and nutmeg, set aside.
In medium bowl, cream together the Crisco, sugar and vanilla, and add to the flour mixture. Add molasses and water to flour mixture bowl.
Mix all ingredients together just until doughy ball forms. Turn dough out onto floured surface, and kneed together for 2 minutes, adding flour as needed.
With rolling pin, roll dough out to 1/4" thickness, sprinkling additional flour on top, if needed. Cut out with circle (or any shape) cookie cutter.
Place cookies onto lightly sprayed cookie sheet or parchment paper. Sprinkle cookies with a pinch of white sugar. Make a small thumb print in the center of unbaked cookie and fill with either strawberry jelly or 3 raisins (optional). Be creative!
Bake on middle rack for 10-12 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Let cool on cookie sheet for 5 minutes before moving to metal cooling rack or flattened paper grocery bags.
