Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 sack giblets from one turkey
1 cup diced celery
1/2 cup chopped onion
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
8 cups dry bread cubes
1 cup chicken broth

Directions:
Chop giblets and cook in butter in a medium skillet over medium heat, 2 minutes.  Stir in celery and onion and cook until tender, but not brown.  Remove from heat and stir in salt, pepper and poultry seasoning.
Place bread crumbs in a large bowl.  Toss with giblet mixture and enough broth to lightly moisten the bread.  Use stuffing to stuff an 18 pound turkey, or bake separately, in a 2 quart dish, covered, 40 to 45 minutes in a 375 degree F (190 degree C) oven.
