Description: 
This is a seasoning mix that I stumbled onto by accident.  I was trying to find an online recipe for a homemade substitute for seasoned salt, but i did not have all the ingredients....I was half way through when i realized the problem, so I just stopped and left this mix in the bowl on my counter.  Not wanting to waste it, i experimented and found that it is a great mix as is!  I now use it all the time, and have been asked for my Roasted Potato secret mix many times.  Enjoy!
