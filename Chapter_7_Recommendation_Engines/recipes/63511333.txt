Description: 
Prosciutto is our staple when come to couple’s food because it is sexiest cold cut in Italy. If you want to knock a date out of the park, have some prosciutto! It’s tasty and little salty, and perfect paired with a simple chicken dish. It’s best to deglaze the pan of this dish with the wine you’ll be serving. By Fabio Viviani
