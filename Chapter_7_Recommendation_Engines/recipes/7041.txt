Description: 
A delicious dinner roll that is made from beer, honey, and a slight pinch of cinnamon.  Excellent with turkey, roasts etc.  Different beer may be substituted, but be advised that a highly hopped beer will create an astringent bitter taste. The unique taste comes from the malt used in making the beer.
