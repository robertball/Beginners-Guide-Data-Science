Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 onion, chopped
1 cup light sour cream
1 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/3 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/3 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
8 (10 inch) whole wheat flour tortillas
1 (12 ounce) jar taco sauce
3/4 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook chicken in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, until no longer pink and juices run clear, about 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain excess fat. Cube chicken and return to skillet. Add onion, sour cream, 1 cup Cheddar cheese, parsley, oregano, and ground black pepper.  Heat until cheese melts, about 3 minutes.  Stir in salt, tomato sauce, water, chili powder, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, garlic, and black beans.
Roll even amounts of mixture into tortillas. Arrange in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with taco sauce and 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese.
Bake uncovered in preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling, about 20 minutes. Cool 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I've always liked this recipe because it is quick and easy. I'm always looking for ways to cut out excess fat so I use reduced-fat cheese and sour cream. I also like to add fiber to make the meal a little healthier for my family so I add black beans and some bell peppers. This also adds color! To make it super healthy I use whole-wheat flour tortillas. And it still tastes just as delicious!
