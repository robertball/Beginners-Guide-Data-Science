Ingredients:
1 center-cut slice of watermelon, 1 to 2 inches thick
1/4 cup plain yogurt
1 teaspoon honey
1/3 cup fresh blueberries
1/3 cup fresh raspberries
1/3 cup sliced fresh strawberries
1 tablespoon chopped pistachio nuts
1 teaspoon shredded coconut

Directions:
Cut the round watermelon slice into 8 wedges, keeping them together for a nice presentation, and place on a serving dish.
Spoon yogurt evenly over watermelon, stopping before the rind. Drizzle with honey. Sprinkle blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, pistachios, and shredded coconut evenly over the yogurt. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This recipe is like your favorite bowl of yogurt loaded with all the toppings, just on top of watermelon instead. Watermelon pizza with yogurt makes a striking presentation and is delicious, but also healthier. It makes just as good a guilt-free breakfast as it does a show-stopping dessert. You can use any combination of mixed berries you like.
