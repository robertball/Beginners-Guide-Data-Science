Description: 
A tasty chowder perfect for a cold winter day. If your feeling adventurous buy some small sourdough boules of bread, scoop out the middle and serve the chowder inside the bread bowl. The bread soaks up the chowder that doesn't make it onto your spoon.  The bread bowl is delicious and fun to eat!
