Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package uncooked rotini pasta
2 (28 ounce) jars pasta sauce
1/2 pound salami, cubed
2 (8 ounce) packages shredded Italian cheese blend
8 (1 ounce) slices provolone cheese
Italian seasoning to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place rotini in the pot, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente. Drain, and mix with the pasta sauce to coat.
Scoop half the pasta and sauce into a large casserole dish. Layer with 1/2 the salami, and 3/4 of the shredded cheese. Cover with remaining pasta mixture, layer with remaining salami and shredded cheese, and top with provolone slices. Sprinkle with Italian seasoning.
Cover with aluminum foil, and bake 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly.

Description: 
This is a great potluck dish or a main entree for dinner. It's very heavy, so a small portion goes a long way.
