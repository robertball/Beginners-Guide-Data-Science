Ingredients:
Pasta- 1 box (of whatever kind you like)
Blue cheese crumbles- 1 container (whatever kind/brand you want)
Wing sauce- 2 BOTTLES(usually the cheapest orange colored sauces work best because they are runny and absorb well)
Blue cheese dressing-  2 BOTTLES I go to both extremes here, I buy one jar of the refrigerated really good stuff and one jar maybe 2 jars of the cheap blue cheese dressing unrefrigerated on the shelf.
Chicken- for chicken you can get all white meat, use left overs, deli chicken, whatever you prefer.
Celery- One whole package

Directions:
PREP WORK:
COOK PASTA- TO DESIRED FIRMNESS, RUN UNDER COLD WATER TO COOL PASTA.
CHOP/ SHRED CHICKEN TO DESIRED THICKNESS ETC.
CHOP CELERY TO DESIRED THICKNESS
AFTER PASTA HAS COOLED TO AT LEAST ROOM TEMP.  COMBINE ALL INGREDIENTS HOWEVER ONLY ADD ONE BOTTLE OF WING SAUCE AND ONE BOTTLE OF BLUE CHEESE DRESSING AT A TIME TOGETHER.  STIR BOTH INTO SALAD THEN EVALUATE.  ADD MORE OR LESS OF EACH BOTTLES AFTER TO TASTE, PASTA WILL ABSORB SOME SAUCE SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO RE-CHECK SALAD AFTER IT HAS BEEN SITTING FOR AWHILE.  IF YOU LIKE IT HOTTER OR DRIER OR MORE RUNNY, ETC. YOU CAN EASILY PLAY WITH THAT TO SUIT YOUR TASTE.   PROMPTLY REFRIGERATE.  IF SERVING TRY TO KEEP COOL.  LEAVE OUT NO MORE THAN FOUR HOURS.
