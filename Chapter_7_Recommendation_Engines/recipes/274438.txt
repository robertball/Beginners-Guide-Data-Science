Ingredients:
Crumb Topping:
1/3 cup tightly packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces
Muffins:
2 cups peeled and finely chopped apples
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup oil
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup quick-cooking oats
2 cups whole wheat flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin tin cups with cupcake papers.
Mix brown sugar, all-purpose flour, and cinnamon together in a small bowl for crumb topping. Add butter and press with the back of a spoon or your fingers to incorporate it into the sugar mixture. Mix until crumbly and set aside.
Toss apples with lemon juice in a large bowl. Mix in sugar, honey, buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla until combined. Stir in oats.
Combine whole wheat flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt in a smaller bowl. Gently fold flour mixture into the wet ingredients with a large spoon, until flour is just mixed in. Spoon batter into the prepared cupcake papers and sprinkle about 1 teaspoon crumb topping on top of each one.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
These muffins are great for a fast breakfast. I also put them in lunch boxes instead of cookies. They become even more moist the next day from the apples.
