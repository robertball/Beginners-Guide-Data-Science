Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup Quaker® Oats (Quick or Old Fashioned, uncooked)

1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
In large bowl, combine flour, oats, baking powder and salt; mix well.
In separate medium bowl, combine milk, egg and oil; blend well.
Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients all at once; stir just until dry ingredients are moistened (do not over mix).
Add one of the stir-in options, if desired; mix gently.
Heat skillet over medium-high heat (or preheat electric skillet or griddle to 375 degrees F). Lightly grease skillet.
For each pancake, pour 1/4 cup batter into hot skillet.
Turn when tops are covered with bubbles and edges look cooked. Turn only once.
Serve & enjoy!
