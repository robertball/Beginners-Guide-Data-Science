Ingredients:
2 pounds beets, trimmed
4 small garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
5 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, or to taste
1/2 pound arugula
1 (8 ounce) package feta cheese, thinly sliced
16 pitted kalamata olives
1/4 cup olive oil, divided

Directions:
Place beets into a large saucepan and pour in enough water to cover the beets by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the beets are easily pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes. Drain and let cool.
Peel beets, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices, and cut slices in half. Place into a bowl.
Smash garlic with salt in a small bowl using a spoon until the mixture becomes a paste. Stir lemon juice into garlic paste. Retain about 1 tablespoon lemon dressing in a small bowl and pour the remaining lemon dressing over beets; toss to coat.
Divide arugula between 4 plates; top each plate with beets, feta cheese, and olives; drizzle salads with olive oil and retained lemon dressing.

Description: 
Beets are an incredible vegetable. They're packed with tons of vitamins and antioxidants, and the dark crimson color adds a nice accent to most dishes. In this particular salad, they blend perfectly with the creamy feta cheese while balancing out the tang of kalamata olives. You'll convert even the most skeptical eaters who have always turned a nose to the wonderful world of beets with this salad topped with a citrus dressing over a bed of nutty arugula.
