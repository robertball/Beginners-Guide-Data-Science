Ingredients:
10 ounces spinach, rinsed
1 (16 ounce) package bow tie pasta
1/4 cup olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
2 1/2 cups cherry tomatoes, quartered
8 ounces crumbled goat cheese

Directions:
Remove stems from spinach and stack leaves together; chop thin longer strips instead of square chops and set aside.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and place in a large bowl.
Drizzle olive oil over pasta and add salt and pepper to taste, spinach and tomatoes; gently toss.
Add goat cheese and serve warm or room temperature.
