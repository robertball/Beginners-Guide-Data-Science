Ingredients:
Crust:
2 Cups Flour
1/2 Cup Powdered Sugar
1 Cup Butter, I never substitute
1/2 Teaspoon Salt
Topping:
4 Eggs
1/3 cup Lime Juice
1/4 cup Flour
2 Cups Sugar
2 or 3 Teaspoons Lime Zest
1/2 Teaspoon Baking Powder
1-2 drops of Green Food Coloring, Optional
Glaze:
1-1/2 Cup Powdered Sugar
1 Tablespoon Lime Juice
1 Teaspoon Lime Zest, Optional

Directions:
Combine first four ingredients and pat into a greased 12 x 15 pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.  Mix together the eggs, lime juice, lime zest, sugar, flour, baking powder and food coloring.  Pour over crust and bake 25 minutes at 350 degrees.
When done, let cool and spread the glaze over the bars.  Let the glaze set and cut into bars. You can omit the glaze and sprinkle with powdered sugar if that's your preference.

Description: 
A different take on the lemon bars we all love.  I actually prefer them to lemon. This is my favorite bar cookie and I'm asked to bring it when going to a potluck or picnic.
