Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
2 eggs
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoons strong brewed coffee
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup chocolate chips, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8-inch baking dish with parchment paper.
Combine beans, eggs, applesauce, cocoa powder, coffee, vanilla, baking soda, and salt in a blender or food processor. Blend batter until smooth. Pour 1/2 cup chocolate chips into batter; stir gently to combine.
Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish; top with remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven. Let cool completely before cutting into squares, about 15 minutes.
