Description: 
This is very unique and what we had with our crepes when I was a kid. Most look at me funny, but love it once they try it. It's not too sweet, unless you want it to be. We would have our crepes rolled with butter and brown sugar inside.  Then you put some brown sugar on the side and drip some black coffee into it, but don't make it too runny.  I even loved it as a kid.
