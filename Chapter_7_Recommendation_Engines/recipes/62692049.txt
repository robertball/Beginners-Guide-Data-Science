Ingredients:
Party rye slices
Good chunk of swiss cheese grated
about 1/2 cup chopped black olives
1/4 cup bacon bits (the artificial ones work just fine)
1-2 tbs chopped green onions
Mayo to hold it together nicely (several tbs)

Directions:
Preheat oven to Broil.
Mix ingredients 2-5 together.
Put a dollap of the spread on each piece of bread.
Place in oven for only a minute or so until hot and bubbly. Watch them because they can burn quickly.

Description: 
These are terrific, always the hit of the party, even since the 70s pool parties that Uncle Mike and Aunt Kay had in PA. If you are watching your calories and fat, well just pass on by.
