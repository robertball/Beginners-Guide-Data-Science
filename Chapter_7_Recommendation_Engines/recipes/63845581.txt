Ingredients:
Crust:
2/3 cup Graham cracker crumbs
2 T white sugar
2 T melted butter
Filling:
2 (8 oz) packages cream cheese
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla
2 eggs
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
Pinch ground cloves
Pinch ground nutmeg
Whipped topping

Directions:
Preheat oven 325 degrees
Crust:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place foil cupcake liners in a 12-cup muffin pan.
In a medium bowl, mix together the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and margarine with a fork until combined. Measure a rounded tablespoon of the mixture into the bottom of each muffin cup, pressing firmly. Bake in the pre-heated oven for 5 minutes, then remove to cool. Keep the oven on.
In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar and vanilla. Beat until smooth. Blend in eggs one at a time. Remove 1 cup of batter and spread into bottom of each crust; set aside.
Filling:
Add pumpkin, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg to the remaining batter and stir gently until well blended. Carefully spread over the batter in the crust.
Bake in preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until center is almost set. Allow to cool, then refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight. Cover with whipped topping before serving.
