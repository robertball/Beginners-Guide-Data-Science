Ingredients:
2 (5 ounce) cans water-packed tuna, drained
1 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup finely chopped celery
1/4 cup finely chopped green onions
1/4 cup finely chopped carrots
2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
8 large ripe olives, sliced
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard (such as Grey PouponÂ®)
1/4 cup butter, melted
12 slices sourdough bread, or more to taste
12 slices Swiss cheese

Directions:
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine tuna, mayonnaise, celery, green onions, carrots, hard-boiled eggs, olives, and mustard in a bowl; mix until well combined.
Brush melted butter on one side of each bread slice. Top an unbuttered side with a slice of cheese, some tuna salad, another slice of cheese, and another slice of bread, buttered side facing up. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Transfer sandwiches to the prepared baking sheet.
Broil in the preheated oven until bread is toasted and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
I got this recipe when I was working at a restaurant, when I was a teenager, that is no longer in business. I like the tuna salad in it because it is a little different then most. And this sandwich is just a little different then most. I serve this with small relish tray of olives, pickles or cucumbers, green onions, pickled beets, pickled okra, and sliced tomatoes. Plus a salad of some sort, like a corn salad or pasta salad.
