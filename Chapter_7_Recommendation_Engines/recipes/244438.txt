Ingredients:
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
2/3 cup coconut oil

Directions:
Combine chocolate chips and coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave in 30-second intervals, mixing well each time, until mixture is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. It takes about 1 minute of stirring until they fully mix together. Store at room temperature in an air-tight container.

Description: 
Two ingredients and less than 5 minutes to a delicious chocolate candy shell for ice cream. After trying recipe after recipe that turned out either rock hard or thick gummy hard shells - I thought to read the ingredient list on a bottle of the store stuff and came up with this! You can use any oil that has NO flavor or has a flavor compatible with chocolate and your ice cream - canola or soybean work ok here, but the coconut oil sends the flavor over the top and makes it a tad crunchier! Drizzle on top of your favorite ice cream!
