Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh asparagus
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
6 tablespoons butter
1 pinch salt
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups water
4 cups hot milk
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
2 tablespoons tamari

Directions:
Break off and discard tough asparagus bottoms. Break off tips; set aside. Coarsely chop stalks.
Cook in skillet over medium heat with onion in butter, salting lightly, for 8 to 10 minutes.
When onions are clear, sprinkle with flour. Continue to stir over lowest possible heat 5 to 8 minutes.
Slowly add water or stock, stirring constantly. Cook 8 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until thickened. Cool slightly.
In blender, puree sauce bit-by-bit with milk until thoroughly smooth.
Return puree to 3-quart pan, preferably a double boiler. Add dill, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and tamari. Heat gently but don't boil.
As soup heats, cook asparagus tips in boiling water until tender, but still very green, about 2 minutes; drain. Add whole pieces to soup.
