Ingredients:
4 medium to large zucchinis (halved lengthwise)
2 small (or 1 large) purple onions (chopped)
8 ounces baby portabella mushrooms (sliced)
4 ounces of cheese (cheddar, jack or a mix)
2 tablespoons margarine
1/2 ounce Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons bread crumbs
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F
Use a melon ball scoop (or just a regular teaspoon) to remove the seeds from the zucchini halves. Keep the seeds for later. You want to get as close to the zucchini skin as possible without tearing.
Place margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and saute for a couple of minutes.
Add the mushrooms and saute for an additional 3 minutes.
Add the removed zucchini seeds. The mushrooms will release their liquid. Afterwards, saute  until all the liquid is evaporated.
Remove from heat and add the cheese. Mix well.
Place the onion-mushroom-zucchini-cheese mixture into the empty zucchini skins. You should have just enough filling for 4 halved zucchinis. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and top with the Parmesan cheese.
Bake, covered, in an oven at 350 for about 30 minutes.
Remove cover and and bake an additional 15 minutes until the parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs are a golden brown and the onion-zuchini-cheese mixture is bubbly.

Description: 
I wanted a simple vegetarian dish that used baby portabella mushrooms and zucchinis. The zucchinis do not need to be precooked for this recipe.
