Ingredients:
1 large zucchini, finely chopped
1 small onion, chopped
3 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1/2-1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh oregano
1/2 cup freshly grated Romano cheese
1 cup 2% milk
2 cups all-purpose flour
salt and pepper to taste
garlic powder to taste
onion powder to taste
dried parsley (optional)
Plain yogurt, sour cream, or apricot jam, for serving

Directions:
Grate and squeeze dry zucchini (essential!)
In a large bowl, mix together the zucchini, onion, Romano cheese, milk, and flour. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and parsley. Stir in eggs just before frying.
Heat skillet over medium heat, then add about 1 tablespoon of shortening (or canola oil) in a large skillet. Drop 1/4 cupfuls of the batter into the skillet, and flatten slightly with the back of a spatula. Turn fritters over when the center appears dry. About 2-3 minutes per side.
Add more shortening to skillet as needed, and continue with remaining batter. Transfer to paper towels and keep warm until ready to serve. These Freeze well too! Does not keep well, enjoy immediately.
