Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch salt
1/3 cup butter, chilled
1 egg
1/2 cup half-and-half cream
1 cup chopped pear

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Sift together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl; cut in the butter until the mixture has a crumbly texture. Whisk together the egg and half-and-half in a separate bowl; stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture until combined; stir in the pear. Drop large spoonfuls of the dough onto an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes; rest briefly on a cooling rack before serving.
