Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
8 jalapeno peppers, seeds and membrane removed, minced
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1/2 cup Cheddar cheese
8 slices bacon

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place chicken breast on a flat work surface. Slice horizontally through the middle, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side. Open the 2 sides and spread them out like butterfly wings. Repeat with remaining breasts.
Combine garlic powder, salt, onion powder, paprika, and black pepper in a small bowl. Sprinkle mixture over chicken breasts.
Combine jalapeno peppers, cream cheese, and Cheddar cheese in a bowl. Spread mixture evenly over chicken breasts.
Wrap 2 strips of bacon around each chicken breast and secure with a toothpick.
Cook on the hot grill until bacon is cooked and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
Simple recipe. I am sure other people have made this recipe before. We like to grill this during the summer and winter months. You can also bake in the oven with a couple tablespoons of grass-fed butter (add fat for keto diet) at 350 degrees F for about 25 minutes. We normally serve with grilled zucchini and a side salad.
