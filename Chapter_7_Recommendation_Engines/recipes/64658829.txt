Ingredients:
Spice cake mix
15 ounce pumpkin puree
1 large egg
1/3 cup canola oil
2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
12 ounce can sweetened condensed milk
12 ounce Carmel sundae topping
5oo ml whipping cream
1/2 cup toffee bits
1/2 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/3 cup salted caramel sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Line a 9 x 13" pan with cooking spray/butter
In a large bowl, add cake mix, pumpkin puree, egg, canola oil, pumpkin pie spice, and beat with a hand blender on high until smooth and combined, about 3 minutes.
Bake 27-30 minutes, or until cake is set in the centre, springy to touch, and a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs but no batter.
While the cake bakes combine the sweetened condensed milk and Carmel sundae sauce, whisk to combine and set aside.
Remove cake from the oven when it's done and use the blunt end of a wooden spoon to poke holes all over the cake (about 60).
Slowly pour the sweetened condensed milk & Carmel mixture over the cake, taking your time to evenly distribute it.
Place the cake in the fridge for about 15 minutes to cool slightly before adding the whip cream so it doesn't melt.
Remove cake from the fridge, evenly spread the whipped cream over the surface, evenly sprinkle with toffee bits, chocolate chips and evenly drizzle with Caramel sauce.  Cover cake and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight before serving.
