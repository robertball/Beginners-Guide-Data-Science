Description: 
I have been making this Mexican-inspired dip for years. It's similar to a dip seen in advertisements for processed American cheese, but with my own twists. It's great as an appetizer, but this hearty mixture of beef, cheese and refried beans can also be served as a full meal. Serve with tortilla chips.
