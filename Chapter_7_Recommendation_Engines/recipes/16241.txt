Description: 
I got this recipe from my mother-in-law.  It's a wonderful, light, refreshing slush that we all love.  She always added a cherry, for color.  You can make it using lemon-lime flavored soda instead of ginger ale, if you like.  Adjust the amount of soda depending on how strong you'd like the drink to be.
