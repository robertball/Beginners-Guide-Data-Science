Description: 
This is a recipe that I made up. It came out great and delicious. This recipe is very creamy, so if you like a less creamy ice cream you can play around with the milk and cream to get the desired texture you like. If you like a harder ice cream, place it in the freezer for a few hours. This is a perfect Thanksgiving recipe. It's very decadent.
