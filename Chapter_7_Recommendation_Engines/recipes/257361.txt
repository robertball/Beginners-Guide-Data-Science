Ingredients:
Chickpea "Tuna" Salad:
1/2 sheet nori (dried seaweed), torn into small pieces
1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup vegan mayonnaise
1/3 cup minced or finely grated carrot
1/3 cup finely diced celery
2 tablespoons dried minced onion
2 tablespoons fresh dill
1/2 teaspoon salt
black pepper to taste
Sandwiches:
8 slices whole wheat bread, toasted
1/4 cup vegan mayonnaise
8 lettuce leaves
8 tomato slices

Directions:
Pulse nori in a blender until it's a fine powder. Set aside to let dust settle.
Mash chickpeas with a sturdy fork or a small-holed potato masher (chickpeas slip through larger, zigzag-type mashers) in a large bowl until most are broken up. Do not overmash--they should retain some texture.
Stir in mayo and mash a little more. Stir in nori powder, carrot, celery, onion, dill, salt, and pepper. Cover and chill at least 15 minutes or up to 3 days.
For the sandwiches, slather toast with mayo (about 1 1/2 teaspoons per slice). Layer salad, lettuce, and tomato between toast slices. Cut sandwiches in half diagonally.

Description: 
Chickpeas are surprisingly fishy, and when they're mashed, taste a lot like tuna! Mix it with nori and the usual tuna salad suspects (like carrots and onion) for a vegan 'tuna' sandwich.
