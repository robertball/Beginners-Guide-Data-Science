Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 Tbsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
3/4 Tbsp white sugar
5 Tbsp + 1 tsp of butter
1 cup buttermilk

Directions:
Cut butter into cubes and place into freezer. Place mixing bowl, food processor bowl and blade into freezer.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.
Place approximately 1-1/2 cups of flour mixture into food processor and add butter.
Pulse for one second intervals until the butter is the size of peas.
Return flour and butter mixture to mixing bowl and toss with hands to mix.
Gradually add milk and combine gently with fingers until dough pulls away from the side of the bowl.
Turn out onto a floured surface, and gently pat dough together. Pat or roll dough out to 1 inch thick.
Cut biscuits with a large cutter or juice glass dipped in flour (cut straight down, do not twist.
Repeat until all dough is used.
Brush off the excess flour, and place biscuits onto a greased or ungreased baking sheet (personal preference).
Bake for 13 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges begin to brown.
Brush with melted butter and serve.
