Ingredients:
1 (2 to 3 pound) chicken, cut into 8 pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste
½ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper, or to taste, divided
½ cup all-purpose flour
1 pinch dried sage, or to taste
1 pinch dried thyme, or to taste
¼ cup vegetable oil
1 pound smoked sausage, cut into 1/2-inch slices
2 cups sliced onions
6 cups chicken stock
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
4  bay leaves
¼ cup chopped green onions

Directions:
Season chicken pieces with salt, pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.
Mix remaining 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper with flour, sage, and thyme in a bowl. Dredge chicken pieces in the flour mixture, coating each side completely.
Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook chicken in the hot oil, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in sausage; cook until browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Add onions; cook until softened, 5 to 6 minutes.
Stir chicken stock, garlic, and bay leaves into the Dutch oven; cover and cook until chicken is very tender, about 3 hours. Stir in green onions before serving.
