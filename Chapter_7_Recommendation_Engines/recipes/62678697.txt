Ingredients:
5 T butter
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 eggs
1 t vanilla
1/2 cup flour (I used Pamela's)
1 cup natural peanut butter
1/4 t baking powder (omit if using Pamela's)
1/2 cup milk chocolate chips
1/2 cup white chocolate chips

Directions:
Spray the inside of your crock stoneware with cooking spray.
Mix all ingredients in a bowl, dump into stoneware
Prop open the lid of the crockpot with something to let out the steam. I used a chopstick.
Cook on high for 90 minutes to 3 hours.  The brownies are done when the edges start to turn darker, but the center is still light in color. Test with a knife in the center.
