Ingredients:
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons sugar
3/4 teaspoon coca powder
1 1/2 tablespoon melted bittersweet chocolate
A splash of Kahlua or coffee liquor*
Thawed Phyllo dough
*If you would like a stronger coffee taste, add more liquor

Directions:
Add all ingredients into a medium sized bowl, and mix with a hand mixer until light and fluffy.
Place mousse in refrigerator until ready to use.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Unroll sheets of Phyllo dough and remove 2 sheets. Layer sheets on top of one another and cut into 2-3 inch squares. Once squares are cut, fit them into the cups on a small non-stick muffin tin to create shells and place in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until dough turns golden brown.
Once the shells are cooled, place a dollop of mousse into each shell (roughly 1 teaspoons worth) and garnish with powdered sugar.
