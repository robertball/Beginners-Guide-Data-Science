Ingredients:
4 pieces of raw bacon
1 small onion chopped
2-3 garlic cloves minced
3-4 tbsp. coconut or olive oil
1/2 large red cabbage or small red cabbage chopped
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
2 cooking apples like cortland or gala, peeled and chopped
1/4 cup brown sugar or palm sugar

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute chopped bacon, onion and garlic in coconut oil till fragrant.
Add the chopped cabbage, toss to coat, cover and stir/toss occasionally till cabbage is starting to soften.  Adjust the heat so nothing burns.
In a separate bowl, mix cider vinegar and brown sugar.
Pour it over the cabbage.
Add apples and cover.
Stir occasionally until most of the liquid has evaporated about 35-40 minutes.
Turn off the heat and let it all sit uncovered for another few minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
This recipe makes for a great veggie side. The apple adds a nice flavour to otherwise bland cabbage and of course bacon makes everything taste good!
