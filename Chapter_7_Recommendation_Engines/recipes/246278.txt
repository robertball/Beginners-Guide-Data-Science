2 stalks fresh rhubarb, diced
¼ cup white sugar

Description: 
Hot rhubarb jam and creamy peanut butter join forces inside a fried crescent roll and conspire to be your new favorite party snack. Use another jam or jelly if you like, but tartness really matters here, and this jam comes together quickly. These are best eaten shortly after frying, while the crescent is crisp and the peanut butter is melted. Dust with confectioners' sugar!
