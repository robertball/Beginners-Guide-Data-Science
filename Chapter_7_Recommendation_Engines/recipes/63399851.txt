Ingredients:
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons corn starch
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup water, apple juice or any juice you have
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla
8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced
1/4 C. flour to dust apples with

Directions:
Dust sliced apples with 1/4 C. flour.
Melt butter in a sauce pan. Stir in flour to form a paste.
Add white sugar, brown sugar and water; bring to a boil. Reduce temperature, and simmer 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
Bake 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue baking for 50-60 minutes.
