Ingredients:
3/4 cup salted butter
1 tablespoon coconut oil
2/3 cup crunchy natural peanut butter
2 tablespoons erythritol confectioners' sweetener (such as Swerve®)
1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder (such as Hershey's®)
1/2 teaspoon pink Himalayan salt
3 tablespoons heavy cream
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup dark chocolate chips (such as Lily's®)

Directions:
Combine butter and coconut oil in a saucepan over low heat and melt completely, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in peanut butter. Heat, stirring continuously, until fully combined with the fat. Combine erythritol confectioners' sugar, cocoa powder, and pink salt in a bowl. Stir into peanut butter mixture until well combined, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in heavy cream and vanilla extract until well combined.
Stir in chocolate chips. Continue stirring until chocolate chips are completely melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Line a cupcake tin with silicone baking cups. Spoon peanut butter mixture into baking cups, about 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons per cup. Freeze until solid, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from silicone cups and store in a tightly sealed container in the fridge.
