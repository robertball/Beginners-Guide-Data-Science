Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, divided
1 onion, minced
1 pound sugar pumpkin - peeled, seeded, and cut into small cubes
1/2 pound orecchiette pasta
2 orange bell peppers, seeded and diced
1 cup heavy cream
4 tablespoons Parmesan cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt 1/2 the butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add pumpkin and cook for 2 minutes. Cover, reduce heat, and cook, stirring often, until soft, 25 to 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orecchiette in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until almost tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes, 2 minutes less than indicated on the package. Drain and transfer to a bowl.
Melt the remaining butter in a second skillet and cook bell peppers until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add to the bowl with the cooked pasta.
Once pumpkin is tender, add cream and Parmesan cheese to skillet. Season with salt and pepper and stir until smooth. Add drained pasta and cooked bell peppers and mix well.

Description: 
A delicious dish, which my kids adore. You can use pumpkin or squash for this recipe and any kind of pasta, but short pasta like orecchiette, penne, or rigatoni works better.
