Ingredients:
1/2 large kabocha squash, seeded
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 small yellow onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup pumpkin puree
1 cup vegetable broth
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste
1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste
1 pinch ground allspice, or to taste

Directions:
Place kabocha squash cut-side down into a microwave-safe baking dish. Pour 1/2 inch water around the squash. Microwave on high until tender, about 10 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a blender.
Scoop kabocha squash flesh into the blender. Add pumpkin puree, vegetable broth, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Blend until smooth.
Pour blended mixture into a saucepan. Cook and stir over medium-low heat until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
