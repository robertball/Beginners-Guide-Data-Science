Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 Spanish onion, chopped
1/4 green bell pepper, chopped
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
4 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
1 cup white wine

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, green bell pepper, and garlic until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add brown sugar, Italian seasoning, salt, oregano, basil, black pepper, and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until brown sugar dissolves and seasoning is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and white wine into the seasoned onion mixture; bring to a boil for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have blended, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
We built this recipe from a lot of trial and error and a little experimentation with the wine selection. It has a sweet flavor with just a little zing to keep things interesting. Great for all types of italian dishes. We even used it for Italian sausage bombers.
