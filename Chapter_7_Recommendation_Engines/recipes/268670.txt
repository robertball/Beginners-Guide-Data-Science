Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package dried lo mein noodles
4 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, divided
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 cup diced onion
1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 (15 ounce) can low-sodium chicken broth
1 (8 ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and sliced
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
1 envelope onion soup mix
3 cups chopped celery, 1/4-inch pieces
1 cup sugar snap peas
1/4 cup diced red bell pepper
1 (12 ounce) package fresh mung bean sprouts
1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil; cook noodles, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 6 minutes. Drain and toss with 1 teaspoon sesame oil.
Heat remaining sesame oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add turkey, onion, and garlic to the hot oil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until ground turkey is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease and return to the pan.
Pour in chicken broth, water chestnuts, soy sauce, and onion soup mix. Stir until well combined. Add celery, snap peas, and bell pepper. Cook and stir until slightly softened, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add noodles and bean sprouts to the pan. Stir to combine and serve immediately, topped with red pepper flakes.
