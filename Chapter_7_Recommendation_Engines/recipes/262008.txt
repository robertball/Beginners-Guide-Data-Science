Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce
3 green onions, whites and greens, chopped
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds
2 pounds beef sirloin steak, very thinly sliced
Dipping sauce:
6 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 teaspoons crushed toasted sesame seeds
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
1/4 teaspoon sweet paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 pinch white sugar

Directions:
Mix 1/4 cup soy sauce, green onions, 3 tablespoons sugar, oil, garlic, sesame oil, and 1 teaspoon sesame seeds together in a bowl. Add beef to the marinade. Let sit until flavors are well absorbed, at least 30 minutes.
Mix 6 tablespoons soy sauce, vinegar, 2 teaspoons sesame seeds, ginger root, paprika, cayenne pepper, and 1 pinch sugar together in a separate bowl to make the dipping sauce.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef until firm and lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve with dipping sauce.
