Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
3 bananas, mashed
1 cup grated carrots
1 cup walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 4x8-inch loaf pans.
Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Beat brown sugar and butter together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Stir flour mixture, alternating with bananas, into creamed butter mixture just until batter is mixed; fold in carrots and walnuts. Pour into the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a loaf comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes.
