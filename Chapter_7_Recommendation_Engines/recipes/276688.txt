Ingredients:
Filling:
2 (16 ounce) packages frozen mixed berries
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Crust:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cold butter, cut into cubes
Topping:
2 cups rolled oats
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 cups cold butter, cut into pieces

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Mix together berries, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon for the filling in a bowl until well combined. Pour into a separate, ungreased baking dish.
Bake filling in the preheated oven until berries are hot, about 10 minutes.
While berries are baking, mix together flour, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, baking powder, and salt for the crust in a bowl. Cut in 1/2 cup cold butter with a pastry blender until crumbly. Spread crust mixture into the bottom of the prepared 9x13-inch baking dish and pour hot berry filling on top.
Mix together oats, 1 cup flour, 1 cup brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon for the topping in a bowl. Cut in 1 1/2 cups cold butter with a pastry blender until crumbly. Sprinkle topping over the berry filling.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbling and topping is golden brown, about 35 minutes.
