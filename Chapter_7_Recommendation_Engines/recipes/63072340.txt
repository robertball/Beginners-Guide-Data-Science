Ingredients:
1/3 cup finely chopped pecans
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup sugar
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 tsp. vanilla extract
parchment paper

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake pecans in a single layer in a shallow pan 6-8 minutes or until toasted and fragrant, stirring halfway through.
2.  Beat butter and sugar at medium speed until fluffy.  Gradually add flour, beating just until blended.  Stir in pecans and vanilla.
3.  Divide dough in half, and shape each portion into 2 (11/4 inch thick) logs (about 12 inches long).  Wrap in parchment paper and cover and chill 1 hour or until firm.
4.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Cut logs into 1/4 inch thick rounds, and pace 1/2 inch apart on parchment paper-lined baking sheets.
5.  Bake at 325 for 18-20 minutes or until lightly golden brown.  Let cool on baking sheets 5 minutes.  Transfer to wire racks and let cool completely ( about 30 minutes)
