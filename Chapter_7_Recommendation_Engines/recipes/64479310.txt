Ingredients:
1/2 cup chestnut flour
3 Tbsp fine rice flour, brown or white
1 Tbsp potato starch
1/2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp honey
1 egg, separated
1/2 cup of milk or milk substitute
1 Tbsp vegetable oil

Directions:
Mix together the dry ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside.
Mix together the honey, milk, oil and egg yolk in a large mixing bowl. Set aside.
Preheat a waffle iron.
Whip the egg white until peaks form.
Sift the dry ingredients into the egg yolk mixture mixing constantly so lumps do not form. Do not over mix to allow the baking powder to react without losing too many air bubbles.
Fold in the egg white to the flour mixture until just combined, again taking care that as few air bubbles escape.
Pour batter into the waffle iron as per manufacturer instructions. I use a Belgian waffle iron and use a little over 1/4 cup of batter per side yielding 2 full large squared waffles (two sections).

Description: 
The rich and nutty flavour of chestnut flour makes a deliciously unique waffle. Light in texture but hearty in flavour this is a perfect treat for those cool Autumn mornings. Chestnut flour has a smokey flavour that hints of molasses. When you taste these hot waffles topped with maple syrup you'll think Mother Nature arranged this marriage!
