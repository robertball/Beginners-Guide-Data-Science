Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon brown sugar
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cups bread flour
1/3 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
1.	Put the warm water in your bread machine. Add the yeast and brown sugar to the water, and let sit for 10 minutes. Add the oil to the yeast solution. Cover the liquid mixture with the flour, and then the salt. Put the machine on the dough setting. Remove the dough and place on a clean, lightly floured surface. Knead for about 10 minutes, using a little more flour as needed. Cut in two and form each into rounds, then allow them to rest for a minute. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Put one of the doughs on a pizza pan, on a piece of parchment paper. Stretch the dough out to the edges of the paper and cover with a light layer of olive oil. (Trim the edges of the paper except for one corner). Bake for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and lower the temperature to 400 degrees Flip the crust over onto the pan and throw away the paper. Top with your favorite sauce and toppings. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are golden brown, about 30 minutes. (You can freeze the other dough until you're ready use it).

Description: 
This simple pizza crust is chewy and soft, with a crispy exterior. Pizza crust dough can be sticky and hard to work with, so using a bread machine and a dough scraper make it easier to handle.
