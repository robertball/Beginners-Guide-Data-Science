Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can HORMEL速 Mary Kitchen速 Roast Beef Hash
5 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup diced white onion
fresh ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chili garlic sauce
1/3 cup chopped cilantro
2 roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
15 frozen empanada wrappers, thawed
2 eggs
2 tablespoons water
1/2 (8 ounce) jar picante sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Heat non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add roast beef hash, onions, and chili garlic sauce; cook and stir to break up the hash and until onions soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour in 5 beaten eggs and cook, stirring constantly, until eggs just begin to set but are still very loose. Remove skillet from heat. Stir in cilantro and tomatoes.
Lightly flour a work surface. Roll out each empanada wrapper into a 6-inch circle. Scoop 1/3 cup hash filling onto center of each wrapper. Fold each wrapper in half to enclose the filling; crimp edges with times of a fork to seal. Cut 2 half-inch slits on top of each empanada. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.
Whisk 2 eggs with 2 tablespoons water to make egg wash. Brush egg wash over the tops of the empanadas.
Bake in preheated oven on middle rack until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Serve with picante sauce for dipping.
