4 Granny Smith apples, peeled and diced
1/4 teaspoon lemon zest
3/4 cup water

Press crumbs into the bottom of the casserole dish. Bake for 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a medium sauce pan, bring the cranberries, apples, lemon zest, water, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and 2/3 cup sugar to a boil. Simmer 8 minutes. Pour over the walnut crust.
In a medium bowl, combine the granola, 1/4 cup butter and 2 tablespoons sugar. Sprinkle evenly over the apple layer. Press down gently with a spatula.
