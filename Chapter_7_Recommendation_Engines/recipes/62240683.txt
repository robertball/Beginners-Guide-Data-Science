Ingredients:
2.5 LB	  SWEDISH MEATBALLS from IKEA (OR OTHER PRE- MADE MEATBALLS)
1 JAR	  CLASSICO (OR OTHER) WHITE 4-CHEESE PASTA SAUCE
16 OZ	  SOUR CREAM, DIVIDED
16 OZ	  HEAVY CREAM
1/2 TSP	  GARLIC POWDER
1/4 TSP	  SALT
1/2 TSP	  DRIED DILL WEED
24 DROPS  TABASCO SAUCE
16 OZ	  NOODLES

Directions:
Thaw meatballs if you have time.
Pour Classico into a large bowl.  Add 1/2 of sour cream, all of heavy cream and seasonings; whisk until all incorporated.
Pour about a cup of the cream mixture into the bottom of a slow cooker bag in the crock-pot.
Add meatballs to crock-pot and top with remaining cream sauce.
Cook on low for 2 hours if thawed; on high 4-6 hours if not thawed.
Just before meatballs are done, cook noodles according to package directions; drain and pour into a very large serving bowl.
Pour cooked meatballs over noodles and mix well; top with remaining sour cream.

Description: 
I was looking for a way to use up the leftover heavy cream and sour cream from the Holidays, and I came up with this quick and easy version of Swedish Meatballs using pre-made meatballs and store-bought sauce.  It's not what one would call authentic, but it sure tastes good!
