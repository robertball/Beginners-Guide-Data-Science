Ingredients:
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup goat cheese, softened
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
8 leaves fresh basil, chopped
1 bulb roasted garlic
salt and pepper to taste
2 (8 ounce) jars jumbo or extra large olives

Directions:
Place cream cheese, goat cheese, Parmesan, basil, roasted garlic, and salt and pepper into a food processor; pulse until smooth and well blended. Spoon filling into a cookie press or pastry bag (a plastic baggie with the corner cut out will also work), and fill olives.

Submitter: 
crumbs
Description: 
Will definitely impress others! To fill the olives, use a pastry bag or plastic baggie with the corner cut out. What works best is a cookie press. Also, you can use bottled roasted garlic, but I like to make my own.
