Ingredients:
1 cup butter divided (1 stick=1/2cup for caramel and 1 stick for cake)
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
36 marachino cherries
1 20oz can crushed pineapple drained well, (reserve  liquid)
18-19oz yellow cake mix
36 muffin tins
water (enough added to pineapple juice to make
1 1/3 cups of liquid)
3 eggs
1/2 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350, grease muffin tins
Combine 1 stick butter with 1/2 cup brown sugar in a small sauce pan. Bring to a boil stirring constantly for 1-2 minutes. Caramel will be light brown. (do not overcook)
Put one heaping teaspoon of caramel in each muffin tin. Place 1 cherry in the middle of each cup. Scoop a heaping teaspoon of pineapple onto the caramel/cherry mixture.
Melt the remaining stick of butter. Beat 3 eggs in mixer bowl. Add the liquid, melted butter, almond extract and cake mix, beat on slow to combine then beat at medium speed for 2 minutes.
Pour enough batter over the pineapple to fill each cup only 2/3 full (approx. 1/4 cup batter in each muffin cup).
Bake one pan at a time in preheated oven for 18 minutes. Take pan out of the oven and run a knife around each cupcake. Invert pan on a sheet of wax  paper. after a few moments remove pan(I tap the top of the cups to aid the release). Remove the pan and allow to cool.
