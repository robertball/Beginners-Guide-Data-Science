Ingredients:
2 tablespoons dry white wine
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon grated or minced garlic
¾ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
½ teaspoon ground fennel seeds
½ teaspoon mild paprika
½ teaspoon dried parsley
¼ teaspoon anise seed
1 ¼ pounds lean ground pork

Directions:
Combine wine, olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, ground fennel, paprika, parsley, and anise in a medium bowl. Add pork and mix until well combined.
Divide into 6 equal portions and form into patties. Place patties on a plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 24 hours to allow the flavors to meld.
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Working in batches if necessary, cook patties in the hot skillet for 5 minutes per side, or until internal temperature is 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).

Description: 
Italian sausage is traditionally made with a fattier cut of pork but I've made this a little healthier by replacing the fat with olive oil. The patties can be used as you would a burger, or crumple them and use as a topping for pizza, in lasagna, or added to your tomato sauce for pasta.
