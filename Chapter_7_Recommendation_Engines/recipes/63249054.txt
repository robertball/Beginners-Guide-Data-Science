Ingredients:
2 large zucchini
salt
"Quick" Sauce:
Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and add 1 pkg. "meat" crumbles or 1 lb. ground turkey, 1/2 - 1 diced onion, 2 Tbsp. minced garlic, seasoning lightly with salt & pepper. If using ground turkey,  cook until no longer pink. Drain if too watery. (Stop here if making sauce from scratch). Additional ingredients for "Quick" Sauce:
Add 1/4 c. red wine and 1-2 Large jar(s) spaghetti sauce - mix well and simmer together for 15 minutes.
OR make sauce consisting of:
Above "meat" mixture (w/o spaghetti sauce or wine) in addition to:
1 (12 oz.) or 2 (6 oz) cans tomato paste
1 small can tomato sauce (or more as needed)
1/4 cup red wine
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil or 2 tsp dried
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano or 1 tsp dried
1 beaten egg
1 (15 ounce) container low-fat ricotta or a large low fat cottage cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or 2 tsp dried
Fresh spinach
1 pkg (8 oz.) fresh mushrooms, sliced
8 to 16 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese, grated
Parmesan cheese or shredded Three Cheese blend

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Grease or spray a deep 9x13 inch baking pan. Set aside.
Slice zucchini in half and then lengthwise into very thin slices. Sprinkle slices lightly with salt; place slices on parchment lined cookie sheet (with sides) and roast in oven for 15-20 minutes to release moisture. Drain.
To prepare the sauce, stir into the cooked "meat" crumbles or ground turkey mixture(see above), add tomato paste, tomato sauce, wine, basil, and oregano. Bring to a boil (adding additional tomato sauce if too thick); reduce heat and simmer sauce for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently.
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, stir egg, ricotta or cottage cheese and parsley together until well combined.
To assemble lasagna: layer the 9x13 pan with 1/2 of the drained zucchini. Spread 1/2 of the  "meat" sauce over zuchinni, then add 1/2 the ricotta/cottage cheese mixture, 1-2 layers of fresh spinach, the mushrooms and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat by layering the remaining zucchini slices, "meat" sauce, ricotta/cottage cheese  mixture, and mozzarella. Spread Parmesan or Three Cheese blend evenly over the top and cover tightly with foil.
Bake for 45 minutes. Remove from oven and raise oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Remove foil and bake an additional 15 minutes at 350 degrees or until cheese is melted and edges are bubbly. Let stand for 5-10 minutes before serving.
