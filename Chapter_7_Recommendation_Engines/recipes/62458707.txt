Ingredients:
3 large over ripe bananas (or 4 medium)
1/2 cup sugar
1 large egg, beaten
6 oz fat free plain yogurt
2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
Spray a 9 x 5 loaf pan with baking spray and set aside.
Preheat oven to 325F.
Mash the bananas until the consistency of a lumpy puree.
Add the sugar and mix.
Add the beaten egg and yogurt, stir until well mixed.
Whisk the whole wheat pastry flour with the baking soda and salt, then add to the banana mixture 1/4 at a time, stirring well before adding more.  Stir the dough only until all the flour is incorporated.
Let the batter rest about 10 minutes to hydrate the flour then pour into the prepared pan.
Bake at 325 for 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

Description: 
I have updated my grandmother's favorite banana bread recipe, which I think originated in the Fannie Farmer Cookbook.  Mine is a slightly healthier version.
