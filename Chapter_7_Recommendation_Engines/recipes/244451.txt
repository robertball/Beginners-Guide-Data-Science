1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 teaspoons cornstarch

1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple tidbits, drained

Directions:
Combine pineapple juice, sugar, lemon juice, and cornstarch in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until sugar dissolves and sauce is smooth, about 5 minutes.
Stir about 1 tablespoon sauce into the bowl with the egg until egg is slightly warmed. Slowly pour egg mixture into sauce, whisking until sauce is smooth and thickened. Remove saucepan from heat and freeze sauce, stirring occasionally, until completely chilled, about 15 minutes.
