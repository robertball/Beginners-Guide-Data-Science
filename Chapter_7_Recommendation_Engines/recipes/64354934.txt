Place the onions, carrots and fennel in a roasting pan. Drizzle about 1-2 tbsp of olive oil over veggies. Sprinkle salt, pepper, and the 20 sprigs of thyme over the veggies and using hands toss everything together so it's all coated in the oil and seasoning. Place the chicken on top of the veggies. Cover the pan with aluminum foil, tightly.
