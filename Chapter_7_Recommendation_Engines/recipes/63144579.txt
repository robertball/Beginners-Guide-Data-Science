Ingredients:
1 cup Porta Bella mushrooms (or any similar kind)
1 tbsp unsalted butter
2 tbsp olive oil
2 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp garlic powder (or garlic salt)
1 tsp steak rub powder (optional)

Directions:
In a skillet, melt the butter into the olive oil.
Add the (washed) mushrooms. Move them around so that they are all coated in the butter & oil.
Sprinkle on oregano, garlic powder, & steak rub powder. Mix up the mushrooms to disperse evenly.
Continue stirring mushrooms occasionally to prevent burning for about 5 minutes (to taste, depending on how cooked you like your 'shrooms). Remove from heat & serve.
How French of you!
