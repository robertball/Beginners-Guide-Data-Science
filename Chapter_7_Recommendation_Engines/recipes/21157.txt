Ingredients:
3 cups water
2 cubes chicken bouillon
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 tablespoons butter
1 ½ cups uncooked white rice
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
In a  medium saucepan heat water and bullion to a slow boil over medium-high heat.  In a large oven safe skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  Saute onions until transparent.  Increase heat to high and add butter and rice.  Stir constantly until the rice becomes starchy, about 3 minutes, and then carefully pour the chicken bouillon stock into the skillet.
Place the skillet in the oven and bake for 20 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
This is a great recipe for rice that comes out perfect every time.  I serve it with grilled meats such as pork tenderloin, but it complements any recipe. I use medium grain rice because it has a fuller texture, but long grain works fine.
