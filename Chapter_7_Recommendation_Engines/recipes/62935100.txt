Ingredients:
Pasta Dough:
4 1/4 cups flour
3 eggs
1 cup warm water
1/2 cup olive oil
Meat Filling
1/2 lb. ground beef
1/2 lb. ground pork
1 tsp granulated garlic
1 tsp granulated onion
1 12-14 oz can spinach
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Pasta Dough
On a clean large wooden board, marble board, or counter top, pour flour into mound. Make a large well in the center. Crack eggs into the center and whisk lightly with a fork. Pour in olive oil and about half a cup of warm water. Start stirring flour into the center, incorperating wet and dry ingredients. As ingrediets become incorperated, roll dough into a ball, adding more water as needed to become a soft but not sticky ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and let sit at least a half an hour. (This whole process can be done in a food processor fitted with a dough blade or Kitchen Aid mixer with Dough Hook)
Meat Filling
Fry ground meats, garlic, and onion in a large skillet over medium heat until slightly pink. Add can of Drained Spinach and finish cooking through making sure not to brown. Stir in cheese and add salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and let slightly cool before forming Raviolis.
Roll out pasta dough to desired thickness and  make raviolis using ravioli forms. Place on a sheet pan coated with a bit of flour. Place in freezer until firm.
Cook Ravioli in a pot of salted boiling water on a low simmer, approximately 5-6 minutes.
