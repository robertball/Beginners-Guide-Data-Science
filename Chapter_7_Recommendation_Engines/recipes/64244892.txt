Ingredients:
2 lbs potatoes (about 6 medium), peeled or unpeeled, and coarsely grated
1 large onion, grated or minced (or less, to taste)
1 tsp salt, divided
1 carrot, finely grated (optional)
1/2 C flour
1 Tbsp corn starch
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 egg white and 1 whole egg
Oil for frying

Directions:
Place grated potatoes and onion in a colander and set over a large bowl.  Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp salt and toss to combine.  Press the vegetables to squeeze out excess liquid.  Let vegetables stand for 10 minutes and press them again.
Move any thick starch which has collected to a small mixing bowl.  Move potato mixture from the colander to the large bowl.  Add carrot, flour, corn starch, and black pepper; stir to combine.
Add egg to reserved starchy potato liquid and lightly beat to combine.  Add to potato mixture and stir to combine.
Heat approximately 1/3" oil in a frying pan to 365 degrees F.  Add 1/4 C scoops of potato mixture to hot oil and flatten into pancake shape.  Fry until golden brown, approximately 4 minutes per side.  Do not overcrowd the pan- I prefer to fry 4 at a time.  Remove from oil and place on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess grease.  Keep warm in closed microwave or oven until all pancakes have been fried.  Serve warm.
