Ingredients:
1 egg
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 cup dill pickle juice
1/4 cup dill pickles, finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 slice bread, torn into small pieces
1 pound lean ground beef
1/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350°.
Grease a 8x8 inch baking dish.
Beat the egg in a mixing bowl.
Whisk in the onion, pickle juice, pickles, salt, and pepper.
Stir in the bread until soggy, then mix in the ground beef until evenly combined. Form into a loaf and place into the prepared pan.
Stir together ketchup, water, sugar, and Worcestershire sauce; pour over the meatloaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.
An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160°.
