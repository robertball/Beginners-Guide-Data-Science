Ingredients:
1 cup sushi rice, or Japanese short-grain white rice
3 eggs, beaten
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons black sesame seeds
6 sprigs Italian parsley with long stems

Directions:
In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Once cooked, spoon rice into a large bowl and allow to cool until it is cool enough to handle.
Meanwhile, beat eggs together with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Brush the bottom of a skillet with vegetable oil, and place over medium heat. Once hot, pour in 1/6 of the egg mixture and spread evenly over the bottom of the pan. Cook until the egg has just firmed, then carefully flip over and cook for a few more seconds to firm the other side. Repeat with remaining egg to create 6 thin sheets.
Stir together vinegar, sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Microwave for a few seconds until the mixture is hot; stir until the sugar has dissolved. Fold vinegar and sesame seeds into warm rice.
To assemble, place a large spoonful of rice into the center of each egg sheet. Fold into a square, and tie with a sprig of Italian parsley to secure.

Description: 
This is Japanese girl's festival food. This sushi is wrapped in very thin egg sheets. Inside is a vinegar rice ball. I used an Italian parsley sprig as the tie. The look is so cute!
