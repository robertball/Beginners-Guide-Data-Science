Ingredients:
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2 cups rolled oats
3/4 cup chopped almonds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Combine brown sugar, maple syrup, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, salt, cayenne pepper, and cocoa powder in a bowl. Whisk thoroughly. Add oats and almonds. Toss and smear the mixture together using a spatula until well coated. Spread mixture evenly over a silicone-lined baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Toss granola with a fork, breaking up any clumps to get a finer texture. Continue baking until desired texture is reached, 30 to 60 minutes more. Sprinkle some granola onto a plate; if it clinks, it is ready. Turn off the oven and leave granola inside the oven to dry and cool to room temperature.

Description: 
Don't be deceived by its indulgent, chocolaty flavor--this granola contains less sugar than most. Introducing cocoa into the mix not only makes it delicious, but it also makes it better for you! Possibly... The point is this really tastes great, with a pronounced chocolate flavor, and would make a wonderful treat for chocolate lovers and hippies alike.
