Ingredients:
12 ounces whole wheat fettuccine
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
2 cloves garlic, minced and divided
2 zucchinis, halved lengthwise and cut into thin half moons
1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)
4 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup cold milk
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup fat-free evaporated milk
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 cup chopped fresh flat leaf parsley

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Reserve about 1/2 cup cooking water and drain pasta.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir 1 clove garlic in hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add zucchini and red pepper flakes. Continue to cook and stir until zucchini are tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a large bowl and cover with aluminum foil.
Season chicken breast halves with kosher salt and black pepper.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat in the same skillet used to cook zucchini. Pan-fry chicken in hot oil until juices run clear and center is no longer pink, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and cut into strips. Cover with aluminum foil.
Whisk milk and flour together in a bowl.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saucepan; cook and stir remaining 1 clove garlic in hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in flour mixture and bring to a boil while stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring for 2 minutes. Stir Parmesan cheese, evaporated milk, and 1/2 teaspoon salt into the flour mixture, stirring until cheese is melted and sauce is heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
Toss pasta, chicken strips, zucchini, and parsley into sauce, adding reserved cooking water as needed if sauce is too thick.
