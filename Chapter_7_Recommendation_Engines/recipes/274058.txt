Image:
NA
Ingredients:
1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk, or to taste
1 teaspoon red curry paste
2  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, diced
1  red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1  green bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 ⅔ cups water
1 ⅓ cups uncooked white rice
¼ cup shredded coconut
¼ cup raisins

Directions:
Whisk together coconut milk and curry paste in a slow cooker. Add chicken, bell peppers, onion, and garlic.
Cook on Low, stirring halfway, until chicken juices run clear and the vegetables are cooked through, 4 to 5 hours.
Meanwhile, bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
Serve chicken curry over cooked rice. Garnish with coconut and raisins.

Description: 
Bell peppers add a touch of sweetness to this spicy Thai dish. This is my mom's recipe, to which I've added a touch of flair! Use more coconut milk if you like it saucy--I prefer it thick and chunky. Coconut and raisins as garnish bring the heat of the curry down a notch.
