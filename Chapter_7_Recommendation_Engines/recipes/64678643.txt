Ingredients:
10 ounce pizza dough
1/4 cup barbecue sauce
3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 onion sliced thin
1 cup pulled pork

Directions:
Make your favorite pizza dough reciepe hopfully one that produces a chewy pizza crust. Roll out dough thick or thin.
Place dough in a pizza pan or on a stone. Spread a layer of barbecue sauce on top of pizza dough.
Spread half the onion and half the cheese.
Spread the pulled pork on top.
Spread the remaining cheese and onion on top.
In a heated oven at 450 degrees F cook the pizza for 18-20 minutes. Half-way through cooking I like to get underneath whole pizza with a spatulas.
