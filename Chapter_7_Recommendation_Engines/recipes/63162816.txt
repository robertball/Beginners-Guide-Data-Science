Title:
London Broil Marinade for Meatatarians Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1/2 c. Soy Sauce
1/3 c. Lemon Juice
1/3 c. Worchester sauce (nothing beats the real McCoy)
1/3 c. Dry Sherry
2 tsp. sea salt
2-3 minced cloves of garlic

Directions:
Combine ingredients and pour over London Broil. If you use a zip-lock bag it makes it easy to turn regularly.  Marinate at least 4 hours or overnight. I baste the meat with some of the marinade about half of the way through cooking.  As always with this cut of beef, have a good sharp carving knife on hand so that thin full slices can be served.

Description: 
This marinade is always a hit. While it contains a lot of salt, you'll find that the London Broil isn't too salty and that the marinade ternderizes the meat.  Great for the grill or the oven.
