Ingredients:
3 eggs
2 egg yolks, extra
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup (220g) caster (superfine) sugar
2 cups (500ml) single (pouring) cream
250g (about 9 ounces) dark chocolate, melted
350g (about 12 ounces) store-bought chocolate brownies, chopped

Directions:
Place the eggs, extra yolks, vanilla and sugar in a heatproof bowl. Place over a saucepan of simmering water and, using a hand-held electric mixer, beat for 6â€“8 minutes or until thick and pale. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. Whisk the cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold through the egg mixture until well combined. Fold through the chocolate and brownies. Pour into a 2 litre-capacity metal tin and freeze for 6 hours or overnight. Makes 2 litres.
