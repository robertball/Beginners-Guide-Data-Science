Ingredients:
Bowl #1
2 Cups Flour
1 Cup Sugar
1/4 Teaspoon Baking Soda
1 Teaspoon Baking Powder
-
Bowl #2
1 Egg
1/2 Cup Shortening (plain, butter flavored gives an odd taste)
1/4 Teaspoon Anise
-
Bowl #3
1/2 Cup Milk
1 Tablesppon Apple Cider Vinegar

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350
Mix all ingredients in bowl #1.
Mix all ingredients in bowl #2.
Mix and Set, for 3-5 Minutes, all ingredients in bowl #3.
Combine all bowls into Bowl #1. Mix thoroughly.
Dough will be very sticky. Add 1/4 Cup of Flour at a time, until dough is no longer sticky, but still elastic.
Roll-out dough and use cookie cutters of desired shapes.
Bake 10-12 minute; however pay close attention, bottoms of the cookies should be lightly browned and not much else. Should be cooked all the way through.
Allow cookies to cool before applying regular vanilla frosting. Decorate if desired, eat! Often better the second day, I keep them lightly covered with either plastic wrap or a towel in the cupboard. Last about 1 week in that condition.

Description: 
This was my Grandma Alida's recipe, a family favorite. I make them for a myriad of events, and I've never come across a single person who has not enjoyed these cookies. I often get asked which bakery I bought them from.
