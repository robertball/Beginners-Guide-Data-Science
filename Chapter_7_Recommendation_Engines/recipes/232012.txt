Ingredients:
2 (18 x 18-inch) sheets of Reynolds Wrap® Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil
1 medium red bell pepper, cut into strips
1 medium zucchini, thinly sliced
1 small red onion, thinly sliced
8 small whole mushrooms
3 Roma tomatoes, sliced 1/2-inch thick
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon dried basil leaves
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/4 cup grated Romano or Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium-high.
Place 1/2 of vegetables in center of one sheet of Reynolds Wrap® Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil; repeat with remaining vegetables on 2 sheet of foil. Combine garlic, oil, lemon juice, basil, seasoned salt and thyme in small bowl; drizzle over vegetables.
Bring up sides of foil over vegetables; fold down two times. Double fold both ends of foil to seal packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Repeat to make two packets. Place packets on baking sheet with 1-inch sides.
Slide packets off of baking sheet onto preheated grill.
Grill 10 to 12 minutes on medium-high in covered grill.
Slide packets off of grill onto baking sheet. Open packets carefully by cutting beside top fold with a sharp knife, allowing steam to escape.
Transfer grilled vegetables to plates, and sprinkle with grated cheese, if desired.
