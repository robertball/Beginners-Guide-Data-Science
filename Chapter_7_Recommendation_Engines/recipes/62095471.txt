Ingredients:
Ingredients:
3lbs chicken (use cheap pieces, like thighs)
1 chopped onion
2 large chopped bell peppers
1/2 can chopped jalapenos

12 corn tortillas, cut into 1 inch squares
1 (4C) pound Colby/jack cheese, shredded

Directions:
Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350*
Salt/Pepper chicken to taste.
Melt 1T butter in large pan, cook onion and bell pepper until tender. Remove and place in large mixing bowl. Melt remaining butter and sear chicken (Cook over very high heat very quickly-don't burn the butter). Remove chicken and set aside.
Pour water into pan to bring up the tidbits left in pan. Reserve.
Cut the chicken into large chunks and add to bowl.
Add remaining ingredients(including water), reserving 1C cheese.
Mix thoroughly and place in baking dish.
Bake, covered, for 30 minutes. Uncover and add remaining cheese. Bake until cheese is melted and bubbly.
I serve this with Mexican Crema(sour cream, mexi style) and shredded iceberg on the side.
