https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/543672.jpg
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup shortening
3/4 cup milk
2 eggs
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cream together the shortening and sugar.  Mix in eggs and beat well.
In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  Add flour mixture to shortening mixture in thirds. After each third, add 1/4 cup of the milk and mix well.  Dough will be soft.
Put dough on well-floured surface and knead in just enough additional flour so it can be rolled.  Cut with your favorite cookie cutter.
Transfer to parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes. I rotate my sheets, baking each sheet 5 minutes on middle, then 5 minutes on top rack.

Description: 
I have been making these since the 70's.   The recipe was passed on to me by my   mother-in-law and I have yet to find a   better tasting sugar cookie!   I sprinkle them with colored sugar for  the holidays.
