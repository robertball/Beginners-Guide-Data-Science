Ingredients:
1 box brownie mix and ingredients required on the box
1/3 cup chocolate or peanut butter chips (optional)
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup chopped peanuts

Directions:
Prepare the brownie batter as directed on the box.
If desired, stir in the chips.
Pour batter in to the baking dish.
Place peanutbutter in a microwave safe bowl.  Microwave 30 seconds, or until easily pourable.
Pour peanut butter in thin stripes over the brownie batter.  For a pretty design, drag a knife through the stripes in the opposite direction of the stripes.
Sprinkle chopped peanuts over the batter.
Bake as directed on the box.

Description: 
I make these when I only have time for boxed brownies but don't want to underwhelm.  They take only moments more to make, but will get gobbled up much faster!
