Ingredients:
1 lb ground turkey
1 clove garlic, minced
2 Tbsp canned chipotles in adobo sauce (pureed)
1 Tbsp chili powder
1 tsp salt
½ tsp pepper

Directions:
Mix everything together until well incorporated. Add extra chipotle sauce or chili powder for more heat. Let sit for several hours or overnight.
Form into 4 patties. Make a dent with your thumb in the bottom side of each burger. Dent side down, grill on medium high heat. Don't press on the burgers. Flip after a few minutes and cook through until no longer pink.
Serve on a bun with smeared avocado and nectarine salsa!

Description: 
I made a smoky and spicy chipotle turkey burger and loved it.  I was super happy with the results! You should be happy too, because this burger is low fat, high protein, and max flavor. 

PS. This makes for a great meal stealer. Like when I make chipotle turkey burgers and steal the leftover turkey to make chipotle turkey tacos. That’s what I call two for the price of one.
