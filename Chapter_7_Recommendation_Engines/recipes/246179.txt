Ingredients:
1 cup dried black chickpeas (garbanzo beans)
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 quart water
1 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped, or more to taste
1 (1 inch) piece chopped fresh ginger
3 tablespoons water
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds
2 pinches asafoetida powder
4 potatoes, peeled and quartered
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon garam masala
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 cups water
3 tablespoons tamarind paste, or more to taste

Directions:
Sort and clean chickpeas and wash them under cold water; drain. Combine chickpeas, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and baking soda in a large bowl; add 1 quart water. Soak chickpeas for 24 hours; drain.
Combine onion, garlic, and ginger in a blender; add 3 tablespoons water. Blend mixture at high speed until a smooth paste forms.
Heat vegetable oil in a 4-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds and asafoetida; cook and stir until asafoetida expands and cumin seeds darken, about 1 minute. Stir onion paste into cumin mixture, taking great care to avoid splattering. Cook and stir mixture until well mixed and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Stir chickpeas, potatoes, 1 teaspoon salt, coriander, garam masala, turmeric, and cayenne pepper into onion-cumin mixture; add 2 cups water. Bring liquid to a boil and cover pot; reduce heat and gently simmer for 1 hour. Stir tamarind paste into chickpea mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes more.
