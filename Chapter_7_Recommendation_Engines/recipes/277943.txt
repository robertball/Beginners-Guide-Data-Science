Ingredients:
4 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and chopped
1 (32 ounce) carton low-sodium chicken stock
1  yellow onion, diced
1 ½ teaspoons salt
1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper
1 (16 ounce) package thick cut bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 cups heavy cream
4 tablespoons butter
¼ cup all-purpose flour
¼ cup sour cream
2 tablespoons chopped scallions, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Combine potatoes, chicken stock, onion, salt, and pepper in a slow cooker. Cook on High until potatoes are tender, about 4 hours.
Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels and wipe out most of the grease from the skillet.
Puree potatoes in the slow cooker with an immersion blender until smooth. Add 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese and 1/2 of the cooked bacon, set temperature to Low, and cook for 1 to 2 hours.
Melt butter in the skillet over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add heavy cream and sour cream and whisk until thickened. Pour into the slow cooker and cook on Low for 1 more hour.
Ladle into bowls and garnish with remaining bacon, remaining Cheddar, sour cream, and scallions.
