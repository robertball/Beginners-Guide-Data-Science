1/4 cup self-rising flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
3 tablespoons vegetable oil

2 tablespoons chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®), or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Stir self-rising flour, sugar, egg, vegetable oil, milk, cocoa powder, chocolate-hazelnut spread, salt, and vanilla extract together in a large mug until batter is smooth.
Cook in microwave oven on full power until the cake has risen in the mug and is set in the center, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 minutes.

Description: 
As a poor starving college student, this recipe is one of my favorites. It is quick, cheap, and 1-portion size. I actually make about 6 servings of the dry ingredients ahead of time, then add the liquid later. The dry is about 11 tablespoons. A whipping cream or ice cream topping completes this heavenly dessert. Can substitute peanut butter for hazelnut spread, but cut the portion to 1 1/2 tablespoon. You can increase cocoa powder and hazelnut spread to 3 tablespoons each and substitute almond extract for vanilla if desired.
