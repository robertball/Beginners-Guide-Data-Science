Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
4 teaspoons minced garlic
2 green chile peppers, chopped
3 stalks lemon grass, minced
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 limes, juiced
1 lime, zested
2 tablespoons corn oil
1/4 cup corn oil
1/2 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
1 (7 ounce) can baby corn, drained
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
3/4 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp (30-40 per pound)

Directions:
Place cumin, coriander, ginger, garlic, green chile peppers, lemon grass, cilantro, lime juice, lime zest, and 2 tablespoons of corn oil in a food processor. Blend to a smooth, thick paste. Set aside.
Heat 1/4 cup of corn oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir green beans and baby corn for about 30 seconds. Stir in the paste, soy sauce, and coconut milk and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes, then add the shrimp. Cook the shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 3 to 5 minutes. If the sauce becomes too thick, stir in some water.

Description: 
I lived above a Thai restaurant for a year in Sydney and they made the best green curry I've ever tasted. I was a regular customer and they even loaned me plates and bowls. I managed to persuade the chef to let me know how he made the curry. I've adapted it slightly to bring down the heat but it's still got a nice kick to it. Apparently the paste will keep in the fridge for up to 4 months! Serve immediately over fluffy jasmine rice.
