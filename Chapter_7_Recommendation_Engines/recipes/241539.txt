Description: 
Yummy salami, onion,and cream cheese roll ups for an appetizer or a party! Secure the roll ups with toothpicks, and cut them into bite size pieces. Sometimes I make different versions, so I can have a platter that includes roll-ups with onions and pickles. Something for everyone! You can use pickles in place of green onions, if desired.
