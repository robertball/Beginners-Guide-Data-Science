Ingredients:
1 small onion, diced
½ cup diced celery, with leaves
6 slices stale bread, cut into cubes
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon dried sage
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon celery salt
½ cup melted butter
1 (3 pound) whole chicken
¼ cup chopped fresh savory

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir together onion, celery, bread, pepper, parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme, and celery salt in a large bowl; pour melted butter over bread mixture and stir to combine.
Spoon stuffing into the cavities of chicken; place chicken into a roasting pan. Sprinkle chicken with savory; cover with a lid or foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove cover; increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Roast until browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C),  about 15 minutes.

Description: 
I taught my children this recipe by singing along to Scarborough Fair by Simon and Garfunkel: Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme, great herb stuffing seasonings. If you can get savory from the Atlantic provinces to green your chicken; it would be the best. My father was a Newfoundlander and swore by their savory.
