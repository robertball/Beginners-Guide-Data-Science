Ingredients:
2 ounces uncooked spaghetti, broken in half
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons sour cream
1/2 pound ground turkey
1/4 cup chopped green pepper
2 tablespoons chopped onion
1 teaspoon butter or margarine
1/3 cup tomato sauce
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and pepper to taste
1/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Cook spaghetti according to package directions; drain. In a bowl, combine the egg, Parmesan cheese and spaghetti. Press spaghetti mixture onto the bottom and up sides of a greased shallow 2-cup baking dish or 7-in. pie plate. Spread with sour cream.
Crumble turkey into a skillet; add the pepper, onion and butter. Cook over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the tomato sauce, garlic salt, oregano, salt and pepper. Spoon into spaghetti crust. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Cover edges loosely with foil. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until heated through and cheese is melted. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This pie is practically a meal in itself. I usually put a green salad and crusty French rolls on the table with it.
