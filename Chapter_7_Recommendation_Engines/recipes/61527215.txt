4 (4 ounce) fillets salmon
4 tablespoons prepared Dijon-style mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a shallow baking pan with aluminum foil or grease with Olive Oil PAM.
Place salmon skin-side down on foil.  Season with salt and pepper and spread a thin layer of mustard on the top of each fillet. Top with seasoned Panko bread crumbs, then spray generously with Olive Oil PAM.
Bake in a preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until salmon flakes easily with a fork.  Crisp up top by broiling for several minutes.
