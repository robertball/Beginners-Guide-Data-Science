Description: 
Rice(I used Minute Rice and increased to 1 1/2 cups , was quicker and that's all I had) is sauteed with salt(I used garlic powder and salt), cumin and onion, then simmered with tomato sauce(I used 1/2 diced fresh tomato instead, and mashed them just so they weren't chuncks) and chicken broth(used 1/4 cup less). I added chopped cilantro before steaming. Only steamed for 15 minutes.Modified from: Mexican Rice II
