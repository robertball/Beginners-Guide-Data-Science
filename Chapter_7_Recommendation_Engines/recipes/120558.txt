Ingredients:
1 pound eggplant, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 large red onion, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 medium yellow sweet peppers, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 tablespoon olive or canola oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
SAUCE:
1 1/2 cups chopped onions
2 teaspoons olive or canola oil
6 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon fennel seed, crushed
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/8 teaspoon dried thyme
1 (16 ounce) package ziti or other small tube pasta
4 cups chopped fresh spinach
1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese

Directions:
In a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray, combine the eggplant, red onion and yellow peppers. Drizzle with oil; sprinkle with salt. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 35-45 minutes or until edges of peppers begin to brown, stirring every 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a saucepan, saute onions in oil until tender. Add garlic, red pepper flakes and fennel; cook and stir for 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes, parsley, salt, pepper, sugar and thyme. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Cook pasta according to package directions; drain.
In two greased 2-qt. baking dishes, spread 1/2 cup sauce each. In each dish, layer a fourth of the pasta, a fourth of the roasted vegetables and 1/2 cup sauce. Top with 2 cups spinach and 1/2 cup sauce. Top with remaining roasted vegetables, pasta and sauce.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Uncover; sprinkle with cheese. Bake 10-15 minutes longer or until heated through and cheese is melted.
