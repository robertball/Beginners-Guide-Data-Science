Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 shallot, finely chopped (1/4 cup)
1 cup wild rice
3 cups vegetable sock
1/2 cup pecans
1/4 cup dried cranberries
1/4 cup golden raisins, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper

Directions:
1. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shallot, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3 minutes. Add rice, and cook for 1 minute. Add vegetable stock, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer, covered, until rice is tender, and starting to burst, 40 to 45 minutes. Drain any excess liquid. Transfer to a bowl.
2. While rice cooks preheat oven to 400`F. Arrange pecans on a rimmed baking sheet, and toast until browned, and fragrant, about 8 minutes. Let cool. Coarsely chop pecans.
3. Add toasted pecans, cranberries, raisins, and parsley to rice. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm.
