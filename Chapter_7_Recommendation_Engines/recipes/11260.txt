Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon white sugar
3 tablespoons butter
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup honey (optional)

Directions:
Mix the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar together. Cut in the butter until well-blended. Stir in the eggs and mix thoroughly.
Knead dough on a floured surface until dough is elastic. Let dough rest for 1 hour.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Divide dough into 4 parts, keeping each piece covered until ready to use. Roll each piece into a thin rectangle, about 8x10 inches. Cut dough into strips about 8 inches long and 3/4 inch wide. Tie each strip into loose knot.
Fry cookies in hot oil 3 to 4 at a time, until golden brown. Transfer cookies to a paper towel-lined plate. Drain well and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and honey, if desired. Serve hot or cold. Store any uneaten cookies in an airtight container (see Editor's Note).

Description: 
Great unusual fried cookies--the original name is 'Cenci alla Fiorentina.' It came from my Italian cousins. I used these for a bake sale once and ran out before I even got started!
