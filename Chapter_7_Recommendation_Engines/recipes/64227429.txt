Description: 
Recipe was given to my mother by a new neighbor when we moved to the neighborhood. She was a human dynamo! Miss Louise became a treasured friend before cancer took her. We still make these every Thanksgiving and Christmas and laugh at the memory of her Beetle car spitting gravel as she peeled out of her driveway because she always was at top speed!
