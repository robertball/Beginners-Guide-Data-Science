Ingredients:
1 Tbsp butter
1 1/4 cups steel-cut oats (not instant)
1/2 Tbsp pumpkin spice or cinnamon
3 3/4 cups water
2 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Saute Oats: Push saute button to heat pot. Melt butter in heated pot adding the spice. Saute until slightly golden.
Pressure-cook: Add the water and oats to the pot and stir to combine. Close and lock the lid. For chewy oats, pressure-cook for 10 minutes on HIGH pressure. For creamier oats, pressure-cook for 13 minutes on HIGH pressure.
Naturally release the pressure: When the cooking cycle completes, turn off the machine. To prevent scorching, don't let it switch to the "keep warm" setting. Allow the pot to cool down and release pressure naturally, about 10 minutes. Once the pressure has fully released, carefully open the lid away from you. (Consult your pressure cooker's manual to learn how to tell when it's safe to remove the lid.)
