Ingredients:
2 pounds tilapia fillets
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon paprika
cooking spray
1/2 cup plain fat-free yogurt
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 1/2 teaspoons canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
16 (5 inch) corn tortillas
2 cups shredded cabbage
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 tomato, chopped
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced
1/2 cup salsa
2 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Rub tilapia fillets with 2 tablespoons lime juice and season with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Spray both sides of each fillet with cooking spray.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Combine yogurt, 2 tablespoons lime juice, cilantro, and chipotle pepper in a blender; pulse until sauce is well blended. Set aside.
Grill tilapia on preheated grill until fish is easily flaked with a fork, about 5 minutes on each side.
Heat each corn tortilla in a skillet over medium-low heat until warm, about 1 minute. Divide grilled fish evenly over corn tortillas and serve with cilantro-lime sauce, cabbage, Monterey Jack cheese, tomato, avocado, salsa, and green onions.
