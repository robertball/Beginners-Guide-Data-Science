Ingredients:
1/3 cup tapioca flour
1/3 cup brown rice flour
1/3 cup sorghum flour
1/2 cup shortening, chilled and diced
1/4 cup almond meal
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons xanthan gum
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons water
1 1/2 teaspoons dry egg replacer (such as Ener-GÂ®)
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix tapioca flour, brown rice flour, sorghum flour, almond meal, cornstarch, sugar, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Cut in diced shortening using a pastry blender or two knives until pebble-size pieces form.
Whisk water, egg replacer, and vinegar in a small bowl; stir into flour mixture until a loose dough forms.
Roll out dough to even thickness on a piece of parchment paper and transfer to a 9-inch pie plate, or press dough evenly into the pie plate.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 minutes.
