Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 ripe banana
1/2 cup sourdough starter
1/2 cup sour cream
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup milk, or as needed
1 tablespoon butter, melted, divided

Directions:
Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.
Mash banana in another bowl. Stir in sourdough starter, sour cream, egg, 2 tablespoons butter, and vanilla extract. Add to the flour mixture and stir until just combined. Mix in milk gradually until batter is pourable but some lumps remain.
Heat a griddle over medium-high heat. Grease lightly with melted butter. Pour 1/4 cup batter onto the griddle for each pancake, keeping them 2 inches apart. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining butter and batter.

Description: 
A tasty and easy breakfast for two hearty appetites! Perfect for when you need to use up some starter and have an overripe banana. I add mini chocolate chips to mine.
