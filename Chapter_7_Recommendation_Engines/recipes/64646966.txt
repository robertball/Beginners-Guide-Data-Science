Ingredients:
1 pound penne pasta
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper, or less for your taste
1 28-ounce can plum tomatoes, drained
1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese
1/4 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
Sea Salt for pasta water and additional seasoning
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
Fresh basil for garnish, optional

Directions:
Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, 8 to 10 minutes or according to package directions. *Tip - I like to cook about 1-2 minutes less than the package directions so the pasta is al dente.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over low heat. Add garlic and crushed red pepper; cook, stirring, until the garlic is golden, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, crushing them roughly with the back of a wooden spoon.
Bring to a simmer over low heat and cook until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes.
When the pasta is ready, drain and return to the pot.
Stir in the sauce and place the pot over high heat. Stir until the mixture sizzles. Remove from heat. Add cheese and parsley; toss well.

Description: 
You can either serve immediately or in an oven safe pan/dish put under the broiler for just 1-2 minutes if you like some of the cheese melted and pasta crispy! This is the way I like to enjoy this dish!
