Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup turbinado sugar
1/4 cup real maple syrup
1/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
20 cups popped popcorn

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 1 or 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Combine butter, brown sugar, turbinado sugar, maple syrup, and honey in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart saucepan over low heat. Stir continuously until mixture begins to simmer; let simmer on low, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add vanilla extract and baking soda at once. Stir to combine.
Place popcorn in a warm mixing bowl and coat by drizzling caramel sauce over corn while stirring using a heavy metal spoon, making sure to stir slowly and not allowing hot caramel on hands. Place onto the prepared baking sheet, using an additional baking sheet if you're worried it is piled too high.
Bake in the preheated oven until crispy, about 40 minutes, removing every 10 minutes to stir corn.
Remove from the oven and place the tray on a wire rack to cool, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
My wife and I love to munch on caramel corn while watching a movie. But I don't like using corn syrup. Try this delicious, crispy, maple version.
