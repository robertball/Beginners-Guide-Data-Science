Ingredients:
4 pork chops (boneless, 3/4" thick)
1 Tbsp oil
1 clove minced garlic
Sauce:
2 tsp oil
1/4 cup beef broth
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 Tbsp brown sugar
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper
2tsp cornstarch
2 Tbsp water

Directions:
Trim fat from pork
Heat oil in skillet. Brown chops on both sides
Remove from pan & add a little more oil if needed.
Saute garlic for a minute (donâ€™t burn).
Combine oil, broth, soy sauce, brown sugar & red pepper.
Place chops back in skillet. Pour sauce over them. Cover tightly.
Simmer over low heat until chops are tender & cooked through (30-35 min.).Add a little water if needed to keep sauce from cooking down too much.  Turn chops once halfway through cooking.
Remove chops to platter.  Dissolve cornstarch in 2 Tbsp.water and add to sauce. Cook until thickened.
Pour over chops & serve.  I like it with a bit more red pepper than stated in the recipe.  It gives it more zing.  Also, I often leave the extra oil out of the sauce as the residual in the pan is usually enough.  This works great with thinner chops as well, just reduce the simmering time or you'll get tough chops.
