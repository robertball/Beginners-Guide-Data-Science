1/3 cup chicken broth, divided

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Pour yogurt, egg, and coconut oil into a medium bowl and mash together. Mix in 1/2 of the chicken broth, mint, and parsley. Add 1/2 of the chickpea flour, oats, and turmeric; mix until combined.
Mix in remaining broth, then add in remaining flour; knead until incorporated. Scoop dough into a resealable plastic bag. Cut a hole in the corner and pipe out sticks of dough onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until crunchy, 15 to 20 minutes.

Good for your dog's teeth. You can also add your dog's favorite flavors like peanut butter, apples, etc. Make the treats into whatever shape you want. I prefer sticks.
