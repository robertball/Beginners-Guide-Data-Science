Ingredients:
gold potatoes (raw, cut into chunks)
carrots (fresh, peeled and roughly chopped)
mushrooms (fresh, roughly chopped)
1 cup dried barley, rinsed
1/2 cup dried lentils, rinsed
1/2 cup ditalini pasta or other small pasta
32 oz. vegetable stock
About 5 cloves garlic, chopped
About 1-2 tsp each: salt, dried basil, dried parsley, dried thyme
Water (to be added if it starts to dry out during cooking)

Directions:
Chop potatoes, carrots, mushrooms, and garlic. Put them into the crock pot.
Rinse barley, lentils, and pasta. Put them into the crock pot.
Add spices and stir all ingredients together in the crock pot.
Pour in vegetable stock.
Cook on low for 6-8 hours or until vegetables are cooked, stirring occasionally.  I needed to add water about 4 hours in because it started to get dry.
