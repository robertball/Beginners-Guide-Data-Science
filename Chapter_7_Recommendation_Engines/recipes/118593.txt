Ingredients:
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 cup water
1 1/4 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
1 tablespoon lemon juice
GRAHAM CRACKER MIXTURE:
2 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter, melted
ICE CREAM:
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant cheesecake or vanilla pudding mix
1 quart heavy whipping cream
2 cups milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine sugar and cornstarch. Gradually stir in water until smooth. Stir in blueberries and lemon juice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally. Cover and refrigerate until chilled.
In a large bowl, combine the cracker crumbs, sugar and cinnamon.  Stir in butter. Pat into an ungreased 15-in. x 10-in.x  1-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool completely on a wire rack.
In a large bowl, whisk the ice cream ingredients. Fill ice cream freezer cylinder two-thirds full; freeze according to manufacturer's directions. Refrigerate remaining mixture until ready to freeze.  Whisk before adding to ice cream freezer (mixture will have some lumps).
Crumble the graham cracker mixture. In a large container, layer the ice cream, graham cracker mixture and blueberry sauce three times; swirl. Freeze.
