Description: 
I have dairy allergies but I love curry. I created this recipe based on another curry recipe and it turned out amazing. Tasty and delicious curry. Not too spicy, but spicy enough to taste like a true curry. An easy dish that you can cook in only about half an hour. And best of all - no cow's milk! Serve with quinoa or rice.
