Ingredients:
Tart:
1 prepared pie pastry (such as PillsburyÂ® Pie Crust)
1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling
7 1/2 ounces part-skim ricotta cheese
1 egg, beaten
1 1/2 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
Crumb Topping:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Roll out pie crust lengthwise to fit into the bottom a 13x9-inch baking dish with a good 1/2-inch of the crust up all sides.
Mix apple pie filling, ricotta cheese, egg, and shredded Cheddar cheese together in a bowl; pour over the pastry and flatten into a smooth layer.
Mix flour, brown sugar, salt, and cinnamon together in a separate bowl. Mash butter into the flour mixture with a fork or pastry cutter until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle over the apple pie mixture in the pan.
Bake in preheated oven until crust is a good caramel-brown color, 15 to 20 minutes.

I enjoy finding other uses for ingredients in my kitchen. Needing a fresh dessert for my family one night, I came up with this gem. Feel free to add to or take away as you and your family need. This tart is good warm, and scrum-diddily-umptious cold! Enjoy.
