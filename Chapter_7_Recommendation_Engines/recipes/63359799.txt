Ingredients:
2 cups grated sweet potato
3 bananas (overripe work the best - I freeze ripe ones and use those defrosted until mushy)
2 eggs
1/3 cup creamy honey, melted
1 capful vanilla (real kind)
1 generous tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup coconut flour or almond flour (i prefer almond)
3/4 cup dark chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 365.
* Blend sweet potato and bananas into gloppy mush
* Add vanilla. Mix
* Add eggs. Mix
* Add honey. Mix
* Add baking powder, baking soda, flour. Mix
* Mix some more properly so there are no floury lumpy bits.
* Add oil. Mix.
* Add chocolate chips. Mix.
Wipe a bit of olive oil around each cuplet in a muffin tin. Spoon in batter until full but not overfull. Bake approx 30 mins until golden brown and knife comes out clean. Let sit in tin for a few minutes and then gently tip out onto plate.
