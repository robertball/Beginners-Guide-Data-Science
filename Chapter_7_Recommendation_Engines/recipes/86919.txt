Ingredients:
8 ounces uncooked rotini pasta
1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced
1 large tomato, diced
1/2 cup Ranch dressing
2 tablespoons crumbled cooked bacon

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente. Drain, and rinse under cold running water to cool.
In a bowl, gently toss together pasta, avocado, tomato, dressing, and bacon. Chill until ready to serve.

Description: 
This is something I threw together one day. Prepare the veggies while the pasta cooks and you're done in 10 minutes. I use different kinds of tomatoes, depending on what I have on hand. Cherry or grape tomatoes are easy to just throw in - no cutting required.
