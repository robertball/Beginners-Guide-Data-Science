Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon Italian herb blend
1/2 cup canola oil
2/3 cup lowfat milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Sift dry ingredients into a medium-size bowl. Make a well in flour mixture, and add canola oil and milk. Mix with a fork until mixture cleans the bowl and forms one mass.
Place dough on floured surface and knead lightly 10 times. Roll or pat out dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Using a round 2- to 3-inch cookie cutter cut dough into circles. Place biscuits on an unoiled baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes. Best served warm.

Description: 
Biscuits are traditionally made with a solid fat like butter but they're even better with canola oil! Replace solid fats with canola oil and you'll cut total fat as well as trans and saturated fats.
