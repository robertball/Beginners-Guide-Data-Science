Ingredients:
Royal Icing:
4 egg whites
8 cups confectioners' sugar, or as needed
1/4 cup lemon juice, or as needed
Cookies:
24 sugar cookies
24 large marshmallows
1 (.75 ounce) tube black decorating gel
1 (.75 ounce) tube orange decorating gel
75 silver nonpareils, or as desired (optional)
1 (.75 ounce) tube red decorating gel (optional)
1 (.75 ounce) tube green decorating gel (optional)

Directions:
Beat egg whites lightly in a large bowl using an electric mixer until frothy. Slowly beat enough confectioners' sugar into egg whites to make icing that will hold shape; blend in lemon juice until desired consistency is reached.
Arrange cookies about 1-inch apart on a large sheet of waxed paper. Spread icing onto each cookie, allowing icing to drip over edges to look like melting snow.
Grease a microwave-safe plate. Place 1 marshmallow onto plate.
Microwave marshmallow until it starts to puff up, 20 to 30 seconds. Immediately place marshmallow on the edge of 1 cookie while the icing is still wet to look like a melted snowman. Repeat with remaining marshmallows and iced cookies.
Decorate 'melted snowmen' by piping 'twig-like arms' using black decorating gel on the icing. Make 'coal eyes' and a 'mouth' on the marshmallow using black decorating gel. Make a 'carrot nose' under the 'coal eyes' using orange decorating gel. Make 'coat buttons' by arranging silver nonpareils down the middle of the icing. Make 'scarves' or 'bow-ties' using red decorating gel or green decorating gel.
Allow cookies to fully dry before removing from waxed paper, at least 1 hour.
