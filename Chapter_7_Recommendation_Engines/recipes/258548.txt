Description: 
Can't eat oats but need something nutritious and delicious in the morning to keep you moving? This is it. Super easy and healthy. This recipe is extremely versatile. Too wet, add more coconut. Too dry? Add more peanut butter. I make this different every day and haven't been disappointed yet.
