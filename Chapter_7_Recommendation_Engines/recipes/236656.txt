Ingredients:
1 (9 ounce) box Barilla® Oven Ready Lasagne
1 quart milk
6 tablespoons butter
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
Salt and black pepper to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 (24 ounce) jar Barilla® Meat Sauce
1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, julienned

Directions:
Pre heat the oven to 375 degrees F.
For the bechamel, bring the milk to a simmer in a saucepan. Meanwhile in a separate pan, melt butter; stir in flour and cook 2-3 minutes. Stir the hot milk into the butter-flour mixture. Whisk vigorously and bring to a simmer;  cook for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and 3/4 of cheese.
Pour 1/5 of the Barilla sauce and 1/5 of the bechamel into the bottom of a 13x9 baking dish; top with basil. Cover with three noodles and repeat for 3 layers. For the top layer add the remaining Parmigiano cheese and basil. Cover with foil.
Bake until the corners are bubbling and slightly brown, about 20 minutes. Let the lasagna rest for 5 minutes before serving.
