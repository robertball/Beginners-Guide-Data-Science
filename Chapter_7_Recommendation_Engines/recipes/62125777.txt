Description: 
One of my sisters, Beth, learned how to make carrot cake in home economics class in 1978.  A few years ago I asked her to write down what she remembered from the recipe.  Only remembering two-thirds of the ingredients, I completed the recipe by trial and error.  It was worth all the effort. Simply delicious.
