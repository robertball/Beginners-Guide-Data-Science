Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie shell, baked
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup peanut butter

1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 tablespoons cornstarch
3 eggs, separated
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
6 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Mix confectioners' sugar and peanut butter until mixture has a crumbly texture.  Sprinkle half over the bottom of the shell.
In the top of a double boiler, combine milk, 2/3 cup sugar, salt, vanilla, cornstarch, and egg yolks.  Cook over medium-low heat until thick. Pour filling into crust.
Beat egg whites until foamy.  Add cream of tartar, and continue beating.  Gradually add 6 tablespoons sugar, and continue beating until stiff peaks form.  Spread over the top of the pie.  Sprinkle with remaining peanut butter mixture.
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 30 minutes.
