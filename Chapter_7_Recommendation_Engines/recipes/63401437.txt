Ingredients:
2 lbs stew beef
1 t Montreal Steak Seasoning
1/2 t onion powder
1/2 cup barley
1 bay leaf
1 T oil
Handful baby carrots, chopped
1 T dried minced onion
2 cans beef stock
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (28 ounce) can chopped stewed tomatoes
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large fry pan, heat oil over medium heat.  Add beef, sprinkle with Montreal Steak Seasoning and onion powder.  Brown briefly, stirring to brown evenly.  Pour entire contents in a slow cooker, add beef broth and cook until very tender (usually 4 to 5 hours on High, but can vary with different slow cookers). Add barley, carrots and bay leaf during the last hour of cooking. Remove meat, and chop into bite-size pieces. Discard bay leaf.  Add remaining ingredients and cook for another 30-60 minutes.  Add more stock or some tomato juice if soup has thickened too much.
