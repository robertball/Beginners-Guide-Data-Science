Description: 
This refreshing treat is good any time of the day, whether you're having it with breakfast, after lunch, or for dessert. It's sweet, nutritious, and has a bit of a spark that will make you just love it. I use less yogurt because that's how I personally like it, but you can add more to vary the taste.
