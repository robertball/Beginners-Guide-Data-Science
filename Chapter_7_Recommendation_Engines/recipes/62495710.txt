Ingredients:
1 pound of boneless turkey breast
1 1/2 tablespoons smoked paprika
1 teaspoon chipotle chili powder
1 teaspoon granulated garlic
kosher salt
black pepper
blended olive oil

Directions:
Cut Turkey into Medallions
First you want to take the turkey meat and cut it into small little pieces which we called medallions. They are about 2 to 3 bites.
Add Spices and Oil to Turkey Medallions
add smoked paprika, chipotle powder, granulated garlic, two nice pinches of salt, three turns from the pepper mill and 1 tablespoon or so of blended olive oil or vegetable oil. Next, you want to go in with a pair of tongs and mix everything together until it is all fully incorporated and your medallions are coated with spices and oil.
Cook Turkey on a Grill Pan
Here we have a screaming hot grill pan. Let this cook for about one minute on each side and give it a flip. Look for good grill marks, when it has good grill marks a flip it over. If it doesnâ€™t have good growth marks let it cook for a little bit longer. Remove it from the grill.
Serving Spiced Turkey Medallions
You can optionally drizzle over a little bit of BBQ sauce. This would go nicely with just about anything.
