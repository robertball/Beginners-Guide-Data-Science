Ingredients:
1/2 cup dried food-grade seaweed (can be found at markets such as Whole Foods or Asian grocery stores.)
1 bunch fresh kale
1 tbsp minced garlic
2 tbsp sesame oil
1 tbsp minced ginger
1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds
2 tbsp Bragg Liquid Aminos or soy sauce to taste.

Directions:
Rinse the seaweed in water and let soak, covered in water for 6 minutes. Drain and place in a large bowl. Add 1 tspn of sesame oil and the minced ginger.
Prepare kale by soaking in water to loosen any dirt, rinsing very thoroughly. Chop cross-wise into 1 in. X 2 in. strips or however slender you like.
In a large covered skillet, uncover and heat 2 teaspoons of sesame oil on medium heat. Add garlic and gently saut√© for 1 minute. Add the seaweed and ginger, gently cook for 1 minute. Remove from pan back to the bowl and set aside.
Heat 1 tbsp sesame oil in the skillet. Add the kale and 3 tbsp of Braggs. Mix in the pan to coat the kale with the oil and Bragg. Cover; lower heat to low; let cook for 5-10 minutes or until kale is wilted - make sure not to cook too long to where it becomes mushy or burned.
Remove cover and let cook a minute more to evaporate any excess moisture. Remove from heat and mix the kale with seaweed ginger mixture. Add more sesame oil and Braggs to taste. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds.
You can eat as is, but I prefer to refridgerate after cooking until cold, 10-20 minutes, and then serve like a salad with chopsticks.
