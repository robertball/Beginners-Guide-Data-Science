Ingredients:
1 pound fingerling potatoes, halved lengthwise
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Toss potatoes, garlic, Parmesan cheese, lemon zest, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and toss again until evenly combined.
Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add butter and heat until melted. Add potatoes; cook and toss until evenly coated with butter, about 2 minutes. Move skillet to the preheated oven.
Roast in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until soft, tossing potatoes halfway through. Remove from oven and top with parsley.

Everyone loves roasted potatoes, and fingerling potatoes have a natural hint of sweetness that makes them a nice alternative to other potatoes. They pair well with almost anything, from grilled steak to chicken marsala. The possibilities are endless! The Parmesan cheese and garlic brown up in the oven for crunchy bits of flavor.
