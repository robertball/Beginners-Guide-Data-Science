Description: 
For Saint Patrick's Day celebrations, or for Reuben sandwiches any time of the year, this corned beef is delicious, and it slices perfectly, not crumbly or dry, after some time in a sous vide bath! Lots of liquid comes out during the cooking, and you can reserve it for a sauce, or use as cooking liquid for cabbage or potatoes on the big day. This method requires a bit of planning ahead. However, it does not require much attention because the sous vide circulator does all the work for you, except slicing, of course!
