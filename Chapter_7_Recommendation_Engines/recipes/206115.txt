Description: 
When my husband and I were visiting Toledo, Spain, we enjoyed a refreshing, tangy, and creamy bowl of gazpacho outside a small church at a tiny storefront restaurant. I had never tasted anything like it. I asked how they made it and developed this recipe to take home. If you like, serve chopped cucumbers, peppers, and parsley as a garnish.
