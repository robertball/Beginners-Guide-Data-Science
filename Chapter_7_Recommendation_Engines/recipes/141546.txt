Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups converted long-grain white rice
2 teaspoons safflower oil
2 cups water
1/4 teaspoon ground thyme
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese
2 cubes beef bouillon
1 pound lean ground lamb

Directions:
Combine rice and safflower oil in a saucepan over medium heat; stir and cook 2 minutes. Add the water, thyme, garlic powder, and bouillon. Cover, and cook 15  minutes more over medium heat, or until liquid is absorbed.
Meanwhile, cook the ground lamb in a large skillet over medium heat until browned, about 10 minutes. Drain, then stir into the rice along with the Monterey Jack cheese until the cheese melts. Cool completely before serving.

Description: 
Tired of purchasing canned dog food our two large rescue dogs wouldn't eat, I decided to make pooch-friendly chow that was savory and good for them. I use converted rice, but pasta, bulgur, or quinoa may all be substituted.
