3 small yellow squash, washed and cubed (don't peel)
1 tbsp dried rosemary

Directions:
Put olive oil into a frying pan and add onion.  Cook on medium heat 5 minutes or until soft.  Add squash and rosemary and cook another 10-15 minutes.  Squash should be lightly browned but not mushy.  Beat eggs, grated cheese, garlic, salt and pepper.  Pour over vegetables and reduce heat.  Cook over low-medium until eggs have set, about 10 minutes.  Slide onto a plate and divide into portions.
