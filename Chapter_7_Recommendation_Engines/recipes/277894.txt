Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
1/2 cup butter, cut into chunks
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 cup cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup finely chopped seeded jalapeno chiles
1 small fresh red chile pepper, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.
Place butter in a microwave-safe dish. Microwave, uncovered, on high until melted, about 30 to 45 seconds.
Pour melted butter into a large bowl and stir in sugar. Add eggs and beat until well blended. Stir in buttermilk and baking soda. Add corn, cornmeal, flour, jalapenos, red chiles, and salt; mix until well combined but do not overmix. Transfer batter to the prepared muffin cups using a ladle or large serving spoon.
Bake in the preheated oven until a fork inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I created this recipe when my wife offered to bring something to her brother Justin's New Year's Eve party. In a way that only those who are brought up together can get away with, she was told that he never likes anything that she brings. He then relented and said she could bring the cornbread. After a bit of experimenting, this is what we came up with. Everyone at the party agreed that this cornbread was awesome, and much better than any cornbread Justin ever made. Gotta love sibling rivalries.
