Ingredients:
olive oil cooking spray
4 vegetarian sausage patties
4 ounces fresh mushrooms, chopped
3/4 cup finely chopped fresh spinach
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 pinch chili powder, or to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup egg whites
1/2 cup low-fat cream cheese
4 English muffins, split and toasted

Directions:
Spray a nonstick skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Cook patties until heated through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.
Spray skillet with more cooking spray. Saute mushrooms over medium heat until tender, about 5 minutes. Add spinach, garlic, Italian seasoning, chili powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper; stir until mixed.
Pour in egg whites and stir lightly until combined. Cook until starting to set, 2 to 3 minutes. Lift edges and let uncooked egg flow underneath. Repeat until completely set, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cut into 4 wedges.
Spread cream cheese over English muffin halves. Sandwich a sausage patty and wedge of egg between each English muffin.

Delicious veggie-filled breakfast sandwiches. I make large batches of these and keep them in the freezer. Take one out the night before and let defrost in fridge. In the morning, just nuke and you have a yummy hot breakfast.
