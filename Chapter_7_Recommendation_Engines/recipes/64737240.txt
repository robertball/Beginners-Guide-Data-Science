Bone side down, rub the mixture onto the flesh of the ribs.
Fold the zip lock back, you don't want to get any mixture in the lock, and add 1 rack to each bag
When the temp reaches 155 place the bags into the water and submerge. Open the seal of the bag and allow any air to escape, reseal.
Make sure that the bags are completely submerged.
Cover the pot with heavy foil so the steam does not escape.

Description: 
Wonderfully meaty back ribs are the perfect protein to cook in the Sous Vide. The end result are moist and extremely tender ribs that don't disintegrate when picked up.
