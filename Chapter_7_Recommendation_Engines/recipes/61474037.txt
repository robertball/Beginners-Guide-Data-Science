Ingredients:
8 baked potatoes, still hot
2 tablespoons butter
2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Rice potatoes.  Place in large bowl and make a well in the center.  Put butter in well and allow to melt.  When mashed potatoes have cooled, knead in enough of the flour to make a soft dough.
Divide dough into fist-sized portions. Cover portions when you are not working with them.  On a floured surface, roll each portion into a long rope.  Cut the ropes into one-inch pieces.  Roll each piece with a fork for a distinctive texture. Cook immediately.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until they float to the top.
