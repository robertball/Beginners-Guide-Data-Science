Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
20 button mushrooms, finely chopped
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
2 cups torn spinach leaves
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt, or to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste
1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 cup sour cream
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the mushrooms and onion; cook and stir until the mushrooms have softened and the onion is translucent, about 7 minutes. Stir in the spinach, parsley, garlic salt, and pepper. Continue cooking until the spinach has wilted, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1/2 cup of Cheddar cheese. Cool for 5 minutes. Stir in the sour cream, then spread mixture into an 8x8-inch baking dish. Sprinkle 1 cup of Cheddar cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Simple and yet very tasty. I wanted to make an appetizer out of ingredients I had on hand, thus this recipe was born. Serve with tortilla chips.
