Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 cup sour cream
1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, sour cream, onion soup mix, bread crumbs and pepper using your hands. Refrigerate while you heat up the grill so the flavors have a chance to blend.
Preheat a grill for medium heat. Form the ground beef into 8 balls, and flatten into patties.
Grill the patties for 6 to 8 minutes per side, or until well done.
