Ingredients:
3/4 cup chopped green onions
3/4 cup mayonnaise
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic, divided
1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
2/3 cup butter, melted
12 sheets phyllo dough (18 inches x 14 inches)
6 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the onions, mayonnaise, lemon juice, 2 garlic cloves and tarragon; set aside. in another small bowl, combine the butter and remaining garlic.
Place one sheet of phyllo dough on a work surface with a short edge facing you. Brush with 2 teaspoons butter mixture; brush to distribute evenly. Repeat with one more sheet of phyllo, brushing with another 2 teaspoons of butter mixture (Keep remaining phyllo dough covered with plastic wrap to avoid drying out).
Lightly sprinkle chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Center one chicken breast on the lower third of phyllo. Spread about 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise mixture over chicken breast. Fold bottom edge over chicken, then fold in sides. Roll up jelly-roll style; cover with plastic wrap and set aside. Make five more chicken packets.
Place packets in an ungreased 15-in.x 10-in.x 1-in. baking pan. Brush tops with remaining garlic butter; sprinkle with cheese. Bake uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F. Serve warm.
