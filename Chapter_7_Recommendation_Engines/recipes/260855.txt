Ingredients:
2 red potatoes, diced
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 yellow onion, diced
1/2 cup frozen corn
1 jalapeno pepper, chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 (6 inch) corn tortillas
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place potatoes in a bowl; drizzle 1 tablespoon oil on top, add garlic powder, and mix to coat. Lay out potatoes on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 30 minutes.
Heat the remaining oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add red bell pepper, onion, corn, jalapeno, salt, and black pepper; cook and stir until vegetables are slightly soft, about 10 minutes.
Heat a griddle over medium heat. Cook tortillas, flipping halfway, until evenly warmed, 2 to 3 minutes. Divide tortillas among serving plates; fill with the baked potatoes and sauteed corn mixture. Top tacos with green onions and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.

Description: 
Tacos were one of the first dishes for which I had to find a vegan alternative. Now, we make these potato tacos on a regular basis. Spice them up with some red pepper flakes or hot sauce. Add avocado if you want a flavor explosion.
