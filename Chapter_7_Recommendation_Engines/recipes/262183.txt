Ingredients:
2 (6 ounce) steaks
2 tablespoons peppercorns, ground
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons butter, divided
6 mushrooms, sliced, or more to taste
1 large clove garlic, minced
1 fluid ounce bourbon (such as Maker's MarkÂ®)
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Coat steaks with ground peppercorns, olive oil, and soy sauce. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Place 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet and allow it to melt completely and begin to foam. Cook steaks in the hot skillet until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Place mushrooms around steaks and stir to coat with pan drippings.
Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and cook until steaks are firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 6 to 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 135 degrees F (57 degrees C). Remove steaks from the skillet and allow to rest.
Return skillet to medium heat and add remaining 1 tablespoon butter and garlic. Cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Pour in bourbon carefully, away from any heat source, and cream. Allow to simmer until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Serve sauce over steaks.

Description: 
Peppered steaks seared in cast iron, with a quick, creamy pan mushroom sauce. Simple, elegant dinner for 2. This recipe works with most steaks, but I prefer a nice fillet or chuck eye. A small, thick cut of steak is best.
