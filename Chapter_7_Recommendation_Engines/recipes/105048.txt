Ingredients:
2 cups olive oil for frying
1 red onion, sliced and separated into rings
1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
2 cups plain dry bread crumbs
1 cup self-rising flour
6 (6 ounce) fillets halibut

Directions:
Heat 1/4 to 1/2 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. While that is warming, place the red onion onto a platter and sprinkle with balsamic vinegar.
Combine the bread crumbs and flour. Press fish into the mixture to coat on both sides. Fry in the hot oil until cooked through, about 5 minutes on each side.
Transfer to the dish of onions and allow to drain. Wait 5 minutes and then transfer to serving plates. Spoon some of the vinegar and onions over the top for show.

Description: 
This recipe is my husband's specialty, good for any fresh fish. I prefer halibut but whatever your pleasure. Goes great with homemade mashed potatoes.
