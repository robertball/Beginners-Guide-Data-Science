Ingredients:
2 Chicken Breasts
1 Carton Chicken Broth
2 cans Mixed Veggies
1 can Cream of Chicken Soup
3 cups Water
1 can whole kernel corn
1 pkg Frozen egg noodles
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon cajun seasoning
1 teaspoon black pepper
1-2 teaspoons of salt
1/2 teaspoon onion powder

Directions:
Cut up chicken breasts (or other cut of chicken) into small bite size pieces.  In a large pan, bring chicken to boil in water until chicken is slightly cooked.
Add chicken broth, frozen noodles and salt to boiling chicken and water.  I listed 1 carton of broth but sometimes I add more depending on how much broth I want in my soup.  Boil for aproximately 15 minutes.
Add remaining seasonings, cream of chicken soup, and drained veggies.  Cook for an additional 5 minutes.
The seasonings can be adjusted to taste.
