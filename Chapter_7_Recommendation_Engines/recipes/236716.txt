Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, diced
3 leeks (white part only), chopped
2 pounds yellow potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes
1/4 pound processed cheese food (such as Velveeta Â®), cut into cubes
1 cup dry potato flakes
kosher salt to taste
1 pinch ground white pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; saute onion and leeks until softened, 5 to 10 minutes.
Place potatoes into a large pot with enough water to cover by about 1 inch; add onion and leeks. Bring water to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove pot from heat and mash potato mixture in the water, leaving some potatoes in chunks.
Stir cheese food into potato mixture until smooth; add potato flakes. Stir mixture until soup reaches desired consistency; season with salt and white pepper.
