Ingredients:
1 pound pork sausage, or more to taste
1 small onion, diced (optional)
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (32 fluid ounce) container beef broth
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 (9 ounce) package cheese tortellini, or to taste

Directions:
Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium-high heat until cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove sausage from skillet, draining grease. Cut sausage into thin rounds.
Cook and stir onion and garlic in the same skillet until browned, 5 to 10 minutes.
Combine sausage, onion mixture, beef broth, diced tomatoes, black pepper, Italian seasoning, and salt in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover pot, and simmer until soup flavors blend, about 1 hour.
Bring soup to a boil, add tortellini, and cook until tortellini are cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.
