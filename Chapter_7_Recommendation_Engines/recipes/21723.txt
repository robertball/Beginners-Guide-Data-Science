Ingredients:
2 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup grape juice
1 cup crisp rice cereal
2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
In a small bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the cereal to the cheese then add the juice to the mixture until it holds together.  Stir in milk until the cereal is pasty but not lumpy.

Description: 
For the little ones that are either teething or don't have enough teeth this cereal is nice and mushy but sticks to a spoon very well.  It's easy to eat and tasty. If my toddler is any judge, it's scrumptious, too! You may substitute cranberry juice for the grape juice if you wish.
