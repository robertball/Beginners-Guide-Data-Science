1 (300 mL) can sweetened condensed milk
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 1/4 cups whipped topping, thawed, divided
8 Oreo cookies, finely chopped (or Oreo crumbs)
1 tablespoon butter, melted

Directions:
Line an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan with aluminum foil, extending a couple of inches of foil over the edge of the pan on all sides.
Mash 2 cups of the strawberries in a large bowl.Stir in sweetened condensed milk and lemon juice. Stir 1 cup of whipped topping into the strawberry mixture.
Pour strawberry mixture into the foil-lined loaf pan.
Combine the chopped Oreos and the melted butter. Top the strawberry mixture with the Oreo/butter mixture and press into the strawberry mixture gently.
Freeze the strawberry-cookie loaf for at least 6 hours or until firm.
Remove strawberry-cookie loaf from the freezer and invert loaf pan onto a chilled platter. Peel the foil off of the loaf.
Frost the loaf with the remaining 1 1/4 cups of whipped topping, covering all sides and top of the loaf. Just before serving, top the loaf with the remaining 2 cups of sliced strawberries and slice to serve.
Store leftovers (if you have any!) covered in the freezer.
