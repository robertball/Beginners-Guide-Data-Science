Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 onions, chopped
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 pounds lean ground turkey
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1/2 cup water
2 (4 ounce) cans diced green chiles
2 (15 ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained
2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro
salt and pepper to taste
sour cream
tortilla chips

Directions:
Heat oil in a large soup kettle over medium-high heat. Cook onions in oil until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic powder, cumin, and oregano; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add turkey; cook until it loses its raw color.
Pour in broth and chiles; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 10 minutes.
In a small bowl, mash the drained contents of one can of beans. Stir all beans and cilantro into soup; simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve topped with crushed tortilla chips and sour cream.
