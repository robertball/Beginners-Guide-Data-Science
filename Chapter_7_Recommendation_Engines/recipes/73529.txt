Ingredients:
4 1/2 pounds country-style pork ribs
2 (14.5 ounce) cans Hunt's® Diced Tomatoes with Sweet Onions
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup Hunt's® Ketchup
1/2 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons paprika
1 tablespoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Place ribs in a 13-inch x 9-inch baking dish. Bake, uncovered for 1 1/2 hours.
Combine remaining ingredients except rice in a medium saucepan to make BBQ sauce. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 15 minutes. Set aside; keep warm.
Drain juice from the meat pan. Pour about 2 cups of sauce over the ribs. Cover pan loosely with foil; continue baking for 30 to 45 minutes or until ribs are tender. Cook rice; keep warm.
