Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1 1/2 cups peanuts
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 drops red food coloring

Directions:
Grease a cookie sheet or other flat surface.
In a 2 quart glass measuring cup combine water, sugar and corn syrup.  Microwave on high until boiling.  Stir in peanuts.
Microwave on medium to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.
Stir in butter, vanilla and food coloring.  Beat until creamy and cool.  Drop by teaspoonfuls onto prepared pan.
