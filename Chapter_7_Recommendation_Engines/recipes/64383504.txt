Ingredients:
2 tubes Pillsbury Grands! biscuits
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 stick unsalted butter, melted
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup pizza sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
Cut each of the 16 biscuits into quarters, making 64 pieces.
Pour olive oil into the bottom of the pan.
Combine the butter, Parmesan, garlic, seasoning, garlic powder, and salt in a medium bowl.
Dip each piece of dough into the butter mixture and place in the pan. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until golden brown.
Remove the bread from the oven and let cool in pan for 15 minutes. Turn it out of the pan onto plate. Stuff a small dish or piece of aluminum foil into the bottom of the hole. Fill with pizza sauce.
Pull pieces of garlic bread from the bowl and dip away.
