Ingredients:
8 egg whites
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups sugar
3 cups sliced fresh strawberries
1 1/2 cups whipped cream

Directions:
Place egg whites in a large mixing bowl and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Beat egg whites, vinegar, vanilla and salt on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar, about 2 tablespoons at a time, on high until stiff glossy peaks form and sugar is dissolved.
Spread into a greased 10-in. springform pan. Bake at 300 degrees F for 65-70 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to a wire rack to cool (meringue will fall). Serve with strawberries and whipped cream.  Store leftovers in the refrigerator.
