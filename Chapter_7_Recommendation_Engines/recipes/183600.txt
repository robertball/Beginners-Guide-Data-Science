Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds skirt steak
1 1/2 cups Newman's Own Herb & Roasted Garlic Marinade
2 heads romaine lettuce, chopped
1/2 seedless English cucumber, grated for dressing
1/2 seedless English cucumber, quartered, then chopped for salad
1/2 cup chopped roasted red bell peppers
1/2 cup halved Kalamata olives
1/2 red onion, thinly sliced into rings
2 tomatoes, seeded and diced
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1 1/2 cups plain non-fat yogurt
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon paprika
2 tablespoons Newman's Own Lighten Up Light Lime Vinaigrette
2 Pita breads or pockets, quartered

Directions:
Marinate steak with marinade for 30 minutes or longer.
Cucumber Lime Tzatziki dressing: In a bowl, whisk together yogurt, garlic, paprika, lime vinaigrette and grated cucumber. Cover and chill.
Heat indoor grill pan or outdoor grill over high heat. Remove steak from marinade and discard marinade. Grill steak on one side until golden brown about 3 to 4 minutes. Turn steak over and cook to medium-rare, about 3 to 4 minutes more. Let rest 5 minutes then slice thinly against the grain.
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Place pitas on a baking sheet and spray with cooking spray. Bake in oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
In a large salad bowl toss lettuce, chopped cucumber, red peppers, olives, onion, tomatoes and feta. Divide salad evenly among plates, top with steak and pitas. Drizzle with dressing. Enjoy!
