Ingredients:
1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes
1/2 cup butter
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 T garlic powder (optional)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil on medium high heat, then reduce heat to medium low.
Peel potatoes, cut in quarters to speed cook time.
Add potatoes to boiling water, cook until tender but still firm.
Drain and return to stove over low heat to dry for 1 to 2 minutes.
Mix remaining ingredients and set aside.
Use a potato masher to mash until smooth, or a potato ricer for BEST, FLUFFIEST results.
Begin folding in remaining ingredients a small amount at a time. The amount needed can vary due to dryness of potatoes, and you may not need all of the liquid.
Serve and be complimented!
