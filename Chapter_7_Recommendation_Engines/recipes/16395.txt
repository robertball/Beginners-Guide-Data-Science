Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds pork tenderloin
1/8 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1 lemon, juiced
salt and pepper to taste
1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed

Directions:
In a medium nonporous bowl, combine the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and lemon juice and mix well. Place the pork in the bowl, turning to coat well on all sides. Cover and refrigerate for at least two hours, allowing the pork to marinate.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place tenderloin in a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes, or until internal pork temperature reaches 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
Remove pork from oven. Drain the liquid from the baking dish and  reserve for later as a gravy, if desired. Roll out the two puff pastry sheets and wrap each piece of tenderloin in the dough, sealing the edges to completely enclose the meat. Return this to the baking dish.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown.
