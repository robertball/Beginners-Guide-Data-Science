Ingredients:
For the Sponge:
150g/6oz S.R Flour
150g/6oz Sugar
150g/6oz Margarine (always use margarine, butter is too heavy)
½ Teaspoon of Vanilla essence
3 eggs
Jam to sandwich the cake
For the Butter Cream:
100g/4oz Powdered Sugar
50g/2oz Butter
½ Teaspoon Vanilla Essence
All measurements are in English measurements, so you will need kitchen scale's.

Directions:
Light the oven Gas 3, 170C, 350F.  Place the shelf in the center of the oven.  Line 2, 7” sandwich tins with wax paper.
Sieve the flour into a bowl and add the sugar, margarine, Vanilla and eggs and beat well with a wooden spoon or mixer, until the mixture is light coloured and fluffy.
Divide between the tins and smooth the top, Bake for 30-40 Minutes or until golden brown.  Turn onto a wire tray to cool.
To make the cream, Sieve the sugar into a bowl, add the butter and vanilla essence and beat well.
To sandwich the cakes together add a layer of Jam to the top of one of the sponges, followed by a layer of cream on top of the jam, finish by placing the last of the sponges on top.  Dust with a layer of powered sugar if required.
Tip
Eggs can vary a lot in size, for perfect results weigh the 3 eggs.  This will more than likely weigh over or under 150g/6oz.  For example, if the eggs weigh 175g you would use 175g each of the flour, sugar and margarine.

This recipe, is the traditional recipe for Victoria sponge, that I was taught back at High school in England.
