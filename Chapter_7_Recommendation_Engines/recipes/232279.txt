Ingredients:
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 1/2 tablespoons water
6 cups chicken broth
2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce (such as SrirachaÂ®), or more to taste
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 (16 ounce) package thick rice noodles
1 cup sliced zucchini
1 cup sliced red bell pepper
2 cooked chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
1/4 cup crushed peanuts (optional)
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Stir cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until smooth. Pour chicken broth into a large pot and stir cornstarch mixture, soy sauce, fish sauce, rice vinegar, chile-garlic sauce, vegetable oil, ginger, garlic, and coriander into broth. Cover and bring to a boil.
Place rice noodles in the boiling sauce, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until noodles are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir zucchini, red bell pepper, and chicken into sauce. Bring back to a boil, cover, and simmer until vegetables are just become tender, about 5 more minutes.
Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes to thicken. Serve garnished with crushed peanuts and cilantro.
