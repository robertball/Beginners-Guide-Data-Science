Ingredients:
2 cups 100% apple juice
1/2 cup water
3 tbs pumpkin pie mix/puree (unsweetened!)
1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
1 tsp brown sugar
1 tsp sugar
1 tbs honey (can leave it out)

Directions:
Mix the ingredients together and chill for 20 minutes  (you don't have to wait, but it tastes better).
Before serving, stir the juice well, as the pumpkin will settle to the bottom.
Fill crystal goblets with ice cubes and pour the juice over the ice.

Served in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry! Fast and easy, great for Harry Potter parties, or any feasts, holidays :)
Tastes exactly like the bottled ones they sell in Universal Studios, in Orlando, FL.
