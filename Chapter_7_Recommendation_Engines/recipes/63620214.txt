Tips:
•You can omit the nuts.
•If you want to make the cookies right away just omit the freezing.
•Switch the white chocolate chips for any other you have on hand.
•You can also make regular size cookies. Just don’t cut each slice into 4. You should get approximately 48 cookies. They will take 10-12 minutes to bake.
