Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 cups yellow corn meal
1/2 cup sugar (or to taste, but too much sugar will make the dough balls difficult to form)
1/4 cup finely minced onions (optional)
1/8 tsp baking soda
3/4 cup boiling water
1/2 cup vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Heat oil in skillet over high heat.
Mix meal, sugar, and baking soda in a mixing bowl.
Slowly add water a little at a time and mix until all dough is slightly moistened and dough balls can be rolled and formed by hand. (You will NOT use all the water, so do not make it too runny.  It should feel almost dry yet sticky.)
Separate into 8-10 balls and flatten into small circles (using about 1/4 cup of mixture for each ball) and fry until golden brown on each side.
Serve with butter and honey or molasses.
