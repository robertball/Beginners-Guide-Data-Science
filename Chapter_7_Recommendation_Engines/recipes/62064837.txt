Ingredients:
3/4 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips, melted
1/2 c. butter
2 c. brown sugar
3 eggs
1 1/2 tsp. vanilla
2 c. flour
2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
1 c. buttermilk
1 c. boiling water
1 3/4 c. chocolate chips
2 oz. cream cheese
1 tsp. vanilla
1/2 c. buttermilk
4 c. powdered sugar
1/4 c. milk
2 1/2 c. heavy cream
3 tsp. sugar
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour 2 round 8 or 9" cake pans.  Beat together butter, sugar, and eggs.  Add melted chips and vanilla.  Separately, combine dry ingredients and add to the chocolate mixture alternately with the buttermilk.  Stir in boiling water, batter will be thin. Pour into cake pans and bake for 30 to 35 minutes.  Meanwhile, for the frosting melt 1 3/4 c. chocolate chips with cream cheese and 1/2 c. buttermilk.  Beat in 1 tsp. vanilla.  Alternately whip in 4 c. powdered sugar and 1/4 c. milk.  Let set to thicken.  After cakes have cooled, spread half of the frosting on the first layer.  Top with remaining cake and spread the rest of the frosting on top.  Whip the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla until stiff and pipe around the edges of the cake, on the top and on the bottom.
