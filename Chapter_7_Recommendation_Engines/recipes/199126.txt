Description: 
I came up with this recipe when I found myself with a plethora of frozen peas. A friend of mine was leaving the country for 6 weeks and I ended up with 5 bags of frozen peas from her freezer. This is a heavier, sweeter twist to traditional basil pesto. Goes well with pasta or spread over bread and covered with cheese...yum! Add more lemon juice, basil, or garlic to taste.
