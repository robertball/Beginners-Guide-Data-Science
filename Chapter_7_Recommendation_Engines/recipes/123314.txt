STREUSEL:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon cold butter

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, beat egg; add milk and oil. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill eight greased or paper-lined muffin cups half full. Spoon 1 teaspoon marmalade over each. Top with remaining batter. For streusel, combine flour, brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Cut in butter until crumbly; sprinkle over batter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until muffins test done.
