Ingredients:
5 large potatoes, peeled and chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup white wine vinegar
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and chop.
In a large bowl, mix together the garlic, olive oil, vinegar and parsley. Add potatoes and toss to evenly coat.
Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Description: 
My Nonnie used to make this potato salad for me whenever I was home for the holidays. It's a great alternative to mayo-based potato salads.  Red wine vinegar works well, too.
