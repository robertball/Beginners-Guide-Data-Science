Mini Quiche Lorraine Recipe

Ingredients:
24 frozen 3" tart shells, thawed
4 eggs
1-1/4 cups milk
1 tsp dijon mustard (or other smooth savory mustard)
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
FILLING:
6 - 8 slices of bacon, cooked and crumbled
2 green onions, diced
1 cup shredded cheese (any variety will work)

Directions:
TART SHELLS: you can use the shells without pre-baking them but the bottoms may turn out soggy. I prefere to blind bake my shells (bake with pie weights/beans) so that they are 75% baked and then finish them off on the 2nd baking.
FILLING: place a small amount of crumbled bacon, cheese, and green onion in each tart shell.  place cheese on the bottom to act as a barrier between the filling and the crust - this will help reduce soggyness as well.
EGG: whisk together the eggs, milk, mustard, salt & pepper. osing a small ladel (or measuring cup) pour egg mixture over filling.  Be careful not to overfill the shells (will stick to tin cups) - stop at base of rim.  if desired, top with a small amount of shredded cheese.
BAKE at 375F for 25 - 30 minutes or until shells are brown and egg is set in the middle.
