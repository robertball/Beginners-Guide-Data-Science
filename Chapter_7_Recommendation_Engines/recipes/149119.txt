Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
1 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp
1 tablespoon liquid shrimp and crab boil seasoning
1/2 cup butter
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/3 cup diced red onion
1/3 cup diced sweet red bell pepper
1/2 cup canned whole kernel corn, drained
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon canned chipotle chile peppers in adobo sauce, finely chopped
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 cup half-and-half

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
Place shrimp and crab boil into a large saucepan. Fill with water to 1 inch above the shrimp, and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 3 minutes until shrimp turn pink, then drain.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in garlic, and red onion, cook until the onion softens and turns translucent, about 4 minutes. Stir in bell pepper, corn, lime juice, cilantro, oregano, chipotle pepper, and salt. Stir in the half-and-half, and bring to a simmer. Once the mixture is simmering, stir in shrimp, and toss with the drained pasta.

Description: 
After throwing some ingredients together for tapas, the flavor was so fresh and light my family asked for more. By warming it through with a few more ingredients I turned it into a family meal with pasta instead of just a snack.
