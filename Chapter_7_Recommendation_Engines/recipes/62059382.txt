Ingredients:
4 large ears corn on the cob
2 quarts water
large pot

Directions:
Put water in pot to boil over high heat.
While water is coming to a boil,remove the husks and strings. Remove the   stems. You can usually just break them off.
Cut ears in half. Rinse under cold water.
Place ears in boiling water. Turn off the heat. Let ears sit in hot water
for six minutes. Drain. Season with butter if desired. These are so fresh
and crisp that butter isn't even needed.
Enjoy!

Description: 
This very easy recipe will give you some of the finest corn on the cob you've ever had. FYI: To pick the very best cobs, just look at the ends. If the strings are still moist and not all brown, you're in business.
