Ingredients:
2 cups cubed butternut squash (about half a squash)
1 large eggplant, stem removed, peeled, and cubed
1/2 head of cabbage, cored and cut in chunks
1 zucchini, sliced into 1/4-inch coins
1 large onion, chopped
1 cup chopped carrots
One 15-oz. can pure pumpkin
One 6-oz. can tomato paste
1 1/2 tbsp. brown sugar (not packed)
1 tsp. chopped garlic
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp. salt, or more to taste
1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper, or more to taste
1/4 tsp. ground ginger, or more to taste
1/4 tsp. ground cumin, or more to taste
1/4 tsp. chili powder, or more to taste

Directions:
Place all cut veggies in an extra-large bowl and set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine all other ingredients and thoroughly mix. Spoon this mixture over the veggies and stir to coat.
Transfer mixture to a crock pot with a capacity of four quarts or more. If needed, pack it in tightly. (It will cook down.)
Cover and cook on high for 3 - 4 hours or on low for 7 - 8 hours, until veggies are very tender.
Stir well and serve!
