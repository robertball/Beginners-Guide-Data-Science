Ingredients:
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
6 tablespoons olive oil
2 (4 inch) pita bread rounds
2 cups torn fresh spinach
1/4 cup halved grape tomatoes
3 tablespoons chopped pimento-stuffed green olives
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix lemon juice, garlic powder, oregano, and basil in a bowl; whisk oil into lemon juice mixture until dressing is well blended. Brush about 1 tablespoon dressing over pita breads and arrange on baking sheet; reserve remaining dressing.
Combine spinach, tomatoes, and olives in a large bowl. Pour remaining dressing over vegetables and toss to coat. Divide spinach mixture evenly over each pita; sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and feta cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and pitas are lightly toasted, about 8 minutes.
