Ingredients:
2 cups basmati rice
4 cups water
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1  red onion, cut into 1/2-inch slices
3 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 2-inch strips
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
6 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups cremini mushrooms, cut in half
12  fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
2 small red bell peppers, cut into 1/2-inch strips
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1  egg
2 cups fresh basil leaves
1 cup fresh cilantro leaves, chopped
2 tablespoons sesame seeds, for garnish
tamari soy sauce to taste

Directions:
Bring the rice and water to a boil together in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 35 to 40 minutes.
When the rice is nearly done cooking, heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Cook the onion in the hot oil until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chicken, garlic, and ginger to the skillet and continue cooking and stirring until the chicken is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Fold the mushrooms, asparagus, bell peppers, and fish sauce into the chicken mixture; continue cooking just until hot, about 5 minutes. Crack the egg, and scramble it into the mixture. Add the basil leaves to the mixture; cook until the leaves wilt slightly, about 30 seconds. Remove pan from heat immediately. Serve over the basmati rice; garnish with the cilantro and sesame seeds and a drizzle of the tamari soy sauce.

Description: 
Simple and delicious, this Asian-style chicken recipe is one I've refined over years. I used to spice it up as I love hot food, but this recipe just works better when you let the fresh flavors speak for themselves. You can also leave out the chicken and just make it with two eggs if you want a vegetarian option.
