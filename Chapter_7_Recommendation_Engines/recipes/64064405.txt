Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup plus 1/4 cup sugar, divided
3 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1/2 cup cold butter
1 cup milk
5 medium tart apples, peeled and chopped
1-1/2 cups orange juice
1/2 cup honey
2 Tbl butter, melted
1 tsp ground cinnamon
Topping
1-1/3 cups sour cream
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the flour, 2/3 cup sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in milk just until moistened. Spread into the bottom of a greased 4- or 5-qt. slow cooker; sprinkle apples over batter.
In a small bowl, combine the orange juice, honey, melted butter, cinnamon and remaining sugar; pour over apples. Cover and cook on high for 2-3 hours or until apples are tender.
Topping: In a small bowl, combine sour cream and confectioners' sugar. Serve with warm pudding cake.

Description: 
A comforting dessert like this is a superb treat on a chilly night. Since the pudding is made in a slow cooker, it does not require any attention from you, so it's great when entertaining. It separates into three layers—apples, cake and sauce; and I like to serve it in a bowl.—
