Ingredients:
1 devil's food cake mix
Eggs, water and oil as directed on cake mix box
3 boxes of white chocolate instant pudding-4 serving size.  (I used sugar-free)
5 cups low-fat or skim milk
1 (8 oz.) container Cool Whip topping
1 1/2 packages toffee bits OR
chocolate chips OR your choice of embellishments

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 &#0176;.  Grease 2 (8") square cake pans or one 9 x 13 pan.
Prepare and bake cake according to package directions.
Allow to cool and remove to cutting board.  Cut layer cakes into 42 squares, or the 9 x 13 into about 84 squares.
Mix together 2 packages of pudding and 4 cups of the cold milk. Let sit for 5-10 minutes until set.
In a large, clear bowl, begin layering the cake, pudding, and toffee bits starting and ending with cake and using 1 bag of toffee bits.  (I had three layers of cake, but it will vary depending on the size and depth of your bowl.) Mix together the third box of pudding with 1 cup of cold milk.  Fold in the Cool Whip.  Spread over the top layer of cake.  Cover and chill for 2 hours or longer.
When ready to serve, top with 1/2 bag toffee chips.
