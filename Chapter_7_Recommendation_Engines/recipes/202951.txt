Ingredients:
1 pound ground chicken
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 egg
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
3 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano
salt and pepper to taste
2 ounces crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Mix the chicken, bread crumbs, egg, lemon juice, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; form the mixture into 5 patties. Divide the feta cheese between the 5 patties; place a portion of the feta cheese atop each patty and fold the chicken mixture around the cheese so that the cheese is in the center.
Cook on the preheated grill until no longer pink on the inside and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
