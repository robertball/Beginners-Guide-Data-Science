Ingredients:
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup butter
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/4 cup peanut butter

Directions:
Coat a small cup muffin tin with cooking spray.   In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate with butter and oil, stirring often, until melted, 1 to 2 minutes.  Pour about a tablespoon of the chocolate mixture into each muffin cup.
Melt peanut butter in microwave, 30 to 40 seconds.  Spoon about 1 teaspoon of melted peanut butter over chocolate in each muffin cup.  Top with another tablespoon of chocolate.
Chill in refrigerator 30 minutes, until set.
