Directions:
In a cocktail shaker, muddle raspberries and thyme. Add gin, egg white, simple syrup, and lemon juice. Shake until mixture no longer sounds sloshy and you feel a lot of pressure.

Description: 
The egg white foam on top of this pretty drink begins to break down after about 10 minutes, so be sure to take a photo of your Clover Club and drink it up before that happens.
