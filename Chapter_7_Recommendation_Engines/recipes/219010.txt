Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup white sugar
1 cup honey
4 eggs
1 cup cold brewed coffee
1 apple - peeled, cored and shredded (optional)
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/4 cup butter
2/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup orange juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon until thoroughly mixed together. In a separate large bowl, stir together the vegetable oil, 1 cup of sugar, and honey, and beat the eggs in one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the flour mixture, alternating with the coffee in several additions. Mix in the shredded apple, if desired.
Transfer the batter into the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle the walnuts over the top of the cake. Bake in the preheated oven until the cake springs back when lightly touched with a finger, about 1 hour. Allow the cake to cool until warm, about 15 minutes.
In a small saucepan, melt the butter, and whisk in 2/3 cup of sugar and the orange juice until the sugar has dissolved. Bring the mixture to a boil, and remove from heat, whisking constantly. Pour the glaze over the warm cake.
