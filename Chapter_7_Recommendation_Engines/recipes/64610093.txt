Gluten Free Pancakes Recipe

Ingredients:
1/4 cup brown rice flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon spice (I suggest cinnamon, allspice, ginger, or the like)
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
3 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons liquid egg substitute

Directions:
Combine flour, baking powder, and spices in a bowl and whisk to mix well.
Add water and eggs and whisk until batter comes together. It should be relatively thick. If it seems too thick, add more water one tablespoon at a time until it reaches a thick, but pourable consistency.
Spray a non-stick skillet and heat over medium-low to medium heat until warm.
Pour batter into the pan and spread out with a spatula to create a thin cake. Cook for 2 minutes or until the top bubbles and the bottom is golden brown.
Flip and cook on the other side for 2-3 more minutes. Serve warm. These can be topped with nut butter for a boost in protein and deliciousness.
