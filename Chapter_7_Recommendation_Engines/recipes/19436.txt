Ingredients:
1 1/8 cups chocolate wafer cookies, crushed
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
6 tablespoons coffee-flavored liqueur
1 teaspoon instant espresso coffee powder
3 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 pint vanilla ice cream, softened
2 tablespoons coffee-flavored liqueur
1 pint chocolate ice cream, softened
2 tablespoons coffee-flavored liqueur
3/4 cup whipped cream, beaten stiff

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the cookie crumbs and melted butter. Press mixture evenly onto bottom and sides of a 9 inch pie pan. Bake crust in oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely.
In a small saucepan, heat 6 tablespoons of liqueur and espresso powder over low heat. Heat until warm and powder is dissolved. Stir in chocolate and 1 tablespoon of butter until mixture is melted and smooth. Allow to cool completely.
Place vanilla ice cream into mixing bowl with 2 tablespoons of coffee liqueur. Using an electric mixer, blend together on low speed. Spread over bottom of cooled crust and freeze until firm. Then spread cooled chocolate mixture over frozen ice cream. Freeze pie until firm.
Blend together chocolate ice cream and 2 tablespoons liqueur.  Spread chocolate ice cream mixture over frozen chocolate sauce in pie. Freeze until firm. Serve pie with a decorative piped border of whipped cream around the inside edge of the pie.

This recipe combines the flavors of coffee and chocolate into an ice cream pie. For something different, try using coffee or chocolate chip ice cream in place of vanilla.
