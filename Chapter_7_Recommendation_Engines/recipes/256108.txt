Ingredients:
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 1/2 pounds trimmed leeks, cleaned and thinly cut
2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
1 1/4 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, cut into eighths
3 cups chicken or vegetable broth, or more as needed to adjust thickness
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup creme fraiche
1 pinch cayenne pepper
Chopped fresh chives for garnish

Directions:
Melt butter in soup pot over medium-high heat. Add leeks and salt; cook until leeks begin to wilt. Reduce heat to medium or medium-low and cook until soft and almost pastelike, 30 to 40 minutes.
Place potatoes in the pot; add chicken broth. Adjust heat so mixture simmers slowly. Cook until potatoes are soft, about 30 minutes. Puree mixture with an immersion blender or in batches in a blender. Whisk in heavy cream and creme fraiche. Heat over medium heat. Add more salt, if needed, and cayenne pepper. Do not boil.
Serve with a drizzle of creme fraiche and a sprinkle of chopped chives.

Description: 
There is nothing better on a chilly, damp day than a steaming bowl of potato leek soup; and conversely, few things are as delicious and refreshing on a hot, sweaty day than a bowl of ice cold vichyssoise.
