Ingredients:
parchment paper
cooking spray
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup palm sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup coconut oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons palm sugar
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and prepare with cooking spray.
Sift whole wheat flour, baking soda, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, cream of tartar, and sea salt together into a bowl.
Blend 1 cup palm sugar, eggs, coconut oil, and vanilla extract together in a food processor until smooth; add flour mixture and blend until the mixture forms a dough. Divide the dough into 24 portions and roll into balls.
Mix 2 tablespoons palm sugar and 1 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon together in a shallow bowl. Roll dough balls in the sugar-cinnamon mixture, arrange onto the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart, and flatten slightly.
Bake in preheated oven until browning along the edges, 8 to 10 minutes.
