Ingredients:
3/4 cup arrowroot starch
2/3 cup white rice flour
2/3 cup brown rice flour
1 tablespoon white sugar (optional)
14 tablespoons cold butter, cut into chunks
2 large cold eggs
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 tablespoon cold water, or more as needed (optional)

Directions:
Combine arrowroot starch, white rice flour, brown rice flour, and sugar in a food processor; pulse until blended. Add butter to flour mixture and pulse until mixture is the consistency of oatmeal.
Transfer flour-butter mixture to a bowl; add eggs and vinegar. Knead mixture just until blended. Mix water, 1 tablespoon at a time, into dough (if dough is too dry) until dough holds together. Split dough into 2 balls, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
Spread a piece of plastic wrap on a work surface and sprinkle with arrowroot starch. Place 1 dough ball on the plastic wrap and flatten using your hands. Dust rolling pin with arrowroot starch and roll over dough until even thickness and about 9 inches in diameter. Repeat with remaining dough.

Description: 
I have tried a lot of recipes trying to find one that compared with the traditional wheat crust that I have been missing.  After throwing away many batches, I finally came up with this one and my family loves it. They said they couldn't tell the difference (I am not sure I believe that) but it sure did satisfy my cravings. 
Hope you like it too.
