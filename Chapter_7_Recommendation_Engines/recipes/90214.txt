Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup yellow cornmeal
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 tablespoons dried thyme
1 1/2 tablespoons crushed fennel seed
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 pinch salt
1/4 cup white sugar
1 cup soy milk
1 egg
1 egg yolk
1/2 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin, or line with muffin papers.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, thyme, fennel seeds, salt, pepper, and sugar. Make a well in the center, and pour in the soy milk, egg, egg yolk, and oil. Stir just until blended. Spoon into the prepared muffin tin, filling cups about 3/4 full.
Bake for 18 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the tops of the muffins spring back when lightly pressed. Cool in the pan for at least 5 minutes before removing from cups.
