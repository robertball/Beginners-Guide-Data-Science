Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds butternut squash, halved and seeded
1 acorn squash, halved and seeded
1/2 small spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
3 tablespoons butter
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon curry powder
2 tart green apples - peeled, cored and chopped
2/3 cup sherry
5 cups vegetable broth
salt and pepper to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place the squash, cut side down, on baking sheets and roast for 45 minutes, or until flesh is soft.  Scoop out the flesh into a large bowl.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.  Saute the onion, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes or until tender.  Stir in the garlic, ginger and curry powder and cook 1 minute.  Add the apples and sherry and simmer for 10 minutes, or until apples soften.
Puree batches of the squash flesh and broth in a food processor or blender.  Transfer the squash puree to a large saucepan.  Puree the apple/sherry mixture and stir into pureed squash.
Heat over medium heat and season with salt, pepper and cayenne, to taste.
