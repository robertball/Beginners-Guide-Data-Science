Ingredients:
1 lb bacon

Directions:
Line a jelly-roll pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper to make cleanup easier.
Set a wire rack on the pans so the bacon doesn't sit in fat.
Place bacon slices in a single layer on the rack, and bake at 400ยบ for about 20 minutes, until crispy.  Note:  baking bacon at lower temps will result in bacon that is not crispy.
Turn off the oven.
Remove cooked bacon from oven and using thongs place hot bacon on paper towel to drain.
After bacon has cooled, chop it in a food processor using chop or pulse button.
Lay chopped bacon on a paper towel lined baking sheet and place in warm oven (be sure oven is "off" but still warm for 30 minutes.  This will help to drain more grease from the chopped bacon.
Store bacon bits in a paper towel lined zip top bag in the refridgerator.
