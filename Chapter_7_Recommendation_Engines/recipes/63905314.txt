Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups of water
1 cup rice of choice
2 tbsp of low sodium or regular soy sauce
3 tbsp of butter or oil
2 eggs
1 cup of chopped carrots
1 cup of sliced mushrooms in water
1/2 small white onion
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring water to a boil and mix in soy sauce.
Add rice and stir until the water returns to a rapid boil.
Cover and reduce heat to very low.
Let cook covered for 40 to 45 minutes, depending on your mix of rice, or until you can fluff it with a fork.
Remove from heat and mix in 1 tbsb butter or oil immediately to prevent it from sticking to the pan. This reduced the amount used when frying later on.
When pan is cooled enough, transfer the rice to the fridge (in the pan or in a seperate container) to cool completely, at least one hour.
Remove the rice from the fridge.
Chop the vegetables in shapes of your own liking, then set aside.
Beat the eggs in a bowl.
Heat a tbsp of butter/oil in pan or skillet over high heat.
Add eggs, then vegetables, and allow them to become soft.
Then add the rest of the butter/oil and the cooled rice. Stir until the rice is heated throughout.
Mix well and enjoy immediately.
