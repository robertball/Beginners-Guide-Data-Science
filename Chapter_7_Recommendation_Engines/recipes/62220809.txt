Ingredients:
1 1/4 c. pecan halves
1 c. butter, softened
2/3 c. sugar
2 eggs
1 t. vanilla
2 c. flour
1 t. baking powder
1 t. cinnamon
1/4 t. salt
1 t. lemon zest
Powdered sugar for dusting
1 c. seedless raspberry jam

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Place nuts in food processor and process until medium fine in texture.
Line baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside until ready to use.
Beat butter and sugar together with an electric mixer until light and creamy in texture.
Add eggs and beat until smooth.
Add in vanilla and beat until combined.
In a separate bowl, combine flour, nuts, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and lemon zest.
Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat to combine.
Place in freezer until firm, approximately 30-40 minutes.
Dust a clean surface with flour, and roll out the dough to approximately 1/8 in thickness.
Using a linzer cutter without an insert, cut out cookies (atleast 36) and transfer to the cookie sheets - these will be the bottom pieces.
Next cut out 36 more with an insert shape in cookie cutters - these will be the top pieces to the cookies.
Bake all cookies for about 8 minutes until golden brown.  Transfer to a wire rack to completely cool.
Sift powdered sugar over top pieces of the cookies.
Spread about 1 t. jam on each of the bottom halves and place top half on jam covered bottom half.
Cookies can be stored carefully in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
