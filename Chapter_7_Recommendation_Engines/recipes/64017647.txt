Ingredients:
Loaf
1 lb Hamburger or Ground Turkey
1 lb sausage (I use Jimmy Deans in the tube)
2 eggs
2 - 8 oz V8 juice
1 1/2 cups bread crumbs (I use Progresso's Italian Crumbs)
2 pkgs Lipton Onion Soup mix (dry)
Sauce
1/2 cup Brown Sugar
1 cup ketchup
2 teaspoons Dry Mustard
1/8 teaspoon Nutmeg

Directions:
Mix all these ingredients together with your hands and place in two loaf pans. There is no need to grease your pans, as you have plenty of fat in your meats.
Mix the sauce together In a separate bowl. Pour over the top of your uncooked meatloaf mix.
Bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees.
