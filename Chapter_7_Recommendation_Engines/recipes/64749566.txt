Ingredients:
12 ounces fresh rhubarb, cut into one-half inch pieces
1/2 cup granulated white sugar

Directions:
Put the rhubarb pieces to a medium pot, sprinkle with the sugar. Stir well insuring the rhubarb is completely covered with the sugar. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes stirring once. This will allow the natural juices to release.
Bring to a boil stirring often. Turn down the heat and simmer until soft, about 10 minutes. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
