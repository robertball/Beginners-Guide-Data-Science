Ingredients:
4 pounds (10-12 medium) onions
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into chunks
2 tablespoons EVOO
1/2 tsp. coarse sea salt
a few sprigs fresh thyme
1 bay leaf
1/2 cup dry sherry
8 cups broth (beef or chicken)
slices of stale baguette
grated gruyere or comte cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400. In a Dutch oven, combine the onions, butter, olive oil, salt thyme, and bay leaf. Cook covered, in the oven for 1 hour. Stir and , leaving the lid slightly askew, continue to let the mixture cook in the oven for an additional 1 1/2 hours.
Transfer the Dutch oven to the stovetop. Cook the onion mixture over medium high heat, until the liquid is evaporated and the onions are golden, about 20 minutes. Add the sherry and cook 5 minutes more. Add the broth, scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen any caramelized onions. Bring the soup to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes.
Spoon the soup into 8 individual ovenproof crocks and top each with a crouton and a layer of grated cheese. Place the crocks under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes, until cheese in brown and bubbly.
