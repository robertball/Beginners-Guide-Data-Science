Ingredients:
3 tablespoons honey
1 (1/4-ounce) package active dry yeast
2 tablespoons canola oil or high-oleic sunflower oil
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup coarsely chopped pecans or walnuts
1 cup seedless raisins or chopped dates
1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, stir together honey and 1/2 cup lukewarm (105° to 115°) water. Add yeast and stir to dissolve. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
Stir in 1 1/2 cups lukewarm (105° to 115°) water, oil and salt. Add whole wheat flour, and stir until well combined. Add pecans and raisins, then stir in all-purpose flour until dough leaves sides of bowl, adding a bit more flour if necessary. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead 5 to 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Place dough in a lightly oiled mixing bowl, turning to coat. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.
Lightly oil a large baking sheet; set aside. Punch down dough and turn out onto a floured surface. Shape dough into a large round loaf and transfer to baking sheet, or shape for or two small bread pan loaves. Cover with damp cloth and let rise again until almost doubled, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425°F. With a paring knife, slash top of loaf. Bake 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 375°F and bake 30 to 35 minutes more, or until nicely browned and bottom of loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Cool on rack before slicing.
