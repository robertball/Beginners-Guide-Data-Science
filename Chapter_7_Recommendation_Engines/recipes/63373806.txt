Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 cup milk
1 cup pumpkin puree
cinnamon-sugar for topping
maple syrup for topping

Directions:
Preheat/prepare your waffle iron according to manufacturer directions.
Crack the eggs into a large bowl and whip until bubbly & fluffy. About 30 seconds with a hand mixer.
Add in remaining ingredients. Mix well. Batter will be thick.
Add batter to waffle iron and cook about 5-7 minutes. (Steam may still be rising, due to the high moisture content of the pumpkin.)
Remove to plate and top with cinnamon-sugar & maple syrup.
