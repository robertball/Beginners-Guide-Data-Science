Ingredients:
2 cups all purpose flour (or gluten-free flour)
1/4 cup sugar
2 tsps baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon (I used a little more)
1/2 tsp nutmeg (I used a little less)
1 1/2 cup milk
4 tbsps butter, melted
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract (I used a little more)
nonstick cooking spray
maple syrup
1/2 cup blueberries (optional)

Directions:
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in medium bowl.
In a separate bowl combine milk, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla and whisk together.  Add dry mixture to wet mixture and stir well, until no lumps remain.
OPTIONAL - place a tsp of flour in a bowl and toss blueberries so they are coated with flour.  Gently fold into batter. (I used about 1/2 cup of blueberries, but feel free to use more if you want more blueberries!)
Spray crock well with nonstick cooking spray, then pour batter into crock.  Drizzle lightly with maple syrup.  Cover and cook on high for 1 1/2 - 2 hours until edges are slightly browned and the center is fully cooked (I cooked for 1 hr 50 minutes). Let cool uncovered for several then slice (or scoop) to serve. Serve warm with maple syrup and butter.
