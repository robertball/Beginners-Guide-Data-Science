Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the sugar and flour. Add beer and continue to mix, first using a wooden spoon, then your hands.  Batter will be sticky.  Pour into a 9 x 5 inch greased loaf pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees ) for 50 for 60 minutes.  The top will be crunchy, and the insides will be soft.  Serve topped with butter or cheese spread.
