Description: 
A friend of mine took notes while our church missionaries Abraham and Lilian Ephriam cooked dinner for her when they were here on furlough from India. This curry will surpass any you've tasted in the best Indian restaurant! It is well worth the time and extra spices needed.  Don't be afraid to adjust the seasonings to your liking, or add a couple of extra hot peppers!
