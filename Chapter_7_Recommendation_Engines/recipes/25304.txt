Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cavatelli pasta
1 head broccoli, cut into florets
½ cup butter
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Place broccoli in a microwave safe dish with about 3 tablespoons of water.  Microwave for 3 minutes, or until tender.
Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat.  Saute garlic and mushrooms until garlic becomes aromatic.  Combine with pasta, broccoli and Parmesan cheese; transfer to a 2 quart baking dish.
Cover and bake in preheated oven for about 20 minutes, or until heated throughout.

Description: 
A local family restaurant has a dish very similar to this one that has been a favorite for years. My friend and I came up with this recipe when we were unable to find one anywhere, even in Italian cookbooks.
