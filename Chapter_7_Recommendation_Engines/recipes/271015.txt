Ingredients:
3/4 cup Italian bread crumbs
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup vegetable oil
3 thick-cut pork steaks

Directions:
Mix bread crumbs and flour together in a resealable plastic bag. Place eggs in another bag.
Place pork steaks in the bag with egg mixture and toss. Transfer 1 steak into the bag with the bread crumbs mixture and toss to coat.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add coated steak to the hot oil. Coat the next steak with the bread crumbs and add to the skillet. Fry until browned on both sides, about 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Repeat with the remaining pork steak.
