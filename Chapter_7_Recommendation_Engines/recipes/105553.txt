Description: 
I love Indian food, this recipe developed after falling in love with the dish at a small family owned Indian restaurant near my home. After tweaking a few things, I think I have come up with a great copy-cat version.  The curry paste can easily be substituted with the mild version for those with more sensitive palates.  Serve over Basmati rice. I hope it meets your liking.  Enjoy!
