Ingredients:
6 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups flour
Pinch Salt
1 tsp. Pure Vanilla Extract
1 Tbs. Sugar
1/4 cup (4 Tbs.) butter
1/3 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 and cut the butter into pats inside a 9x13 Pyrex baking dish. Place Pyrex dish with butter in the oven to melt while oven preheats.
While the butter melts, you can crack the eggs into a large bowl and whisk them until eggs are well-beaten (less than 1 minute). Gradually add the milk and stir to blend. Gradually add the flour, salt, sugar, and vanilla while blending by hand until only a few lumps remain, but do not over-blend.
Remove butter when just bubbly and melted, taking care not to brown the butter. Swirl melted butter around the pan and on the sides of the pan. Sprinkle brown sugar evenly across the butter-covered dish.
Pour the batter on top of the brown sugar-butter coated dish (remember it's still hot!) and bake for about 25 minutes, until it is enormously puffed up and nicely golden brown.
Serve with fresh fruit, your favorite sausage and more hot maple syrup, if you have a real sweet tooth. Enjoy!
