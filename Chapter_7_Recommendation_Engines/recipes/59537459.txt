Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) fillets halibut
1 lime, cut into wedges
salt & pepper to taste
3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons Smart Balance maragine
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Preheat a grill for high heat. Squeeze the juice from the lime wedges over fish fillets, then season them with salt and pepper.
Grill fish fillets for about 5 minutes on each side, until browned and fish can be flaked with a fork. Remove to a warm serving plate.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic; cook and stir just until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in the Smart Balance, remaining lime juice and cilantro. Serve fish with the cilantro butter sauce.
