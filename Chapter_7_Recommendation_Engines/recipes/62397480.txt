Ingredients:
1/2 pound extra-lean ground beef
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon onion powder

Directions:
In medium bowl, combine meat, egg, bread crumbs, cheese, basil and onion powder; shape into 3/4 inch balls.
Place in simmering sauce for minimum of 1/2 hour.  The longer you cook these the more tender they become.  Stir occasionally to prevent sauce from burning.
