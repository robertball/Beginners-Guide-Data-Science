2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast

Directions:
In a large bowl combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  With pastry blender or two knives, cut in shortening until mixture resembles course crumbs, set aside.
Place warm water in warm bowl. Sprinkle in yeast, stir until dissolved. Add yeast mixture and warm buttermilk to dry ingredients, blend well.
