Ingredients:
1 tube of crescent rolls (8 rolls)
1 pound sausage (mild or spicy depending on preference)
1 small onion
1/2 green bell pepper
8 oz cream cheese (the one with chives is really good in this recipe)
1 egg (to brush on top)

Directions:
Preheat oven according to crescent roll directions.
Spread rolls out onto baking pan.
Pinch seams together.
Cut strips along the edges (~1in long and ~1/2-1 in wide)
In a skillet , brown sausage, onion and green pepper until sausage is fully cooked. Drain.
Add cream cheese. Stir while heating, until fully mixed.
Spread the sausage and cream cheese mixture down the middle of the crescent rolls.
Fold the strips over and pinch to form the braid. (This always turns out looking different each time)
In a small bowl, beat the egg.
spread the egg over the top of the loaf to achieve a golden crispy top.
Bake according to crescent roll direction or until browned.

My boyfriend makes this all the time! This might be my favorite breakfast and I really don't like 2 of the main ingredients!
