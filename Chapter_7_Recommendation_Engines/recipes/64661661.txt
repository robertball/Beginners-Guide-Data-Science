Ingredients:
Water
1  Young Fryer Chicken (gizzards removed)
1 Small  or 3/4 Medium onion
1/2 tsp Salt
1/2 tsp turmeric
1/8 tsp black pepper
1/8 tsp cayenne powder
1 bay leaf
1 zucchini
2 carrots
1 tomato
Note:  You can add celery, I just choose not to because it changes the flavor quite a bit.

Directions:
Fill Instant Pot to line 6 with water.  Add bay leaf, salt, pepper, cayenne, and turmeric.  Chop carrots, onion, zucchini, and tomato and add to Instant Pot.  Lastly,  add chicken and submerge in water.   Add cover to Instant Pot and make sure the knob is in "sealing position."  Select "soup" option and it should automatically set to 30 minutes.  When the Instant Pot has heated enough and sealed the timer will begin to count down.  When finished hit "off."  Allow to naturally release for at least 15 minutes.  You can continue to naturally release until unsealed or you can manually release  (TURN VERY SLOWLY) making sure the liquids do not spray  everywhere.  Just take out the chicken, pull pieces and add back in (optional).  You can eat this as broth or cook some orzo or other pasta in it.  Add it to chili or any other recipe requiring broth.
Note:  You can add celery, I just choose not to because it changes the flavor quite a bit.

This is a delicious hearty and comforting soup that is quick and easy to make!  This is my children's favorite!  I will usually use this broth after and cook orzo in it!
