Ingredients:
5 lbs chicken pieces, thighs and breasts, bone-in, skin-on
6 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
2 Tbsp dried oregano
1 tsp kosher salt ½ tsp freshly ground pepper
1/4 cup red wine
¼ cup white wine vinegar (or vinegar w/ 5% acidity)
1 tbsp olive oil
1/2 cup pitted prunes
8 large pitted Spanish green olives, cut in half
1/4 cup capers with a bit of juice
3 bay leaves
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tsp kosher salt
2 Tbsp fresh Italian parsley, finely chopped

Directions:
In a large bowl combine garlic, oregano, salt and pepper, red wine, vinegar, olive oil, prunes, olives, capers with caper juice, and bay leaves. Add the chicken pieces and coat completely with the marinade. Cover and let marinate, refrigerated, several hours or overnight. To make ahead, freeze in a Ziploc bag for up to 6 mos. Make sure it has thawed completely before cooking.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Arrange chicken in a single layer in one or two large, shallow baking pans, or dutch oven and spoon marinade over it evenly. Sprinkle chicken pieces with brown sugar, kosher salt.
Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour. Chicken is done when thigh pieces, pricked with a fork at their thickest point, yield clear yellow juice (not pink).
4 With a slotted spoon, transfer chicken, prunes, olives, and capers to a serving platter. Add some of the pan juices and sprinkle generously with parsley.
