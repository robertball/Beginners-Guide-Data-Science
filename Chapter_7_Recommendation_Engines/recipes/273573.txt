Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup panko bread crumbs
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced into 1/8-inch thick rounds
2 eggs, beaten
Honey Butter:
1 stick salted butter, softened
2 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil and lightly coat with cooking spray.
Mix panko, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Dip sweet potato slices in beaten egg, then coat with panko mixture. Place in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Spray tops of sweet potato slices lightly with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven until chips are golden brown and crunchy, about 20 minutes.
Mix butter and honey together in a bowl in the meantime. Serve chips with honey butter.
