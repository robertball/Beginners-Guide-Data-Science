Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
2 pounds ground pork
vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups carrots, finely chopped
soy sauce to taste
3 cups bean sprouts
1 cup sugar snap peas, chopped
1 cup fresh mushrooms, finely chopped
1 cup green onions, finely chopped
salt to taste
garlic powder to taste
black pepper to taste
1 (14 ounce) package Lumpia Wrappers
1 egg white, beaten
canola oil for frying

Directions:
Brown beef and pork in a large frying pan with a small amount of oil over medium heat. Drain, place in a large mixing bowl, and set aside. In the same pan, cook the carrots with a splash of soy sauce until tender. Add the bean sprouts, snap peas, mushrooms, and green onions, and a dash each of soy sauce, salt, garlic powder, and black pepper. Cook and stir for 5 minutes, or until vegetables are tender but still firm. Add to beef and pork, and toss to combine.
Work with 5, or so, spring roll wrappers at one time, leaving the others covered with a damp cloth to prevent them from drying out. Lay the wrappers so that one corner is facing you. Place a small amount of filling mixture on the corner closest to you, and fold over. Fold the two outside corners inward, then continue rolling up as you would a burrito, leaving the top corner exposed. Brush a small amount of egg white on the top corner, finish rolling, and seal. Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers.
Heat vegetable oil in deep-fryer or deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry rolls for about 5 minutes, or until golden brown, then drain on paper towels.

Description: 
This is a recipe that my mom brought back from a military stint in Japan. She has made it for family reunions, and it is always the first thing to go! These can also be prepared ahead and frozen, then deep fried just before you plan to serve!
