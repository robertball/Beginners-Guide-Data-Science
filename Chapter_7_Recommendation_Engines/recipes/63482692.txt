Ingredients:
2-3 T Olive oil
2 T fresh flat leaf parsley, finely chopped
1 medium onion, finely diced
cracked black pepper and sea salt to taste
1 28 oz. can Furmano crushed tomatoes
2 14 oz. cans diced tomatoes, processed smooth
1 6 oz. can tomato paste
2 tsp. Sun of Italy Italian Spice Mix (a must!)
1 tsp. dried basil
1 tsp. dried oregano
2 cloves garlic, minced
2-3 tsp sugar
I use both crushed and diced tomatoes to vary the texture and flavor...Furmanos crushed tomatoes have the perfect texture, smooth but with a few bits of tomato for a good bite.  Processing the other tomatoes smooth creates the perfect texture combination for our liking.

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a pot over medium high heat.  Add onions, parsley and salt and pepper, stirring and cooking until onions are translucent.
Add tomatoes, tomato paste, spices, garlic and sugar. Stir to combine. Heat on medium high to just boiling, reduce heat to low.
Simmer covered for at least 1 hour, or transfer to crockpot and cook on low 8-10 hours (heaven!). Taste and adjust sugar/salt if needed.
If adding meatballs, brown them in skillet on all sides, then add to pot after the sauce has been simmering 30 minutes.
