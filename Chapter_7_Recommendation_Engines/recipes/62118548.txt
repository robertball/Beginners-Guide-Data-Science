Bring to boil, stirring periodically.
Cook and stir for 4 minutes.
Remove from heat and add vanilla chips and marshmallow cream. Stir till smooth.
Remove a little more that 1/2 of this to mixing bowl.
Leave rest in pan, on very low heat so that it stays warm.
Add orange extract and orange food coloring to mixture in bowl. Spread "orange" mixture into 9 x 13 pan**.
Drop "white" mixture (from stovetop) by tablespoons on top.
Cut through with knife to swirl. Cover and refrigerate till sets up, about two hours.
