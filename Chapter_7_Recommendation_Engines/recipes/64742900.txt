Ingredients:
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons half & half
sprinkle of kosher salt
1/4 cup Guinness draft beer
2 scallions, chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley {plus, more for garnish}
dash of hot sauce {sriracha, or tabasco}, or to taste
Bread or crackers to serve with dip

Directions:
Combine the cream cheese, shredded cheddar, mustard and half & half in the bowl of a food processor.  Sprinkle in a pinch of kosher salt & pulse until combined.
Pour in the beer & blend until smooth.
Add in the scallions, parsley & hot sauce; pulse a few more times.
Taste for seasoning & add in a bit more salt, if desired.
Transfer the mixture to a bowl & chill for at least an hour, or overnight.
Before serving, soften slightly, by letting the dip warm at room temperature.  Garnish with another pinch of chopped fresh parsley.  Serve with crudit√©s, and/or crackers.  I recommend some rosemary flatbreads, or Wheat Thins.
