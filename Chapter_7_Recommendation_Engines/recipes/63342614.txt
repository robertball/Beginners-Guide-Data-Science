Ingredients:
3 tablespoons Cajun seasoning
1 lime, juiced
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp (30-40 per pound)

Directions:
Mix together the Cajun seasoning, lime juice, and vegetable oil in a resealable plastic bag.
Add the shrimp, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Remove the shrimp from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
Cook the shrimp on the preheated grill until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 2 minutes per side.
