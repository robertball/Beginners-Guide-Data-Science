Ingredients:
4 eggs, separated
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup white sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup golden rum

Directions:
Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks.
Whip cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form.
Beat sugar, egg yolks, and salt together in a bowl until very thick and lemon-colored; stir in rum.
Fold egg yolk mixture into whipped cream; fold egg whites into whipped cream mixture. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours.

Description: 
This spoonable eggnog is great for the holidays and feels more like a dessert than a drink. You can substitute 1 1/2 teaspoons rum flavoring for the rum, if desired. Serve in cups with spoons and garnish with a sprinkle of nutmeg.
