Ingredients:
4 pounds chicken wings
1 cup dark soy sauce
1 cup teriyaki sauce
2 cups dark brown sugar
1 cup honey hickory bbq sauce (optional)
black food coloring

Directions:
Whisk together the sauces and sugar in a large glass or ceramic bowl until the sugar has dissolved. Carefully add & stir in enough black food coloring to reach the desired blackness.
Liberally pierce the wings with a fork, then add the chicken wings to the marinade.  For best results, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour if possible - overnight is even better.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Add the chicken & the marinade into a large baking dish. Bake the wings in the preheated oven until the chicken is cooked through, turning & basting occasionally.  About 1 hour.
