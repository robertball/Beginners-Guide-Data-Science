Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (3 pound) beef brisket, top cut or thin cut
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper, or to taste
2 large onions, thickly sliced
1/2 cup beef broth
1/2 cup dry red wine
1 cup bottled chili sauce
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1 bay leaf

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy roasting pan over medium-high heat; pat brisket dry with paper towels. Rub meat with garlic and cracked black pepper and place into the hot oil. Brown brisket on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove brisket and set aside.
Reduce heat to medium and cook and stir onions until very browned, about 10 minutes; stir beef broth and red wine into the Dutch oven. Scrape up any brown bits and bring the mixture to a simmer.
Stir chili sauce, brown sugar, cider vinegar, and bay leaf into the red wine mixture; place brisket in the sauce. Spoon sauce over the meat and cover the Dutch oven.
Bake in the preheated oven until the brisket is tender, 2 to 3 hours. Let brisket cool in pan. Remove brisket, slice the meat, and return the slices to the pan.
Return to oven and bake until the sauce is bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is heaven in a pot and couldn't be easier to make! The sweet and sour flavors come together nicely with melt-in-your-mouth brisket. Serve with mashed potatoes, potato pancakes or roasted potatoes and bread on the side to soak up the scrumptious sauce. If you like intense flavors, you will not be disappointed.
