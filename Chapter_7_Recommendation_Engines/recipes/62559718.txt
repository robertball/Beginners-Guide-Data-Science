Ingredients:
1 pack (double pack) Extra Firm tofu
1 inch piece of ginger-grated
1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce
toasted sesame seeds-optional

Directions:
Cut tofu into 1/4 inch pieces-lay down on layered paper towels-top with more towels and find something heavy to place on top to squeeze out excess water. Let sit 20-30 min. Then mix grated ginger and soy sauce in a large pan. Add tofu and marinate 12 min on each side. Lightly oil a baking sheet and place tofu in oven at 350 for 30 minutes-turning over 1/2 way. Top with a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds-or you can add them to the marinade.
