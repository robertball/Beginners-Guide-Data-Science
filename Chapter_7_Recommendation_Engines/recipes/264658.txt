Description: 
This is a super stable, delicious, easy-to-make Swiss meringue that's perfect as a base for Swiss meringue buttercream or as a topping for any pie you want to make! Because it's whipped over a bain-marie, it doesn't need to be baked - which makes it especially great for my favorite lemon icebox pie (I suggest trying that if you're into lemon meringue pie!). Precision is important, otherwise it's as foolproof as the title says. Hope you love it as much as I do.
