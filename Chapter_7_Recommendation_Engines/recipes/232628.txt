Ingredients:
2 slices  sourdough bread
2 ounces goat cheese, or more to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons mango chutney (such as Patak'sÂ®), or more to taste
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Spread goat cheese onto one side of one slice of bread and mango chutney on one side of the other slice of bread. Sandwich bread slices together around the goat cheese and chutney.
Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Cook sandwich in melted butter, pressing with the back of a spatula occasionally to assure the cheese melts, until the bread is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Description: 
I made this sandwich up one day and have never been able to enjoy traditional grilled cheese quite as much since. The tangy goat cheese and spicy-sweet mango chutney is an awesome combo, and sourdough bread lends to the flavor nicely. As a bonus, it is ridiculously quick and easy to make! Try pairing this with butternut squash soup; it's an even better combo than the old grilled cheese and tomato!
