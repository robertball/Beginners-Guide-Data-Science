Ingredients:
2 cups all purpose flour
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup unsalted butter at room temp.
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup light brown sugar
2 teaspoon vanilla
2 extra large eggs
2 11 ounce bags of chocolate chunk chips - divided
2 cups mini marshmallows

Directions:
Beat butter and sugars until fluffy.
Add eggs and vanilla, blend in.
Add flour, graham cracker crumbs, salt, soda and mix well.
Mix in 2 cups of the chocolate chunks.
Refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Scoop up 1 tablespoon of dough and roll into a ball.   Place on parchment lined baking sheet, about 2 inches apart to allow for spreading.
Bake approximately 8-10 minutes or until set.
Remove cookies from oven and quickly press a few marshmallows on top of each cookie.  Add remaining chocolate chunks.  Return to oven for approximately 1 or 2 minutes until marshmallows melt slightly and the chocolate has the chance to stick to the cookie.
Remove from oven and let cool on baking sheet 5 minutes before removing to wire rack to finish cooling.
Store in an airtight container.
