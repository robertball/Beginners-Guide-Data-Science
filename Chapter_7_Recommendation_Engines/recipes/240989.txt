1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained and liquid reserved
1/4 cup minced garlic
2 serrano chile peppers, chopped
2 tablespoons sun-dried tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Blend garbanzo beans, garlic, serrano peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, and cumin in a blender on low until smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute.

Description: 
This hummus makes a great appetizer for the flavor-famished. Garnish with minced sun-dried tomato for extra awesome points. Just a heads up, though: this stuff has a bit of a kick. It's not a melt-your-face-off kind of spice, but you might end up sleeping on the couch.
