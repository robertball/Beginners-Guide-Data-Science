Ingredients:
1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon sesame seed oil
1 (4 pound) boneless pork shoulder roast
1 cup barbeque sauce
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup cream sherry wine
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 1/2 teaspoons liquid smoke
1/4 cup light brown sugar
1 tablespoon spicey dijon mustard
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/8 teaspoon chili powder
1 large red onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons fresh cilantro, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme, chopped
8 Kaiser rolls, split
butter, as needed

Directions:
Pour the oils into the bottom of a slow cooker. Place the pork roast into the slow cooker. Mix all the liquid ingredients and pour in over the roast. Stir in the brown sugar, mustard, chili powder, onion, garlic, cilantro and thyme. Cover and cook on High until the roast shreds easily with a fork, 5 to 6 hours.
Remove the roast from the slow cooker, and shred the meat using two forks. Return the shredded pork to the slow cooker, and stir the meat into the juices.
Spread the inside of both halves of the rolls with butter. Toast the rolls, butter side down, in a skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Spoon pork into the toasted rolls.
