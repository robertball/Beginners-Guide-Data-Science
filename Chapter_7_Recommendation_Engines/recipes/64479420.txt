Ingredients:
4 cups rice, cooked (white or brown)
1 zucchini, chopped
1 red pepper, chopped
7 cloves of garlic
1/2 block of tofu, cubed
1/4 cup green onions, chopped
1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon lime juice
Salt and pepper to taste.

Directions:
Cook the rice and set aside.
In a frying pan, brown the tofu cubes with one table spoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Once browned, add the zucchini and garlic and let soften, about 10 minutes over medium-low heat.
In a large skillet, fry the rice on medium-high heat with the remaining oil, adding as needed. When the rice starts to brown add the soy sauce and stir. Then, add the red peppers and let cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Combine the tofu mix to the rice mixture, and stir. Add the green onions, cilantro and lime juice and let cook for another couple of minutes over medium-low heat.
Serve hot.
