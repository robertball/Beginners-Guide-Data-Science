Ingredients:
6 boneless skinless chicken breast
6 slices of Prosciutto
1 3/4 cups of chicken stock, divided
2 garlic cloves, minced
3 sprigs of fresh Thyme
1 tsp Dijon mustard

Directions:
Butterfly each chicken breast and pound to even thickness.
Place a slice of prosciutto on  each chicken breast.
Roll each chicken breast with prosciutto in side.
Secure the chicken with kitchen twine or toothpicks.
Heat 1-2 Tbsp of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste.
Sear the chicken for 2-3 minutes on all sides.
Add 1 1/4 cups of the chicken stock (scrapping the browned bits of the bottom of the pan).  Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook for 4-5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.  Remove the chicken and keep warm.
Add the remaining chicken stock (1/2 cup), garlic, and the leaves from the thyme sprigs.
Cook for 1-2 minutes or until reduced.
Add the Dijon mustard and stir to combine.  Serve the sauce over the chicken
