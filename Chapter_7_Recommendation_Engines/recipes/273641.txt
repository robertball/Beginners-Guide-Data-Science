Ingredients:
6 cups crumbled dry bread
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 cup pumpkin puree
3 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
2 cups milk
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup rum
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon rum extract
1 cup heavy whipping cream, chilled
3 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons amaretto liqueur

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x9x2-inch baking pan. Place a pan of water into the bottom of the oven to help keep the pudding moist.
Combine bread crumbs and walnuts in a bowl and pour into the bottom of the prepared baking pan.
Beat condensed milk, pumpkin puree, eggs, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger in a mixing bowl. Stir in milk, melted butter, rum, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and rum extract. Pour mixture over bread crumbs.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
Meanwhile, beat cream, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a chilled bowl until stiff and peaked. Fold in amaretto and refrigerate whipped cream until ready to serve with the bread pudding.
