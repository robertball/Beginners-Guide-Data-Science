Ingredients:
4 medium tomatoes
olive oil, as needed
1 cup cooked brown rice
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese
1/4 cup chopped toasted walnuts
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided, or more to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, divided
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Cut tops off tomatoes and scoop out flesh with a melon baller, leaving 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick sides and bottoms. Discard tomato tops and flesh.
Brush the bottom of an air fryer basket with olive oil.
Combine cooked rice, Parmesan cheese, goat cheese, walnuts, 1 tablespoon basil, and garlic in a medium bowl. Combine bread crumbs, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small bowl. Fill tomatoes with rice mixture, then sprinkle with bread crumb mixture. Place stuffed tomatoes into the prepared air fryer basket.
Cook in the air fryer at 370 degrees F (188 degrees C) until tomatoes are tender, filling is heated through, and topping is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Garnish with remaining basil.
