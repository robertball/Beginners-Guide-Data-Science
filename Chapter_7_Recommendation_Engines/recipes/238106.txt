Description: 
These were creatively thought up by my husband who cannot tolerate gluten or grains. Our boys named them 'Daddy Cookies.' We make these a few times a week, since they are pretty healthy cookies and are delicious, kid-approved, and easy to make! They are best paired with a cup of joe or tea.
