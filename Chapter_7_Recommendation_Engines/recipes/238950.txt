Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) jar Alfredo sauce (such as Classico(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 pound shredded cooked chicken
1 (16 ounce) package mixed vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots), chopped
2 cloves garlic, or more to taste, minced
1 dash onion powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1  prepared pie crust
2 tablespoons melted butter (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir Alfredo sauce, chicken, vegetables, garlic, onion powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Trim prepared pie crust to lay atop the chicken mixture to cover completely, sealing along any edges. Slice three slits across the pastry to vent. Brush melted butter over the crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is a light golden brown and inside is hot and bubbly, about 45 minutes.
