Ingredients:
1 pound ham steak, cubed. (Tip: have the deli slice you a half inch slab of cooked or boiled ham -- cheapest if fine!)
1 cup shredded cheddar or other melting cheese
1 can cream of chicken, mushroom or celery soup
1 package frozen shredded hash browns, thawed
1 onion, grated or minced
1 cup peas, corn or chopped brocolli, thawed if frozen
1/4 cup melted butter or a splash of olive oil

Directions:
It's as easy as combine all, dump in a sprayed 9X13 and bake for 35 or 40 minutes until bubbling.  Variations are endless
