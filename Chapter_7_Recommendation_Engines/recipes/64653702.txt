Ingredients:
3 cups flour
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
2 Tbsp sugar
1 1/2 tsp salt, divided
3/4 cup yogurt
1/4 cup milk
1 egg
1/4 cup melted butter
1 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
2 cups zucchini, seeded and shredded
1 medium sized jalapeno minced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread a thin layer of olive oil evenly onto every inner surface of 2 9"x 5 " loaf pans. Dust with flour to coat evenly. This will keep your loaf from sticking to the pan once it's baked, so make sure you don't miss any spots.
Put zucchini in a colander add 1 tsp salt and toss to distribute evenly. Leave the colander in the sink or over a bowl and allow the excess water to drain from the zucchini for at least 15 minutes, squeeze slightly to remove excess moisture.
In a bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the yogurt, milk and egg.
Whisk the melted butter into the yogurt mixture.
Add the yogurt mixture to the flour mix, and gently combine.
Stir in the shredded cheese, zucchini and minced jalapeno.
Fill loaf pans and  bake for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.
