Ingredients:
Dutch Crunch Topping
2 tbsp  active dry yeast
1 cup warm water
2 tbsp  sugar
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
½ tsp salt
1½ cups rice flour

Directions:
Dutch Crunch Topping
Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and beat with a whisk; beat hard to combine. The consistency should be like stiff royal icing – spreadable, but not too runny. If you pull some up with your whisk, as shown below, it should drip off slowly. Add more water or rice flour as necessary. Let stand 15 minutes.
Coat the top of each loaf or roll with a thick layer of topping. We tried coating it with a brush but it worked better just to use fingers or a spoon and kind of spread it around. You should err on the side of applying too much topping – a thin layer will not crack properly.
You can place the rolls directly into the oven after applying the topping, or let them stand for 20 minutes.
When baking, place pans on a rack in the center of the oven and bake your bread as you ordinarily would. The Dutch Crunch topping should crack and turn a nice golden-brown color.
