Description: 
The perfect recipe for a summer lunch or dinner, when you want to have something cool and refreshing, without being heavy. My family loves it when I serve this, and it doesn't require any exotic ingredients. Other fruits may be added, such as strawberries, blueberries, etc. Serve salad on lettuce, in a sandwich, in a pita pocket or on a tortilla for a roll-up. Enjoy!
