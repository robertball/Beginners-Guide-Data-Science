Ingredients:
6-8 ounces (3-4 large balls) fresh mozzarella
2 cups chopped (seeded if desired) tomatos
2 large handfuls (about 1 cup loosely packed) fresh basil
salt to taste
pepper to taste
2 tablespoons (to taste) red wine vinegar
olive oil 1 1/2 tablespoons (to taste) (extra virgin if available)

Directions:
First drain the fresh mozzarella. Chop into large pieces. Next chop the tomatos and toss with the mozzarella. Next clean off basil leaves and tear roughly. Toss with the mozzarella and tomatos. Next sprinkle a little salt and pepper over mixture. Now toss with equal amounts red wine vinegar and olive oil (preferably extra virgin) to make a very light dressing just to coat a little (this is about 2 tablespoons each). Serve. Chill before serving if desired.

Description: 
This is a simple delicious salad that my mother always made. It is perfect for a hot summer day. It is very Italian. Perfect for a barbeque. A great use for homegrown tomatos and basil! :)
