Ingredients:
1 large bunch Swiss chard
1 tablespoon grated ginger
2 tablespoons oil
1 generous pinch salt

Directions:
Wash chard.  Remove the large stems and cut into 1/2 inch slices.  Loosely chop the leaves.
Grate ginger with a fine grater, into a plate or bowl to collect the juices.
Heat oil over medium heat.  Add ginger and cook about a minute, stirring.
Add chard stems and saute about 5 minutes.  Add leaves and salt, and cook until leaves are wilted and almost all liquid has cooked out, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
I usually don't add much to Swiss chard, as I love its natural flavor, but the addition of ginger brings it up a couple more notches.  Hope you enjoy it too.
