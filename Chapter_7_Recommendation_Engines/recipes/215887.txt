Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast - cooked and diced
4 cups Classico® Tomato and Basil Sauce
2 tablespoons hot sauce
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 1/2 cups water
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 small onion, chopped
1 small green bell pepper, chopped
1 (6 ounce) can mushrooms, drained
1 egg, beaten
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
12 uncooked lasagna noodles
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
3/4 cup crumbled blue cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a lasagna pan.
In a large bowl combine the chicken, pasta sauce, hot sauce, vinegar, water, garlic powder, onion, bell pepper and mushrooms; mix well and set aside. In a medium bowl, mix together the egg beat and ricotta cheese.
Spread 1 cup of the chicken/spaghetti mixture in the bottom of the prepared pan. Layer with lasagna noodles, then another 1 1/2 cups of the chicken mixture. Spread 1/2 of the ricotta/egg mixture over all, then top with 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Add another layer of noodles, 1 1/2 cups chicken mixture, remaining ricotta mixture and remaining mozzarella. Top with one last layer of noodles and remaining chicken mixture.
Cover pan and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 70 minutes. Remove cover, sprinkle with crumbled blue cheese and bake uncovered for another 5 minutes.
Remove from oven, cover and let stand for about 15 to 20 minutes before serving.
