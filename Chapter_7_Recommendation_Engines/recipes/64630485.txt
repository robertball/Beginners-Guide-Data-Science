Description: 
Octopus Ratatouille is a spicy mixed vegetables and octopus dish with a tomato based sauce. This dish is very tasty because many kinds of vegetables were used. I've added octopus to my ratatouille recipe and made it a little bit spicy by adding dried chili peppers. I great choice to make the husband eat more vegetables.
