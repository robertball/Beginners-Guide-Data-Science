Ingredients:
2 Italian turkey Sausages, casings removed
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 red & 1/2 bell peppers, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
2 c sliced mushrooms
17 slices turkey pepperoni, chopped
2 pinches crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 tsp dried Italian seasoning
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 jar Spaghetti Sauce
1 container reduced fat refrigerated Buttermilk Biscuits
1 1/2 cups Part-Skim Finely Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
4 Tbsp shredded parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat over to 375 and spray a 9×13 dish with nonstick cooking spray.  Coat a large frying pan with nonstick spray and place over medium heat.  Add sausage and brown.
While the sausage cooks, chop all vegetables and turkey pepperoni.  Add turkey pepperoni for 1 minute to sausage and remove/set sausage aside.
Return vegetables to pan and cook until soft, approximately 5-7 minutes. Add spices, spaghetti sauce and mix well.  Remove from heat.
Pull each biscuit apart into little pieces. Arrange half of the biscuit pieces evenly over the bottom of a 9×13 pan. (Be sure that the biscuits aren’t to thick, or they won’t cook through.)
Spread half of the sauce mixture over the biscuits. Sprinkle with half of the cheese. Repeat layers.
Bake for 23-28 minutes or until golder brown.
