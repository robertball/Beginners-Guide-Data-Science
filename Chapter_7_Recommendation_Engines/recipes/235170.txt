1 teaspoon salt
3 pounds pork picnic roast

Directions:
Mix beer, mustard, honey, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, cayenne pepper, and salt in a bowl until honey is dissolved. Pour a small amount of the beer marinade into a slow cooker; add pork. Pour remaining marinade over pork. Cover and refrigerate overnight, turning pork occasionally.
Cook pork on Low in the slow cooker for 8 hours, basting occasionally. Add water if the pork becomes dry. Drop onion around pork and continue to cook until pork is very tender, about 2 hours more.
Pull and shred pork with two forks, discarding any pieces of fat. Transfer pork to a serving dish. Skim remaining onion from the slow cooker using a sieve and add to pork.

Description: 
A wonderfully easy, exceptionally tender pulled pork recipe. The meat literally falls off the bone and the marinade adds an excellent flavor that can complement any BBQ sauce. This recipe is great if you're looking for a make-ahead meal. Pulled pork is great served on fresh baked rolls or pita bread with sharp cheddar cheese and coleslaw. You can serve the pork as is or mix in your favorite BBQ sauce.
