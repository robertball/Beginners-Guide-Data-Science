Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped
1 (16 ounce) can chili beans
1 (15 ounce) can black beans
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 carrot, chopped
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chilies, undrained
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
1 1/2 tablespoons of Healthier Taco Seasoning I (recipe from this website)
3 whole skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese (optional)
light sour cream (optional)
crushed baked tortilla chips (optional)

Directions:
Place the onion, garlic, chili beans, black beans, corn, chopped carrot, tomato sauce, beer, and diced tomatoes in a slow cooker. Add taco seasoning, and stir to blend. Lay chicken breasts on top of the mixture, pressing down slightly until just covered by the other ingredients. Set slow cooker for low heat, cover, and cook for 5 hours.
Remove chicken breasts from the soup, and allow to cool long enough to be handled. Shred the chicken, and then stir the shredded chicken back into the soup, and continue cooking for 2 hours. Serve topped with shredded cheese, a dollop of light sour cream, chopped cilantro and crushed tortilla chips, if desired.
