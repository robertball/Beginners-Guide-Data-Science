Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (14 ounce) can kidney beans
1 (14.5 ounce) can beef bouillon
1 (14 ounce) can whole plum tomatoes
1 (7 ounce) can tomato puree
1/2 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer (optional)
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon crushed dried chipotle pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
Cook and stir ground beef in a large soup pot over medium heat until meat is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Pour kidney beans, beef bouillon, plum tomatoes, tomato puree, beer, and Worcestershire sauce into beef. Stir in dry onion soup mix, red pepper flakes, dried chipotle pepper, cumin, thyme, and oregano.
Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until thickened, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Description: 
This recipe won the Blum invitational chili cook-off/Super BowlÂ® party. It really is good. Many people say this but this one guarantees an empty pot when taken to potlucks. I got this recipe from my friend Mark, who has spent his life in public safety positions. He hasn't forgotten his firehouse roots as evidenced by this recipe.
