Description: 
These soft, rich cookies have half the sugar that regular chocolate chip cookies have. Although there are some reputable organic brands making goodies for babies and toddlers, nothing beats homemade! Never underestimate yourself in the kitchen; remember, homemade goodies are always going to have less preservatives than even organic things on the store shelves!
