Ingredients:
4 cups fresh blueberries
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup vegan mayonnaise (such as Vegenaise®)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place blueberries into an 8-inch square baking dish.
Stir together flour, white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Stir in vegan mayonnaise until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle the mixture over the top of the berries.
Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is bubbly and the top is lightly browned, 35 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
This blueberry crisp is simple and delicious! The perfect balance of sweet and tart. The original recipe used mayonnaise but I have substituted Vegenaise®, which is a vegan alternative made from vegetable oils. It is available at some health food stores. You wouldn't guess that there is such an unusual ingredient! Best served with vanilla ice cream, or your favorite vegan alternative!
