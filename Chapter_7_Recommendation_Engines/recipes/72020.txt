Ingredients:
3 pears - peeled, cored and chopped
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
3/4 cup pear juice
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon, or to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
6 thin cut boneless pork chops

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, mix the pears, brown sugar, lemon juice, pear juice, and cinnamon. Bring to boil. Cook 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened.
Transfer the sauce mixture to a blender, and blend until smooth. Return to saucepan, cover, and simmer 15 minutes over low heat. Remove from heat, and allow to cool.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the pork chops 8 minutes, turning once, until done. Drizzle with the pear sauce to serve.

Description: 
I created this recipe because I have found that many pork recipes have little flavor, are too spicy, or just require too much work. My husband and I prefer sweet food rather than spicy or sour, hence a new pork recipe was born. This is delicious when served with rice and green vegetables as side dishes.
