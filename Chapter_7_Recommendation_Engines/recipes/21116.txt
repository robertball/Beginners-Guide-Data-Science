Ingredients:
4 quarts goat's milk
dried minced onion, to taste
1 pinch salt (optional)
1/3 cup distilled white vinegar

Directions:
In a large sauce pot over medium heat, bring the milk to a slow boil; be careful not to scorch.  Add dried onion and salt, if desired.  As the milk really bubbles up, turn off the heat and pour in the vinegar; wait for the milk to curdle, then pour it through a cheesecloth-lined colander.  Let cool, and enjoy!
