Ingredients:
1 cup almonds, or as needed

Directions:
Place almonds, about 1/4 cup at a time, in the food processor. Pulse until you reach a flour-like consistency; sift into a container. Place any remaining almonds chunks back into food processor and pulse. Repeat until all almonds are transformed into flour. Cover container and store flour in refrigerator.

Description: 
I use almond flour with many of my recipes but it is very costly. I want to experiment with a few inspirations for the holidays therefore decided to make my own almond flour. I had a huge bag that I purchased a while ago to make a nut crunch. I used my food processor but I bet you can do the same with a coffee grinder as well. My advice would be to pulse it because I fear if you over blend you will end up with almond butter. 
It came out perfectly so now off to cooking land!
