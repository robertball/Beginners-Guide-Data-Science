Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera)
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin (jeera)
1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander (dhana)
1 1/2 teaspoons chile powder
1 teaspoon minced ginger
3/4 teaspoon minced Thai chile pepper
1/4 teaspoon pav bhaji masala
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric (haldi)
1 yellow onion, diced
1 1/2 vine-ripened tomatoes, diced
4 cups finely chopped fresh spinach
3 cups water
1 1/2 cups uncooked quinoa
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste
1 lemon, cut into wedges

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large wok over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let sizzle for 30 seconds. Add garlic, ground cumin, coriander, chile powder, ginger, chile pepper, pav bhaji masala, and turmeric; saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in onion; saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cook until the tomato smell goes away. Mix in spinach; cook until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.
Pour water and quinoa into the wok. Bring to a simmer; cook, stirring occasionally, until water is absorbed, 8 to 12 minutes. Garnish with freshly chopped cilantro and lemon wedges.
