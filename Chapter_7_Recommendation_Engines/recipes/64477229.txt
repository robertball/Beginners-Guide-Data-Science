Ingredients:
2 tsp. sea salt
8-16 shrimp, about 1 lb.
2 Tbsp. olive oil, divided
1 shallot, finely chopped
3 cups frozen peas
1 cup water
1 Tbsp. fresh mint, finely chopped
1 Tbsp. fresh parsley, finely chopped
1 Tbsp. fresh basil, finely chopped
1 Tbsp. lemon juice
sea salt and pepper

Directions:
Add salt to large pot of water and bring to boil.
Add shrimp and cook for 3-4 minutes. When shrimp are cooked, they will float to the surface and change to opaque pinky orange. Do not overcook, or they will be tough.
Remove from water and place into a bowl of ice water for 1 minute to stop cooking.
Drain and remove heads and shells (and devein, if desired) before setting aside.
Heat 1 Tbsp. of olive oil in a large skillet over low heat.
Add shallot and saut√© until just cooked.
Add peas and water and cook until peas are cooked through and most of the water has evaporated, about 5 minutes.
Add shrimp and stir to warm.
Add herbs, lemon juice, and remaining oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
