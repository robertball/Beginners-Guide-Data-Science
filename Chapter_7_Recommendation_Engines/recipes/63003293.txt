Ingredients:
1 tbsp bread crumbs
4 eggs, separated
1 cup powdered sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/4 cup margarine
1 cup almond flour
1 cup rye flour
1 tbsp baking powder
3/4 cup warm milk
2/3 cup raisins
2 tsp cocoa powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300. Spray a bundt pan with cooking oil and coat with bread crumbs.
In a medium bowl, beat together egg yolks, powdered sugar, applesauce, and margarine until light and fluffy. Add flours and baking powder gradually. Add all but 2 tbsp of the milk.
In a glass bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold into the batter mixture. Stir in raisins.
Pour all but 3/4 cup of the batter into the pan. Add the 2 tbsp milk and the cocoa to the 3/4 cup batter and stir until combined. Drizzle over the batter in a simple circle then use a spatula to trace over the circle, pushing the cocoa batter deeper into the white batter, creating a marble effect.
Bake for 45-50 minutes. Sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving.
