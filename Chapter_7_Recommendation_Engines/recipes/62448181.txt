Ingredients:
3 1/2 pounds peaches
1 3/4 cups white sugar
1 Tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon almond flavoring

Directions:
Remove pits from peaches, but leave the skins intact.  Mash peaches, then combine with other ingredients in a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil on medium heat, stirring often.  Boil, again stirring often, for about one hour and fifteen minutes until thickened.  Use hand blender if needed.  A spoonful on a chilled saucer should remain smooth with no watery sign.  Fill hot sterilized jars and process for 15 minutes.
