Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
4 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
In a sauce pan, melt the butter over medium heat.
Once melted, add the cream and vanilla to the butter and heat to boiling.
In a separate thick bottomed 3 quart sauce pan, melt the sugar on medium-high heat.  Stir occasionally to prevent burning.
When all the sugar crystals have melted, remove the pan from the heat.  Slowly add the cream mixture and whisk until smooth.
If using immediately, let cool for 5-10 minutes before serving.  If storing, pour immediately into a glass jar or other container.  It will keep, refrigerated, for 2-3 weeks.

Description: 
Caramel is so easy to make, there's no reason to buy store bought caramel sauce ever again.  Use on cheesecake, apples, or ice cream.
