Ingredients:
2 cups heavy whipping cream
2 cups milk
2 (3.4 ounce) packages instant lemon pudding mix
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 cups heavy whipping cream
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 dash vanilla extract
1 (9 inch) angel food cake, cubed
3 cups sliced fresh strawberries
2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
Stir 2 cups whipping cream, milk, lemon pudding mixes, and lemon juice in a large bowl until creamy and smooth. Cover and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.
Beat remaining 2 cups whipping cream in a bowl until foamy. Gradually add confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the whipped cream will form sharp peaks.
Layer half the angel food cake in a trifle bowl. Top with half the lemon pudding mixture, half the strawberries and half the blueberries. Spread half the whipped cream over the berries. Repeat the layers. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
