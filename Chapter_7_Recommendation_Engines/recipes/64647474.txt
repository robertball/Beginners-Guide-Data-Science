Description: 
Make sure when you make this recipe, that you place baking paper in the tray whilst baking. The first time I did this, was without baking paper. Trust me, this is not what you want to be scraping out of the tin.

Finding it hard to give up carbohydrates? This keto bread makes the switch much easier, easily being able to still have sandwiches and toast.
