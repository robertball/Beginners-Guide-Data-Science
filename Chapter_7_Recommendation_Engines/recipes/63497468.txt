Ingredients:
SIMPLE BEEF MIXTURE:
1/2 pound of ground beef
1/2 cup to 1 cup of  sweet onion
1 garlic minced
1/2 tsp. garlic salt
1/2 tsp. onion powder
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp. cumin (or to taste)
1/4 tsp. black pepper
BEAN INGREDIENTS:
2 cups of refried beans (or 16 oz. can of refried beans)
SPICY BEEF VERSION: Add to Ground Beef
1 tsp. chili powder (I like New Mexico Powdered Chimayo powder)
1/4 tsp.  seasoning salt ( I use Lawry's)
1/4 tsp. garlic salt
1/2 tsp. onion powder
1/4 tsp. paprika
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/8 tsp. cumin
1/8 tsp. sugar
1/4 tsp. low sodium beef base or beef bouillon granulated
Tostada Shells:
6 corn tortillas
2 Tablespoons of cooking oil or Pam Spray
Garnishes:
shredded lettuce
1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese- 1/4 cup per tostada
1 diced tomato
other garnishes: salsa, sour cream, guacamole, black olives, Mexican shredded cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Prepare the garnishes- salsa, guacamole,  chopped black olives,cheese, chop onions, lettuce, tomatoes, etc.
Mix spices in a small bowl.  For the spicy meat mixture-If using low sodium beef base, add to the beef in the pan.
Add beef, 1/2 cup of onions and spices to a large frying pan. Fry on medium heat until browned. Remove grease.
Cover the pan with a lid to keep warm.
Brush oil on both sides of the corn tortillas.  Or spray each side with Cooking Spray such as Pam. Place on a foil lined cookie sheet.
Bake 5 minutes on one side in a preheated oven at 400 degrees.
Meanwhile, heat up the refried beans on medium low. Stirring often to prevent the beans from sticking to the pan.
Remove the tostada shells from the oven. Then, use tongs or a spatula to flip the corn tortillas over and bake for 2-3 minutes more on the other side. Or until the corn tortillas are crispy. You will have to watch the tortillas when you flip them over so they don't burn.
Spread refried beans on tostada shells with a spoon. Add 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of meat mixture to each tostada.
Garnish with desired toppings.
