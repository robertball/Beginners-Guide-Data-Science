Ingredients:
1 lb (4 cubes or 2 cup) unsalted butter
1 lb (2 cup) cup raw sugar or evaporated cane juice
14 grams fine sea salt
2 tablespoon molasses, unsulfered (NOT blackstrap)

Directions:
Cut a strip of non-stick foil to the same width of an 8x8 loaf pan. Line the pan making sure the edges of the foil extend up and over opposite sides of the pan. (Don't worry about the unlined sides. Spray the whole pan and foil with cooking spray, especially the unlined sides and set on a heatproof surface.
Melt butter over medium low heat. Stir in the sugar, molasses and salt. When the mixture is good and liquidy, increase the heat to medium to medium-high and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
Cook the candy to 250F and then pour it into your prepared pan.
Let sit out until barely warm and then score the candy for later cutting. Run a thin spatula between the unlined sides of the pan and the butterscotch and put it in the fridge to firm up completely.
remove to a cutting board sprayed with cooking spray, and cut into whatever shapes you want. This will make about 65-80 pieces of butterscotch depending on how you cut them.Store covered in fridge.
To make butterscotch sauce, cook ingredients to 260-280F. (The higher the temperature, the firmer it will set up within it cools.
If you cook the ingredients to 305-310 it will be toffee.
