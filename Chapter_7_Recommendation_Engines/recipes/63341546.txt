Ingredients:
4 large tomatoes, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon lime juice
salt and pepper to taste
1 jalapeno pepper, minced

Directions:
In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine tomatoes, onion, cilantro, garlic, lime juice, and salt and pepper to taste.
Mix well.
Add 1/2 of the jalapeno pepper, and taste. If you desire your salsa with more of a kick, add the remaining 1/2 jalapeno. If you are satisfied with the salsa's heat, do not add the remaining jalapeno pepper.
Cover the salsa, and chill until ready to serve.
