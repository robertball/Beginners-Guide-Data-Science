Ingredients:
¾ cup raspberry vinaigrette
2 tablespoons maple syrup
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 pounds venison, cut into 1/2-inch strips
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
¾ cup water
2  sweet onions, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Whisk together the raspberry vinaigrette, maple syrup, and soy sauce in a large bowl. Stir in the venison until well coated, and set aside.
Bring the butter, olive oil, water, onions, and garlic to a boil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until the onions have caramelized to a deep, golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Once the onions have turned dark golden brown, stir in the sugar, and cook 2 to 3 minutes more.
Stir in the venison along with the marinade. Cook and stir until the venison is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes.
