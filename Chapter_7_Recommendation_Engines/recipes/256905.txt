Ingredients:
6 Ball Park® Original Hot Dog Buns
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups finely chopped sweet onion
1 teaspoon jerk or Cajun seasoning
6 hot dogs
8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
4 ounces crushed pineapple, drained (optional)

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium heat.
Whisk garlic powder into mayonnaise and spread onto Ball Park® Hot Dog Buns.
Coat the bottom of a small skillet with olive oil and warm on medium heat.
Add the onion and caramelize by stirring until golden brown.
Add jerk seasoning and remove from heat.
Butterfly the hot dogs by splitting on one side, leaving the other side intact, then grill split-side down until grill marks appear (safe internal temp. 160 degrees F).
Flip hot dogs and add the jerk onions and cheese into each split.
Open each bun and lightly toast opening-side down.
Place each hot dog into a toasted bun and add pineapple or your favorite toppings.
Refrigerate any leftovers.
