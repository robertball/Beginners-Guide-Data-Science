Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/3 cup barbeque sauce (such as Sweet Baby Ray's® Hickory & Brown Sugar)
1 1/2 tablespoons Asian-flavored barbeque seasoning (such as Savory Spice® Asian Delight BBQ Rub)
1 tablespoon caramel sauce
1 pound chicken tenders

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray an 8x8-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
Combine barbeque sauce, barbeque seasoning, and caramel sauce in a shallow dish. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the mixture.
Dip each chicken tender into the barbeque sauce mixture and coat thoroughly. Place in the prepared casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. Baste with reserved sauce and continue baking for 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
These chicken tenders have a barbecue base but are elevated with a decidedly Asian influence. I use Savory Spice® Asian Delight BBQ Rub, which is different from Chinese five-spice.
