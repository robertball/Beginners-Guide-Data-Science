Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
2 red bell peppers (cut into thin strips)
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 pounds fusilli
1/4 pound fontina (grated about 1 cup)
3 ounces mozzarella (grated about 3/4 cup)
6 tablespoons grated parmesan (plus more for serving)
1/4 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper

Directions:
In a medium frying pan, melt one tablespoon of the butter over moderately low heat. Add the bell peppers and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and cook until soft, about 10 minutes.
Heat the broiler. Butter a large shallow baking dish.
In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the fusilli until just done, about 13 minutes. Drain and return to the hot pot. Toss the pasta with the remaining 3 tablespoons butter and 3/4 teaspoon salt, the sauteed bell peppers, the fontina, mozzarella, 3 tablespoons of the parmesan, and black pepper.
Transfer the pasta to the prepared baking dish and sprinkle the remaining 3 tablespoons parmesan over the top. Broil until the top starts to brown, 3-4 minutes. Serve with additional parmesan.
