Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream
2 cups whole milk
13 cardamom pods
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon garam masala
3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
3/4 cup white sugar
6 large egg yolks

Directions:
Combine heavy cream and milk in a deep saucepan over medium-high heat. Add cardamom, cinnamon, vanilla extract, garam masala, nutmeg, and cloves. Whisk lightly and bring to a simmer.
Beat sugar and egg yolks together in a bowl until runny, pale yellow, and falling off the whisk in thick ribbons.
Pour the egg yolk mixture into the saucepan, whisking continuously to avoid scrambling the eggs. Continue whisking the mixture over high heat until it reaches 185 degrees F (85 degrees C), about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely, about 1 hour.
Strain custard through a fine sieve. Pour into the canister of an ice cream maker. Churn until thick and creamy, according to manufacturer's instructions. Serve immediately or store in the freezer.
