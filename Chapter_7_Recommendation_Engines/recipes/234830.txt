Ingredients:
1 roll PillsburyÂ® refrigerated sugar cookie dough
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup vanilla creamy ready-to-spread frosting
64 small pretzel twists
64 semisweet chocolate chips
16 gumdrops, cut in half

Directions:
In large bowl, break up cookie dough. Stir or knead in flour until well blended. Reshape into triangle-shaped log. If too soft to cut into slices, refrigerate up to 30 minutes.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. With thin sharp knife, cut dough into 32 (1/4-inch) triangular slices. On ungreased cookie sheets, place slices 2 inches apart.
Bake 7 to 11 minutes or until set. Cool 1 minute; remove from cookie sheets to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 15 minutes.
Frost cookies with frosting. Place 2 pretzel twists on each triangle near corners for antlers. Lightly press 2 chocolate chips into each cookie for eyes and 1 halved gumdrop for nose. Store between sheets of waxed paper in tightly covered container.
