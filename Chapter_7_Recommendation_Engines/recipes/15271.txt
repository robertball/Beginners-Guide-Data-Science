Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
4 eggs
1 pound confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon anise seed, ground
1 tablespoon anise seed, crushed

Directions:
Sift together the flour and baking powder, set aside. In a large bowl, whip the eggs and sugar until thick and light. Stir in the lemon zest and ground anise. Add the flour mixture, mix well. Cover and chill dough for about an hour.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/2 inch thickness. Traditionally, you would roll over the dough with a springerle rolling pin, but the dough can be cut into small shapes of any kind. Place cookies 1/2 inch apart on baking sheets, sprinkle with anise seed and leave out uncovered, overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake cookies for 25 to 30 minutes.
