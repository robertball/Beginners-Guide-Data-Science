Description: 
My friends in India doesn’t like Mexican food and my Mexican friends don’t care for Indian… but that is no reason not to fuse these two favorite flavors of mine together. So I adapted this from a breakfast dish I recently had in Northern India and added a Mexican twist of a Allrecipes Kind … I’m thrilled the way it turned out and now to share this recipe and have this it in my recipe box as well. It’s healthy and easy and quick to make.
