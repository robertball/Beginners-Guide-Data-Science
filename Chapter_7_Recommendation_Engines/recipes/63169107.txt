https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups flour
1/3 cup pecans, lightly toasted and ground
1/3 sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla powder
2 eggs
1 cup milk
Â½  cup butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
Heat and oil waffle iron.
Combine dry ingredients.
Lightly beat eggs; add milk and butter and whisk to blend.  Stir in dry ingredients and combine until moist, but still slightly lumpy.  Adjust consistency of batter as needed by adding a little more milk or a little more flour.
For extra fluffy waffles, separate eggs and continue as above with egg yolks.  Whip egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Gently fold whipped egg whites into waffle batter just until combined.
Cook in heated waffle iron and enjoy!
For pancakes, add milk to thin the batter, if needed, and cook on a hot griddle (350-375 degrees).
Delicious with Blueberry Vanilla Syrup or maple syrup, sliced bananas and a sprinkling of toasted pecans.

Description: 
Nutty and delicious, especially when topped with blueberry syrup! I included the dry ingredients for these as a mix in a breakfast basket once and everyone requested the recipe.
