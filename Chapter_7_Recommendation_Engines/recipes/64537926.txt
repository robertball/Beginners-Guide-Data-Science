Ingredients:
6 Chicken Tenders
1 Tablespoon Olive Oil
1/2 Teaspoon Kosher Salt
1/4 Teaspoon Pepper
1/4 Teaspoon Granular Garlic Powder

Directions:
1. Preheat grill to surface temperature of about 450 which is medium high on most gas grills and medium on a hot gas grill. Clean and oil the grill surface well.
2. Pat dry 6 (or as many as you need) chicken tenders. Trim the tendon as much as is easy.
3. In a mixing bowl, mix tenders with 1 T olive oil and ¾ tsp of 7:2:2 (or ½ t of kosher salt, ¼ tsp pepper and ¼ t granular garlic powder). Or season any way you want.
4. Place over direct heat. Grill until the chicken turns from a pink color to white along the edge (about 5 minutes). You will see the white moving up the sides. Flip and grill another approximate 4-5 minutes until internal temperature is 165 degrees. Time will vary with size and thickness of the tender and your exact grill temperature.
