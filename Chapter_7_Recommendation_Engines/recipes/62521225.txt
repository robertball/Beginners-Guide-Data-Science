Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 large onions, thinly sliced
1/4 cup barbeque sauce

Directions:
Heat a large skillet to low heat.  Add the olive oil.
Toss the sliced onions in the barbeque sauce.
Cook the onions until soft and brown, stirring every 10 minutes.  This usually takes between 30 minutes and an hour.
Serve with burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches or any grilled meat.
