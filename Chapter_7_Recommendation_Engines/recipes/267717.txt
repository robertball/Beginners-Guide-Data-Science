Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/8 cup chopped onion
1/8 cup chopped cooked bacon
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 tablespoon hamburger seasoning
1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste
3 slices Muenster cheese, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
12 slider-size burger buns, split

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and bacon. Cook until onions are browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
Form turkey into 12 small patties. Season both sides of each patty with hamburger seasoning, garlic salt, and pepper.
Add patties to skillet on top of the onion and bacon. Cook for 3 minutes. Flip and cook for 2 minutes more. Scatter Muenster cheese on top and let melt. Cook until cheese is melted and meat reaches desired doneness, about 2 minutes more. If desired, add buns to the pan and let steam while patties cook.
Remove patties, place between buns, and spoon onion and bacon on top.
