Ingredients:
1 cup shortening
1 cup white sugar
6 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons anise extract
4 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening, sugar and eggs until smooth. Stir in the anise extract. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the wet ingredients. Scoop out spoonfuls and roll into balls. Place balls 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until light brown. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Frost when cool if desired.
