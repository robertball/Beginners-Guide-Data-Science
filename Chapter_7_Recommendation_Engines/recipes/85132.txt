Description: 
After finding tons of recipes calling for ginger-garlic paste, but only finding ginger paste or garlic paste, but not both, at local grocery stores, I decided to find a recipe for it myself.  Basically it is just equal amounts of ginger root and garlic pulsed together.  Store in the refrigerator or freezer. You may use water in place of the oil, but it will not keep as long.
