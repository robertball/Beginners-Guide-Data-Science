Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup minced onion
1/4 cup chopped poblano chile pepper
8 ounces extra-lean ground beef
4 ounces chorizo sausage
1 1/2 tablespoons red enchilada dry seasoning (such as Savory Spice Shop® Canyon Road)
1 tablespoon tomato powder (such as Savory Spice Shop®)
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup ketchup
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 avocado, sliced (optional)
1/2 cup shredded Oaxaca cheese, or to taste (optional)
4 hamburger bun, split and toasted

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion and poblano pepper until softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to a plate. Add ground beef and chorizo to the skillet. Cook, stirring often to break up meat, until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add enchilada seasoning and tomato powder. Add water, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce. Return cooked onion mixture to the skillet. Simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes more.
Serve meat mixture on toasted buns topped with Oaxaca cheese and avocado.
