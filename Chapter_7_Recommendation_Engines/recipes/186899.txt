Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 yellow onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 (4 inch) cinnamon stick
salt and pepper to taste
1 pound butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 2-inch cubes
4 large red potatoes, cut into 2-inch cubes
2 cups vegetable broth
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can canned diced tomatoes with their juice
1 cup pitted, brine-cured green olives
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1 3/4 cups water
1 (10 ounce) box uncooked couscous
6 tablespoons plain yogurt
6 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large covered saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat, until oil is hot but not smoking. Drop in the onion, garlic, cumin, cinnamon stick, and salt and pepper. Cook and stir for 5 minutes, until onion is tender and translucent.
Stir in the butternut squash and potato cubes, broth, garbanzo beans, and tomatoes, and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat, cover the pot, and simmer about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the squash and potatoes are tender. Remove the stew from heat, and stir in the olives and lemon zest.
In a large saucepan, bring 1 3/4 cup water to a boil. Stir in couscous. Cover and remove from the heat; let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork; cool.  Serve stew over cooked couscous. Garnish each serving with a dollop of yogurt and a sprinkle of cilantro leaves.
