Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups quick cooking oats
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup butter flavored shortening, melted
1 tablespoon water
1 (16 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce
2 tablespoons cornstarch
5 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together the oats, brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon. Stir in the melted shortening and water to form a crumbly mixture.
In a large saucepan, mix together the cranberry sauce and cornstarch. Bring to a boil, and then remove from heat. Stir in the apples. Spread into an 8x8 inch glass baking dish. Crumble the oat mixture over the apples.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the apples are tender. Serve warm.
