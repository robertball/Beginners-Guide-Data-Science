Ingredients:
Crust
44 Reduced-Fat Chocolate Wafers, crushed
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
Filling
3 (8 ounce) packages reduced-fat cream cheese
3/4 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
2 eggs
2 egg whites
1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup reduced-fat sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla
1 1/4 teaspoons instant espresso crystals
2 (.55 ounce) packages Sugar-Free Swiss Miss Instant Cocoa Mix

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Mix crust ingredients together, and press into a 9-inch springform pan.  Place pan on a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool to room temperature.
Reset oven temperature to 325 degrees F.
Beat cream cheese and SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener together until well mixed and smooth.  Add eggs, egg whites, cornstarch and salt. Mix until smooth. Add sour cream and vanilla; mix until well blended.
Measure 1/2 cup of the cheesecake batter and pour into a small bowl.  Add instant espresso crystals and cocoa mix.  Stir until well combined.
Pour half of plain batter over crust. Top with half of the coffee batter by placing rounded spoonfuls over the cheesecake batter.  Gently swirl the coffee batter into plain batter with the tip of knife or spatula.  Repeat with remaining batters.
Bake 45-50 minutes or until center is almost set.  Remove from oven and gently run metal spatula around rim of pan to loosen cheesecake (this helps prevent cracking).  Let cool 20-25 minutes before covering and placing in the refrigerator.  Refrigerate 4- 6 hours or overnight before serving.
