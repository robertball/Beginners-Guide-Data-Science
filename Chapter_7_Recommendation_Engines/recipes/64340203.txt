Ingredients:
3 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts(frozen)
1 package of Swanson's Cream Starter(Traditional)
2 Tablespoons Italian Seasoning
2 16 ounce bags frozen mixed vegetables(carrots, green beans, lima bean, corn, mix)
1 can Campbell's Golden Mushroom Soup
Chicken Broth

Directions:
1. Set up 6-7 quart slow cooker. Set on low.
2. Place frozen chicken breast in slow cooker
3. Pour Swanson's Cream Starter on top of chicken
4. Sprinkle seasoning on top.
5. Cover and slow cook for at least overnight(at
least 10 hours)
6. Remove lid after cooking and shred chicken in the
cooker.
7. Mix the 2 bags of frozen mixed vegetables with
the chicken.
8. If dry, pour about 1/2 cup(more if desired)of the
chicken broth.
9. Cover and cook for another 2 to 3 hours on low
This can be made up in two stages if needed. Making up the chicken and starter and shredding ahead of time and then just refrigerating the crock. Remove and put in remaining ingredients and cook on low for 3 hours.
This is delicious and got rave reviews at my church's covered dish this week. Try it and let me know what you all think!
