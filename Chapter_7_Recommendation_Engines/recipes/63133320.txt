Ingredients:
1 store bough pizza dough (phillsbury works too)
1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese
2 ripe bananas
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 Tbsp cinnamon

Directions:
Open your pizza dough per manufacturer's instructions.
Sprinkle the cheese on top of the dough.
Slice the bananas and layer them on top of the cheese.
In a bowl, mix the sugar and cinnamon together and sprinkle this mixture evenly on top of the pizza. Make sure you cover the whole pizza.
Bake at 350F for approx. 10-15 minutes, or until you can see the sugar on top is almost entirely caramelized. You may turn on the broiler if your dough is ready before the sugar.
After you fall head over heals with this recipe, you can try quicker versions with pitta bread, but do it on real pizza dough the first time. It's worth the extra prep time.
