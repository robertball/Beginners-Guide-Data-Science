Ingredients:
half of medium-size sweet yellow onion, chopped
2 large cans of whole, peeled San Marzano tomatoes
1 can San Marzano tomato sauce
3T basil pesto
1/2 cup Jamaican dark rum
1 tsp dry Italian seasoning
extra virgin olive oil
sea salt
freshly cracked or coarsely ground black pepper

Directions:
Strain whole tomatoes into a colander.
Squeeze them with the hand to remove most of their interior liquid and seeds.
Set the hand-crushed tomatoes aside.
Reserve tomato liquid for use later.
In a pot, saut√© chopped onion in a liberal amount of olive oil for 5 minutes on medium-high heat.
Carefully add hand-crushed tomatoes to the oil and cook with onions for 2 minutes.
Add dry Italian seasoning.
Add San Marzano tomato sauce, basil pesto, and dark rum.
Cover and let simmer for 30 minutes.
Use a wire whisk to bring the marinara together to the consistency you desire.
Heavy whisking will lead to a pizza sauce.
Whisking to incorporate will yield a traditional marinara.

Toasted Garlic
Description: 
Great ingedients come together quickly to make a basil marinara that is to die for -- I first used it with fried crawfish.
