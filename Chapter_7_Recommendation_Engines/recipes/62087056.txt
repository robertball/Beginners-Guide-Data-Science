Ingredients:
1/2 lb. almonds (1 2/3 cups)
2/3 cup water, divided
1 cup sugar
2 Tbsp. corn syrup
1 tsp. almond extract

Directions:
Spread the almonds on a baking sheet at toast at 325 degrees for 5 minutes.  Pour the hot almonds in a food processor with 2 Tbsp. of the water and process until very finely ground.
Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and the rest of the water (generous 1/2 cup) in a small saucepan.  Cook over medium-high heat, frequently wiping the sides of the pan with wet paper towels in order to prevent crystalization (watch for hidden sugar grains on the spoon, too).  Boil until the mixture reaches soft ball stage (240 degrees).
Turn the food processor on again and pour the hot syrup over the ground nuts.  Quickly, before the paste forms into one big ball, add the almond extract.
Transfer the almond paste to a bowl and allow to cool.  Store tightly covered in the refrigerator, for up to a month (although good luck letting it last that long).  Enjoy!

Description: 
This is the only recipe I've found (and I've made lots) that's spot-on for what's in Europe.  You can use blanched almonds for even-colored almond paste, but I think the skins add a lot to the taste.
