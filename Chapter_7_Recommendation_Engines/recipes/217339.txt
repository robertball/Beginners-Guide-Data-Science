Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 tablespoon water
1/3 cup dry bread crumbs
1/3 cup instant mashed potato flakes
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
4 (4 ounce) fillets walleye

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Beat the eggs and water together in a bowl until smooth; set aside. Combine the bread crumbs, potato flakes, and Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl with the seasoned salt until evenly mixed. Dip the walleye fillets into the beaten egg, then press into the bread crumb mixture. Place onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the fish is opaque in the center and flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.

Crispy breaded fish without frying! My husband only likes deep-fried fish, and he loves this. Feel free to use your favorite seasonings. You can also use tilapia or other white fish fillets.
