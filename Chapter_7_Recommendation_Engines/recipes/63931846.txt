Ingredients:
4 thin-sliced chicken breasts
4 hamburger or Kaiser rolls
1 cup Italian Panko bread crumbs
3 tablespoons peanut or olive oil
2 green onions sliced thin
4 slices deli cheese (Cheddar or American)
Mayonnaise or Ranch dressing
Shredded lettuce
Sliced tomato
Salt and pepper

Directions:
Cut each chicken piece in half.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then coat generously with Panko crumbs, pressing crumbs on chicken.
In a large skillet, heat oil on medium-high heat.  Fry chicken on one side until browned and crispy (approximately 5 minutes).  Turn each piece over.  Place green onions on half of the pieces and top with 1 slice of cheese.  Fry until golden brown and chicken is done.
Coat both sides of roll with mayo or Ranch dressing.  Place one cheese and onion covered breast half on roll and top with plain breaded breast half.
Add toppings of your choice (shredded lettuce, tomato, pickle, etc).
