Ingredients:
2 c leftover rice
1 T oil
1/2 T ginger paste
1/4 c onion, chopped
1 tsp cumin seed

Directions:
Heat oil over a medium heat.  Add the cumin seeds.
When they begin to brown, immediately add the ginger, minced chilis, and onion.
Cook, stirring, until the onions begin to soften and brown.
Add the turmeric and stir well.  Cook for another minute or 2.
Add the rice, "declumping" if necessary (break any clumps of rice up) and stir well to distribute the spices.
Increase heat to medium high and stir-fry as you would for "normal" fried rice, stirring constantly.  Add a T or 2 of water as needed in lieu of the moisture that would usually be provided by soy sauce.
Stir fry like this for about 5 mins.  Remove from heat and serve.
