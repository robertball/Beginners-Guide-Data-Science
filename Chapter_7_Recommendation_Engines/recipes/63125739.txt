Ingredients:
4 Cups Flour
1/2 Cup Bacon Grease or lard
2 Teaspoons Salt
1 Cup Water

Directions:
Combine flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Work bacon grease into flour mixture with your fingers until mixture resembles coarse corn meal.
Make a well in center of flour mixture. Add water and stir to combine. Form dough into a ball. If mixture is to dry add more water. Knead for three minutes on a floured board.
Divide into twelve balls. Cover and let sit for twenty minutes.
Roll each ball on a floured pastry cloth to a 7 to 8 inch circle; trim if necessary.
Stack tortillas between sheets of waxed paper until all are rolled.
Bake on an ungreased, moderately hot griddle until edges dry and brown flakes appear, approx. 2 minutes. Turn and bake 1 minute more.
Wrap tortillas in foil to keep them warm until all are cooked.
