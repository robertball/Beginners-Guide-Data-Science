Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 cup milk
1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard
1 (16 ounce) package FarmlandÂ® Deli-Style Sliced Ham
4 slices Swiss cheese
1/2 cup arugula or spinach leaves
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
In a medium bowl stir together the flour, sugar, basil, baking powder, and salt. Add egg, milk, shredded cheese, and oil. Stir just until moistened. Add batter to a preheated, lightly greased waffle iron and bake according to manufacturer's directions. When done, use a fork to lift waffle off waffle iron. Repeat with remaining batter. You should have 8 4-inch waffles.
For each sandwich, spread waffles with mustard. Layer ham, sliced cheese, and arugula on half of the waffles. Top with remaining waffles, spread side down.
Heat a griddle or 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add butter until melted. Add sandwiches. Cook for 4 minutes or until cheese is melted, turning once.
