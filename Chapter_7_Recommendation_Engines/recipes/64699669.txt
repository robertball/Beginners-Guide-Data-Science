Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds FROZEN boneless chicken breast
1 medium onion quartered and sliced
1 cup brown sugar
2/3 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 Tbsp lemon juice
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
3-4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (or more to taste)
2 Tbsp corn starch
2 Tbsp cold water
sesame seeds and green onions for garnish if desired

Directions:
Place chicken in pressure cooker along with the sliced onion.
Stir together vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, lime juice, sesame oil, black pepper, ginger, garlic and chili flakes.
Pour mixture over the chicken and onions.
Place lid on your pressure cooker and make sure your pressure release valve is set to closed. Press manual and adjust the time for 40 minutes. Allow to complete cycle and pressure release naturally. Remove lid and turn pressure cooker off. Remove chicken from the juices. Combine cornstarch and water and stir into pot to thicken. Turn instant pot on to saute and stir until thickened. Serve sauce over chicken and enjoy over rice or noodles. We love this over fried rice!
*optional, after I thickened my sauce, I brushed some of it over the chicken and stuck it under the broiler for a minute or 2.
*I have not tried this with fresh chicken breast but have heard mixed reviews. If you try it, the recommended cook time is 20 minutes. Let me know how it turns out for you!
