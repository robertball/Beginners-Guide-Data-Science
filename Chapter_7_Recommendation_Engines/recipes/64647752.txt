Ingredients:
4 cups fresh strawberries, hulled, and quartered
4 to 5 stalks fresh rhubarb, diced (about 4 cups)
1 cup granulated sugar, or more to taste (divided use)
2 Tbsp cornstarch
1 1/2 tsp grated orange zest
1/4	cup fresh orange juice
8 Tbsp	(1 stick) cold butter
1/2	cup flour
1/2	cup granola
1/2	cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1/4	tsp salt
Vanilla ice cream (optional), for serving

Directions:
Place the strawberries and rhubarb in a nonreactive bowl and toss with 1/2 cup granulated sugar (or more if the rhubarb is especially tart), the cornstarch, orange zest, and orange juice. Tip into 10" cast iron skillet.
In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, combine the butter, flour, granola, the remaining 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, the brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt.
Pulse until the mixture is coarse and crumbly. The butter should form pea-size pieces. Spoon evenly over the fruit in the skillet.
Set up the grill for indirect grilling and preheat to medium-high.
Place the skillet in the center of the hot grate away from the heat and cover the grill. Cook the crisp until the filling is bubbling and the topping is nicely browned, 40 to 60 minutes. Let the crisp cool for a few minutes. Serve with ice cream, if desired.
