Ingredients:
1 cup tomato, chopped
1/2 cup frozen spinach, thawed
1/2 jar mushroom spaghetti sauce
2 veggie burgers, microwaved and crumbled
1 cup red skinned potatoes, diced
1 stalk broccoli, cut in small pieces
1 tbs minced garlic
2 tbs Smart Balance or butter
3 tbs soy milk
1/4 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
italian seasoning
onion powder
salt
pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the potatoes and broccoli.
While the potatoes and broccoli are cooking, combine the spinach and tomatoes with 1/4 cup spaghetti sauce as the first layer in a glass baking dish.
Add the veggie burger on top, and spread the remaining spaghetti sauce over that.
Drain the water from the potatoes and broccoli. Mash them together in a bowl with a potato masher until fairly smooth. Add in the garlic, butter, milk, italian seasoning, onion powder, salt and pepper.
Spread the potato and broccoli mixture on top of the rest of the dish. Sprinkle with mozzarella and italian seasoning.
Bake for about 35 minutes, or until the cheese starts bubbling on top.
