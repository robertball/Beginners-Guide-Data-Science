1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup soft margarine
1/4 cup peanut butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
3/4 cup peanut butter

Directions:
In small bowl blend flour, cocoa and baking soda.  Mix until well blended.
In large bowl beat white and brown sugars, butter or margarine and 1/4 cup peanut butter, until light and fluffy.  Add vanilla and egg, beat. Stir in flour mixture until blended.  Set aside.
To make Filling:  Combine confectioner's sugar and 3/4 cup peanut butter.  Blend well.
Roll filling into 30 1-inch balls.  For each cookie, with floured hands, shape about 1 tablespoon of dough around 1 peanut butter ball, covering completely.  Place 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Flatten with glass dipped in white sugar.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 7-9 minutes. When cookies are done, they should be set and slightly cracked.
