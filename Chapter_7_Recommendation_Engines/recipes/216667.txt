Ingredients:
2 slices bacon
8 cups water
2 cups dry pinto beans
1/2 pound kielbasa sausage, cut into bite-size pieces (optional)
1 (15 ounce) can ranch-style beans
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1/2 cup dried minced onion
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons pickled jalapeno peppers
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
2 teaspoons ground paprika
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 cup chopped green onion

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat; crumble bacon when cool.
Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan, and stir in pinto beans. Simmer over medium-low heat until the beans soften, about 30 minutes; pour beans and water into a slow cooker. Stir in the bacon and bacon drippings, kielbasa, ranch-style beans, tomato paste, dried onion, apple cider vinegar, pickled jalapeno, sugar, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika. Set the cooker to Low, and cook until pinto beans are very tender, 9 to 10 hours.
About 5 minutes before serving, stir in chopped green pepper. Serve topped with chopped green onion.
