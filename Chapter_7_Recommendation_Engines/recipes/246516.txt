Ingredients:
1 pound pizza dough
1/2 cup pizza sauce, divided
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
16 slices pepperoni

Directions:
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Roll pizza dough to 1/2-inch thickness on a flat work surface. Cut dough into 16 rounds using a 2-inch cutter. Press rounds out with your fingers until each measures about 3 inches across.
Spoon 1 teaspoon pizza sauce into the center of 8 rounds. Top each with 2 teaspoons mozzarella cheese and 1 slice of pepperoni. Cover with remaining 8 rounds, pressing around edges to seal.
Cook the sealed rounds, in batches, on the preheated waffle iron until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Top each one with another pepperoni slice and a little more mozzarella cheese. Close waffle iron and continue cooking until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes more.

Description: 
Pizza made in the waffle iron! It's so fun to make and perfect for a busy weeknight or quick snack. I use pre-made pizza dough but your favorite homemade recipe will work just fine. Add more cheese and pepperoni if you like, it's a very versatile recipe (plus the crispy, cheesy bits are my favorite). Serve with more pizza sauce for dipping. I hope you enjoy it!
