Ingredients:
12 Hard-boiled eggs
Liquid food coloring (neon is fun)

Directions:
First thing you need is a bunch of hard boiled eggs.
After the eggs are cooked, cooled, and dry, gently tap them on the counter top.  You want to create little cracks all over the egg.  Itâ€™s okay if a few small pieces of shell fall off, but try to avoid breaking large chunks off.
You should just have small tiny cracks all over.  In fact after you make a few taps on the counter, you can even gently squeeze the egg in your hand to crack the shell.
Use liquid food coloring to tint your water (6-8 drops), and plop your eggs in.
Let them sit in the fridge overnight (IKEA kid cups work well). Remove the eggs from the water the next day, rinse them off and gently remove the shells, revealing the dino designs inside!
