Ingredients:
Cookies:
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 1/4 cups dark brown sugar, packed
1/4 cup mild molasses
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, peeled and grated
1 egg
2 teaspoons coarse sea salt
Icing (Optional):
1 cup powdered sugar
1/2 tablespoon butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon light corn syrup
1 tablespoon milk, or more as needed

Directions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, allspice and cloves; set aside. With an electric mixer, cream together 3/4 cup butter and brown sugar until fluffy. Add molasses and ginger; mix. Add egg; beat until blended. On low speed, slowly add flour and spice mixture, beating until blended. Divide dough in half; shape each half into a flat round. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. On lightly floured surface, roll 1 dough round to 1/4-inch thickness dusting with additional flour, as necessary, so dough does not stick. Cut dough into desired shapes and place on prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle cutouts with salt; press lightly to adhere salt.
Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until slightly darker in color. Remove to a cooling rack; cool completely (cookies will crisp as they cool). Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
For Icing: In a medium bowl, whisk powdered sugar, butter, corn syrup and 1 tablespoon milk until smooth. Slowly add additional milk, if necessary, for desired consistency. Drizzle over cookies; let stand until icing is set.

Real Butter
Description: 
Gingerbread cookies are a holiday classic that everyone looks forward to. Add a sprinkling of sea salt and you get a crunchy contrast against the rich texture and flavor that only real butter can deliver.
