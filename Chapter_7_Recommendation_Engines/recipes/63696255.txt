Ingredients:
2 Boneless Pork Chops
2 Shallots, sliced
1 Onion, sliced
1 tbs Butter
1 tbs Olive Oil
1 tbs Chicken Stock
2 tbs White Cooking Wine
Italian Seasoning (oregano, basil & thyme)
1/4 tsp thyme
2 tsp lemon
2 tbs Horseradish Mustard
1 Cup of Cream (half & half)

Directions:
preheat oven to 350
Season your chops with salt and pepper, oregano, basil & thyme.
Heat butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high. When the butter is hot and begins to foam, arrange the chops in the skillet. Cook, turning only once, about 3 mins each side until they are a rich golden brown. Reduce heat to low. Remove chops, put in oven dish and bake for 10-15 mins.
Cook shallots in the remaining butter/oil over moderate heat, stirring until softened, 3 to 5 minutes.
De-glaze pan with chicken stock/wine enough to cover the bottom and let it bubble. Add two heaping tablespoons of horseradish mustard, (fresh) thyme, 2 tsp lemon, and a cup of cream, whisking until smooth.
Serve with greens (salad with oil/vinegarette dressing, goat cheese, tomato & crumbled bacon)
