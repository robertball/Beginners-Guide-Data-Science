1 clove of garlic - rough chopped
1 cup blanched almonds
1 1/2 cups cold water
1/2 cup olive oil
1 cup stale (white bread with crusts removed) cubed
1 tbs sherry vinegar (I used Chianti vinegar b/c thats what I had)
cantaloupe (approx 2 cups) - diced into small cubes (or if you have a small melon baller even better) Honeydew melon can be substituted
salt - to taste
cracked pepper - for garnish

Directions:
Soak bread in cold water for a few mins. to soften, then discard water and ring out remaining liquids before adding the bread to the rest of the ingredients.  Add everything but the cantaloupe into blender (or use immersion blender) and blend until smooth.
SERVE: in martini glasses with a few tbs of chopped cantaloupe drizzle of good olive oil and cracked pepper.
