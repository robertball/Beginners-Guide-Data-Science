Ingredients:
1/4 cup flour (to make gluten-free use 2 tbsp cornstarch instead)
2 cups water
4 cups fat free milk
1 large celery stalk, chopped
1/2 medium chopped onion
8 oz sliced baby portobello mushrooms
2 chicken bouillons
fresh ground pepper
pinch of thyme
10 oz frozen classic mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, green beans, corn)
2 potatoes, peeled and cubed small
16 oz cooked chicken breast, diced small
salt

Directions:
Create a slurry by combining 1/2 cup of the cold water with flour in a medium bowl and whisk until well blended. Set aside.
Pour remaining water and milk into a large pot and slowly bring to a boil.
Add celery, onion, mushrooms, chicken bullion, thyme, fresh pepper, frozen vegetables and return to a boil.
Partially cover and simmer on low until vegetables are soft, about 20 minutes.
Remove lid, add potatoes and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.
Add chicken, and slowly whisk in slurry, stirring well as you add.
Cook another 2-3 minutes, until soup thickens, adjust salt and pepper to taste and serve.
