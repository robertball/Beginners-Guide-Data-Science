Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups water
1 cup jasmine rice
1 cube beef bouillon
5 kaffir lime leaves
14 ounces lean ground beef
1 cup torn cilantro leaves
1 cup torn mint leaves
1/2 cup sliced green onions
1/4 cup lime juice
1/4 cup chopped green chile peppers
4 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce, divided
1 (12 ounce) package firm tofu, drained and cut into 1-inch cubes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large red onion, sliced

Directions:
Bring 1 3/4 cups water to a boil. Add rice, beef bouillon, and lime leaves. Boil for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, for 10 minutes. Turn off heat and let rice stand for 10 minutes. Spread onto a platter and let cool completely, at least 40 minutes.
In the meantime, marinate beef with cilantro, mint, green onions, lime juice, chile peppers, and 2 tablespoons soy sauce for up to 1 hour. Marinate tofu in the remaining soy sauce.
Heat oil in a wok over high heat. Add red onion; cook for 1 minute, then add marinated beef. Saute until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Discard lime leaves from the cooled rice and toss rice into the wok. Stir-fry for 2 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Add tofu, stir gently, and fry for 3 minutes more. Serve hot.
