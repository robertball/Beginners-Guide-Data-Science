Description: 
I just love lentils and marinara so it was a quick decision to marry the two of them in this zucchini dish!  I love to drizzle my dish with a little extra virgin olive oil then sprinkle some freshly grated parmesan cheese.

Cindy's Note:  Before using the lentils pour into a colander and rinse then go through them with your hands to pick out any bad lentils.
