Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup cornstarch
Colored sugar (optional)

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and confectioners' sugar. Combine flour and cornstarch; add to creamed mixture and mix well.
Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls 3 in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets (cookies will spread). Sprinkle with colored sugar if desired. Bake at 325 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until edges are lightly browned and tops are set. Cool for 2 minutes before carefully removing to wire racks.
