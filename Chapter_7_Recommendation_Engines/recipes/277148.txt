Ingredients:
1 pound bulk pork sausage
1 1/4 cups baking mix (such as Bisquick Â®)
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (8 ounce) package shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Blend sausage, baking mix, cream cheese, and Cheddar cheese together using the dough hook attachment of an electric stand mixer on very low speed until well combined, 2 to 3 minutes.
Roll into 1-inch balls and place on a rimmed baking stone.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and no longer pink in the centers, 22 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
Sausage balls are an entertaining standby for me, but they were always admittedly a little dry - until I tried adding cream cheese, and better balls were born. I'll never go back!
