Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix
1 cup water*
1/3 cup vegetable oil*
3 eggs*
1 cup ready-made dark chocolate frosting
1 cup Kahlua
6 ounces chocolate disks for melting
Optional:
2 ounces white chocolate disks for melting

Directions:
Prepare the cake mix according to package directions.  Allow cake to cool for one hour.
Crumble cake into a large bowl. Mix in Kahlua.  Add frosting and stir until combined.  Mixture will be sticky.  Cover and refrigerate 2 hours or overnight.
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.  Use a melon baller to form 2 inch bites; place on waxed paper.  Freeze bites for one hour or until firm enough to coat.
Using a skewer, pick up bites one at a time and dip into melted chocolate.  Use another skewer to slide bite onto the lined cookie sheet. Allow bites to set in refrigerator.
Optional:  After bites have set, use a pastry bag fitted with a #3 tip to drizzle melted white chocolate.
