Ingredients:
4 oz bittersweet chocolate, chopped
¾ cup butter, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
2 eggs
1 Tbsp. vanilla
2 cups all-purpose flour
½ cup cocoa powder
1 tsp. baking powder
½ tsp. each baking soda and salt
3 chocolate-covered caramel bars (such as Caramilk, chilled)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375F.
In bowl over saucepan of hot (not bowling) water, melt chocolate, stirring occasionally; let cool.
In large bowl, beat butter with sugar until fluffy, beat in eggs, 1 at a time. Beat in vanilla, then melted chocolate.
In separate bowl, whisk flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt; stir into butter mixture until combined. Cover; refrigerate for 30 minutes or until firm enough to shape.
Break each chocolate bar into 10 pieces. Roll dough by heaping tablespoonfuls into balls; flatten and place 1 piece of chocolate in center. Seal dough around chocolate. Place, seam side down, on parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Bake in center of oven for 10 minutes or until edges are firm and centers are still soft. Let cool on pan on rack for 2 minutes. Transfer to rack; let cool completely. (Make-ahead: Store in airtight container for up to 1 day or overwrap and freeze for up to 2 weeks.)
