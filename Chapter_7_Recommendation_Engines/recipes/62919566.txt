Ingredients:
Ham bone with some meat still on it (usually leftover from a holiday meal)
8 cups chicken broth (I use water and powdered bouillon base)
2 cups lentils
1/2 onion, chopped
1 green pepper, chopped
1 cup chopped carrots
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 tsp marjoram
1/4 tsp crushed bay leaves

Directions:
Put bone and broth (or water, add bullion when boiling) into stock pot, bring to a boil.
Reduce heat, add lentils, and simmer about 10 minutes.
Add onion, green pepper, carrots, celery and seasonings, simmer about 10 minutes more, until lentils and vegetables are tender. Turn off heat.
Remove ham bone from pot, then cut meat from bone.  Cube meat and add it back to the soup. Discard bone, enjoy soup. :)

Description: 
I originally called this my 'experimental lentil' soup, patching together various other lentil soup recipes. I've been making it every fall for a decade now. What's listed here is a single recipe, though I can't remember the last time I've made such a small batch. It's great for freezing in individual servings for lunches.
