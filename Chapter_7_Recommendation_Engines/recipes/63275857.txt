Ingredients:
1 box gemelli pasta, or other spirals such as rotini
3 med-large cooked boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced small
1 large tomato, diced small
1 bunch asparagus
1/2 c pine nuts
1/4 - 1/3 c butter
1 T butter
splash olive oil
1-1.5 c half and half
1-1.5 c shredded Italian blend cheese
1/2 tsp minced garlic
1/2 tsp salt
garlic salt to taste

Directions:
Boil pasta with salt until done.  Meanwhile, grill asparagus on George Foreman or other grill until crisp tender, and slice into 1/2-3/4 in. pieces.
In a large nonstick sauce pan, saute pine nuts in 1 T butter until lightly browned; remove.  Add splash of olive oil; saute tomatoes; remove. Add garlic and saute about a min, being careful not to burn garlic.
To make sauce, add butter to sauteed garlic, then stir in half and half.  Add cheese, stirring until melted over low heat.  Determine by sauce thickness if more cheese or cream is needed (for 8 servings pasta, I use 1.5 cups each); add to taste and stir until melted and heated throughout.  Add diced cooked chicken, asparagus, tomatoes and pine nuts to cream sauce, stirring until heated through.
Drain pasta and return to pot.  Pour in sauce; stir gently and taste for seasoning.  Add garlic salt to taste if desired.
