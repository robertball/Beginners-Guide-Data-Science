Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package whole cranberries
1 small unpeeled orange, sliced
1 1/3 cups white sugar
1/2 cup pecan pieces
1/4 cup orange juice
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground mace
1 (40 ounce) can cut yams, drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine cranberries, orange slices, sugar, pecans, orange juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and mace in a 2-quart baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until cranberries soften, about 30 minutes. Stir yams into cranberry mixture and continue baking until heated through, about 15 minutes more.

Description: 
My father's mother made this every year for our Thanksgiving dinner. It is not Thanksgiving to me without this dish. I do not like the tartness of most cranberry dishes, and sweet potatoes can be bland by themselves. This dish combines both to make a great all-in-one dish. When I take this dish to another person's home, I bake the first time and add the yams, cover, and then wait to heat until I am at their house.
