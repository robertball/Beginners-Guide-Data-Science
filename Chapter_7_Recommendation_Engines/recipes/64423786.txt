Description: 
I have the plant that grew from a cutting of my Grandmothers rhubarb plant she had growing in her garden 50 years ago and this is the recipe she gave me to help use all that vegetable up (yes, it is a vegetable).  You can easily change out the raspberries for another type of fruit ie: peaches or strawberries.
