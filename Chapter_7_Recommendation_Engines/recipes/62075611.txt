Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs. fresh green beans, picked over
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 medium sweet onion, chopped
6 slices pepper bacon, rough chopped
1 heaping tablespoon minced garlic
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
salt & pepper

Directions:
Bring several quarts of salted water to a boil and add green beans.  Boil for 5 minutes. Drain, and set beans aside.
Place a large saute pan on medium high heat.  Carefully add oil and heat for several seconds.  Add onion, garlic,and bacon, and saute until onion is opaque and bacon cooking but not crisp, about 5 minutes.  Add green beans to mix and saute for additional 10 minutes, stiring frequently.  Add balsamic vinegar, cover, and turn heat down to low, about 10 additional minutes.  The balsamic vinegar will reduce, thicken and begin to carmelize the beans. Salt and pepper to taste.
