Greek Flair Anaheim Peppers Recipe

Ingredients:
3 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 lb ground lamb
1 cup chopped mushrooms
1 whole onion, yellow or white, chopped
1 tsp rosemary leaves
1/2 tsp dill
salt and pepper to taste
5 oz Goat Cheese
6 large Anaheim Peppers
1 lb sliced bacon

Directions:
Pour olive oil in a large skillet and cook the ground lamb, mushrooms, onions, rosemary leaves and dill until meat is browned. Turn heat off and let sit for aprx 1 minute, then press the goat cheese into the mixture. The heat of the mixture will soften goat cheese and allow it to mix thoroughly. Salt and pepper the mixture to taste.
You can prepare the peppers while the stuffing mixture is cooking. Remove the stems and make a lengthwise cut down the sides. Clean out the innards.
Stuff peppers with the mixture from the skillet. Wrap the peppers with bacon strips, making sure to cover the openings in the peppers where you slit them open (the bacon will keep the inside mixture from oozing out while baking).
Place a wire rack on a cookie sheet - this will keep the peppers off the cookie sheet so they don't get soggy from the bacon drippings. Place the peppers on the wire rack and bake at 325 to 350 until bacon is fully cooked.
Helpful hint - if you want your bacon crispier, pre-cook it a bit before wrapping around the peppers. Just make sure you don't pre-cook it so much that it can't wrap around the peppers.
The leftovers taste great for lunch the next day.

Description: 
This was an experiment that my roommates went nuts over. Anaheim peppers stuffed with lamb, goat cheese, onions and mushrooms. Wrapped in bacon because, well, everything's better with bacon.
