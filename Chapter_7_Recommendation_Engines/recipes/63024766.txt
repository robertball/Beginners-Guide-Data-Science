Ingredients:
4 cups (13 1/2 ounces) whole wheat pastry flour
2 to 3 tablespoons (7/8 to 1 1/4 ounces) sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) buttermilk
2 tablespoons (7/8 ounce) vegetable oil or melted butter (1 ounce)

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, salt, baking soda and baking powder.
Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the buttermilk and the oil or butter.
Stir together until blended—some lumps will remain.
Turn the dough out onto a floured board and knead about 10 times, or until it all holds together.
Form it into a large ball and place it on a lightly greased baking sheet. Cut a deep cross in the top.
Bake the bread in a preheated 400°F oven for approximately 40 minutes, or until it tests done (a cake tester inserted into the center will come out clean.)
Yield: 1 large round loaf, 10 to 12 inches in diameter.
