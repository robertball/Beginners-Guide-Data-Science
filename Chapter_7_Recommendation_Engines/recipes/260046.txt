Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 tablespoon water
1/2 cup molasses
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup quick-cooking oats
3 cups bread flour
2 1/4 teaspoons bread machine yeast
1 tablespoon quick-cooking oats, or to taste

Directions:
Place 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon water, molasses, oil, sugar, salt, 1 cup oats, bread flour, and yeast in a bread machine in the order listed. Run "Dough" cycle.
Remove dough from the bread machine. Shape into a round loaf, tucking ends in underneath. Transfer to a baking sheet and cover loosely with lightly oiled plastic wrap. Let rise until puffy, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Uncover dough and sprinkle 1 tablespoon oats on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes.
