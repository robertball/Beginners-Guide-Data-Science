Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons butter
1/4 cup chopped shallots
1 pound sliced mushrooms
1 teaspoon salt
8 ounces chive and onion cream cheese
3 packages mini phyllo cups

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Arrange phyllo cups on baking sheet.  Put aside.
In a large skillet, melt butter.  Add the chopped shallots and cook 1 to 2 minutes, until soft.  Add the mushrooms and salt and cook until all liquid has evaporated, about 8 - 10 minutes.  Let mixture cool a bit.
Transfer the mushroom mixture to a food processor, fitted with the steel blade.  Pulse until finely chopped.  Add the cream cheese and process until smooth.
Spoon filling into phyllo dough cups.  Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
These are so good and easy!  My family has been making these for quite some time.  The cream cheese and mushroom flavors are to die for.  The pre-formed mini phyllo cups make this a breeze to make. I suggest using a blend of mushrooms for the best flavors possible!
