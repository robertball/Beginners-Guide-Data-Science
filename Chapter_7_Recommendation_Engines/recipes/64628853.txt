Prepare the sesame sauce by mixing the sesame seeds, sugar and soy sauce.
Put the lid or cover the chicken with a cling wrap then microwave for 4 minutes using 600W.
Take out the chicken from the microwave then let it cool. Once it cools, shred it into smaller bite-size pieces.
Remove the roots of the sprouts then distribute it on top of the chicken.
