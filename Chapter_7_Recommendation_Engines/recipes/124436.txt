Description: 
Some time ago, when I was working at a newspaper, a co-worker happened to bring a meat pie for lunch. The aroma was familiar to me, and I asked for a taste. To my amazement, it was the same pie my grandmother used to serve when I was a youngster! I copied the recipe, and I have been enjoying French Meat Pie ever since. It's still delicious!
