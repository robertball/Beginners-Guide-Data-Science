Description: 
This is a quick and easy salad recipe that has been in our family for years. It always disappears at gatherings. Works well for potlucks. You can easily increase the ingredients or change the flavors for different seasons. Cranberry Jell-O and apple pie filling works well for Thanksgiving!
