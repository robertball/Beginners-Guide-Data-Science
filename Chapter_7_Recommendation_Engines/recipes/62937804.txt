Ingredients:
2 Tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon
4 17-by-12 inch sheets phyllo dough
3 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted
1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts
2 firm, ripe bananas, peeled
1/4 cup miniature chocolate chips
1 large egg, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.
Place 1 phyllo sheet on parchment paper with short side facing you, cover remaining sheets with a damp kitchen towel.  Brush phyllo sheet with butter, sprinkle the cinnamon sugar and walnuts. Repeat with 2 remaining sheets.
Layer bananas horizontally on lower 3rd of phyllo, leaving a 1 inch border on all sides and bottom, trimming bananas if necessary.  Sprinkle the chocolate chips over the bananas.  Fold long sides of phyllo towards center, over end of bananas.  Fold bottom edge over bananas.  Roll up bananas in phyllo, away from you.
Position strudel, seam side down, in center of baking sheet.  Beat egg with 1 Tbsp water and brush egg mixture over strudel. Use a serrated knife to cut 4 vents in dough.  Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
