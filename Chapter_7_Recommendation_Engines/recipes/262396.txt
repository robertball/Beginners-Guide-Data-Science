Ingredients:
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 red onion, finely sliced
2 cloves garlic, finely sliced
1 pound baby bok choy, trimmed
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
2 teaspoons fish sauce
1 tablespoon toasted pine nuts
2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds
1 cup Thai basil (optional)

Directions:
Heat sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over low heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic until soft, about 5 minutes. Add bok choy and continue to stir-fry. Add soy sauce, fish sauce, pine nuts, toasted sesame seeds and Thai basil. Stir-fry until the green tips of the bok choy and the basil are just wilted, about 3 minutes.

Description: 
This Asian-inspired bok choy dish with pine nuts and toasted sesame seeds tastes delicious over jasmine rice. If you use normal-sized bok choy, slice it in half before cooking. You can cook any green leafy vegetables this way and if you want a vegetarian version, just omit the fish sauce.
