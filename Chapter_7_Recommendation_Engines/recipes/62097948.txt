Ingredients:
Tomato Sauce:
2 TBSP EVOO
1/2 medium onion (approx 1/2 cup)
3 cloves minced garlic
1 14oz can diced tomato (basil, garlic, oregeno)
2 TBSP tomato paste
1/2 tsp sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
2 TBSP fresh thyme
Chicken:
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
4 oz goat cheese
2 diced green onions
2 TBSP fresh thyme
2 TBSP butter
1 tsp EVOO

Directions:
For Tomato Sauce: Heat oil over medium heat. Saute onion until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, saute for about 1 minute.
Meanwhile, crush tomatoes with a potato masher (or just be dirty and use your hands to break it up a bit). Add tomatoes, paste, salt, pepper, sugar and thyme. Bring to a boil, turn heat to low, cover & simmer 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
Chicken: Place chicken breast (one at a time) between two pieces of saran wrap and pound to about 1/2" thick.
Mix onions and herbs with goat cheese. Spread 1/4 of the mixture into the middle of each chicken breast. Roll chicken and place folded side down on a plate.
Heat butter and oil over medium heat. Brown chicken, starting with folded side, for about 5 minutes or until golden brown. Turn and do the same to the other side. The chicken is pounded thin so it will cook faster than usual. Once the 2nd side is browned, add the tomato sauce, turn heat to low/medium, cover and simmer for another 5-7 minutes.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe after being inspired by a Spanish tapa I had at an amazing restaurant in Las Vegas. I basically took their goat cheese/tomato sauce appetizer idea and added chicken. This is restaurant quality and will wow any dinner guest!
