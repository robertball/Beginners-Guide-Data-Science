Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon flax seed meal
1 cup tapioca flour
1/2 cup potato starch
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella-style vegan cheese (such as DaiyaÂ®)
2/3 cup almond milk
1/3 cup olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 24-cup mini muffin tin with cooking spray.
Stir water and flaxseed meal together in a small bowl. Let stand until thickened, about 5 minutes.
Combine tapioca flour, potato starch, and baking powder in the bowl of a food processor; blend until well combined. Add vegan Mozzarella cheese; mix well. Mix in flaxseed mixture, almond milk, and olive oil, with the processor running, and blend until a smooth and soft batter forms.
Spoon batter into the prepared mini muffin tin, filling each 2/3 to the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese breads are puffy and lightly golden, about 20 minutes.
