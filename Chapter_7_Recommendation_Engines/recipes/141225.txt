Ingredients:
1 (19 ounce) package Bob Evans® Italian Grilling Sausage
1 pound uncooked penne pasta
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
2 garlic cloves, peeled
2 cups fresh basil leaves
1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves
2 tablespoons pine nuts
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 cups seeded and diced Roma tomatoes
1 small green bell pepper, chopped
1 cup whole ripe olives
1 cup cubed mozzarella cheese
Red leaf lettuce for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Cook sausage in large skillet or on grill until browned; let cool. Cut in half lengthwise; cut each half into 1/4 inch slices and set aside. Cook penne according to package directions; drain. Toss in large bowl with butter to prevent sticking.
To prepare pesto sauce, place garlic cloves in food processor with metal blade or in blender; process until smooth. Add basil and parsley; process until finely chopped. Add pine nuts; process until finely chopped. With motor running, slowly add olive oil in fine, steady stream. Add Parmesan cheese and black pepper; process until well blended, scraping down side as needed.
To assemble salad, toss sausage, tomatoes, bell pepper, olives and mozzarella cheese with penne. Gradually stir in pesto until salad is moist but not saturated. Serve salad on lettuce-lined platter, if desired. Refrigerate leftovers.
