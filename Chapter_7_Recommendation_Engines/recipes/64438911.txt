Ingredients:
4 spicy sausage links, cooked, casing removed & crumbled
2 large or 3 medium zucchini
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup shredded Colby or mozzarella cheese
2 cups cottage cheese
1 1/2 cups shredded Italian cheese blend
3/4 cup chopped onion
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
1/2 cup chopped tomatoes
shredded mozarella cheese for topping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Butter a baking dish (size is dependent on the size of your zucchini).
Place crumbled sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside.
Partially cook zucchini in the microwave on high for 2 minutes.  Remove from the microwave and let cool for about 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine eggs, Colby cheese, cottage cheese, Italian blend cheese, onion, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.
Slice the zucchini in half lengthwise, remove the seeds and add half of them to the cheese mixture, along with the tomatoes, sausage and onion and mix well. Place halved zucchini in prepared baking dish and sprinkle with garlic salt.  Stuff the zucchini with the sausage/cheese mixture.  Top with marinara sauce and bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes.  Then sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top of each half and broil for 5 minutes to brown the cheese.
