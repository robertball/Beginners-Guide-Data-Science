Ingredients:
4 cups broccoli, cut into bite sized pieces
7 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons dill weed, divided
1 1/4 teaspoon sea salt, divided
3/4 teaspoon lime juice, divided
1 cup cherry tomatoes, cut in half
1 tablespoon honey
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
6 basil leaves, shredded
1/2 cup pine nuts, toasted

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
In a small skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the garlic and saute until lightly golden brown.  Remove from heat.
Combine 3 tablespoons of the olive oil mixture, 1 1/2 teaspoons dill, 1 teaspoon sea salt, and 1/2 teaspoon lime juice.  Toss with broccoli until coated.
Put broccoli on a baking sheet and roast until crisp tender, 15-20 minutes.
Return the olive oil to the heat.  Once hot, add tomatoes, remaining salt, dill, and lime juice, and honey.  Saute until tomatoes soften, about 3 minutes.
Add basil and vinegar and remove from heat.
Toss broccoli with vinaigrette dressing.  Garnish with toasted pine nuts.
