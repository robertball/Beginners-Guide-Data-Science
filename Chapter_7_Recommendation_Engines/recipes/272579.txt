Ingredients:
½ cup water
¼ cup quinoa
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 cup onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 pound ground chicken
1  egg
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon hot sauce
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion; cook and stir until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another minute. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
Transfer cooked quinoa and onions to a large bowl. Add chicken, egg, tomato paste, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper and mix until well combined. Shape the moist mixture into meatballs and place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are no longer pink in the center, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Let meatballs cool for 10 minutes before serving.
