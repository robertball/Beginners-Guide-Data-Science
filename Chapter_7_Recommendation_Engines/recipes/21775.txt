Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1/4 cup white sugar
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup white sugar
1 (10.75 ounce) package prepared pound cake
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen raspberries, thawed
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting

Directions:
In a medium bowl, beat cream with 1/4 cup sugar until stiff peaks form.  In another bowl, cream together cream cheese, lemon juice, vanilla and 1/2 cup sugar.  Fold 2 cups of whipped cream into cream cheese mixture.  Reserve remaining whipped cream.
Slice pound cake into 18 - 1/2 inch slices.  Drain raspberries, reserving juice.  Line the bottom of a 3 quart glass bowl or trifle bowl with one-third of the cake slices.  Drizzle with some raspberry juice.  Spread one-fourth of the cream cheese mixture over cake.  Sift one-fourth of the cocoa over that.  Sprinkle with one-third of the raspberries.  Repeat layers twice.  Top with remaining cream cheese mixture, whipped cream and sifted cocoa.  Cover and refrigerate 4 hours before serving.

Description: 
Layered dessert that should, in theory, feed a lot of people!   I know it's not a typical cake, but I think it's better than that!  And it really does feed a lot of people!
