Ingredients:
1/2 cup low-sodium chicken or mushroom broth
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
2 tablespoons rice wine or dry sherry
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 1/2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil
2 medium garlic cloves, minced
1 (1 1/2 inch) piece ginger root, peeled and minced
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
3 1/2 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded and caps sliced
1 1/4 pounds baby bok choy, chopped

Directions:
Stir together broth, oyster sauce, rice wine, and cornstarch in a small bowl.
Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Stir-fry garlic and ginger with salt until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add shiitakes and stir-fry until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add bok choy and stir-fry until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes.
Re-stir cornstarch mixture. Make a well in vegetables and add cornstarch mixture. Bring to a boil and toss to coat vegetables. Serve immediately.
