Ingredients:
2 quarts whole milk
3/4 cup long-grain rice
3 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
1 cup whole milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup raisins
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Pour 2 quarts milk into a large saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, then mix in rice and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes, stirring frequently and skimming surface of milk as needed.
In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, milk, and vanilla extract. Slowly pour into rice mixture while stirring vigorously. Allow mixture to boil and thicken, approximately 10 minutes, while stirring constantly.
Remove from heat and stir in raisins. Pour mixture into a 9x13 pan and sprinkle cinnamon over top. Allow to cool uncovered in refrigerator for a few hours, until pudding is chilled and firm. Cover with plastic wrap when cool.
