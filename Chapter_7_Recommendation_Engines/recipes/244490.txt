1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Pour whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 3 cups of cold water into the pan, ensuring that the water covers the pasta. Turn the burner to high, then set your timer for 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste).
Cook on high, stirring occasionally, until almost all of the liquid has evaporated.
Add cream and broccoli; stir to combine and gently heat through.
Remove the skillet from heat, season with salt and pepper to taste and fold in the cheese. Serve immediately.
