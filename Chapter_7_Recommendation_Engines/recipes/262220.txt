Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) box penne pasta
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 bunch spinach, roughly chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook mushrooms until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in spinach and garlic. Cook until spinach is wilted, about 3 minutes. Add drained pasta and stir to combine. Mix in remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.
