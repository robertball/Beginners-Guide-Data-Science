Ingredients:
Marinade:
1 (1.1 oz) package dry mesquite marinade mix (such as McCormick速 Grill Mates速)
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 pounds beef top sirloin, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 cup taco seasoning
1 lime, halved
water as needed
1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 onion, thinly sliced

Directions:
Combine marinade mix, 1/4 cup water, and 1/4 cup oil in a bowl with an airtight lid. Add steak, seal the lid, and shake until coated with marinade.
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Add 1 tablespoon oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pot and add garlic. Transfer steak from marinade to the hot oil. Add taco seasoning, squeeze in lime juice, and saute until meat is no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer cooked steak to a bowl.
Add water to the Instant Pot(R) and scrape steak bits from the bottom. Add bell peppers and onion. Close and lock the lid, select high pressure, and set the timer for 2 minutes. Allow 5 to 10 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes, making sure to cover with a towel to prevent splatter. Unlock and remove the lid.
