Ingredients:
2 cups boiling water
1 1/4 cups cracked wheat
1/3 cup honey
2 tsp salt
1/4 cup margarine
2 pkgs active dry yeast
2/3 cup warm water (110 degrees)
1 Tb honey
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup barley flour
2 to 2 1/2 cups white bread flour

Directions:
Combine 2 cups boiling water with the cracked wheat, 1/3 cup honey, salt and margarine.  Set aside to cool.
Meanwhile, Dissolve the yeast in 2/3 cup warm water and add 1 Tb honey.  Combine the cooled cracked wheat mixture with the yeast mixture.  Stir in the whole wheat and barley flours.  Stir in the white flour, saving some for kneading (too much flour will dry out the dough).
Knead on floured board 8-10 minutes.  Let rise until doubled in oiled bowl (1 to 1 1/2 hrs), covered with damp cloth.  Punch down and form into 2 loaves.  Place in sprayed pans, cover, and let rise until doubled (30-45 mins).  Bake at 350 degrees for about 40 mins.  Remove from pans and cool on rack.  Brush right away with melted margarine for an easy-to-slice crust.

Description: 
Here is my best version of cracked wheat bread that I have come up with, using honey, whole wheat and barley flour.  This bread is chewy with a great flavor and texture.  I use it for sandwiches and toast.  I prefer cracked wheat, which is chopped whole wheat berries, as whole berries are too hard to chew!
