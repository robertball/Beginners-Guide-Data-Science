Ingredients:
3 large eggs
1/3 cup smooth peanut butter (Marissa used Peanut Butter & Co.’s
Smooth Operator peanut butter)
2 tablespoons water
2 cups all-purpose flour (plus extra for dusting)
20 half-teaspoons crunchy peanut butter (Marissa used Peanut Butter & Co.’s
Crunch Time peanut butter)
10 half-teaspoons strawberry jelly
10 half-teaspoons grape jelly
¼ cup water
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400°F
Place a ½ teaspoon of crunchy peanut butter every 1 ½-inches on 4 of the strips. (Approximately 5 portions per strip.)
Place a ½ teaspoon of jelly on top of the peanut butter
Moisten the edges between each square of peanut butter and jelly by dipping your index finger in water and sliding over every side of the square.
Use the other four strips to cover over each of the four peanut butter and jelly strips.  Adhere both the bottom and top strips together by pressing between and around each square to form a tight seal and remove any air trapped inside the ravioli.
Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.
Individually moisten both the top and bottom of each ravioli and coat with the cinnamon and sugar mixture. Repeat for every ravioli and place on the prepared sheet pan.
Toast the ravioli in the oven for 4 minutes on one side. Flip the ravioli and toast for another 2-3 minutes, or until both sides are crisp.
