Ingredients:
2 egg whites
1/4 tsp vanilla extract
pinch of salt
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup granulated sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
In mixer bowl combine egg whites & vanilla - beat with paddle attachment until frothy.
Sift flour, sugar & salt in small bowl. Add to egg mixture & beat until it forms a thick batter.
On a heavily greased cookie sheet, take a small amount of batter on a teaspoon & drizzle into a puddle on a cookie sheet with heavy cooking spray. Spread around until you have a thin circle approx 3 inches in diameter & uniform in thickness.
Only do 2-3 at a time as once you pull them out you will have to work quickly.
Bake 5 minutes or until edges are golden brown & center is still pale.
Remove & lift off first one with a thin offset spatula - flip upside down on a cutting board. Quickly place your fortune paper in the center. Fold up the cookie in half- pinching together & hold with one hand. With other hand press into the center to form the bend & pull ends down to form the cookie. This whole process of folding should take no more than 10 seconds before you move on to the next hot cookie waiting for you.
Place on platter to cool and harden.
Repeat until all the batter is used up.
