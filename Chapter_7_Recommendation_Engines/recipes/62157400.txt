Ingredients:
6 ounces whole wheat spaghetti
3 handfuls fresh fiddleheads
2 3.5 ounce can smoked clams, drained and chopped
2 large cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/8 cup dry white wine
1/2 teaspoon salt
grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Trim brown ends from fiddleheads.  Swish around in a bowl of cold water, changing water a few times.  Boil 15 minutes.  Water will take a brown tint.  Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, cook pasta as directed on package.  Drain and set aside.
Heat olive oil over medium and saute minced garlic a couple of minutes.  Add clams and cook one minute.   Add fiddleheads, wine and salt, and cook another 5 minutes.
Remove to serving plate and top with grated Parmesan.

Description: 
Fiddleheads give this dish nice texture and lots of visual appeal.  Make sure to boil them a minimum of 10 minutes, as there is a history of undercooked fiddleheads leading to unpleasant endings to an otherwise nice evening.  The smoked clams add a unique flavor.
