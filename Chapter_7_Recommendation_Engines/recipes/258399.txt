Shape mixture into 10 meatballs about 2 inches in diameter.
Beat egg in a small bowl. Pour flour onto a shallow dish. Dip meatballs in the beaten egg; dredge in flour.
Heat oil in a large skillet. Cook meatballs until golden on all sides, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Simple, but very tasty! One of my favorite Turkish foods. Literally, kadin buddu means 'ladies' thighs.' Coated in egg and then fried, Turkish koftas come in all shapes, sizes, and degrees of spiciness. You can do a lot with them. Serve with breads, rice, sauces, gravies, salads, and onion rings, or serve them as-is for an appetizer or snack.
