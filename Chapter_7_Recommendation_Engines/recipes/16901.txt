Ingredients:
4 pounds chuck roast
1 (4 ounce) can green chile peppers, chopped
2 tablespoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 cloves garlic, minced
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Place roast on heavy foil large enough to enclose the meat. In a small bowl, combine the green chile peppers, chili powder, oregano, cumin, garlic and salt to taste. Mix well and rub over the meat.
Totally wrap the meat in the foil and place in a roasting pan.
Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 3 1/2 to 4 hours, or until the roast just falls apart with a fork. Remove from oven and shred using two forks.

Description: 
I use this recipe all the time. It is the best! The meat just falls apart, and it's delicious served in flour tortillas with guacamole and salsa. This also freezes well.
