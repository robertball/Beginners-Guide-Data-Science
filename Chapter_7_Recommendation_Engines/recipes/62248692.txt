Ingredients:
2 lbs ground beef
1/2 cup progresso italian breadcrumbs
2 eggs
salt to taste
pepper to taste
onion flakes to taste
1 14 ounce can tomato sauce
brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Mix beef, eggs, salt, pepper and onion flakes in large bowl by hand.  Don't overmix because that will change the texture.  Divide into quarters, and then divided each quarter into thirds.  That makes 12 portions.  Roll each portion into a ball (doesn't need to be perfect) and place in muffin tin, without squashing, leaving space in the sides.  On top of each meatloaf pour some of the tomato sauce.  You'll more than likely have some left over.  It's best not to fill the sides completely with sauce, because there will be quite a bit of grease as it cooks.  Sprinkle each meatloaf with brown sugar, and bake until meat reaches 160 degrees.
