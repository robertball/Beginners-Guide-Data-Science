Ingredients:
Cupcakes:
12 ounces strawberries, chopped, or more to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste
2 3/4 cups sifted cake flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 sticks butter
1 1/4 cups white sugar
4 eggs, at room temperature
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon strawberry extract
1/2 cup 2% milk
Frosting:
3 cups powdered sugar
1 stick butter
1 tablespoon 2% milk, or as needed
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
4 strawberries, sliced, or more to taste

Directions:
Place strawberries in a medium bowl. Cover with 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar and refrigerate, 2 hours to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.
Mash strawberry and sugar mixture with a potato masher, or pulse gently in the bowl of a food processor until strawberries are chunky. Strain strawberries over a bowl, reserving juice.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl.
Beat butter and 1 1/4 cups sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer until pale yellow and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing for about 1 minute after each egg and scraping down the sides of the bowl. Mix in vanilla extract and strawberry extract.
Add flour mixture in 2 batches, alternating with the milk, blending well and scraping the sides of the bowl after each addition.
Fold in strawberries and 5 tablespoons strawberry juice with a wooden spoon until well incorporated and you can see bits of strawberry showing throughout the batter. Fill cupcake liners 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until the tops of the cupcakes are a lovely golden color and they spring back when pressed, about 18 minutes.
Cool in muffin cups for 5 minutes. Remove from tins and finish cooling on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.
While the cupcakes are cooling, combine powdered sugar, butter, milk, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer; whip until creamy.
Pipe frosting onto cupcakes and garnish each with a strawberry slice.
