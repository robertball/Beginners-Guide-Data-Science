Cut the cake into thirds, horizontally.
Line a large trifle or other glass serving bowl with kiwi and strawberry slices, reserving two whole strawberries and two kiwi slices. Soak bananas in pineapple juice, add 2 Tbsps lemon juice for good measure. Place one layer of cake in bottom of bowl, top with 1/3 of bananas and pineapple, and 1/3 of whipped topping mixture.  Repeat layering until all ingredients are used.
Make fan garnishes of whole strawberries by slicing from just below the stem.  Garnish assembled trifle with fanned strawberries, reserved kiwi slices, and a sprig of mint.  Refrigerate until serving.
