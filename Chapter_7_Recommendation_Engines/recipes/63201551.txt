Ingredients:
1 box of yellow cake mix (1 pound)
4 ounces of butter, melted
3 eggs
8 ounces of cream cheese, softened
1 pound (16 ounces) of powdered sugar
1 tsp. of vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F. Line an 8 x 8 inch pan with parchment paper.
Make the base first: mix together cake mix, butter and 1 egg.
Pat into pan, create an even layer.
Make the ooey gooey layer: Cream together the cream cheese, 2 eggs, sugar and vanilla.
Pour gooey layer over cake layer, spread to edges.
Bake for 45 minutes* or until edges are golden brown, center should be a creamy yet solid consistency like cheesecake or heaven. (*updated)
Cool completely in pan before cutting into 1-inch squares with a clean, dry knife. For best square results, pop into freezer and chill before slicing
