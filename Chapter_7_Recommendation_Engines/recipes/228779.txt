Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 1/2 cups brown and wild rice mix
3 tablespoons butter
1 cup slivered almonds
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1 cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as CraisinsÂ®)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray an 8-inch square baking dish with cooking spray.
Bring chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan.
Pour rice mix into the prepared baking dish. Carefully pour boiling chicken broth over the rice. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven until rice is tender, about 1 hour.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir almonds in hot butter until they start to color, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle parsley over the almonds; continue to cook and stir until the almonds are lightly browned, another 3 to 5 minutes.
Mix the baked rice, the almond mixture, cranberries, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; toss to serve.
