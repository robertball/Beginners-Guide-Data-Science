Ingredients:
1 cup very hot water (about 190 degrees F (88 degrees C))
1 1/4 teaspoons genmaicha (toasted brown rice green tea)
1 (750 milliliter) bottle soju (such as Jinro Chamisul)
2/3 cup peach schnapps
2/3 cup probiotic yogurt beverage (such as Yakult®)
2/3 cup fresh lemon juice, or more to taste
2/3 cup fresh lime juice, or more to taste
2 large Persian sweet limes, juiced
1/4 cup plain whole-milk yogurt
ice cubes (optional)

Directions:
Pour hot water over genmaicha in a teapot. Let cool completely; refrigerate for 3 hours to overnight.
Combine soju, peach schnapps, probiotic yogurt beverage, lemon juice, lime juice, sweet lime juice, and plain yogurt in a pitcher. Whisk until well blended. Taste and adjust amounts as needed.
Strain out genmaicha and pour 3/4 of it into the pitcher; taste and add the rest if desired. Whisk again. Serve chilled, adding ice to individual cups as needed.

Description: 
My prompt for the Allrecipes annual Thanksgiving party cocktail competition was You're makin' me gravy, so I derived biscuits and gravy, which brought up buttermilk, which led to yogurt, another fermented friend responsible for good biscuits. I included regular yogurt to counter the distinct flavor of Yakult® and bought all the ingredients other than the yogurt at H-Mart. Drinking to your health has a whole new meaning, so prepare to be cultured!
