Ingredients:
6 pork chops
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon seasoning salt
2 egg, beaten
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups Italian-style seasoned bread crumbs
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 can cream golden mushroom
1/2 cup milk
1/3 cup white wine
small jar mushrooms

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Rinse pork chops, pat dry, and season with garlic powder and seasoning salt to taste. Place the beaten eggs in a small bowl. Dredge the pork chops lightly in flour, dip in the egg, and coat liberally with bread crumbs.
Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Make sure oil is hot, then fry the pork chops 5 minutes per side, or until the breading appears well browned and crunchy. Transfer the chops to a 9x13 inch baking dish, and cover with foil. Then saute mushrooms in same pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. While baking, combine the cream of mushroom soups, milk and white wine in a medium bowl. After the pork chops have baked for 20 min, cover them with the soup mixture. Replace foil, and bake for another 20-30 minutes.
