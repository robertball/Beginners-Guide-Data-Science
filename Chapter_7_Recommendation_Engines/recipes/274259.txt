Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
6 tablespoons cold butter, cut into 1-inch squares
1/2 cup canned pumpkin
1 large egg
3 tablespoons half-and-half
Powdered Sugar Glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar, or as needed
2 tablespoons milk, or as needed
Spiced Glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoons milk
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pinch ground ginger
1 pinch ground cloves

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine flour, 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger in the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix using the paddle attachment. Add butter to the bowl and toss using a spatula to ensure butter is coated in flour mixture. Mix until mixture resembles cornmeal with butter pieces no bigger than a pea, about 2 minutes.
Whisk pumpkin, egg, and half-and-half together in a bowl until blended. Fold pumpkin mixture into flour mixture until dough can be formed into a ball.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface press with your hands into a long rectangle, 3/4- to 1-inch thick. Use a pizza cutter to cut dough into 4 rectangles. Cut each rectangle into 2 triangles. Place dough triangles onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until scones begin to brown around the edges and on top, about 15 minutes.
Transfer scones to a wire rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes.
Mix powdered sugar and milk together in a small bowl, using more sugar or more milk to reach the desired consistency. Use a brush to spread glaze on the cooled scones. Allow to harden, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix powdered sugar, milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves together in a small bowl. Drizzle spiced glaze over the first glaze and allow to harden completely, about 10 minutes more.
