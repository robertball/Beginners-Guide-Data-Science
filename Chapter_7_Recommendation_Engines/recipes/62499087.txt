Ingredients:
¦8 ounces pork tenderloin, trimmed of visible fat and cut crosswise into 6 pieces
¦Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
¦1/2 teaspoon herbes de Provence
¦1/4 cup dry white wine

Directions:
Sprinkle the pieces of pork with black pepper. Place the pork between sheets of wax paper. Pound with a mallet or roll with a rolling pin until about 1/4-inch thick.
In a large, nonstick frying pan, cook the pork over medium-high heat until the meat is browned, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove from heat and sprinkle with herbes de Provence. Place the pork on individual plates and keep warm.
Pour the wine into the frying pan. Cook until boiling. Scrape the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour the wine sauce over the pork and serve immediately.
