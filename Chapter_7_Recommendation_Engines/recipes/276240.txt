Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
1 (5 ounce) package rice vermicelli noodles
2 tablespoons sesame oil, divided
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, thinly sliced
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 (8 ounce) package snow peas, trimmed and halved
2 carrots, julienned
3 tablespoons mild curry powder
4 green onions, sliced
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/4 cup unsalted, dry roasted cashews

Directions:
Place chicken stock in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add vermicelli noodles, and toss until noodles have softened slightly. Cover and let soak for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok over high heat. Add chicken in batches, and cook until golden on the outside and no longer pink on the inside, 3 to 5 minutes per batch. Transfer chicken to a plate.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil in the wok. Add onion; cook and stir until soft, about 2 minutes. Add snow peas, carrots, and curry powder; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add green onions, soy sauce, cooked chicken, cooked noodles, and any remaining chicken stock. Toss to combine and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in cashews and serve.
