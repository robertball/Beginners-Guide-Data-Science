Ingredients:
2 large chicken breasts cubed
2-3 cups cooked spiral (or other) pasta
1 can kidney beans drained and rinsed
1 1/2 cups diced fresh tomatoes
2 cans condensed cream of chicken soup
1 packet McCormick taco seasoning
1/2 cup cheese
1/2 - 1 cup crushed tortilla chips
cheese to sprinkle on top

Directions:
Preheat to oven 350
I always grease my baking dishes for easy cleaning but it isn't necessary for cooking this recipe. Also, I under cook my pasta just to make it quicker when I'm in hurry since it will finish cooking in the casserole.
Mix together in a large bowl, the soup and seasoning. Then add all other ingredients, except chips, and mix to coat well. Put into 13x9 casserole dish and sprinkle with crushed chips and then sprinkle with extra cheese. Bake for 30-40 minutes (will go quicker with smaller chunks of chicken).

Description: 
This was an on the whim recipe that turned out great. I think it works as a great base, you could add more veggies or sour cream or even switch ground beef for chicken. The kids loved it, the husband loved it (with extra hot sauce of course), and I loved it. Nice change of pace from the typical casserole.
