Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup solid vegetable shortening (such as CriscoÂ®)
2 eggs
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 (8 ounce) jar maraschino cherries, drained and juice reserved, divided
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Combine sugar, shortening, eggs, and salt in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until well combined.
Mix flour and baking powder together in a medium bowl. Add flour mixture to shortening mixture in 2 or 3 batches, alternating with maraschino cherry juice, mixing batter well after each addition.
Cut each cherry into 4 pieces; stir into batter with pecans. Spoon mixture into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen and invert loaf onto a wire rack. Let cool completely.
