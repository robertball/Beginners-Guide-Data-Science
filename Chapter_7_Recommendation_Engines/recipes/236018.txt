Ingredients:
1 (28 ounce) bottle ketchup
1/4 cup prepared yellow mustard (such as French's®)
2 tablespoons ground smoked black pepper (such as McCormick® Smokehouse®)
1 tablespoon dried onion granules

2 teaspoons granulated garlic

Directions:
Stir ketchup, mustard, smoked pepper, onion granules, hot pepper sauce, and granulated garlic together in a bowl; funnel into a squeezable bottle and refrigerate between uses.

Description: 
Give your ketchup a twang by adding prepared mustard. I prefer French's® but dijon-style will work as well. I also like to add a couple of tablespoons of ground black pepper. Smokehouse® pepper is the best!
