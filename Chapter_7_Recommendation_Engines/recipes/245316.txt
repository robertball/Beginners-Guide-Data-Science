Ingredients:
1 pound bacon, sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces
12 ounces sour cream
12 ounces ranch dressing
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (18 ounce) package scoop-shaped tortilla chips (such as Fritos® Scoops®)

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels until cool.
Stir sour cream, ranch dressing, and Cheddar cheese together in a large bowl. Crumble bacon into the dip; mix well.
Chill until flavors blend, about 1 hour. Serve dip with chips.
