Ingredients:
4 teaspoons olive oil, divided
12 ounces brown mushrooms, sliced
1 large onion, thinly sliced
4 4-ounce pork loin chops
3/4 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup brandy
1 teaspoon dried sage
1 teaspoon dried rosemary

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
In a large oven-safe skillet, heat 2 teaspoons oil over medium high heat. Add mushrooms and sautee until browned and moisture has evaporated. Set aside.
In the same skillet add remaining oil and onions, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and caramelized. Add to mushrooms.
In the same skillet, add chops and sear each side until brown, about 3 minutes a side. Add stock, brandy and herbs and bring to a boil. Let cook several minutes to allow the alcohol to cook off. Cover and transfer to the oven. Bake until tender, about 25 minutes. Uncover, add onions and mushrooms and bake an additional 5 minutes.
