Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons white wine
1 1/4 pounds salmon fillets

Directions:
In a medium glass bowl, mix together the melted butter, brown sugar, soy sauce, lemon juice, and white wine. Stir until brown sugar has dissolved. Reserve a small amount to use as a basting sauce; the remainder is used as a marinade.
Place salmon fillets in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in marinade, seal, and turn to coat salmon. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, turning once.
Preheat grill for medium-high heat.
Lightly oil grill grate. Place salmon on grill, and discard marinade. Cook salmon for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until easily flaked with a fork. Baste with reserved sauce while grilling.
