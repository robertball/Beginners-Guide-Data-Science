Ingredients:
One 9-inch pie shell, uncooked
3 cups cooked chicken
1 1/2 cups frozen peas
1 1/2 cups frozen carrots
1 can mushrooms
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup water, or more
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
Salt and pepper, to taste
3 cups chicken broth

Directions:
In a medium saucepan saute onions over medium heat until lightly browned.  Add in mushrooms.
Meanwhile, in a large frypan add flour, salt and pepper; gradually stir in a small amount of chicken broth.  Turn heat on to medium, stirring constantly with a whisk, adding more broth as mixture thickens and all broth is added.  Transfer onion and mushroom mixture to pan.  Stir in chicken, peas and carrots.  Bring to a boil, whisking constantly until mixture is thickened.
Spoon into a large casserole dish and cover with pastry top, making slits to let steam escape.  Bake at 450F. for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 350F. and bake until pastry is nicely browned and cooked (about 40 minutes).
