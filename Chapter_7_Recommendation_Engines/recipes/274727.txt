Ingredients:
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon onion powder
12  chicken tenders
12 slices turkey bacon, cut in half lengthwise
â…“ cup light brown sugar
1 tablespoon chili powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a cooling rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet.
Mix paprika, salt, and onion powder together in a small bowl. Sprinkle seasoning over both sides of each chicken tender. Wrap each tender with two strips of bacon, tucking the ends in to secure.
Mix brown sugar and chili powder together in a small bowl. Gently roll each bacon-wrapped tender in the brown sugar mixture, pressing down to ensure good coverage.
Arrange tenders on top of the prepared cooling rack, making sure to not overcrowd.
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.
