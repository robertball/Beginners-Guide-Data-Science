Ingredients:
Soft White Roll
This recipe approximates the quintessential white sandwich roll found throughout the Bay Area. The recipe is simple, quick, and addictive. Should make 10-12 rolls.
1½ tablespoon active dry yeast
¼ + 1/8 cup warm water {it should feel between lukewarm and hot to the touch}
1 ½ cup warm milk {low fat}
2 ¼ tbsp sugar
3 tbsp vegetable oil {plus additional for greasing bowl during rising}
2¼ tsp salt
5 ½ cups {750gm} all purpose flour
2 tbsp vital gluten

Directions:
Soft White Rolls
In the bowl of an electric mixer or large mixing bowl, combine yeast, water, milk and sugar. Stir to dissolve and let sit for about 5 minutes. {The mixture should start to bubble or foam a bit and smell yeasty}.
Add in vegetable oil, salt and 2 cups of flour. Using the dough hook attachment or a wooden spoon, mix at medium speed until the dough comes together.
Add remaining flour a quarter cup at time until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 4 minutes, until smooth and elastic. {Thermomix:Place all ingredients in TM bowl. Mix at speed 6 for 7-8 seconds, and then knead for 2-3 minutes}
Place in a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for 1 hour, or until doubled.
Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 10-12 equal portions {or 2 equal portions if you’d like to make a loaf}.
Shape each into a ball or loaf and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet {try not to handle the dough too much at this point}.
Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 15 minutes while you prepare the topping.
Coat the top of each roll or loaf with the topping as described above. {While the original recipe recommends letting them stand for 20 minutes after applying the topping, I got equally good results by putting them directly into the oven, and by letting them stand for 20 minutes while the first batch baked}.
Once you’ve applied the topping, bake in a preheated moderately hot 190°C for 25-30 minutes, until well browned. Let cool completely on a wire rack before eating.
