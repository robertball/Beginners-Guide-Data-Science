Ingredients:
3 cups chicken broth
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 ½ tablespoons unsalted butter
¾ teaspoon white sugar
1  carrot, thinly sliced
1 stalk celery, thinly sliced
1 cup potato gnocchi
4 ounces frozen peas
4 ounces frozen corn
1 cup shredded cooked chicken
2 ounces baby spinach
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Combine chicken broth, garlic, butter, and sugar in a large saucepan; bring to a simmer and cook until garlic is tender, about 2 minutes. Stir carrot and celery into simmering broth; cook until vegetables are almost tender, about 2 minutes more.
Bring broth mixture to a boil and stir gnocchi into the saucepan; cook until gnocchi rise to the top and are tender yet firm to the bite, 2 to 3 minutes. Add peas and corn to broth mixture; simmer until heated through, about 30 seconds.
Stir chicken and spinach into broth mixture; remove from heat and season soup with salt and black pepper. Ladle soup into bowls and top with Parmesan cheese.
