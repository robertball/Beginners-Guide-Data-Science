Sweet and Sour Tofu Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
* 1 tbsp cornstarch
* 3/4 cup vegetable broth
* 3 tbsp white wine vinegar
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 1 tbsp ketchup
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1/2 tsp ground ginger
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil (I used canola)
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 onion, diced
* 2 carrots, sliced (I omitted this part)
* 1 green bell pepper, diced
* 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms
* 1 14 oz package of firm or extra firm tofu, drained and cut into 1 inch cubes

Directions:
1. In a large bowl, mix together the cornstarch and vegetable broth, then add the vinegar, sugar, ketchup, soy sauce, ginger and cayenne pepper until well mixed. Set aside.
2. In a large skillet or wok, stir-fry the garlic, onion, (and carrots) in oil about 5 minutes.
3. Here's where I deviate from the original recipe. We fried our tofu. So, heat a splash or so of oil until hot in a pan . . . and then drop in your cubes of tofu. Keep stirring well to fry all sides while you continue the next steps.
4. Add the pepper and mushrooms and stir-fry for another 2 to 3 minutes.
5. Add the sauce mix to the veggies and cook until mixture thickens, approx 5 to 7 minutes.
6. Add tofu and allow to cook at least 5 more minutes.

Found this when I searched for a Sweet and Sour Tofu recipe where the tofu was fried. Wanted to be able to add the ingredients to my Allrecipes shopping list and recipe box.
