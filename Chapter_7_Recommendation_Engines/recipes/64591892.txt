Ingredients:
1 head sour cabbage
2 lb lean ground beef
1 lb lean ground pork (if available) OR
3 lb lean ground beef (for total of 3 lb meat)
1 1/2 cups long grain rice
1 medium to large onion, chopped (adjust to taste)
fresh pressed garlic, optional (as much or little as you like)
2 tbsp. brown sugar
3 tsp. ginger
3 tbsp. soy sauce
liquid smoke, to taste
48 oz tin tomato juice
salt, pepper and spices to taste (I love adding dill!)

Directions:
Separate cabbage leaves. Larger ones can be cut into smaller sizes.
Mix tomato juice with an equal amount of water.
Pre-cook rice in 3 cups of this mixture. Let cool.
Mix remaining ingredients, except cabbage.
Add rice and approx. 1/2 cup of juice to meat filling.
Place mix on leaves and roll.
Pack rolls in a roaster, using a bottom rack or a few loose leaves on bottom to prevent scorching.
Cover rolls with remaining tomato juice mixture.
Bake @ 350 x 1 1/2 hrs or until meat is fully cooked. Check level of liquid and add more if needed so rolls stay mostly submerged and don't dry out.
