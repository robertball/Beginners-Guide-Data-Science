Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package egg roll wrappers
1 pound lean ground beef, turkey, chicken or venison
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
8 ounces of coleslaw mix
2 cups shredded colbyjack cheese
4 cups oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Crumble ground meat into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until evenly browned, and drain off grease. Add coleslaw mix and taco seasoning, and cook according to taco package directions. Set aside and let cool. Heat 1 inch of oil in a large skillet, or preheat a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Lay out one egg roll wrapper at a time, and place a little more than a tablespoon of the meat mixture in the center. Top with a little bit of shredded cheese. Roll up according to package instructions, and seal edges, wetting with water if necessary. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.
Fry the rolls in the hot oil until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oil to drain on paper towels. Serve hot and fresh.
