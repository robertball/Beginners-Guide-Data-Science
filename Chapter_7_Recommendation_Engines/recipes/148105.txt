Ingredients:
1 1/2 fluid ounces dark rum
1 pint Irish stout beer (e.g. GuinnessÂ®)

Directions:
Pour the rum into a pint glass, then slowly pour in the stout. Enjoy!

Submitter: 
Brian Miller
Description: 
Irish stout is very smooth, but a little weak in alcohol content. Adding a shot of dark rum kicks the alcohol up a notch and adds just a hint of sweetness, making this very drinkable.
