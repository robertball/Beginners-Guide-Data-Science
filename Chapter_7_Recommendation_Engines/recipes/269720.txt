Ingredients:
3 (6 ounce) fillets salmon, cut into cubes
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 medium onions, sliced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
2 teaspoons cumin seeds
2 teaspoons garam masala
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
2 tomatoes, grated
2 cups water
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Gently fry salmon pieces until easily flaked with a fork, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels and set aside.
Heat remaining oil in the same pan over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, and ginger; fry until golden, about 7 minutes. Add cumin, garam masala, and turmeric. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add tomatoes; cook until they start to reduce, about 5 minutes. Add water and salt; bring to a boil.
Return salmon to the pan and reduce heat to low. Simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
