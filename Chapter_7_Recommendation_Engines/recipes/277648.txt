Ingredients:
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 pound Fuyu persimmons, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks
1/4 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 teaspoon Madagascar vanilla powder
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup fine cornmeal
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup cold unsalted butter
1/2 cup cold buttermilk
1 tablespoon milk
2 tablespoons cane sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a 9x9-inch square baking dish. Set aside.
Place persimmon chunks into a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle in brown sugar, white sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, lemon zest, vanilla powder, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Mix well and set aside.
Mix flour, cornmeal, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl. Cut in the butter until it resembles small pebbles. Add buttermilk, little by little, mixing the dough with your hands. Once the dough forms a ball, turn out onto a flour-dusted work surface. Knead until smooth. Roll into an 8x8-inch, 1/2-inch thick square.
Pour persimmon mixture with all its juices into the prepared baking dish. Tear off pieces of dough and lay them onto the top of the persimmons like patchwork. Allow a bit of space between each pieces so the juices can bubble up around the pieces.
Brush the top with milk and sprinkle with cane sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until persimmons are bubbling and the biscuit topping is browned, about 40 minutes. Allow to cool before serving.
