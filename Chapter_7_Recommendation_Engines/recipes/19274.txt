Ingredients:
1/2 cup honey
2/3 cup butter
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups whole wheat flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 (32 ounce) package wheat and barley nugget cereal (e.g. Grape-Nutsâ„¢)

Directions:
In a medium bowl, heat honey in the microwave until bubbly, about 1 minute. Stir in the butter until melted. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Combine the wheat flour and cocoa; stir into the batter until well blended. Cover dough and chill in the freezer for 1 hour or several hours in the refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll dough into small logs of random length and shape like poops. Roll the poops in the nugget cereal and place them 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm. Serve in a disposable cat litter box on a bed of nugget cereal, with a cat litter scoop. I hear you get lovely effects by decorating the box and scoop with melted chocolate or pudding
