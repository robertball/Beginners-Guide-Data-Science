Ingredients:
1 torilla (thin burrito style,I like Aztec)
3 Tbl cream cheese
1 tbl pizza sauce
6 slices pepperoni
1/4 shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
place cream cheese on tortilla, microwave for 10-15 seconds, to soften tortilla and cream cheese.
Spread cream cheese evenly around surface, take all the way to the edge as cream cheese serves as the "glue".
Spread pizza sauce evenly on top of that.
Line up pepperonis on the right inner edge in two rows of 3 (more if you like).
Sprinkle mozzarella over those.
Fold the bottom in and roll, starting at pepperoni edge, burrito style.
You can also fold in both the top and the bottom and roll it egg roll style, so there is no mess while eating.
Note: Cream cheese and sauce measurements really depend on preference and size of tortilla, you want just enough, but not so much it's seeping out as you roll it.
As does the ingredients depend on preferences.
I cut it in the middle diagonally to make it easier for my kids to eat at lunch time, also I do keep a cold pack in the lunchbox with this.
Hope your kids like these as much as mine do, it's always nice to find fun and new ideas to keep them guessing at lunch time :)
