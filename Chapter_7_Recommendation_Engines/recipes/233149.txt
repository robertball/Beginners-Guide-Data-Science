Description: 
My kids love to help mix this up with their hands (so they can eat the fudge off their fingers afterwards of course) -- or you can use a mixer with a dough hook. All ingredients should be at room temperature. The recipe can also be halved but this freezes beautifully so don't hesitate to make the whole batch.
