Ingredients:
1 medium zucchini, spiralized
1 splash olive oil
3 green onions, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 pinch red pepper flakes
1/4 cup chopped peanuts
1/2 red bell pepper, thinly sliced

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute zucchini noodles in the hot pan for 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a metal colander and let drain in the sink.
Heat olive oil in the same pan over medium-low heat. Saute green onions and garlic in the hot oil, 2 to 3 minutes. Add soy sauce, brown sugar, and red pepper flakes. Let simmer until sauce is reduced and thick, about 5 minutes. Turn off heat.
Squeeze moisture out of zoodles in the colander. Toss into sticky sauce to coat. Serve topped with chopped peanuts and bell pepper.
