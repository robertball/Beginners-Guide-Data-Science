Ingredients:
2 slices bacon
2 links pork sausage
2 slices Canadian-style bacon
3 eggs, beaten
1 pita bread, cut in half

Directions:
Place bacon, sausage, and Canadian-style bacon in a medium skillet over medium heat. Fry until evenly brown; drain. Crumble bacon, and chop sausage.
Mix eggs into the skillet, and scramble with the bacon and sausage until no longer runny.
Place pita bread in a microwave, and heat on High about 30 seconds, until warm. Spoon the egg mixture into the pita bread halves, and serve warm.

Description: 
A good substitute for the plain old omelet.  You can use a variety of ingredients; however, I like the all meat version. Serve with salsa and ketchup!
