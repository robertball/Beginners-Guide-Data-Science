Ingredients:
1 sheet Pepperidge Farm® Puff Pastry
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling

Directions:
Thaw pastry sheet at room temperature 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Mix egg and water.
Unfold pastry on lightly floured surface. Roll into 16x12-inch rectangle. With short side facing you, spoon pie filling on bottom half of pastry to within 1 inch of edges. Starting at short side, roll up like a jelly roll. Place seam-side down on baking sheet. Tuck ends under to seal. Brush with egg mixture. Cut several 2-inch slits about 2 inches apart on top.
Bake 35 minutes or until golden. Cool on baking sheet on wire rack 30 minutes. Slice and serve warm.

When you pull this warm strudel from the oven, everyone will think it took hours to prepare. Not true when you rely on frozen Pepperidge Farm® Puff Pastry Sheets  and canned pie filling.
