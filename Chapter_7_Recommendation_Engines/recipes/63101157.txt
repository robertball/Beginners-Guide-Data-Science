Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup chopped yellow onion
1 cup long-grain white rice
1 can (4 ounces) sliced mushrooms, drained
1 3/4 cups beef broth
1/4 teaspoon salt
Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish

Directions:
1. In a medium saucepan, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft and golden, 10 to 12 minutes.
2. Add the rice and mushrooms and cook, stirring to coat with the butter, for about 2 minutes. Pour in the broth and add the salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender, 17 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Serve garnished with parsley.
