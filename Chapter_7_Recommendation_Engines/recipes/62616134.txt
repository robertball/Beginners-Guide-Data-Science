Ingredients:
1/2 C water
1 t table salt
10 oz pkg. frozen spinach
3 eggs, whisked
3 T flour
16 oz cottage cheese (low fat is ok)
4 oz brick cheese, cut into 1-in cubes
4 oz American cheese, cut into 1-in cubes
1/2 stick melted butter (opt)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Bring water to boil. Add salt and spinach and cook until done. Transfer to colander and squeeze spinach to remove as much water as possible.
Meanwhile, in large bowl, mix remaining ingred. Stir in cooked spinach. Grease a shallow quiche pan or 8x8 baking dish. Bake uncovered for 60 min or until top begins to brown.

Description: 
Recipe calls for brick cheese and I haven't seen that in awhile. But all other ingred are easily found. Seems like a lot of ingred for 10 oz package of frozen spinach.
