Ingredients:
2 ounces freshly picked rose petals
1/2 cup white sugar, divided
1 cup water

Directions:
Wash rose petals and dry them using a salad spinner or paper towels. Trim and discard white bases of petals.
Place rose petals in a bowl; add 2 tablespoons sugar. Rub petals with your hands until sugar draws out liquid from the petals. Pour liquid into a separate bowl and reserve.
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in remaining 6 tablespoons sugar. Cook over medium heat for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool, about 15 minutes.
Place rose petals in the cooled syrup. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, and cook, about 5 minutes. Add reserved liquid. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally and skimming off any foam that rises to the top, until syrup is reduced, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
For the most fragrant and attractive jam use brightly colored tea roses, or any other fragrant roses. I am using light pink roses from my garden â€“ although they do not make the most colorful jam, I am sure the roses are not sprayed. I am suggesting a small batch recipe for those, who, just like me, only have one or two rose bushes. The recipe can be doubled.
