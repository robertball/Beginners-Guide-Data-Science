Description: 
An easy chili that's sure to please. I've made this for a Halloween party and a chili cook-off at work with great results!  It's a great base with lots of options to spice it up depending on the crowd you're cooking for! I usually put everything together in the morning and let it simmer all day; cooking time can be adjusted to fit your needs.
