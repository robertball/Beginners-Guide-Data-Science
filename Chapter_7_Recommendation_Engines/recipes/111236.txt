Ingredients:
1/4 cup packed fresh basil leaves
1/4 cup olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons grated Romano cheese
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons creamy Caesar salad dressing
6 (1/4 inch thick) slices Italian bread with sesame seeds (also known as Scali)
1/2 cup shredded iceberg lettuce
2 thin slices smoked mozzarella

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat; lightly oil the grate.
Place basil, oil, garlic, Romano cheese, oregano, and pepper into a blender. Blend on high until smooth, adding additional oil if necessary, about 30 seconds.
Grill chicken until juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. Do not turn off grill.
Spoon 1 tablespoon of Caesar dressing onto 2 slices of bread. Top each with lettuce, and an additional slice of bread. Spread the second slice of bread thickly with the pesto. Top each sandwich with a cooked chicken breast, a slice of smoked mozzarella, and the remaining bread.
Grill sandwiches until the cheese is melted, and the bread is toasted, about 3 minutes per side.
