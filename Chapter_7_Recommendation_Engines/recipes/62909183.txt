Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar or 1/3 cup honey*
5 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar

3/4 cup shortening or butter-flavor shortening or butter
1 1/4 cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Grease 2 cookie sheets.
In large bowl, combine flour, sugar or honey, baking powder, cream of tartar, and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in milk and vanilla extract; quickly mix until just combined.
Drop dough by 1/4 cups, 2 inches apart, onto cookie sheets to make 16 biscuits.
Place cookie sheets on 2 oven racks; bake biscuits 12 to 15 minutes until golden, rotating cookie sheets between upper and lower racks half-way through baking time. Serve warm. Or, if not serving right away, cool biscuits on wire rack. Store in tightly covered container to reheat before serving. Makes 16.

This recipe was gave me years ago by my sister in law. Every time I make them my family tells me I didn't make enough. I also use these recipe and leave out the honey for biscuits and gravy. It so easy to make that everyone in our family can make these delicious biscuits.
