Ingredients:
5 medium/large red potatoes, skin on, quartered
1, one ounce packet of ranch dressing mix
1/2 medium onion, diced(or more if you LOVE onion)
3 slices of bacon, diced in 1 inch squares
Olive oil for drizzling
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425
Quarter the potatoes and place in a medium sized mixing bowl. Drizzle with olive oil until they're fully coated.
Add contents of the ranch dressing packet a bit at a time, as you want to coat all the potatoes with ranch dressing mix.
Add onions and stir.
Pour mixture into a 9x13 in casserole dish. Place Bacon slices on top.
Bake for 25-35 minutes uncovered(I've found that the hardness/softness of the type potato you use can affect cooking time) stirring halfway through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
Ranch dressing mix, some bacon and onion spice up potatoes! You can leave off the bacon if you're being health conscious. They're good with or without. Serve them plain or with sour cream.
