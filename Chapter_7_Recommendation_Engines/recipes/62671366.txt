Ingredients:
Cooking Spray
1 large ziploc bag "vegetable scraps"
3 cloves garlic, whole
2 carrots, cut into chunks
2 stalks celery, cut into chunks
3 onions, cut into chunks
1 green or red pepper, quartered
1 tomato, quartered
8 cups water
2 bay leaves
8 peppercorns
3 or 4 sprigs of herbs (thyme, sage, rosemary...whatever) or a couple teaspoons dried

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray Arrange scraps and fresh vegetables on baking sheet in a single layer.
Roast the vegetables in the preheated oven, turning every 20 minutes, until tender and browned, about 45 minutes.
Transfer the roasted vegetables to a large stockpot.  Add a little water to the baking sheet and use a spatula to scrape up any cooked on bits; add this to the stockpot.  Add the remaining ingredients. Bring the water to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 1/2 hours; strain and cool.

Description: 
I keep a plastic bag in my freezer for any vegetable scraps that would go well in stock: carrot peels, sweet potato peels, onion ends (including skin), cloves of garlic that are too small or maybe a little dried out, spinach/cabbage/kale leaves, herbs or stems that are past their prime, etc  Roast them with a few fresh veggies and you've got a great base for veggie stock.Modified from: Roasted-Vegetable Stock
