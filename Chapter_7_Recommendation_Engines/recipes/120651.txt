Ingredients:
3/4 cup finely chopped onion
3/4 cup finely chopped green pepper
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
3 (7.5 ounce) packages refrigerated buttermilk biscuits
1 pound sliced bacon, cooked and crumbled
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a small skillet, saute onion and green pepper in oil until tender. Cut each biscuit into quarters. In a large bowl, gently toss onion mixture, biscuits, bacon, butter and cheese until combined. Transfer to a greased 10-in. tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately invert onto a serving plate. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
To dress up plain recipes, I'll toss a bit of bacon into the mix, just like I did here. I'm always pleased with the results! Pieces of this hearty bread are almost a meal in themselves.
