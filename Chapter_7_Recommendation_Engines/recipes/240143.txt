Ingredients:
2 cups water
2/3 cup nonfat dry milk powder
1/2 cup margarine, melted
6 tablespoons white sugar
2 eggs
1/4 cup sucralose sugar substitute (such as SplendaÂ®)
4 teaspoons baking powder
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons ground thyme
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried minced onion
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups whole wheat flour
2 sweet-tart apples (such as Gala), cored and chopped
1/2 cup chopped celery

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Whisk water, milk powder, margarine, white sugar, eggs, sucralose, baking powder, salt, thyme, baking soda, onion powder, garlic powder, minced onion, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Whisk all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour into milk powder mixture until batter is thick. Fold apples and celery into batter; spoon into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Rotate muffin pans and bake until set and golden, 5 to 10 minutes more.

Description: 
I decided to combine my wheat muffin recipe with the rest of the ingredients that I use to make stuffing. These muffins make healthy finger food stuffing on-the-go. They are sweet and savory with a buttery-like taste.
