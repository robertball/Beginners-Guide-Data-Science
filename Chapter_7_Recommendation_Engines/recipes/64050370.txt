Ingredients:
4 Cups uncooked rolled oats
¼ C oat flour
½ C sunflower seeds
¼ C flax seeds
¼ C pumpkin seeds
½ t salt
¼ c agave syrup
¼ C honey
¼ C canola oil
1 t vanilla extract
¾ C raisins

Directions:
Heat oven to 300F.
In a large bowl, mix the oats, oat flour, seeds, and salt together.
Stir together separately the liquid ingredients.
Add the liquid to the dry ingredients and thoroughly combine.
Spread onto a baking sheet with sides (I use a jelly roll pan).  Bake in preheated oven 25 minutes.
Remove the baking sheet from the oven, dump the raisins over top, and stir thoroughly with a spatula, scraping the pan, to combine.  This will keep it from over-browning on the bottom and edges.
Return to the oven and bake an additional 12 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet.  As it cools it will get crispy.
Store in a sealed container and use within 10 days.  (May be stored longer in the refrigerator or freezer.)

Description: 
Full of fiber and healthy fats, I came up with this recipe to give myself a healthy option where I don't have to worry about my tree nut allergy.  The whole family enjoys it either eaten as cereal, or sprinkled over yogurt and fruit.
