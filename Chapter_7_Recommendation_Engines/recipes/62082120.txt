Description: 
I use bacon instead of ham and frozen hash brown potatoes in this pea soup.  Its a good winter comfort food and  smells wonderful while cooking.  It freezes well, so when my husband and I  are busy all day, its a quick dinner for us.  I add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.
