Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds large shrimp - peeled and deveined
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 tablespoon ground white pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup ice water
2 cups shredded coconut
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
1/2 cup orange marmalade
1/4 cup Dijon-style prepared mustard
1/4 cup honey
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

Directions:
Peel, devein and wash shrimp. Dry well on paper towels.
Mix together flour, cornstarch, salt and white pepper. Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and the ice water. Stir to blend.
Pour the coconut into a shallow pan. Dip the shrimp one at a time into the batter, then roll the shrimp in the coconut. Once coated, place each shrimp into a frying pan of oil heated to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry the shrimp in the hot oil until lightly browned; about 4 minutes.
Bake the fried shrimp in a preheated 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) oven for 5 minutes.
Make the dipping sauce: combine marmalade, mustard, honey and hot sauce in a small bowl. Mix well. Serve the shrimp and dipping sauce side by side.
