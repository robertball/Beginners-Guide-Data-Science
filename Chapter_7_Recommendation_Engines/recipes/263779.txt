Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups coconut milk
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup crushed pineapple
1 medium banana, chopped
Pineapple Topping:
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup butter
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple tidbits in juice, drained and juice reserved

Directions:
Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Add coconut milk, eggs, and oil; stir to combine. Stir in pineapple and banana until just combined; do not overmix.
Melt brown sugar and butter together in a saucepan over medium heat. Add pineapple tidbits and 1 tablespoon reserved pineapple juice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.
Preheat a griddle to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Pour 1/4-cup scoops of batter onto the hot griddle. Cook until bubbles form, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until set, about 5 minutes more.
Serve pancakes with the pineapple topping.

Description: 
I created this recipe when I wanted pancakes for dinner and wanted a fruit to round out the meal of pancakes and sausage. All I had was pineapple and this came about. Everything to make this I had in my cabinet.
