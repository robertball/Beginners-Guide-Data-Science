Ingredients:
olive oil 2 tbs
1/2 apple, chopped into bite size
1 stem celery, chopped into bite size
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped into bite size
1/3 onion, chopped into bite size
chicken tenders, chopped into bite size (thigh or breast are ok too) 2/3 pack
1 tbs red pepper paste (available at Asian markets)
white wine 1/4 cup
dash of lemon pepper
2 tbs sugar
1 tbs minced garlic
dash of black pepper

Directions:
In a medium size pan, stir fry olive oil, apple, celery, bell pepper, and onion for 4 minutes or until they get soft (they don't need to be cooked completely).
In the same pan, add chicken, red pepper paste, white wine, lemon pepper, sugar, garlic, black pepper for 3 minutes or until chicken is just cooked (overcooking results in hard texture of chicken)
Serve with a bowl of steamed white rice (optional)
