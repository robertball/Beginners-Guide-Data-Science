Ingredients:
2 pounds pork shoulder roast
1 1/4 cups caffeinated pepper-type soda (such as Dr PepperÂ®)
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
2/3 cup salsa verde
1 habanero pepper, diced (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place pork shoulder fat-side-up in a slow cooker. Cover with soda, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Cover and cook on Low until pork is tender and can be easily pulled apart with a fork, 8 to 10 hours.
Remove any bones and solid hunks of fat from pork and discard. Shred with 2 forks; stir pork into its juices. Add brown sugar, green chiles, salsa verde, and habanero pepper. Season with salt and pepper. Stir well to combine.
Cover and cook on Low until flavors are absorbed, about 1 hour.
