Ingredients:
2 8-ounce packages of cream cheese,
softened
3/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 to 2/3 package of almond toffee
bits (Bits 'O Brickle)
Fuji apple slices, or any other tart apple like a Granny Smith

Directions:
Mix softened cream cheese and sugars with electric mixer until well blended.
Stir in toffee bits and serve with slices of Fuji apples.
It's best to add toffee bits right before serving as they will eventually get soft after they are mixed with the cream cheese; that is, if the dip lasts that long!  Always good to use lemon juice or Fruit-Fresh on the apple slices to keep them from turning brown.

Description: 
This recipe came from my niece and so will forever be known to us as Emily's Apple Dip.  BIG hit with young and old alike - I've seen grown men fight over the last of the apple slices to dip with!  Long ago lost track of how many times I've given out this recipe.  Any kind of apple will do; but the perfect compliment to the sweetness of this dip is a tart apple like a Granny Smith or Fuji apple.
