Ingredients:
1 (10.75) can condensed Cream of Onion Soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed Cheddar cheese soup
1/2 cup milk
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon paprika
6-8 large baking potatoes, scrubbed and parboiled for 5 minutes, let cool, and peel
2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Grease a 9x13 casserole dish.
After the parboiled  potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them, if you choose.
Slice potatoes 1/4 inch thick.
In a mixing bowl combine the soups, milk, parmesan cheese, paprika and add salt and black pepper, to taste.
Spoon a 1/4 cup of the soup mixture over the bottom of the casserole dish.
Arrange a layer of potatoes and then more soup, then a light layer of shredded cheese. Layer until all of the ingredients have been used.
Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake until the casserole is bubbly and the potatoes fully cooked, and fork tender, about 45 minutes.
Uncover the casserole.
Sprinkle the remaining Cheddar cheese over the top of the casserole.
Return to the oven and bake 5-10 minutes until the cheese is melted and browned to your likings.
Let casserole rest for about 5 minutes, after taking out of the oven.
