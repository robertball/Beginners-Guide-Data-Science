Ingredients:
3 cups of Multigrain flour
1 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. yeast
1 and 1/2 cups warm water  (110 degrees)
some extra flour, about 2-3 tbsp.

Directions:
Place flour, salt and yeast in a deep bowl.
Stir well.
Add the water and stir,don't over mix.
Cover with plastic wrap and place  bowl on a tea towel in a warm place to rise.
Leave on the counter for 4-10 hours.The longer it sits the better the yeast will ferment.
Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured counter, about 1-2 tbsp.
Fold the dough 10-15 times, it will be sticky.
Rinse the bowl out and line it with parchment paper. Try and smooth
the parchment paper so it sits  flat against the bowl.
Put a dutch oven in your oven and turn your oven to 400 degrees.
With a scraper scoop the dough  into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
Set the bowl on a tea towel and set your timer for 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes remove the dutch from the oven  and carefully lift the dough
and parchment paper into the dutch oven.
Place the lid on and place in the oven.
Allow this to bake for 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes remove the lid and bake for 10 more minutes.
Remove from oven and carefully lift the parchment paper/loaf
on to a cooling rack.
Remove the parchment paper.
I put the dough in the oven with the light on to let it rise.
Make sure to keep it away from drafts
I let this rise for 4 and 1/2 hours.
NOTE: this can be made with whole wheat flour also.
