Ingredients:
Brownies:
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup white sugar
4 fluid ounces coffee-flavored liqueur (optional)
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup melted butter
Peanut Butter Cookies:
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 (4 ounce) packages white chocolate (such as Baker'sÂ®), broken into pieces, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine 2/3 cup flour, cocoa powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon baking powder in a large bowl.
Stir 3/4 cup sugar, coffee liqueur, 2 eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Add melted butter and the flour mixture; stir and spread batter into an ungreased 9x13-inch baking pan.
Sift 1 1/3 cups flour, baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl.
Beat peanut butter, unsalted butter, brown sugar, and 1/2 cup white sugar together in another large bowl using an electric mixer. Beat in 1 egg and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Stir in flour mixture. Place peanut butter cookie dough on top of the brownie mixture in the baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookie layer is golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes. Cut into squares and leave in the pan until fully cool, about 20 minutes more.
Place white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in microwave until melted, about 30 seconds. Place melted chocolate in a resealable plastic sandwich bag and cut a very tiny hole in a corner. Drizzle white chocolate over cooled cookie brownies.
