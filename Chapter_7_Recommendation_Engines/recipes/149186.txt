Ingredients:
3 large onions, cut into thin slices
8 large green bell peppers, cut into thin strips
3 jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced (optional)
6 tablespoons pickling spice
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Place onion, bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, pickling spice, sugar, salt, and vinegar into a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Pack pepper mixture into hot, sterilized canning jars, and fill with hot vinegar, leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Top with a sterilized lid, and screw on tops securely.
Place jars into a canner or large stockpot, and cover with 2 inches of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium, and simmer gently for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove jars and allow to cool to room temperature. Refrigerate any jars that did not seal. Refrigerate after opening.

Description: 
This recipe is great on anything that you would put relish on.  It's great on brats, hotdogs, and hamburgers.  The ingredients are very simple and consist of bell peppers and onions. Great for using up all those end of the season peppers. If you like it hot, you can add jalapeno peppers for a little spice.
