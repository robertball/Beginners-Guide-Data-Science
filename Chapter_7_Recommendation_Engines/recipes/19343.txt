Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup minced onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup minced celery
2 tablespoons butter
1 pound lean ground beef
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried mint
6 ounces fresh chopped mushrooms
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
2 (10.5 ounce) cans beef broth
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 pound spaghetti
1 teaspoon olive oil
3 tablespoons salt
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, for garnish
1/4 cup grated Romano cheese

Directions:
In a large skillet, warm olive oil over low heat; saute onion, garlic and celery until onion is transparent.
Stir in butter and increase heat to medium; brown beef until no longer pink. Mix in sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, mint and mushrooms; lower heat and stir for about 3 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine tomato paste and broth; pour liquid and basil to pot. Simmer over very low heat for about 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Bring a large pot of water to a vigorous boil with 3 tablespoons salt and 1 teaspoon olive oil.  Slip spaghetti into water holding on to ends until strands soften a bit.  Cook over high heat for 7 to 8 minutes only.  When properly cooked, raw taste should be gone but still have a firm texture.
When ready to serve, combine pasta with meat sauce; serve on a warmed platter or bowl topped with parsley and Romano cheese.
