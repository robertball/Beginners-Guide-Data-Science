Ingredients:
2 lbs ground beef
5 cloves minced garlic
2 onions finely minced
1/4 cup of green onions finely minced
1 egg
1 Tbs cinnamon
2 Tbs ground coriander
3 tsp cumin
1 tsp allspice
1 tsp ground ginger
1 1/2 tsp ground pepper
2 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp red pepper flakes
Extra virgin olive oil

Directions:
Thoroughly mix the ground beef with the spices and onions.
Add the egg to the beef mixture and mix until the egg is well incorporated. Cover and refrigerate for an hour to overnight.
Soak 24 6-in skewers in water for 15 minutes or more and set a grill to high heat.
Shape the kebabs into 24 cigar shaped patties, about 3/4 thick and 3 inches long. Insert the skewers into one side of the kebab with 3 to 3 1/2-inches visible.
Once the grill is well preheated (450 degrees or hotter) reduce the heat to low or bank the coals to one side. Spray/brush one side of the kebabs with olive oil and place them oil side down on the grill.
Grill for approximately 4 to 5 minutes, or until the meat starts to pull away from the grate. Spray/brush olive oil on the exposed side of the kebabs and flip them.
Grill for an additional 3 to 5 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 165.
