Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
4 ounces Roquefort or other blue cheese, crumbled
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
4 hamburger buns, split and toasted
1 tomato, sliced
1 red onion, sliced
4 leaves lettuce

Directions:
In a large bowl, lightly mix the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, mustard and pepper. Divide into 8 equal portions and flatten each one into 1/4 inch thick patty. In a separate bowl, combine the crumbled bacon, Roquefort cheese and thyme. Place an equal portion of the bacon mixture onto 4 of the patties. Top with the remaining 4 patties, pressing the edges together to enclose the filling.
Preheat a grill for medium heat. When hot, lightly oil the grate.
Grill the patties for 6 to 8 minutes on each side, or until cooked through. Serve immediately on toasted buns, topped with tomato, onion and lettuce.

Description: 
This is one of our favorite hamburger recipes.  You can substitute bleu, gorgonzola, or feta for the Roquefort cheese. Don't forget the American fries!
