Ingredients:

Directions:
Lime Jello Salad
1 8 oz pkg lime jello
1 1/2 cup boiling water
1 8 oz pkg cream cheese
1 20 oz can crushed pineapple
2 cups whipping cream
1 cup chopped pecans or walnuts
Pour 1 cup boiling water over the jello mix in a large bowl.  Stir it until it is dissolved.  Add 1/2 pineapple juice.  Place it in the refrigerator to partially gel.  This is important that the jello is only partially jelled.
Meanwhile, cook the pineapple in a small saucepan until it boils.  Let it cook about 5 minutes.  Cool it to room temperature.
When the jello is partially gelled, blend the softened cream cheese into it until it is creamy.  Mix in the cooled, cooked pineapple.
Whip the cream until it is fluffy.  Fold it into the jello-cream cheese mixture.  Fold the nuts into the jello mixture, also.  Pour it all into a pretty crystal bowl and place it in the refrigerator to completely gel.

Description: 
This is a great recipe my mom got from my aunt.  She has made it every year for Thanksgiving.   It is a family tradition for us.  It can be made a day or two ahead of time, if you like.  It looks just beautiful in a cut crystal bowl.   Thanksgiving is not the same without it for us!!  We just gobble it up!
