Ingredients:
1/2 cup honey
2 tablespoons orange juice
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
3 tablespoons cumin seed, toasted and crushed
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
12 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
4 Cornish hens, split in half
Salt and pepper

Directions:
Combine glaze ingredients.
Preheat the oven to 400°F.
Rinse hens and blot dry. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Using about a third of the glaze, brush both sides of hen halves.
Place, skin side down, on a baking sheet with low sides. Place in oven and roast 10 minutes.
Turn heat down to 375°F, brush hens again with half the remaining glaze and roast 5 minutes.
Turn hens over and roast 10 minutes.
Brush with remaining glaze and roast until deep golden brown, about 5 minutes more. Let stand 10 minutes before serving
