1/2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 onion, sliced

1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
To taste: black pepper, garlic powder

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion, bell peppers, and garlic in oil until tender-crisp, stirring frequently. Stir in mushrooms after peppers are semi tender. Set aside.
Heat another large skillet over medium heat. Pour soy sauce and rice wine vinegar in pan, then add beef. Cook beef, stirring frequently, until done, about 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the beef into the veggie pan and cook over low-medium heat for another 10 minutes.

Description: 
A quick and easy way to get your pepper steak fix if you're normally a solo eater. I'm always looking for ways to cut down recipes for myself and this one went well for me. I served it over brown rice to complete the meal. Enjoy!
