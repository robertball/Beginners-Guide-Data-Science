Ingredients:
2 lbs. ground venison or beef
1 large onion
2 Tablespoons  butter or oil
3 slices day old bread
1 cup milk
1 Tablespoon apricot or peach jam
4 Tablespoons lemon juice
1/3 cup seedless raisins
10 dried apricots
2 Tablespoons  mild curry powder
12 almonds, slivered and toasted
1 teaspoon salt
6 bay leaves
2 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Beat eggs with half of the milk and set aside. Set aside bay leaves. Soak raisins, dried apricots, and up to 3 slices day old bread in half the milk. Sauté onions in butter or oil until clear. Mix all other ingredients well with sautéed onions. Spoon into 2 quart casserole or large quiche pan. Pour remaining eggs and milk over the mixture. Decorate the top of the casserole with the bay leaves in a pattern. Bake  at 350 for about 45 minutes until well set. (Note mixture should be very soft and moist when pressed into pan after adding the eggs and milk. If the milk and eggs do not almost cover the meat mixture you may need to add additional milk and eggs beaten together. The mixture should have a pudding or quiche consistency when baked. Serve over rice. The bay leaves are for flavor and should NOT be eaten.)
