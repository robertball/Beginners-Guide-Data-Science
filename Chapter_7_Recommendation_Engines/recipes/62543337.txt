Description: 
'We enjoyed a hearty breakfast bake during a visit to an Amish inn When I asked for the recipe, one of the ladies told me the ingredients right off the top of her head. I modified it to create this version my family loves. Try breakfast sausage in place of bacon.'Modified from: Amish Breakfast Casserole
