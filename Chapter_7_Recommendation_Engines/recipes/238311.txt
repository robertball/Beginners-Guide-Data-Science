Description: 
So many things are touted as 'miracle foods' these days, but invariably you find out the claims were false and the benefits exaggerated. I sure hope that doesn't turn out to be the case with these grain-free, gluten-free, dairy-free, low-carb, low-cal, and quite delicious yuba noodles. So what's the catch? It's tofu.
