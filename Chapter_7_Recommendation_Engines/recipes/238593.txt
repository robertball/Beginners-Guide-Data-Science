Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
2 1/2 cups mayonnaise
1/4 cup white vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons seasoned salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
2 (5 ounce) cans chunk light tuna in water, drained and flaked
2 (4 ounce) cans baby shrimp, drained
1 large cucumber, seeded and chopped
1 small sweet onion, chopped
4 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
2 hard-boiled eggs, sliced
1 pinch paprika

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain. Rinse macaroni with cold water until chilled; drain.
Mix mayonnaise, white vinegar, seasoned salt, sugar, garlic powder, and black pepper in a large bowl with a whisk until smooth. Stir tuna, baby shrimp, cucumber, and sweet onion into the mayonnaise mixture to coat ingredients completely; add chopped eggs and stir. Pour chilled macaroni into the bowl and stir; top with sliced eggs. Garnish salad with paprika.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour to overnight before serving.

Description: 
This was my Mom's recipe. She never wrote anything down, so the amounts on the seasonings are estimates and 'to taste.' She always said the key ingredient was 'love.'
