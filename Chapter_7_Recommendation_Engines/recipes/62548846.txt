Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1 cup powdered sugar
1 cup softened butter
2 teaspoons vanilla
1/4 cup powdered sugar (optional-see directions)

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
Mix together the flour with the powdered sugar.
Add in softened butter and mix together until blended.
Add vanilla and mix until slightly fluffy.
Use a cookie scooper to make roughly 1 inch balls.
Roll in powdered sugar (optional)
Then place on un-greased cookie sheet.
When they come out of the oven, immeditly put them on a cooling rack, and sprinkle with powdered sugar. This step is also optional.
*If you don't have or want to use a mixer, such as a Kitchen Aid, you can use a pastry cutter, this helps with cutting the butter into the flour mixture.*
**Also, cooking time depends on how 'done' you want the cookies. I bake mine at 30 minutes, just so the edges of the cookies start to get just slightly brown.**

Description: 
This recipe is one that I found online, and then changed it up a bit, to make it my own. They are a little sweeter than your usual shortbread cookie, but aren't TOO sweet, just the perfect amount of sweetness.
