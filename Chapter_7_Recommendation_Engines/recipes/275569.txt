Ingredients:
1 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup boiling water
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs, room temperature
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup raw sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste
1 1/2 cups diced plums

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine oats and water in a medium bowl. Let sit for 20 minutes.
Combine brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter, white sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Add oatmeal mixture and mix until combined.
Sift flour, baking soda, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and allspice together in a bowl. Add to oatmeal mixture.
Place 2 tablespoons butter in a 9-inch square baking pan and melt in the preheated oven. Remove from the oven and sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on top. Sprinkle plums evenly over sugar. Pour batter over plums and spread evenly.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.

I was trying to use up our plum harvest and became inspired to try and make a wholesome version of a pineapple upside-down cake using plums.
