Ingredients:
2 pounds ground venison
3 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, chopped
5 ounces blue cheese crumbles
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 yellow onion, chopped
5 banana peppers, chopped
6 hamburger buns

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix venison, chipotle peppers, blue cheese, and garlic in a large bowl. Divide mixture into 6 equal parts and shape into patties.
Grill on the preheated grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted horizontally into the center registers 160 degrees F, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and banana peppers until onions are lightly golden, about 7 minutes. Top burgers with the onion mixture; serve with hamburger buns.

Description: 
It may be a mouthful but you'll be happy to fill your mouth with this burger. This was an experiment that ended up in my husband's top 2 meals - and those are tough to earn. For burger toppings, the best combination I found was using mayo and Dijon mustard with lettuce and tomatoes.
