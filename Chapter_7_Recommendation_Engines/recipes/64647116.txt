Ingredients:
1 medium sized zucchini
2-3 tablespoons olive oil or coconut oil
2 cloves garlic (minced)
2-3 cups fresh baby spinach
1/2 cup fresh basil (thinly sliced)
2 tablespoons sunflower seeds
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Using a peeler, shave ribbons of zucchini until you reach the seeds.
Heat a large saute pan over medium heat.  Add in oil and once hot, toss in zucchini and garlic.  Use tongs to coat with oil and garlic for 30 seconds.
Add in spinach and cook for about 2 minutes.
Add in basil, sunflower seeds, salt, and pepper--cook for another 2 minutes.
Serve in a large platter and drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil before serving

Description: 
Serving this dish with fresh grilled fish is a perfect combination.  Zucchini  (courgette) can be grilled, fried, sauteed, or eating raw in a salad.  I grew up eating zucchini and eggs for breakfast and now, I just love making pasta with this versatile vegetable!

**Cindy's Tip!--A mandolin works great for creating ribbons but a vegetable peeler is also a wonderful tool in the kitchen.  You may want to discard the first few as it will be the green only from the zucchini's skin **
