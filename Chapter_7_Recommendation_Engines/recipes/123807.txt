Ingredients:
1 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
GLAZE:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
Food coloring

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add egg and extracts. Combine flour and baking powder; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well. (Dough will be very stiff. If necessary, stir in the last cup of flour mixture by hand. Do not chill.) On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut out cookies into desired shapes. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F for 6-7 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool 2 minutes before removing to wire racks; cool completely. For glaze, combine the sugar, water and corn syrup until smooth. Tint with food coloring if desired. Using a small brush and stirring glaze often, brush on cookies, decorating as desired.

Description: 
I collect cookie cutters (I have over 5,000!), so a good cutout recipe is a must. These cookies are crisp and buttery-tasting with just a hint of lemon, and the dough handles nicely.
