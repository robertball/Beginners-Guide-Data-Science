Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 cups milk
6 ounces Muenster cheese, or more to taste, cubed
4 ounces Cheddar cheese, cubed
2 cups cooked white rice
2 cooked chicken breasts, chopped
2 cups seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 cup melted butter

Directions:
Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a large saucepan; slowly whisk in milk. Cook over medium heat until thick and bubbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Continue cooking for 2 more minutes. Remove from heat and add Muenster and Cheddar cheeses. Let sit for a few minutes and then stir until cheeses have melted.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir cooked rice and cooked chicken into the cheese sauce and pour into a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
Mix bread crumbs and melted butter together in a small bowl. Spoon over the top of the casserole.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and heated through, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This chicken casserole with rice is a recipe I made up when my husband and I were first married. It is now a family favorite. My son Ian has it every year on his birthday.
