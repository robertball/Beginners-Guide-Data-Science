Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pound carrots, cut into thin half-rounds
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1/2 teaspoon ground chile pepper
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
3 cups water
1 cup lentils
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup Greek yogurt

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir carrots, tomato paste, ground chile pepper, and sea salt into onion mixture; cook and stir until heated through, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.
Combine water and lentils in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover saucepan, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove lid, increase heat to medium-high, and stir in carrot-onion mixture; cook until liquid is almost all evaporated, about 2 minutes more. Season carrots and lentils with salt and pepper and cool to room temperature.
Serve carrots and lentils with a spoonful of Greek yogurt.
