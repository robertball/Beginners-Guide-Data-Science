Ingredients:
1 (1 inch) piece turmeric root, peeled and diced
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
2 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1 1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Grind turmeric and sea salt into a fine paste using a mortar and pestle. Rub paste evenly over chicken thighs. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for flavors to develop, about 1 hour.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place chicken in hot oil and cook until brown underneath, about 8 minutes. Flip and cook second side until browned, about 8 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
