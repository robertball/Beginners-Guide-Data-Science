Mix all together, form into walnut sized balls, its incredibly sticky and your hands will be covered in it, but I promise its worth it ;) roll balls in icing sugar and place on cookie sheet, when all batter is on sheet, freeze 1 hr and place in seal-able zip bag. Eat straight from freezer. The cereal is full of air so they never freeze completely hard and taste sooo yummy you will want to double the batch. If they thaw they go back to sticky again, can be on a plate not in freezer for up to 45 min. Then need to be chilled again... if there are any left.
