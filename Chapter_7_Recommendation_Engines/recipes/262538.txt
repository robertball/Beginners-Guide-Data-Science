Description: 
This is a flavor party in your mouth and it only takes 10 minutes to cook in an electric pressure cooker! Tender and juicy and flavorful jerk chicken breasts! Pictured served with Big Easy red beans and rice with Normandy vegetables. I used some of the juice from the cooked jerk chicken to flavor the vegetables. You can serve with your favorite sauce, such as barbeque, but it is very flavorful as-is!
