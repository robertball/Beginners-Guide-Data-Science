4 - 6 stalks celery, chopped
2 Tbs minced garlic (from a jar)
2 Tbs dried parsley

Stir well and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours on low, stirring occasionally. Add celery, Chinese vegetables and shiitake mushrooms. Simmer for 30 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
I've combined the recipes of my grandmother and mother-in-law, with a few of my own touches to create a really good and simple homemade chow mien. Hubby requests this often and says it's even better then his Mother's recipe, which is quite the compliment! I serve it with egg rolls and buttered white rice.
