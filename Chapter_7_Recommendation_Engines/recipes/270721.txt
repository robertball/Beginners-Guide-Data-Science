Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage
3 carrots, chopped
3 ribs celery, chopped
1/2 large red onion, chopped
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 (14 ounce) can no-salt-added cannellini beans, undrained
2 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste
water to cover

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add sausage and cook until browned, breaking apart with a wooden spoon. Stir in carrots, celery, and red onion; cook until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in beans with their liquid.
Add potatoes, thyme, oregano, salt, and pepper to the saucepan. Pour in enough water to cover, about 1 1/2 cups. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender and soup thickens, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is simple fare that the whole family will enjoy. I make this, or a close rendition, and freeze in batches for my toddler's lunches. But it's also a nice option for those times when you don't have a lot of time or headspace, but want to cook something from scratch that's satisfying and tastes like it cooked for ages.
