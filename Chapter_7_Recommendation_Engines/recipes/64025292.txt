Ingredients:
12 oz. good quality bittersweet chocolate - chopped
3/4 cup sugar
1 tbsp. light corn syrup
1 cup heavy cream
3 sticks unsalted butter - softened
3/4 tsp. flaky sea salt

Directions:
Put chocolate in a medium bowl.
Bring sugar, corn syrup and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar.
Boil, swirling pan occasionally and brushing down sides of pan with a wet pastry brush, until mixture turns a deep amber color - about 10-12 minutes.
Remove from heat and whisk in cream - mixture will bubble vigorously.
Return to medium heat and cook, stirring until smooth - about 2 minutes.
Pour caramel over chocolate and stir until mixture is smooth.
Let cool, stirring occasionally.
Using an electric mixture, beat chocolate mixture, gradually adding butter, until frosting is thickened and smooth - about 1 minute.
Chill, stirring occasionally, until stiff enough to spread easily - about 20-25 minutes.
Use salt to sprinkle on top of frosted cake.
