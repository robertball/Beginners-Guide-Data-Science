Ingredients:
9 graham crackers, crushed
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 1/4 cups miniature marshmallows
1 1/3 cups candy-coated milk chocolate pieces (such as M&M;'sÂ®)

Directions:
Place graham crackers in a food processor; process into crumbs.
Combine graham cracker crumbs and brown sugar in a bowl; mix well.
Pour milk chocolate pieces into bottom of 1-quart jar. Layer marshmallows on top of chocolate.
Fit a resealable plastic bag into the jar over the marshmallows, with the opening pulled over the mouth of the jar. Spoon crumb mixture into the bag gradually, patting mixture down to fill the bag tightly. Seal the bag and close the jar.
