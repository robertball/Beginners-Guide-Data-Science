Ingredients:
1 sheet puff pastry
2 leeks, white part only (and a tiny bit of light green).  Rinsed really well (I separate the rings and rinse because sometimes they can be sandy).  Sliced in thin slices.
5 strips bacon
2 eggs
½ cup 15% cream
½ cup plain yogourt
Ground black pepper
Grated old cheddar

Directions:
Heat over to 425.
Slice up bacon in small bits and fry in frying pan until brown.  Add the leeks and fry on medium-low until soft and brown (at least 10 minutes).
Place parchment paper in pie plate.  Stretch dough out a bit (by gently pulling it four times from each side) and lay it inside the pie plate.  The four corners should be hanging out quite a bit.
Sprinkle a little grated cheese on the dough (about 1/2 cup).  Scrape all of the leek mixture inside the dough.
In a bowl blend together then eggs, cream and yogurt.  Pour on top of the leeks.  Grind pepper over the whole thing.  Sprinkle a little bit of cheese on top (about ¼ cup).
Fold the pie crust over top the quiche.  pop in oven.  Bake til golden brown (about ½ hour) although I leave it in based on appearance, not time.
It’s actually best eaten at or near room temperature, not hot.
