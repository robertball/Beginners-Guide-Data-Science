Description: 
The potatoes in this recipe provide starch and don't add flavor. You won't even know there are potatoes in it. You will only taste a sweet confection. When adding the confectioners' sugar and peanut butter, be aware that the amounts are approximate. You may add more or less, depending on your tastes.
