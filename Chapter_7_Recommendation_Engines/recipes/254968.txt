Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/4 large onion, diced
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TELÂ®)
2 green tomatoes, diced
1 tablespoon capers
1 pinch dried basil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 pounds tilapia fillets
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in diced tomatoes, green tomatoes, capers, basil, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
Season tilapia fillets with salt and pepper.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add tilapia fillets; cook until flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a serving platter.
Pour lemon juice into the skillet; swirl to pick up browned bits off the bottom of the skillet, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Pour over fillets.
Spoon tomato mixture over fillets before serving.

Description: 
The tapenade is great in pasta, served as an appetizer on bread rounds, or over another mild fish or thin chicken breast. It's a great way to use up your green tomatoes at the end of the season. You can also make a big batch and freeze it. It is a nice taste of late summer when it's cold out. I do have to say, I think this is good enough; I am looking forward to summer's first tomatoes that might just not get a chance to ripen!
