Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (4 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 cup diced celery
1/3 cup diced onion
1/2 cup water
1 1/2 cubes chicken bouillon
2 (12 ounce) cans garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed
1 egg
2 teaspoons dried sage
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a glass baking dish with cooking spray.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Cook the mushrooms, garlic, celery, and onion in the olive oil 3 to 5 minutes. Add the water and bouillon; cook and stir until the bouillon is dissolved.
Combine the garbanzo beans, egg, sage, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mash together with your hands until thoroughly mixed; stir in the vegetable mixture; transfer to the prepared baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes; remove the foil and bake uncovered another 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
After the holidays, I had an extra turkey breast in my freezer. Since starting the 'South Beach Diet,' I couldn't figure out how I could make a great stuffing for phase one. I think I have come close. This is a lot better than I even though it would be!
