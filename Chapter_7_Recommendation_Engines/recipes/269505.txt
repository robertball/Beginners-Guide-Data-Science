Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/3 cups buttermilk
Maple Buttercream Frosting:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup shortening
1/2 cup maple syrup
1 pinch salt
2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
6 strips cooked bacon, crumbled
1 teaspoon raw sugar, or as desired

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fill 48 mini muffin cups with paper liners.
Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract.
Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Add to the sugar mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, alternating with buttermilk. Mix well after each addition. Fill muffin cups 2/3 full of batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 18 to 21 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack before frosting, at least 20 minutes.
Beat butter and shortening together until fluffy to start the frosting. Beat in maple syrup and salt. Add confectioners' sugar; beat until smooth. Frost the cooled cupcakes and sprinkle bacon crumbles and raw sugar on top.

Description: 
This recipe was given to me by a close friend. I was headed to a bacon party and the dessert list was quite limited.  These cupcakes were eaten before the entrees and disappeared quickly! The bacon is the clincher. It is a must and the buttermilk in the batter makes it taste amazing.
