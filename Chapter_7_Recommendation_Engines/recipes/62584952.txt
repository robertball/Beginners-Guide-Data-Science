Ingredients:
6 King's Hawaiian sweet rolls
4 green onions, diced
3 slices of bacon, cooked and diced
scant 1/2 cup of shredded swiss cheese
scant 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese
3 eggs
2/3 cup half and half
1/2 cup skim milk
2 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan
salt
pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350.
Cube the rolls (8 cubes per roll) and spread on a baking sheet in a single layer.  Toast at 350 for 10 minutes.  This may be done up to 24 hours in advance.
Layer the toasted bread cubes in a 1.5 qt baking dish.  Sprinkle 1/2 the green onions, 1/2 of the bacon, and 1/2 of the swiss and cheddar cheeses on top of the bread.  Shake the dish so that the toppings settle into the bread a bit.
In a small mixing bowl, beat the eggs with the milk, cream, a pinch of salt, and a dash of black pepper.  Pour the mixture over the bread cubes, making sure to pour over all cubes.  Using the back of a wooden spoon or spatula, press the cubes down into the mixture a bit.
Sprinkle the remaining green onion, bacon, and cheese on top.
Place the dish in the oven, uncovered, and bake for about 30 minutes, or until hot in the center.
