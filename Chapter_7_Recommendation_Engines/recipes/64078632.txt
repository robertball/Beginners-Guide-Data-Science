Ingredients:
Cabbage (One Head)
Extra light Olive oil (2 Tbs)
Minced Garlic (2 Tbs)
Salt (1/2 Tsp)
Pepper (1/2 Tsp)

Directions:
Set oven to 350 degrees. Cut the bottom off of the cabbage and set it so that the flat end is on the cutting board. Slice the cabbage about an inch thick and place each slice flat in a casserole dish.  Drizzle the slices with olive oil then sprinkle them with minced garlic.  Then add salt and pepper, as little or as much as you would like. Cover the casserole dish with foil and place it in the oven for 45 minutes. The slices should be tender enough that a fork will easily pierce the core of the cabbage.
