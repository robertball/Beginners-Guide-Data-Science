Ingredients:
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup quinoa
1 sweet potato, peeled and cubed
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 egg
1/8 cup plain potato chips
1 avocado, pitted, peeled, and sliced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and broth has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Keep warm.
Meanwhile, place sweet potato in a bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until potato is tender and crispy, 20 to 25 minutes.
Heat remaining olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook egg to desired doneness, about 5 minutes.
Layer quinoa, roasted sweet potato, potato chips, and avocado in a serving bowl. Top with fried egg and cilantro.
