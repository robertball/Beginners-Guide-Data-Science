Ingredients:
For the brine:
1/4 c. sugar + 1/4 c. Kosher salt
or
1/2 c. Kosher salt
Water to cover ribs
For the dry rub:
1 1/2 Tbsp. Paprika
1 1/2 Tbsp. Chili Powder
1 3/4 tsp. ground cumin
1 1/2 tsp. brown sugar (pref. dark)
3/4   tsp. salt
3/4   tsp. oregano
3/4   tsp. pepper

Directions:
Prepare brine in container large enough to hold the ribs.  Combine sugar & salt or just salt, with cold water and stir to dissolve.
Rinse and pat ribs dry to remove any residue from packaging.  Submerge ribs in brine and leave standing in a cool place for 30 minutes to one hour.
Meanwhile, line a large rimmed baking sheet with heavy foil and mix all dry rub ingredients in a small bowl.
Remove ribs from brine and drain.  Place on baking sheet and rub both sides with the spice rub.  Bake in a slow oven (275 degrees for 3 hours or 300 degrees for 2 1/2 hours), turning ribs every 30 minutes.
Remove from oven and place on cutting board and cut into serving size pieces.

Description: 
My friend Margaret, who shared this with me, got it from a physical therapy patient she worked with.  It is the best rib recipe I've ever had, including at restaurants known for their ribs.  And best of all, you can cook it in the oven and don't have to fire up a grill.
