Ingredients:
2 (2oz) large boxes instant vanilla pudding mix (fat free, sugar free variety)
1 (1oz) small box instant banana creme pudding mix (fat free, sugar free variety)
6 cups skim milk
2 (8oz) containers whipped topping (fat free variety)
3 ripe bananas
1 box fat-free vanilla wafers

Directions:
Allow the whipped topping to thaw for at least 10 minutes, if frozen.
In large stand mixer, whisk all 3 boxes of pudding mix and the cold milk for 2 minutes on medium-high speed.
Reduce speed to medium-low and add the whipped topping, a few tablespoons at a time, until fully incorporated.
Pour 2/3 of the mixture into serving bowl. Cut bananas into small rounds and add evenly over pudding. Pour remaining mixture over, covering the banana slices.
Allow pudding to set for 5 minutes. Decorate with wafers and serve cold.

No one ever believes me when I try to explain to them that this banana pudding is fat free and low calorie and took me less than 10 minutes to make. It's like the skinny cousin of grandma's old-fashioned dessert... fluffy, creamy, delicious and guilt-free!
