Ingredients:
CRUST
1 3/4  C. finely crushed Ritz crackers
1/3 C. melted butter
FILLING
24 oz. cream cheese, softened to room temperature
4 large eggs, room temperature
1 dry packet Good Season Italian Dressing OR 1 dry packet Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing
1 tsp.  Worcester sauce
1/2 C. dry blue cheese, softened to room temperature
2 C. finely shredded cheddar cheese, room temperature

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350
Place a baking dish filled with hot water onto the bottom rack of the oven and put the top rack directly over the water filled pan
Spray the sides and the bottom of a 9" spring form pan with non-stick spray
In a small bowl mix the crushed crackers and the melted butter together and pour into the prepared pan
Press the crumbs evenly along the bottom and up the sides of the pan about a 1/2 "
Place the crust into the freezer while you prepare the filling
In a large mixing bowl beat the cream cheese until creamy
Add the eggs, one at a time, a mix well after each addition
Add the remaining ingredients and mix on medium high until smooth
Pour the filling mixture into the chilled crust
Place on the rack, directly above the pan of water
Bake @ 350 for about 40 minutes
Check to see if the cheesecake is firm around the side, but very slightly jiggles in the middle
If the cheesecake looks too loose or watery, bake in 5 minute increments, until the only the center jiggles very slightly
Turn off the oven and open the oven door slightly ajar and set the time for 15 minutes
Remove the cheese cake from the oven onto a cooking rack
Using a steak knife, dipped in water, gently run the knife around the edge of the cake
Loosen the lock on the pan and set the time for 15 minutes
Remove the sides of the pan and allow the cake to cool completely
Wrap loosely with foil and keep in the refrigerator until ready to serve
To serve, allow the cheesecake to come to room temperature and serve with crackers or toasted baguette  slices
May be frozen
For smaller parties, cut into fourths and freeze and serve what you need and freeze the rest
