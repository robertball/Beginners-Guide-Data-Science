Ingredients:
10 lbs russet potatoes
Vegetable oil
Salt & Pepper
Onion powder

Directions:
Peel all the potatoes and put into a large bowl of cold water.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Remove 1 potato from the water and slice into 1 inch cubes, placing it into a plastic freezer bag.  Continue on with the rest of the peeled potatoes.  You may need to use a few plastic bags.
Once all diced, pour some oil in the bag, season with salt & pepper and some onion powder to your liking.
Spread out onto rimmed baking sheets and bake for 30 minutes, moving them around one time during baking.
Removed baking sheets from oven, let cool right on the baking sheet.  Once cooled, wash one of the baking sheets and place 1/2 the potatoes on it in a single layer and put in the freezer.  Once frozen, remove to a large plastic freezer bag and freeze.  Repeat with remaining potato cubes.
