Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles
3 eggs
1/3 cup white sugar
2 apples - peeled, cored and finely chopped
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup cottage cheese
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup raisins
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons chopped walnuts
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Grease an 8-inch square microwave-safe glass baking dish. Beat the eggs together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the cooked noodles, white sugar, chopped apples, sour cream, cottage cheese, cinnamon, salt, and raisins; mix until combined. Pour the mixture into the prepared dish.
Microwave on medium high (70% power) for 7 minutes.
Combine the brown sugar and chopped walnuts in a bowl, and cut in the butter to form a crumbly topping. Sprinkle the topping over the pudding. Return the pudding to the microwave and cook on medium high (70% power) until the pudding is firm in the center, 7 to 9 minutes.

Description: 
My grandmother made this dish for every family gathering. My Jewish grandfather insisted it tasted just like how his mother use to make it. Not only was it good as a side dish, but it's excellent as a morning treat or dessert.
