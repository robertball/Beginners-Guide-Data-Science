Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, room temperature
2 cups pumpkin puree
14 ounces sweetened condensed milk
3 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch single crust pie

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pastry-lined pie plate on a baking sheet.
Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until fluffy; gradually add condensed milk and beat until smooth. Stir in pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spice, and eggs. Mix until well combined. Pour batter into the pie shell.
Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted 1 inch from the edge comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Allow to cool for about an hour. Serve warm.
