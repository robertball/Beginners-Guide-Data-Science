Ingredients:
500g chicken nibbles
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon mirin
1 tablespoon sriracha (chilli sauce)
1 tablespoon liquid honey
1 tablespoon sesame oil (can use any, sesame oil adds to the flavour)
2 or 3 cloves minced garlic
3 thin slices of ginger
1 teaspoon chilli flakes

Directions:
Preheat oven 425 degrees.
In a mixing bowl, toss chicken wings with salt, pepper and baking powder evenly. Place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet and bake 20 minutes. Make sure wings are at least ½-inch apart so they have room to cook evenly and get crispy. Flip the wings over and bake additional 20 minutes or until wings are fully cooked and golden brown.
Meanwhile, let’s make Asian Zing sauce!? In a cold wok, add sesame oil, crushed garlic, ginger and Thai chili flakes. Now turn on heat to low and let it infuse flavors to oil, about 10 to 15 minutes.
Pour sauce mixture into wok, and increase heat to high. Bring sauce to a boil and keep stirring until sauce texture is syrupy and thick, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
By the time, your chicken wings are done cooking, remove from oven and transfer to wok. Heat the wok over high heat, and toss chicken wings evenly with sauce.
Serve on a plate!
