Ingredients:
FRY BREAD:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup water
1/4 cup nonfat dry milk
4 cups oil or lard for frying, or as needed
TOPPINGS:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 tsp. salt
2 cups pinto beans, with liquid
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded iceberg lettuce
2 cups diced tomatoes

Directions:
In a large skillet, over medium-high heat, cook the ground beef with salt to taste. Cover, and keep warm while you prepare the fry bread.
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir in water and nonfat dry milk, and mix until the dough comes together. Add more flour if necessary to be able to handle the sticky dough. Do not knead the dough. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes.
Heat oil in a large, deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep. Break off 3/4 cup sized pieces of dough, and shape into round discs 1/4 inch in thickness, making a thinner depressed area in the center. Fry breads in the hot oil until golden on both sides, turning only once. Drain on paper towels.
Top fry bread with beans, ground beef, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.
