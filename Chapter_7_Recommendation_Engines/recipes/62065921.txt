Ingredients:
2 medium packages Egg Noodles
1 tblsp Salt
1 tblsp Olive Oil
2 cans Cream of Celery Soup
1 can Cream of Mushroom Soup
1 can peas (drained) (OPTIONAL)
1/2 lb (8 oz) Velveeta Cheese
1 tsp Black Pepper
3 small cans of water packed (drained) Tuna Fish
1 cup Parmesean Cheese

Directions:
Prepare Egg Noodles per package directions - adding Salt and Olive Oil.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Melt Velveeta (I use microwave)
When noodles are cooked, strain well, place back in pan.  Add all soups, peas (if desired) melted velveta, black pepper and tuna fish.  Mix on stovetop until all ingredients are well mixed.  Place the entire contents of the pan in a large casserole dish.  Cover with Parmesean Cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20 - 30 minutes - checking frequently to ensure the parmesean does not scorch.
Remove and serve immediately.
