Description: 
I think this is a tangy, tasty, easy go-to sauce when I need it to be quick and dumped into the slow cooker.  I used a recipe similar to this but it only had three of the ingredients and I added more items to make it flavorful and to our liking...hope you do too!  We think it goes well with our favorite meatball recipe or as a sauce for our favorite meatloaf.
