Ingredients:
2 cups flour, I like to use Robin Hood Omega 3 flour with flax but you can use all purpose or 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 whole wheat
2 tsps baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp cinnamon
3/4 cup sugar
7/8 cup water or milk or juice
1/4 cup oil
1/2 cup mashed or finely chopped fruit of choice, or berries or raisins or chocolate chips
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
In a bowl whisk wet ingredients, add dry ingredients, stir to just combine, stir in your add in of choice.
Using a scoop divide batter evenly between 12 muffin cups.
Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 18 to 20 minutes until the tops are firm to the touch.
Cool on a rack for 5 minutes, remove from the muffin tins to finish cooling.
These freeze very well, I make them for my sons lunches.
