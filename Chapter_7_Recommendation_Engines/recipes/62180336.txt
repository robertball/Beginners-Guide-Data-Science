Ingredients:
1/4 cup pineapple or orange juice
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons white wine
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
1 clove garlic, minced
1/8 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 (4 ounce) tuna steaks

Directions:
In a large non-reactive dish, mix together the pineapple or orange juice, soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, white wine, cilantro, garlic, oregano, and pepper. Place the tuna steaks in the marinade and turn to coat. Cover, and refrigerate for 2 hours.
Sear in a red hot frying pan that has been wiped with a teaspoon of oil or sprayed with a little bit of non-stick cooking spray. Turn the Tuna Steaks every 30 seconds for 3-6 minutes depending on size of the steak. DO NOT OVER COOK! Steak should be pink in the middle. (See note below for cooking in George Foreman Grill or on an outside grill.)

Description: 
Succulent and tasty! These steaks are as satisfying as a beef steak as long as you do NOT overcook them. Tuna steaks can be grilled outdoors, grilled on a George Foreman Grill, or my personal favorite, Pan Seared.Modified from: Marinated Tuna Steak
