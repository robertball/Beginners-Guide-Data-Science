Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed
4 slices bacon, chopped
1/2 cup diced onion
1/2 cup chopped spinach
1/2 cup chopped mushrooms
6 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups with olive oil.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
Saute onion, spinach, and mushrooms in the same skillet until onions are soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.
Blend onion mixture in a blender until smooth. Beat onion mixture, eggs, feta cheese, and bacon together in a bowl until batter is well-combined. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 35 minutes.

Description: 
Paleo. Breakfast. On-the-go. For some reason individual cupcake liners don't work so well for these little quiches. Grease the tin with olive oil or butter.
