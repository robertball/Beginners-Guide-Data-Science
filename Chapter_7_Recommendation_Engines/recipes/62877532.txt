Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 eggs
2 cups mashed ripe bananas (4-5 medium)
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/3 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt. In a small bowl, whisk the eggs, bananas, sugar, applesauce, oil and vanilla. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.
Transfer to two 8-in. x 4-in. loaf pans coated with cooking spray. Sprinkle with walnuts. Bake at 350Â° for 45-55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. Yield: 2 loaves (12 slices each).

Description: 
I found this recipe on the Taste of Home website. It had 15 reviews, ALL of them 5 stars. Note - published recipe calls for 2 cups flour, one reviewer noted the loaf was dense, but baked with an extra 1/2 cup flour was light. All described as moist and tasting like traditional flour loaves. Published in Healthy Cooking, Dec/Jan 2010.
