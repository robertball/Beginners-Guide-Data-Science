Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds pork belly, cut into small pieces
3 cloves garlic, crushed
2 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
water to cover
oil for frying

Directions:
Combine pork belly, garlic, bay leaves, salt, and pepper in a skillet; pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until skin is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. Drain and let sit at room temperature until pork has air-dried.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fry pork in the hot oil, working in batches, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove fried pork with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
