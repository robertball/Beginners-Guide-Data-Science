Ingredients:
2 (1 pound) beef T-Bone or Porterhouse steaks, cut 1 inch thick
1 medium lemon
1 tablespoon Greek seasoning
1 medium cucumber, cut lengthwise in half, then crosswise into thin slices
2 cups halved grape tomatoes
1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese
Salt and pepper

Directions:
Grate peel and squeeze 1 tablespoon juice from lemon. Combine Greek seasoning and lemon peel. Reserve 2 teaspoons mixture for salad. Press remaining mixture evenly onto beef steaks.
Place steaks on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill, covered, 11 to 16 minutes (over medium heat on preheated gas grill, 15 to 19 minutes) for medium rare (145 degrees F) to medium (160 degrees F) doneness, turning occasionally.
Meanwhile, combine reserved 2 teaspoons seasoning mixture, lemon juice, cucumber, tomatoes and cheese in medium bowl, stirring to combine. Season with salt and pepper, as desired.
Remove bones; carve steaks into slices. Season with salt, as desired. Serve beef with cucumber and tomato salad.
