Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed (about 1 3/4 lb.)
1/4 cup + 3 tbsp. butter
2 eggs
1 tsp. vanilla
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1tsp. nutmeg
3/4 cup chopped pecans
1/3 cup flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a large pot, cover potato cubes with enough water to cover by 1 inch.  Over high heat, bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium and cook 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.  Drain potatoes and return them to the pot.  Mash them until they reach a smooth consistency and cool for about 15 minutes. Butter a 1 quart casserole dish.  Melt 1/4 cup butter, set aside.  In another bowl, lightly beat eggs; beat in vanilla, the melted butter and reserved potatoes.  Transfer the mixture to the casserole dish.  In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, pecans, nutmeg and flour -- gradually working in the 3 tbsp. butter until pea-sized crumbs form.  Sprinkle over potato mixuture and bake until the top is bubbly, 30-35 minutes.  Serve hot.

Description: 
This casserole is a great Thanksgiving or Christmas side dish, but can also be used on an everyday basis.  It's practically a dessert -- I always use extra pecans upon request!
