Ingredients:
4 fully cooked Al Fresco Chipotle Chorizo With Mango Chicken Sausage Links
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup flour
2 cups milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
6 fully cooked biscuits
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (topping)

Directions:
1. Chop up the sausage links as finely as possible. Brown the meat with the butter over medium heat in a non-stick frying pan. The sausage is already cooked so make sure not to overcook them.
2. Remove the sausage and place it in a bowl to the side. Keep all the drippings in the pan for the next step.
3. Stir in 1/4 cup of flour until well dissolved.
4. Add in 2 cups of milk and stir until you have a smooth liquidy mixture.
5. Let it sit a few minutes on medium heat. Once you see bubbles, stir in the seasonings.
6. Once blended, turn off the heat and let it sit uncovered to thicken.
7. Pour on top of your favorite biscuits, sprinkle cheese on top and serve.
