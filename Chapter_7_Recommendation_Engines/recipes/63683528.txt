Ingredients:
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking power
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 eggs

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt with oil, the sugar, the flour, the baking powder, and the vanilla.
Add the egg yolks, one by one, keeping the whites in a separate bowl.  Ask an adult to beat the egg whites into stiff peaks.  Delicately incorporate the beaten whites into the cake mixture.
Pour the dough into the lightly greased cupcake tin filling it half way.  Ask an adult to put the cakes in the oven pre-heated to 320 degrees F for 30 minutes.  When baked, remove the cakes from the baking tin and place them on a rack to cool.  Be careful not to burn yourself.
Decorate.
