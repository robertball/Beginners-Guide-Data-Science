1/2 (12 ounce) can frozen limeade concentrate, thawed
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
2 tablespoons tequila
1 tablespoon triple sec
1/2 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

Whisk together the limeade concentrate, milk, tequila, and triple sec in a bowl. Fold in the whipped topping, and pour into the prepared pie crust. Freeze until firm, at least 2 hours.

Description: 
Kind of like key lime pie with a kick. Not for children. Make it as potent as you like. I recommend adding a bit of sugar if you double the alcohol. Top with fresh sliced limes or strawberries for presentation.
