Ingredients:
up to 1 lb. Jerusalem artichokes or sunchokes
3/4 cup olive oil
sea salt to taste
2 tbsp. dried thyme
1 tbsp. minced garlic

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Wash and scrub the sunchokes. Trim away the eyes but do not peel.
Cut the sunchokes in half and/or into 1-inch pieces.
Put the oil, salt, and spices into a large bowl and mix. Add the sunchokes and toss until the pieces are drenched.
Lay the sunchoke pieces flesh side down on a baking sheet, spacing them out to leave a little room between.
Roast for up to 45 minutes or until tender. Serve immediately.
