Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1  onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons paprika
2 ¼ pounds chicken legs, thighs, and wings
1 ½ cups sweet peas
1 (7 ounce) can olives
2 links chorizo de bilbao (spicy Spanish semi-cured sausage), or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2  tomatoes, diced
1 cup water
2 cups glutinous sweet rice (malagkit)
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1  red bell pepper, sliced lengthwise
2  hard-boiled eggs, sliced lengthwise

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add paprika and mix well. Add chicken, sweet peas, olives, chorizo, salt, and pepper; mix thoroughly. Cover and cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook until juices are released, about 5 minutes. Add water; cook until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add sweet rice; mix well. Cover and cook until flavors blend, about 5 minutes.
Pour coconut milk into the skillet and bring to a boil. Cook until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add red bell pepper. Cover and cook until rice is tender and chicken is no longer pink near the bone, about 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with hard-boiled eggs.
