4 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
4 tablespoons butter2 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
6 fresh mushrooms, sliced
2 green onion, minced
1 1/2  cups heavy cream

Meanwhile, place chicken and Cajun seasoning in a bowl, and toss to coat.
In a large skillet over medium heat, saute chicken in butter until no longer pink and juices run clear, about 5 to 7 minutes.
