Ingredients:
1 cup BBQ sauce
1/2 cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 clove garlic, minced
4 salmon steaks

Directions:
Combine BBQ sauce, maple syrup, Dijon mustard, and garlic in a large resealable plastic bag. Add salmon steaks and marinate for at least 45 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.
Place salmon on the baking sheet. Drizzle marinade over salmon.
Bake in the preheated oven, turning halfway through, until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
I ran out of salmon marinade one day and threw maple syrup and BBQ sauce together to come up with this recipe. It's great served with potatoes or acorn squash!
