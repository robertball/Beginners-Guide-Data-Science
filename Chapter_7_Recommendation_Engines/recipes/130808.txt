Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound beef stew meat, cut into cubes
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
8 cloves garlic, minced
2 bay leaves
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 pinch salt
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 carrot, chopped
1 pinch paprika
1/2 fresh tomato, chopped
1 cup white wine
1 cup water
2 sprigs fresh parsley
3 red potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 sweet potato, peeled and cubed
1 (14.5 ounce) can green beans, drained

Directions:
Heat the oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Dust the beef with the flour. Place the beef, garlic, bay leaves, and pepper in the stockpot; cook until the beef is brown; season with salt and cook until beef is tender, about 5 minutes. Add the onion, green pepper, carrot, and paprika; cook until the onion softens, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato, wine, water, and parsley. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 30 minutes.
Mix in the red potatoes, sweet potatoes, and green beans; continue to cook until potatoes are easily pierced through with a fork, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is a favorite home meal from my mom. My sister had to write while my mom cooked in order to get the recipe right. It's easy and will impress anyone. Serve steaming hot on a bed of white rice.
