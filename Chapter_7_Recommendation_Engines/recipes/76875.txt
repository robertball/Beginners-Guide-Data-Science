Ingredients:
3/4 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed
1/2 cup butter
2 medium cucumbers, cut into 1/2 inch chunks
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon
1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place Brussels sprouts in a pot with enough lightly salted water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook 5 minutes, or until tender.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Place cucumbers in the skillet, and cook 5 minutes, until tender. Set aside cucumbers, and mix the flour into the butter to form a roux. Mix in the milk, bouillon, and pepper, and cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until thickened.
In a baking dish, mix the Brussels sprouts and cucumbers. Drizzle with the butter sauce, and gently toss to coat.
Cover, and bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven.
