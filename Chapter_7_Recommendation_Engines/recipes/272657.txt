Ingredients:
1 pound chicken cutlets, pounded to 1/4-inch thickness
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 eggs
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2/3 cup almond flour
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 cup avocado oil
1/4 pound shaved deli ham
1 cup shredded Swiss cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Season chicken cutlets with salt and pepper; set aside.
Whisk eggs and Dijon mustard together in a shallow bowl. Combine almond flour, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken cutlets into egg mixture, letting excess drip off. Dredge with almond flour mixture, then set on a plate.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken cutlets and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip over and cook until chicken is no longer pink inside and the juices are running clear, 3 to 4 minutes more.
Place chicken cutlets on a baking sheet. Top with slices of ham and cover with shredded Swiss cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese has melted, 4 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately.

All the flavors of traditional cordon bleu but keto friendly and much easier to assemble since there is no stuffing or rolling involved.
