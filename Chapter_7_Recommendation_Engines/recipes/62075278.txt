Ingredients:
1 - 1 1/2 pkts plain sweet biscuits (we use Tennis or Marie biscuits - there must be an American equivalent, used in fridge tarts??)
1 can (410g) carmelized condensed milk (sold in South Africa as Carnation Caramel Treat - to make this, put an unopened can of condensed milk into boiling water and boil submerged for 3 hours. Cool 15 min before opening - should be a rich golden brown colour)
100g slab of peppermint chocolate (the one with the green bits in)
250ml cream
extra peppermint chocolate (preferably "Peppermint Crisp")

Directions:
1. Whip the cream. Fold in the caramelized condensed milk and whip until the mixture is smooth and a pale caramel colour.
2. Grate the peppermint chocolate and fold into the caramel mixture.
3.Put a layer of biscuits in the bottom of a glass dish. On top of this, spoon 1/3 of the mixture. Repeat the biscuit layer, then the caramel layer, twice, ending with a caramel layer.
4. Sprinkle extra grated peppermint chocolate on top.
5. Chill. It tastes better after a few hours when the biscuits have softened. Even better the next day.
