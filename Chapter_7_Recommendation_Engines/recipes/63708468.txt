Description: 
By shellacking strawberries with a vanilla-scented, buttery, sweet-and-sour reduction, you may well morph them into one of the most sophisticated summer desserts. Just remember the rule: If a fresh strawberry doesn’t smell like anything, it probably won’t taste like much, even when gussied up with this glaze.
