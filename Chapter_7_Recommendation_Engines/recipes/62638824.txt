Ingredients:
1 pint fresh oysters (small or extra small)
2 eggs
2 cups flour
1 box panko
1/4 to 1/2 cup Butter, oil or bacon fat for frying
Lemon wedges and chopped parsley for serving

Directions:
You'll need either 3 rimmed soup plates or 3 pie plates. Place the flour in one, beat eggs in the second, and fill the third with the panko (keep the box nearby for refills).
Heat the oil over medium high heat. Working in batches, individually dip each oyster in the flour, then the egg, then coat in panko. Place the breaded oysters in the hot oil and fry until golden brown on each side (turning only once).
