Ingredients:
2 tablespoons peanut butter
2 teaspoons brown sugar or honey
2 tsp soy sauce
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1 clove garlic, finely minced
2 Tbsp lime juice
3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
2 tsp sesame oil (I use toasted sesame oil)
2 tsp Thai chili oil
1 tsp Sriracha
2 tbsp grapeseed oil
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1 1/2 cup shredded cooked chicken
16  (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers, shredded
1 small head cabbage, shredded (about 4 cups)
2 cups shredded carrots
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1 Tbsp black sesame seeds

Directions:
To prepare the dressing, whisk together the peanut butter through cilantro.
Toss together cabbage, carrots and green onions.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 C). Spray a large shallow pan with nonstick vegetable spray,   arrange shredded wontons in a single layer and bake 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool.
Add wontons to cabbage mixture and toss with dressing.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve.

Description: 
I love the original recipe, but had to make changes to the dressing based on what I had on hand - kind of ended up with a Thai flair!  Also, the second time I made it I decided to use cabbage so it would hold up to the dressing better than lettuce.  Good with or without the wontonsModified from: Chinese Chicken Salad III
