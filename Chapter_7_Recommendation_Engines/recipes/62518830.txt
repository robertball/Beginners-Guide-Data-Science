Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup milk

In a large bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Add the beaten egg, milk, and butter. Knead dough until smooth, about 5 minutes. Let rest in a covered bowl for 10 minutes.
On a floured surface, roll out to 1/8 or 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into desired lengths and shapes.
Allow to air dry before cooking.
To cook fresh pasta, in a large pot with boiling chicken stock cook until al dente.
