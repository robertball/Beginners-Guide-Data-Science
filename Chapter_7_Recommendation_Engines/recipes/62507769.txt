Ingredients:
2 cups fresh or frozen (thawed) corn
2 roma tomatoes, seeded and diced
1/2 stalk celery, minced finely
1/2 red onion, minced
1/2 orange pepper, minced
3 tbsp diced cucumber
1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 tbsp lime juice
chopped fresh cilantro, or basil if you prefer
sea salt and pepper
garnish of minced green onion, optional

Directions:
If using cobs of corn, blanch in salted water for three or four minutes, then rinse immediately in cold water. Remove the corn from the cob with a sharp knife.  If using frozen, thaw under cold water and drain.
Add all the veg into a pretty bowl.  Add the oil, vinegar, lime juice and cilantro or basil.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, garnish if you choose with the green onions.
Chill for up to half an hour in the fridge and enjoy!
