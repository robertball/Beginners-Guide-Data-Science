Description: 
Bulk mix suitable for quick breads and/or muffins. These are great baked in mini pans for an assortment on trays for gifts. I also bake a lot for fall bake sales. Three cups of mix makes one large or two medium loaves. Add 1 cup pureed cooked vegetable or fruit such as pumpkin, winter squash, carrots, apricots, applesauce, mashed banana along with whatever nuts, fruits or flavorings you desire.
