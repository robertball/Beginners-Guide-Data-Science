Ingredients:
2 Tbsp butter, ghee, coconut oil, or olive oil
3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into cubes
1 Tbsp sea salt
1 Tbsp fresh-ground pepper
1 tsp paprika
2 Tbsp dried parsley flakes (or 3 Tbsp fresh)
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 1/2 cups collard greens, very roughly chopped
1 large zucchini or summer squash, thinly sliced
1 cup heavy cream or whipping cream
3/4 cup crumbled gorgonzola, roquefort, or other bleu cheese

Directions:
Heat butter or oil in a large, non-stick skillet.
Season chicken all over with salt, pepper, and paprika.  Toss cubes into pan, and cook until no longer pink in the center, and brown on the outside. Stir in parsley flakes and the garlic powder, and give it a few stirs.  Put chicken and juices in plate, and set aside.  Keep warm in the oven, if desired.
In the same skillet, toss in the collard greens and the zucchini slices.  Add the cream to the pan, then add the crumbled gorgonzola.  Stir, cover, and let it cook until zucchini and collards are soft, stirring occasionally, for about 10-15 minutes.
Once greens and zucchini are soft and cooked, add the chicken pieces with the juices back into the pan.  Stir to combine, and cook just a couple of minutes so all the flavors can come together.  Serve!
