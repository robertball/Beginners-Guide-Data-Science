Ingredients:
2 eggs
2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Cream together eggs, olive oil, and sugar in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and pale gold in color. Add flour, baking powder, and salt and mix until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Shape dough into a ball and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Use a teaspoon to drop spoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space in between as cookies will spread. Refrigerate leftover dough to bake in batches.
Bake in the preheated oven until just golden around the edges, about 8 minutes. Allow to cool for 2 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to a cooling rack.
